Since the API limits in the number of posts and comments we can get, we decided to use the Archive of Reddit. We need to use Torrent to download the data (predicted to be ~2TB).

## Day 4 - Thu
Scaling theory is a new field (~10 years), and right now it accounts for a lot of noise, but it is evolving on how to flatten up the curves.
Doing interdisciplinary research is difficult, because the researchers want to do different things and somethimes methods are really diverse. So not anything "calls you". Is there danger in there or is it just a defense mechanism?

Andrew: You need to really care about the other discipline, otherwise you won't be motivated.
Emma: How do you "fix" or improve a group that is already doing interdisciplinary research but is not that good?
Probably just patience is the best option, and time helps in "smooth things up". 
Rajiv: 



## Day 3 - Wed
15 minutes talk about the project

The power of side projects, some of those turn into bigger ones, so do not underestimate them.

What about the cases when you have discussions with radically different people? 
- It is more difficult, but it can be worth it. Because the "common language" is more difficult to get to.
- They need, however, to be open to discussions, and not them telling you what they think and that they would not change.
- Sometimes the science of others have better solutions than yours, and it is worth talking to them and knowing about it.

### Chris Kempes session 3:45
One can use a principle of scale in Biology and apply it into companies, countries, etc. We need to define the variables like mass.
In the case of a company:
log(assets) would be the x; and log(liability), revenue, would be the y variable.
