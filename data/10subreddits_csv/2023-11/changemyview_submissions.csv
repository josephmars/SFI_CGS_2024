ISREAL IS BUILDING SETTLEMENTS AGAINST INTERNATIONAL LAWS

The territory for Palestine and Israel is defined in the international laws, however Israel have taking more land, and is expanding its territory.

PALESTINIANS DON'T WANT FUNDINGS, THEY WANT THEIR RIGHTS

Palestinians don't have the right to travel freely, they don't have protection and Israeli gov controls everything. 

Before, the recent events, Israel continuously harassed, deported, detained and killed Palestinians EVERY WEEK. They even killed a journalist (Shireen Abu Akleh) and then attacked her funeral!!

Palestinians, has No1 to ask for help.. even when they ask for help.. it is like screaming into the void.. 

EVERY ACTION HAS A REACTION

if Israel abuses Palestinians weekly, it is not surprising to see extremists groups like hams. 

INHUMAN ENVIRONMENT PROMOTES INHUMAN ACTIONS

This is part of Israeli government plan, taking people's rights and giving them no options, promoting hatred which leads to the formation of extremists and terrorists then they use it as excuse to kill Palestinians."

I think the current situation involving Israel has gotten that reaction because of the West’s relations with Judaism, Christianity & Islam. That’s what I mean by “big”. 

The West is overwhelmingly Christian (which has roots to the region), the west was drawn into a global war (one of the reason being the genocide of a particular group) & the west has a sour taste of Islam due to attacks on the west by individuals in the name of that religion.

I believe those are the main criteria that make it profitable for the Israeli & Palestine conflict to attract so much attention in the media.


* Probably *everything* Israel has been accused of is being done by Saudi Arabia in Yemen (with the help of the help of the US). But how often do you hear about that conflict. But guess Al-Qaeda is looked at diff from Hamas. 

* India & China were fighting at the start of the decade. Two of the largest super powers. Two nuclear capable countries… how often did you hear about that?

* What about India & Pakistan? Again, two nuclear capable countries. Seems more worrisome right? But not as news worthy I guess. 

* Apparently things are still horrible in Myanmar. A lot more casualties than other conflicts but that’s been quiet over here now. 


So why do you think the decades old conflict in the Middle East is talked about more than any of the others.  I think it’s because of the ties that make people in the West seemingly care a bit more while Muslim on Muslim violence in Yemen for example isn’t as profitable."

I also struggle with smiling when I’m nerves (some people are the opposite and smile more when nerves, unfortunately that’s not the case for me), which leads to being “less personable”. On the other hand, since I am always prepared for answering technical questions, I usually ace this part; being tipsy reduces coherent and logical thinking which reduces the quality technical answers slightly, but that is never the issue for me.

These dogs are also used in situations where it is unnecessary. Many unarmed people are sent off to maul unarmed civilians. Non violent offenders are mauled. POC are disproportionately targets of of dog attacks administered by police. 

The attacks can permanently disfigure the person being attacked. It’s cruel and unusual punishment, and these people haven’t even had a trial.

I think considering the distinctly different history and culture among this group in contrast with the rest of america, it would be very beneficial to make them their own ethnic group. They need to be untangled from the rest of white americans because there is next to nothing in common and it hurts progress lumping them together.

My term is marriage equality.

This application of the label ""Social Conservative"" is widely used when media discusses politicians that embrace views and have beliefs that are the literal definition of discrimination ((religious choice and freedom of abstinence) \[See: Humor\] (and marriage equality)), and as such will disenfranchise persons identifiable, further cementing the view.

I can't imagine changing my view on this judgement. Any time I hear ""Social Conservative"", all I can believe is ""Social Discriminator"" or ""Social Discrimination"". Any claim to theocratic rule and unequal civil rights is a violation of humanity, period. The U.S. Constitution is a flexible document that is subject to alteration.

Suella Braverman, the Home Secretary of the UK, called the phrase ""deeply offensive"", and a Labour MP has been suspended for saying ""We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty."" This is wrong and is playing right into Israel's attempt to paint all anti-Zionists as antisemites.

The chant started in the mid-1960s by the PLO as a call for Palestinian liberation. The Likud party even had the phrase ""between the Sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty"" in their founding charter in 1977. It was a phrase that predates Hamas or any terrorist organisations in Palestine. There is no doubt that Hamas included this phrase in their 2017 charter and has genocidal intent, but most people who chant it are not calling a genocide but for Palestinian liberation.

Some people take issue with what happens to Israel if ""Palestine is free"". There are many visions of what would happen to the Israeli state should Palestine be free. Some are very tame, like the release of Palestinian prisoners who are held without charge, while some are incredibly extreme, like calling for the genocide of all Israelis. But the fact of the matter is most people who chant it, including Palestinians, are either seeking a two-state solution where Palestinians are free citizens of Palestine in or out of Israel, or a one-state solution that is inherently secular and treats all its citizens equally. 

In fact, if you look at what [ADL said about the chant](https://archive.ph/ho3e5) _before Oct 26th_, I would agree. The chant _can be _ distressing to Jewish people, especially if the chants are used in front of synagogues as an example, but it is not always used in that manner. But if you look at [the updated page](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/allegation-river-sea-palestine-will-be-free) today, they have declared this phrase as an antisemitic slogan, which is part of their propaganda to equate anti-Zionism and antisemitism together.

To CMV, you need to show that Palestinians living in dignity fundamentally leads to the genocide of Israelis, or that the most common usage of the chant is antisemitic. I do not accept the argument that any anti-Zionist chants are antisemitic, because I do not think anti-Zionism is inherently antisemitic."

I was not old enough to be concerned with politics at the time. And I know that my family voted for Yanukovich, because he was a candidate from Eastern Ukraine. Eastern Ukraine always supported the Party of the Regions, because it was representing 'the regions'. They wanted to decentralize power, let regions like Crimea have more say in how they are run, etc.

And long story short, the president we voted for was removed by force. And I don't think it's a very democratic thing to do. In my school, we were taught that removing Yanukovich was the right thing to do. People voted him in, people can throw him out. But is it fair? He was elected in 2010, maidan happened in 2014. Why couldn't people just vote him out? He had a decent chance to win the second term.

People say the 2010 elections were unfair anyway, but they didn't protest in 2010.

But then why Jan6 in America is viewed as a coup attempt. Removing a president for election fraud without any real evidence of election fraud is not a good thing. If anything, a president should be properly impeached.

Would Americans support forcefully removing a president for any reason? Like if he refused to sign an important agreement with Europe? Do you think it would be democratic if Canadians overthrow Trudeau?"

I don't think I need to provide any evidence for this as anyone who comes here *knows* that it is just a place where a LOT of OPs don't ever award deltas. Or if they do, it's for some very minor point that changes little to nothing about their view.

For example ""Oh I didn't think of that particular scenario. That's interesting. Here's a delta"" - This scenario doesn't necessarily *change* their view and I have almost never seen it do so.

And very often I see posts of people making counterarguments and having a discussion, which is obviously useful and I enjoy a lot.

But I also see a LOT of posts where I, and others clearly wonder ""What even is this person trying to get out of this?"" and some of the top upvoted comments ask ""Why are you even wanting to have your opinion changed? What is the point of all this?"" (And usually, I think most people are just seeking validation or argument, which I think defeats the purpose of the sub IMO)

I think if someone is unable to articulate WHY they want their view changed, or *at least* cannot express a willingness to consider alternative viewpoints, then they inevitably will break the rules of the sub. (Unwillingness to change opinion, soapboxing, etc.)

So for me, the reason I made this post is I am willing to hear alternative reasons why this might not be a good idea that I hadn't considered. I think that's an adequate reason, and the reason can and should be included in all posts."

The situation is in a gridlock and common suggestions doesn't solve problem.

Let's address the most draconian options first, so this won't be a cesspool hopefully.

1. A lot of Idealist people suggest Israel should not exist as it is a colonial state. Where will the citizens of Israel go exactly? They are despised by two largest religions of the planet and they stick out as minority everywhere they go.

Also, who is gonna force them exactly? Not feasible today.

2. ""G-word"" for Palestine. More feasible than the first option, but it is difficult to entirely ""cleanse"" such large groups unless you have also numbers. Israel is a small state despite economical and military might. It will also dry out their international support before achieving the target, and make Israel a legitimate target on everyone's eyes.

It also does not address the fundamental problem that I am about to mention.

-------------------------------
Now, reasonable ones:

3. Two state status quo like Ireland, or maybe Pakistan? Israel does not want to lose control in region due ""Security reasons"" and Palestine wants their stuff back. Also, Pakistan is a nuclear power and Ireland is pretty large, along with British was open to concessions. Palestine wouldn't trust Israel enough to give much control either. We also have Jeruselam in the middle.

4. One state? Democracy won't work, obviously. Apartheid? How is that solve anything?

‐----------------------------------
Here lies the fundamental problem:

1. Jews are despised by two major religions and they are a small, visible minority in the World.
2. Israel is a recently built colonial state, where indigenous people are still alive. In addition, they are militarily aggressive.
3. Israel is surrounded by Muslim countries that can produce numbers of fanatics. 


These problems must be addressed first.

Problem 1: There are several options here:

Option 1: Jews abandon Judaism and assimilate. They merge to whatever dominant group. It may even be Atheism.
Option 2: Jews modify Judaism enough to spread it, so they have the numbers to back them up. (Christianity worked after all) The fact that  Christianity and Islam being somewhat derivations of Judaism and far suppressing it is baffling.

Problem 2: There is no solution here, other than maybe USA reservation system or again, two state AFTER OTHER ISSUES RESOLVED. 

There is actually will in Israel to make peace with nearby countries like Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt. This is possible in state level.
USA can stop a lot of the wars in the region and make peace with Iran, and rebuilt Syria even. Then, all state actors that despise Israel disappears.

If all state actors disappear, all non-state military groups won't be funded and no reason for Israel to be aggressive other than Palestine. Then, a solution like India-Pakistan may be possible.

Option 3: The best option is: Middle East turns Secular, Islamic Cihad dies out and Israel makes peace with nearby countries.

Now, I am not well versed in this regard, but a lot of current problems in Middle East are Cold War relics. Some countries will likely turn secular over a time period, if given breathing room, like Syria, Iran etc... I think Political Islam will disappear if conflicts stop.

In the US, the four well known parties each have a color and a mascot.

Democrats - blue and a donkey mascot

Republicans - red and an elephant mascot

Libertarians - yellow/gold and a hedgehog mascot

Greens - green and a sunflower mascot

I think this style of partisan identification fosters blind tribalism and ""it's my team vs their team"" mentality. In contexts where tribalism is desired, such as sports and corporate competition, each team/company capitalizes on their colors and mascots to the fullest. In these cases, it's okay, because the tribalism is all fun and games (for the most part). But in politics, it's pretty much universally agreed that tribalism is bad and leads to political violence and even terrorism, so why do we let political parties get away with it?

I think some mascots are more defensible than others, when the mascot is directly conveying the platform of the party. For example, the Libertarian hedgehog symbolizes a ""live and let live"" philosophy, and the Green sunflower obviously symbolizes plants and environmentalism. However, even in these cases I think the mascots do more harm than good. And certainly there is no defense of colors. I mean, what is this, summer camp color war?

If the government can't regulate superficial partisan identifiers due to First Amendment rights, the public should at least push back against them. But there seems to be no pushback from any side regarding this. CMV."

Because I had such a false idea of how to approach them.

I just thought being around them, making them laugh, having commonalities, and being with them with the mindset of it ending in a relationship was enough to win them over

But funny enough, I've dealt with some of the worse rejections of my life during that time

Since my start of adulthood, I've had experiences with people without much expectations, that ended in fulfilling connections with one another due to our similarities

I just wish society promoted that so there wouldn't be as much abuse, breakups, codependency, and low self-esteem present in relationships and friendships today

Now, I know that more organic connections takes time, patience, and compromise. And society rather just give us fuckboy, rizz, red pill, and incel tactics because it approaches relationships in a fast and more appealing way towards impressionable young men and women,

And not the good kind of skepticism either.",u/NappyFlickz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17lhopx/cmv_science_is_getting_incredibly_politicized_and/,changemyview,"TL;DR - Science is becoming politicized/religious/dogmatic in how it interacts with the public, and it's scaring the shit outta me, and making me feel like I don't have the right to learn and have an open mind.


Without going into details and risking sending the discussion off the rails, recently science has gotten so fucking politicized. And I'm not necessarily referring to political parties, but rather the fact that scientific discourse is now taking on the ugly vestiges of political discourse.

Debates are being shied away from, if you question an established narrative, you get called names and tossed in a category with the extremists, even if your stance/questions are nuanced. Generalizations of those who disagree with the ""chosen science"" are rampant, scientists who take stances contrary to the majority are getting mocked/ridiculed, and labelled.

No one wants to risk admitting they were wrong or looking wrong, lest they be dragged on social media/the news as collateral damage in a ""gotcha"" moment.

Literal exact mirroring of political discussions.

It's absolutely fucking disgusting and I hate it.

When I read an article about a new study, or listen to an interview from a scientist, I no longer sense that scientists carry that giddiness to challenge themselves and investigate more if someone raises a question or pokes a hole in the presented theory in order to increase their knowledge. Nor do I feel comfortable even asking a goddamned question. It's being chomped down into soundbites and easy-to-read quick headlines and tweets, but in speech form as well. There is no dialogue, just preaching. It's damn near religious.

When I hear ""trust/listen/talk to the experts"" now, it doesn't feel like an invitation to sit down and expand my knowledge on the subject matter, nor does it feel like I can bring up a concern and have an in-depth discussion that assuages my concerns. Instead it feels like a dog-whistle  (I hate using this phrase) for ""shut up and obey the word of God."" 

As I'm sure you could guess by reading this, there is a specific matter of recent significant scientific controversy that I am referring to, but I will not name it directly because I don't want it to prematurely skew the discussion before the discourse even happens, as people seem to have an preset, immovable stance on the subject, just like voters and political parties.

**You can change my view by convincing me that science is still open for discussion and debate, it's not leaning towards dogmatism, and it's still okay to ask questions in good faith and respectfully, and expect to get an equally respectful and good faith answer.**

I'm sorry, I'm just frustrated.

1,2023-11-01,"CMV: Bothsidesism is the only accurate way to see the Israel-Palestine conflict, and the only moral solution is the pursuit of an eventual four-state solution and the total rejection of extremist voices on both sides",u/devilmaskrascal,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17lhxux/cmv_bothsidesism_is_the_only_accurate_way_to_see/,changemyview,"Any side supporting a one-state solution and especially those supporting the removal of the other side from Israel-Palestine are fundamentally immoral and worsening the problem. While ""bothsidesism"" provokes anger from the emotional parties on either side, the regional history is simply too complex to state either side is ""right"", and both sides have justification for their anger. Only by removing extremist and counterproductive voices from both sides can there be any chance of peace.

My proposal is a four-state solution:

* Israel
* West Bank/Palestine, with compensation from Israel and the removal of all illegal settlements;
* Jerusalem, as an independent city-state dedicated to history and the peaceful co-existence for all three Abrahamic religions;
* Gaza without Hamas

**The argument for Zionism and the existence of Israel**

Between the Holocaust, pogroms in the former USSR and the expulsion of Jews from most Arab countries, not to mention the global anti-Semitic response to the current war in Gaza, the evidence of history is ample that ethnic Jews require a secure state and have the right to take measures to prevent the ethnic cleansing and genocide of Jews from ever happening again. Following the loss of their homeland, Jews spent most of history as minorities relying on governments which they had no control over to protect them from genocide and anti-Semitism, and these governments failed them time and time again. While we can all agree to disagree with the way Israel was established and has been run, the underlying point of Zionism is fundamentally correct, and its point is being proven writ large across the world right now.

**The argument against Kahanism and the government of Netanyahu**

Kahanism is a radical right-wing strain of Zionism that believes that Arabs should be removed from Israel and Palestine, and that Israel should be a Jewish Theocratic State. Many Kahanists are anti-democracy, instead supporting government by Halakha (Biblical law), and many support violence against Palestinians and a one-state solution where Palestine simply doesn't exist. 

Although Israel officially banned Kahanism since 1985, Netanyahu appointed Itamar Ben-Gvir, founder of the neo-Kahanist political party Otzma Yehudit (""Jewish Power""), to be the Minister of National Security for Israel. Ben-Gvir even defends Jews spitting at Christians as a ""an ancient Jewish custom."" Netanyahu gave authority to Jewish supremacists who want Palestine eliminated in his government, and I believe strongly this was largely to blame for the current anger underlying the October 7th attack. The citizens of Israel should remove Netanyahu and his extremist coalition from power and restore leadership that is serious about building a lasting peace and a multi-state solution.

**The argument for independence for the West Bank**

In the quest to build a Jewish homeland, Israel has committed horrific acts and violations of the human rights of Palestinians, acts they should formally apologize for. They have also repeatedly violated their own treaties and agreed-upon borders, and has prevented or severely limited Palestinians from accessing Israeli territory and Jerusalem. Currently, 475,000 Israelis also live in provocative illegal settlements in the West Bank, which they call Judea and Samaria but is officially Palestine, and the Israeli government provides military protection for many of these settlements, expanding the reach of the Israeli government deep into Palestinian territory and complicating progress towards a multi-state solution. 

The fundamental condition for Palestinian independence for either Gaza or the West Bank should be 1.) the official acknowledgement of the right for Israel to exist in peace and 2.) a rejection of all forms of terrorism and the stationing of any foreign militaries that wish to eliminate Israel's existence. In return, Israel agrees to end all illegal settlements, acknowledge the crimes it committed historically, fund Palestinian development and education as reparations for an agreed-upon period (provided no re-escalations of violence), and transform Jerusalem into an independent city-state with oversight from all three major religions, no weapons allowed within the city walls, and a mission to support peaceful co-existence and end all cross-religion violence in the region. 

In allowing the West Bank a path to independence and something of a rectifying of Israeli wrongdoing, Israel will diffuse much of the heat from the Arab world and potentially stave off World War III. In resolving the West Bank situation as peaceably as possible and in good faith, Israel protects its own existence.

Gaza should be granted the same standing offer but they fail to meet the basic preconditions currently, given the official use of terrorism and rejection of Israel's right to exist by the Hamas government there. 

**The argument for military action against Hamas and the framework for a Gaza ceasefire and independence**

Israel has zero good solutions when it comes to Gaza, either regarding the immediate situation or regarding a long-term solution. Hamas wants Israel eliminated through violence. Egypt will not annex Gaza. Most Arab countries will not take the people living in Gaza, even as refugees. Giving Gaza independence likely means a base for Iranian military operations on Israel's border-- and less ability to respond to terrorism without physically violating the sovereignty of another country. A free, democratic Gaza will be a hotbed for terrorism. If Israel cuts off Gaza from water and electricity, they cause a humanitarian crisis. If they attack Gaza in retaliation for October 7th, it is called ""ethnic cleansing."" If they maintain the current indefinite situation it is called ""apartheid.""

Hamas wants Israel to commit atrocities in the hope it spurs Arab nations to declare war on Israel and wipe Israel out. They use their own population in an ""ends justifies the means"" fashion, stationing their own terrorist operations in areas where an Israeli attack will cause maximum civilian collateral damage, for instance, hiding amongst refugees. Meanwhile they hold hundreds of hostages that Israel is intent on getting back.

Considering Hamas's ulterior motives and their refusal to release the Israeli hostages, I have yet to hear one critic of Israel's military response give a practical response to the question of what Israel is supposed to do instead. Let Hamas rape and kill the hostages unanswered? 

Israel should practice restraint when it comes to any situation that will target civilians indiscriminately (which only worsens the global backlash and hurts Israel), but the humanitarian crisis and the invasion itself is the fault of Hamas, not Israel. Hamas massacred more innocent Jews --discriminately -- than any event since the Holocaust. Justice must be served and Hamas must be rooted out of Gaza and destroyed.

Israel should offer Hamas one option: the surrender of all top Hamas leadership and all organizers of the October 7th massacre, and the return of all hostages, in exchange for an immediate ceasefire and the same possible path to eventual independence offered to the West Bank. The Hamas leadership and Oct. 7th perpetrators should be sent to the Hague to be tried as war criminals instead of being tried in Israel, and their safety should be guaranteed upon surrender. In making this offer, Israel can show the world that they offered Hamas terrorists a fair alternative to complete military annihilation of Gaza, a solution that would give Israel justice while preventing a further humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. If Hamas choose to be martyrs instead and sacrifice their population as collateral damage, the Arab world can't come back and claim Israel didn't attempt de-escalation.

**My delta** would be if someone can convince me a multi-state solution is impossible or undesirable, and that there is a pragmatic, humanitarian alternative that avoids the ethnic cleansing of one race or the other. "

Also there are amazing kind people , there is racism everywhere but it’s worse in other countries.
You can pay your college loan after you graduate and everything works greatly

we are two students of Communication Sciences from a Dutch university. For a project, we took a closer look at how information and emotions flow within the most popular posts within r/amiugly. We especially tried to find out if there are any differences between male-created posts and those created by females. We initially planned on including an infographic below but since pictures cannot be posted, here's a rough rundown of what we found:  


Most of the discussion, regardless of gender, seems to be heavily influenced by a few key players, that set the tone of the discussion having the majority of interactions. So possibly, a lot of users just follow along with opinions that seem popular. 

We also found that while positivity is the most prominent emotion, negativity is only sligthly less prevalent, especially with female posts. That means that if you post something about your body, you will have to expect both friendly comments but also negative ones.  


Looking at what OPs on the sub say about themselves, almost all of these posts seem to come from a  place of insecurity. This feeling may potentially only be worsened when running into negative comments. Of course, we are only dealing with a snapshot of one space on the internet, but there is no denying that shaming others or mocking them because of their appearance is not exclusive to this subreddit.

While we do think that subreddits like r/amiugly are potentially harmful to users, it is not the root of all problems. In our eyes, the root of the issue is that people in this society are very insecure about their bodies, making room for such subreddits to even exist. If we tackle the problem of insecurity and foster a more inclusive discussion culture around bodies and appearances, we may also get rid of online spaces in which people make themselves vulnerable and get hurt.

I worked with him at a warehouse and was paid significantly less then minimum wage. In the beginning, I didn’t like it because I would have rather done something else like play video games. But my Dad thought it would be good to give me responsibility. I learned to love my job in time. Reflecting as an adult, I learned many skills that made me the person I am today like responsibility, work ethic, interacting with others, being reliable and consistent, doing things that I don’t want to do and built some muscle too. I also enjoyed the freedom of spending the pennies I earned on anything I wanted. My dad wouldn’t buy me any rated M video games but said I could spend my own money how I pleased. I bought halo 3. I also enjoyed spending time with my Dad. He didn’t really talk much at home so I felt like I was able to understand him more in “the real world”.

I was talking to my fiancé and I said that I would also force my kid to get a job at 14 as I feel like this is a good experience to build character. I also think that every child should have something like this. My fiancé disagrees. Could I be wrong about this?

My fiancés argument was something like I shouldn’t force this issue if the kid doesnt want to. Her arguments were:
1) Kids have the rest of their lives to be an adult, so let them be children now. I was like yea ofc they will still be children, do they pay rent?
2)  Children’s primary responsibility is school. They should be free to do what they want in the summer. I would maybe be persuaded by this if my child did well in school (freedom as a reward),  or if the child wanted to do something that I found productive (building character traits like I described above). DND, video games, or running through the woods all day would not be an acceptable alternative.
3) Respect a child’s autonomy. I don’t understand how this is relevant. The world doesn’t care about your autonomy and it is for this world that I am preparing my kids.
3) My fiancé says that just because I went through something, doesn’t mean my kids need to. This kind of got to me. For background, I grew up working class. My fiancé grew up middle class and never had a job until she started medical residency. Perhaps I may have some anxieties from being poor, but I don’t feel like I’m projecting in this situation.

It’s kinda presumptuous to assume that one dog breed is more intelligent or more loyal and peaceful than another. When a dog is raised to do tricks, it will learn them, but if you don’t raise it to tricks, then you will just continue to think it’s stupid. So it’s clear that our biases affect the way we treat them, which in turn affects how we view their abilities, a vicious cycle. Pitbulls, for example, are very controversial. A lot of people are scared of them, but don’t you think this will affect how the pitbulls will treat them? Whereas a dog like a golden retriever is more privileged, so of course we never see them in the same light. 

We should not judge them by their appearance. Just because a dog is smaller doesn’t necessarily mean it has a smaller brain, and even if it has a smaller brain, it doesn’t mean that it’s less intelligent. So we have no factual evidence to show that dog breeds are less intelligent due to their brains. 

All dogs bleed red. They are all valuable and should be treated equally. We should recognize dog racism when it happens and make the world a better place for dogs."

Conservatives have been the ones banning books from libraries. We all know conservative parents (especially religious ones) who cannot tolerate their kids having different opinions. Conservative subs on Reddit are just as prone to banning someone for having opposing views as liberal ones.  Conservatives were the ones who got outraged about athletes kneeling during the national anthem, as if that gesture weren't quintessential free speech. When Elon Musk took over Twitter, he promptly banned many users who disagreed with him. Conservatives have been trying to pass ""don't say gay"" and ""stop woke"" legislation in Florida and elsewhere (and also anti-BDS legislation in Texas to penalize those who oppose Israel). For every anecdote about a liberal teacher giving a conservative student a bad grade for being conservative, you can find an equal example on the reverse side.

I highly doubt that most people on the left would label it censorship if public libraries excluded other types of media, such as books deemed to be excessively racist, or pornography.

I would like you to change my view on weddings as I've been getting heat from my family for not wanting to go to weddings (or any social gathering in general tbh).

I find weddings completely pointless. They're just a show of how well off the parents are and how great their normal kids are. I don't get the point of dressing nice, to sit in a venue who's owners are too cheap to properly run heat or ac depending on the time of year, despite the fact they're charging boatloads of money, to eat generic and over hyped food from a vendor that prob got a new watch over the overpriced menu, to dance like awkward fools on the dance fool and just stareing at people you generally don't care about after the event 


I'm Arab/Muslim so we don't even have booze at our weddings (so don't go ""open bar hur dur). 


What's the obsession with it and why am I expected to go, even if they're my cousin or sister."

Jesus Christ, who is supposed to be the perfect example of righteous living, never killed any human being, and he had plenty of opportunities to during his mortal life on Earth, like when Judas betrayed him and he was arrested.

Then we also have the Anti-Nephi-Lehis who after converting to the gospel of Jesus Christ, decided they would rather die than fight the Lamanites who were come to kill them.

Joseph Smith didn’t kill anyone either.

So it’s rather interesting that Utah is a state with relatively lax gun laws and a strong gun culture.

To quote from their website directly, the church says

“As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we are a people of peace. We follow the Savior, who is the Prince of Peace. We look forward to His millennial reign, when wars will end and peace will be restored to the earth”

For context: I’m a US progressive, and neither Jewish nor Muslim. 

Judaism  is a religion, an ethnicity, or bot, depending on how you think of it. I don’t think theocratic ethnostates are good. And it has “Jewish state” right there in its founding description. 

“20% Arabs.” OK, but the Right of Return is not acceptable to Israel b/c it would change the demographics to have too many Arabs. It wouldn’t be a Jewish majority state, which, to my understanding, means they want it to stay an ethnostate, overwhelmingly and intentionally dominated by one ethnic group. 

They’re not allowed any actual political power. There aren’t any Arab ministers in the gov’t. There was not an Arab leader in the governing coalition until 2021! It made people so uncomfortable that it only lasted 2 years, b/c people weren’t sure if Mansour Abbas should even be there! People in East Jerusalem can’t even vote! 

And then they passed the 2018 Nation—State Law basic law affirming “yes, yes, we’re a super Jewish state for real!” which I didn’t think anyone was disputing anyway, and striking Arabic as a National language. 

And the settlers: theocratic, messianic, and HUGELY empowered by Israel. 

I don’t think if you go back in history there’s better treatment of Arab Israelis, since they were under martial law til 1966. But I don’t know my Israeli history, that’s why it says “current form”.

For the sake of this post, I am leaving out:

-detailing my feelings  on the OPT and Gaza.
-criticizing societal prejudice. Other countries have that too
- Ben-Gvir and Smotrich specifically. This is an act of good faith. I want to include them, b/c they are supremacist and messianic, the height of my point here, more powerful/elevated than US far-right lunatics, and arguable more dangerous. But we all have our far-right lunatics. This is also why I didn’t make the settlers my main point, just an add-on.

I believe in a refuge for the Jewish and Palestinian people (across the…well, the river to the sea) with full rights for Aliyah as they stand, full right of return, and full equal rights. But that’s not the current form. And if you tell me it’s unlikely: sure, but at this point, so is everything but annexation and total, inarguably apartheid, as far as I can tell. Which would be even worse. 

Sure, it has the right to exist, I guess, whatever that means. But so does Iran. Doesn’t mean it should.

US perspective here. Sports teams in the major U.S. pro sports leagues have occasional flirtations with using Purple tones as a primary theme color, especially expansion or relocated teams , but often switch away from purple after a period of time.  I understand that it tends to be a less liked color in design and fashion, as well as having historical connotations with royalty, but I dont consider it overly off putting as a color. Certain teams are rather well known for Purple uniforms, like the Vikings in NFL. However my main complaint is that Given the relative homogenization of sports teams theme colors, certainly an overuse of red and blue, Purple seems to be a woefully underutilized color option."

I was reading the comments and was just amazed at the opinions of the people who were basically saying ""I'm not black but let me tell you how you're opressed"". It really just reminds me of the white savior complex where it's almost like white people need black people to be victims so they can help them and ease their 'white guilt'. Now obviously blacks are statistically worse off than white people but too often I see black individuals coopt discrimination SOME people face for their own gain even though the situation they're in is self inflicted.

I'm from a predominately black area and know many successful black people and many failed black people. Now as black people we all came from the same area, I'm willing to bet have experienced some form of racism or discrimination, and all had similar opportunities afforded to use more or less. So how is it that racism and discrimination caused one group to fail while the other group didn't. 

When looking at myself and the countless other black people who have stable jobs, are progressing in life and things are generally looking up there's some similarities. The majority of us spent our time on productive things like playing sports, studying, going to work and what not. Sure some people smoked weed and partied but it wasn't like they were doing anything extremely illegal. Then there are the black people who struggle to keep a job, can barely afford to make ends meet and their life is going nowhere. The majority of them who are still alive spent their time focusing on material things and money, skipping school, fighting, selling drugs, running with gangs etc.

In my own personal life I can say that I've face much more discrimination from other blacks than whites. I remember being ridiculed and seen as a 'white boy' because I was...productive and respectful. When my car got broken into it wasn't a white guy it was a black guy. I've never been called the N word by a white person but have heard it countless times from other black people. When the riots were happening I don't recall seeing a single white person in my area looting the stores, many of which are black owned and now out of business. And you're telling me that parents having their kids listening to trap music which glorifies kill other black people has no effect on the outcome of a kid.

Now I feel like i'm starting to rant so to get to the point my view is that Individual actions, upbringing and other black people have far more impact on Black Americans as individuals than white racism or discrimination "

I'll try to keep it simple, but it isn't. I'll bold the TL;DR

**A group of people have been weaponized to consolidate power with the 1%. These people are by design incapable of free thought. They have been trained from birth to accept, fear, and rely on an authority for commands and for approval. That group can be and has been commanded to go to war and will follow orders no matter what those orders are**

This is not a new thing. It has been repeated throughout history. And the techniques for creating these people have been honed for thousands of years. But easily and by far **the greatest set of techniques for instilling uncritical loyalty is Christianity**

Make no mistake. Hitler was not a Christian. The German population was Christian. Hitler merely said he was Christian. And he commanded the German population to commit genocide. And they did. Others may claim that people who commit genocide aren't true Christians. True Christians follow Jesus. **Jesus died around 30 AD. The next 1700 years of Christianity was developed by Religious Dictatorships**

Every ritual. Every prayer. Every recitation. Every song. Every talking point and argument. Every excuse and permission structure. Every version of the Bible. Every command of loyalty, obedience, and worship. **Every practice we still use today was developed by the Emperors and Kings in order to wrest as much power and control from the population as possible. Until they were overthrown in multiple revolutions**

**Today, no one actually follows Jesus's morality. But confess to the priest and he will give you permission to say you did. That approval is the only thing that matters.** It is so important that followers will continue to desperately seek it while that priest is molesting their children. Tithes will still poor in while that money is directly sponsoring legal defense and payments for access to children

**The only way to make the desperate need for approval that important is to train it throughout childhood. Education threatens that.** Christians complain that education is indoctrination. And that is a lie. First because they are perfectly fine with their own Christian indoctrination, even when asked directly. And second because teaching someone to think critically for themselves is the opposite of indoctrination. But there is no irony in their complaints, because loyalty, worship, and obedience is the only way to attain approval from their leader. Truth, principle, and Jesus are not important, whether they say so or not

**So they are aggressively working to dismantle education.** There are laws that stand in their way, but all anyone has to do is say ""Christianity"", and Christians who both are and are not paying attention will vote to remove them. They dominate the school board meetings and have books banned whether in the majority or not. They've funneled public funds to private religious schools with unaccredited teachers. For now, private religious schools still have to follow legal standards. But look what happens when the regulation is not enforced: [https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/30/nyregion/nyc-hasidic-yeshivas-education.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/30/nyregion/nyc-hasidic-yeshivas-education.html). Their goal is not education

**Parents do not have the right to do whatever they want to their children. Dooming a child to indoctrination and servitude often with verbal, physical, and sexual abuse; removing their capacity for self determination; and leaving them vulnerable to conmen and despots who are happy to take advantage... It is cruel.**

**And everyone pays the price**. We are actively losing our democracy: a conman waved a bible around, commanded vulnerable minds to attack the capital; and those minds still cannot tell that he is a pathological liar. Parents have a responsibility to their children, but so does the public. Children cannot work. Children cannot have sex. Children will be removed from abuse or neglect. And for now, Children are required by law to be educated

It seems that these bombs keep getting set quietly that do true damage for at least a decade after. Nixon and Roger Ailes starting Fox News after Watergate. Reagan handing the government over to corporations. The 2010 state legislature campaign to rewrite the district maps. I'm truly afraid that this one is going to last much longer if we don't stop it right now in its tracks. 

**Children determine the future. They could be those same minds handing the country over to despots and supplements podcasters but multiplied. Or they could think for themselves; exercise their right to self-determination; and provide the same capabilities to their children**"

Gen Z grew up with the internet and benefitted from the most advanced technological revolution to start a century. TV shows and the internet are where Gen Z dominates, and the youtube video edits and movie opinions fare exceed anything Gen X or millennials have. 

Gen Z is more daring than millennials, and although there are many snowflakes in Gen Z, they're also a movement of edge lords and comedians. There is a reason millennials have the stereotype of being snowflakes.

Gen Z grew up with the best movies that challenge the establishment and bring up important social issues, with the best visuals or writing imo. For example, Gen Z grew up with movies like The Dark knight and the avengers.

You can tell which music and youtube videos are made by people in Gen Z, the slang and redpilled attitude shows."

As of late 2023, the minimum wage for a 40 hour work week is 882.80 dollars. Approximately 1765 a fortnight. 

By contrast, the basic Disability Support Pension plus a small amount of Rent Assist equals out to a little under 1200 a fortnight.

The difference between minimum wage, earned by working 9-5, five days a week, and being eligible for the DSP is maybe 600 dollars. For somebody like me, whose ability to work is impacted but not completely negated by social and mental disability. The benefit of 600 bucks seems like it can't be worth the downsides. 

For starters. Once you get off centerlink payments you can be on the hook for *repayment* or rendered ineligible to return. Attempting to enter the workforce only to realize how out of your depth you are can see you sucked into the infamous *jobseeker* trap.

Between cost of living hikes, rent increases spiking and the modern day myth of home ownership. It's entirely possible that full time work could not provide a lifestyle that is a reasonable improvement over the DSP. Even with my quite frugal life *(no car, old phone, old computer. Zero oven use and no access to aircon)* I could not afford to live alone, unless it was in a similar (horrible) house to the one I currently share. 

Then, once you start working you are effectively enslaved. You can no longer take time to heal or recover from sickness and injury. There are no breaks, you must always be working or else drown in debt and frees that will rapidly see you destitute. 

Working a 40 hour week also eats heavily into your time. Making it increasingly easy to slip into the Work-Eat-Sleep-Work pattern that encourages unhealthy habits and dangerous forms of  escapism.

So. If I need to trade the bulk of my day, every day for fourteen days just to make maybe 50% more then I do on the DSP. What is the incentive to leave my comfortable, sub-minimum wage lifestyle and enter the rat race?"

Also, the fact that some people will break a law doesn't mean that the law is legalizing the thing that it's explicitly making illegal.",u/Majestic-Apple8183,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17lzup3/cmv_cause_precedes_effect_a_person_getting_an/,changemyview,"I'm sorry if the title is confusing, but I'm having trouble wrapping my head around something I read in a pamphlet regarding Ohio's proposed amendment to legalize abortion.

The pamphlet makes several arguments against the proposed amendment to Ohio's constitution, first I'm focusing on a single point. It says the amendment would, ""Create legal protections for any person or entity that assists a person with receiving reproductive medical treatment, including but not limited to abortion;"" As an example it states, ""Like the Cincinnati soccer coach who, in 2004, impregnated a 13-year-old 8th grader and arranged an abortion without her parents' knowledge?""

To be clear, no argument is actually being made here, I'm giving the author of the pamphlet the benefit of the doubt and assuming that they were attempting to make an argument, but failed to do so. I think what they are trying to say is that because the 8th grader had an abortion, that caused the soccer coach to rape them in the past (interestingly, the pamphlet doesn't actually use the word rape, perhaps the author was okay with the sexual act with a minor, and only sees the abortion as wrong?)

It seems to me like a connection is being made where none exists, for example, in response to a hypothetical proposed amendment to protect the right to eat sandwiches, I could say, ""A rapist impregnated a child, and afterwards they ate at Sandwich Emperor together."" But I haven't made an argument, all I've done is put the words rapist and Sandwich Emperor in the same sentence hoping people will draw a connection.

Perhaps another takeaway here is that the amendment will legalize forcing minors to have abortions against their will? Sadly the author didn't actually make a point, so we are left to speculate as to what their point was. But if that was their point, then I offer this counter-example: Imagine there's an amendment to protect the right to organ donation. Would it be a good argument to say, ""But once upon a time there was a guy who forced a child to donate their kidney to them""? Where's the connection? Legalizing a medical procedure is not the same as legalizing a medical procedure being performed on someone against their will.

I want to additionally point out that the pamphlet opposes the amendment because it removes ""parent's rights"". I guess meaning a parent's right to force their 13-year-old to give birth to a child after being raped? To the degree that an argument is being made here, it's an argument that I suspect even most conservatives would find appalling.

There's other arguments I'm having trouble understanding as well, I'll cover one. The pamphlet states that the proposed amendment would prohibit abortion if the fetus/baby/child is viable, but that it would ""Grant a pregnant woman's treating physician the authority to determine... whether an unborn child is viable;"" and also that it would, ""Always allow an unborn child to be aborted... regardless of viability if... the abortion is necessary to protect the pregnant woman's life or health."" The pamphlet concludes, ""Thus: this would make painful, late-term abortions legal.""

In this case, the author has at least made an argument, two actually. First, a physician could lie and claim that a fetus/baby/child was not viable and perform an abortion. Second, that a physician could lie and claim that a pregnant person's life or health were at risk even when it's not. But this would violate the amendment. The amendment allows physicians to determine the underlying facts regarding the safety of the pregnancy and the viability of the fetus, not to lie about the underlying facts. This argument could be made about any new or existing law. There are always people who will break the law, such as the soccer coach from before, but the fact that people will break the law isn't a good argument against having laws. I could say that an amendment banning abortion actually legalizes abortion because some people will perform abortions anyway. But that would not be a strong or logical argument.

Anyway, somebody wrote this pamphlet because they believed it would convince people to oppose the amendment, so I wanted to hear some opposing views, because I found the pamphlet completely illogical, it didn't even rise to the level of something I could disagree with, I thought it was mostly incoherent.

Final thoughts: As a bonus, I wanted to point out that the text that will appear on the ballot regarding this amendment is longer than the text of the actual amendment, and includes phrases such as ""The proposed amendment would...allow an unborn child to be aborted at any stage of pregnancy, regardless of viability..."" despite no such phrase appearing anywhere in the amendment. The text of the actual amendment is almost entirely devoted to carefully defining the circumstances under which the state would be allowed to prohibit an abortion. So it's not only pamphlet authors who are misleading people regarding the amendment, but also the Ohio Secretary of State. So everyone is also welcome to change my view that the text on the ballot should be the actual text of the amendment, and not the administration's opinion on the amendment, in addition to my already stated views on the arrow of time.

Let's explore how the 14th Amendment plays a vital role in safeguarding a woman's right to choose whether or not to have an abortion, the legal aspects of abortion in Los Angeles, and address the question of full-term abortion legality in the United States.  
  
Know-All-About 14th Amendment  
  
The 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868, is part of the United States Constitution. It includes several clauses, but the key one concerning abortion is the Due Process Clause, which is found in the first section:  
  
""No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.""  
  
In the context of abortion, the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause is interpreted as protecting a woman's right to choose to terminate a pregnancy, as this decision falls under the purview of personal liberty. This interpretation was cemented in the landmark Supreme Court case of Roe v. Wade in the late 20s.  
  
Roe v. Wade and the Right to Choose  
The case of Roe v. Wade was a pivotal moment in the history of abortion rights in the United States. The case revolved around a Texas woman named Norma McCorvey, who wanted to terminate her pregnancy but was unable to do so because of the state's restrictive abortion laws. The Supreme Court's decision in this case relied on the 14th Amendment to establish a woman's constitutional right to have an abortion.   
  
The court's ruling in Roe v. Wade established that a woman has the right to choose an abortion up to the point of fetal viability, which is generally around 24 weeks of gestation. Beyond this point, states have more leeway in regulating or prohibiting abortion, but they must still allow for exceptions when the mother's life or health is at risk.  
  
Abortion Legalities in Los Angeles, California  
  
As for the legality of abortion in Los Angeles, it's important to note that California has some of the most permissive abortion laws in the United States. The state recognizes a woman's right to choose abortion and provides access to abortion services.    
  
In California, abortion can be performed up to the point of fetal viability, which aligns with the guidelines set forth in Roe v. Wade. However, the state goes further to protect a woman's right to choose by not imposing many of the restrictions seen in other states. This means that women in Los Angeles have relatively easy access to abortion services, both in terms of clinics and healthcare providers.  
  
Do You Know The Legal Aspects Of Full-Term Abortion?  
  
  
Full-term abortion, often referred to as ""late-term abortion,"" is a topic that generates significant debate and misunderstanding. It's important to clarify that full-term abortions, performed at or near the point of fetal viability, are generally subject to stricter regulations and limitations. However, these procedures are not a common occurrence, and they are typically only conducted under specific circumstances, such as when the mother's life or health is at risk, or when the fetus has a severe medical condition.  
  
The legality of full-term abortion varies from state to state. Some states allow full-term abortions under certain circumstances, while others have placed severe restrictions or outright bans on them. In California, full-term abortion is allowed when the mother's life or health is in danger, or if the fetus has a condition that would result in severe physical or mental impairment after birth. The laws regarding full-term abortion in California are more permissive than in many other states.  
  
Briefing  
  
In brief, the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution plays a crucial role in protecting a woman's right to choose an abortion, particularly up to the point of fetal viability. The landmark Supreme Court case of Roe v. Wade affirmed this constitutional right and established the legal framework for abortion in the United States.  
  
In Los Angeles, abortion is generally legal and accessible, thanks to the state's progressive abortion laws. However, the legality of full-term abortion, or late-term abortion, depends on the specific circumstances and the state in which it is sought. In California, like many other states, full-term abortion is permitted when the mother's life or health is at risk or when the fetus has a severe medical condition.  
  
It's essential to understand that abortion is a complex and deeply personal issue, and the laws surrounding it can vary from place to place. Individuals seeking information about abortion rights, access, and regulations should consult with healthcare providers and legal professionals to understand their rights and options fully.

57,2023-11-02,CMV: Time is an illusion of the human mind.,u/Money_Whisperer,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17m0t2k/cmv_time_is_an_illusion_of_the_human_mind/,changemyview,"Weird post I guess. 

So I recently learned that photons (aka light) essentially exist outside of our concept of time. This is due to the widely accepted theory of special relativity, stating that the closer to the speed of light you travel, the slower time moves for you, relative to everything else. So from the perspective of a photon, there is no passage of time at all.

In other words, light that emitted from a star in the night sky, that traveled billions of light years to hit your retinas last night, did so instantaneously, and was essentially pre-determined to hit your eye from the moment it came into existence. 

This got me thinking about what time actually is in the first place. There is no fundamental “force” of time, it’s just atoms shifting configurations in an entropic direction. If you rearranged the atoms of an old lamp back to their configuration when it was a new lamp, it would essentially be reset in time to it’s original state. The lamp didn’t just get a restoration, it’s literally the same lamp as before, just now moved backwards in time. 

Also- our current understanding of time is paradoxical, because time implies everything relies on cause and effect, when time itself must have likewise come from something, but our human minds cannot comprehend what existed before time to create time. How does anything happen without time? Clearly we are missing something very fundamental. 

This might be an overly vague/weird cmv, but I just wanted to see if maybe somebody had their own perspective on time to help me reconcile why it actually does exist as it’s own force in the universe."

Sure civilians are dying, but so what? Civilians die by militants all the time. You don’t see many people weeping for refugees in Niger or Sudan. 

So who care about the Palestinian people in reality. I don’t, any more than I care about the Ukrainian, Sudanese, Somali, Syrian, Uyghur, Rwandan, etc peoples. Genocide is genocide there is nothing inherently more wrong about the Israel-Hamas conflict than any other war that slaughters innocent civilians. 

So okay, who cares about innocent civilians actually? This is war and war is hell, it’s a tragedy that becomes a statistic with each bombed out infrastructure cite. So what if civilians get slaughtered? This happens in every war by every country since the dawn of the 20th century and the end of Kantly warfare. Based on the principle of realist international relations, a quick brutal war is better than a long war that minimizes casualties. So in that respect (and only that respect) Israel is justified in prosecuting this war to achieve laudable war goals of regional conquest of hostile territory. This is purely an issue of strategic politics, not morality. 

The reason why Israel is indefensible in my eyes, is that they’re couching this as a moral crusade and their military actions are above criticism. This is repugnant hypocrisy and I cannot stomach seeing it, nor can I tolerate seeing legitimate criticism be called out for “antisemitism.” Its appalling.

Israel is hardly in compliance with international law, and hasn’t been for some time. There is no attempt at proportionality in these indiscriminate bombing campaigns of Gaza. Women and children live in these apartments that Israel is hollowing out. The difference between the Hamas hostage taking and IDF bombing is that Israel apparently leaves no survivors when they target women and children. 

Again, from a military strategy standpoint there is absolutely nothing wrong with this strategy. A quick brutal war that maximized enemy casualties is often better than a long “safe” war that minimizes casualties. 

Still, Israel is not in the moral right here and they have not been from the start. Plus, how can Israel be sure they’re not bombing the locations of these hostages? Either they must (somehow) know where the hostages are, or they’re praying that these bombs don’t accidentally hit the hostages. 

TL;DR: Israel is not in the wrong from a military/strategic standpoint a two-state solution was doomed for decades and might had always made right throughout all human history. Nevertheless, Israel and their supporters are disgustingly hypocritical if they claim Israel is in *any way* justified in *how* they’re prosecuting this war. Israel has zero moral legitimacy and is not engaging in any self defense here. This is a war of strategy first, and revenge second. At best everyone sucks here."
1,2023-11-02,"CMV: that male dogs should not be neutered, but female dogs should be spayed",u/joedev2,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17m41z7/cmv_that_male_dogs_should_not_be_neutered_but/,changemyview,"For many years there has been a prevalent misunderstanding that dogs that are neutered will be less aggressive, and will also demonstrate a plethora of positive behavioural changes in comparison to an unneutered male dog. 

But, studies have actually shown the opposite: That they were more likely to be aggressive (due to fear), showed more fear-based behaviour, showed more of a predilection for eating and rolling in faeces, were more likely to bark persistently when alarmed, mount objects, furniture or people, and chase animals. Basically, neutered dogs were more likely to be less in control of their actions and practice less self-restraint, which directly contradicts the existing popular belief. These negative effects on their behaviour was found to be worse the earlier the dog was neutered which indicates that the dog's testosterone levels during early development is absolutely essential to its development as a well-behaved & happy dog. 

These studies found that of the 100 behaviours assessed pre & post neutering, 40 of these behaviours showed a significant difference from intact to castrated dogs, and of these 40, 36 were negative behaviours. This means that only 4 of these behaviours showed a positive outcome after neutering in comparison to 36 negative ones.

Also, too few people realise that this isn't just as simple as making a male dog infertile and not having testicles, we are talking about the complete destruction of its natural hormone systems. In humans, studies have proven low-testosterone males to be anxious, depressed, unathletic, unmotivated, effeminate looking, possessing low muscle mass and high body fat, and being completely unhappy. Why should it be any different for a dog? Testosterone is made in the testicles, and when a dog is neutered their ability to form testosterone is greatly diminished.

More evidence for this is that Police dogs are actually unneutered and you don't see male police dogs chase females across the streets, or bark at 'rival' dogs... 

And the cancer argument is absolutely ridiculous:

MYTH: Spaying and neutering is unhealthy for pets. FACT: Just the opposite! Neutering your male companion prevents testicular cancer and some prostate problems. 

This honestly resembles an Onion article. Maybe we should apply this logic to humans and start removing our skin at birth to prevent skin cancer? 

According to a vet, dogs who have been neutered typically have very testosterone levels and may experience side effects from these reduced levels of testosterone including inability to stand up, gain and keep muscle mass, hip dysplasia, arthritis, IDD, or degenerative join disease. And this vet recommends using testosterone replacement therapy to help neutered dogs live a happy life, and this is the only case where I could see the justification for neutering, if the dog is going to receive TRT after, and continuously. They performed 3 clinical studies and found an increase in quality of life in over 140 dogs with a 95% success rate, which provides more evidence that neutering greatly diminishes a dog's quality of life, due to the massively reduced testosterone levels, although this should be obvious just from looking at Humans with low testosterone levels.

Much like in Humans, another study found more examples of anxious behaviours in neutered dogs compared to intact dogs. The study also found that owners of intact dogs who were surveyed reported higher scores for “boldness” and “sociability to dogs. This emulates some of the symptoms of low T in humans, like being less confident and being anxious.

To me it seems so fundamental that dramatically changing an organisms biology through the complete and utter annihilation of hormonal systems would obviously have a negative effect on the animal. And all of these arguments are before we even consider just the straight up cruelty-factor involved in neutering operations. We thought it was a necessary evil for the greater good but it seems more to be a doubly evil operation."

I believe if parents would have to stomach watching their child getting mutilated fewer people would want to do it and it would fall out of favor.

Aside from clinically indicated cases, circumcision is a barbaric and unnecessary practice based on distorted perceptions stemmed from religion or social norms.

The prepuce (foreskin) is a normal part of the body that protects the very sensitive glans of the penis. Unless there is a clinical indication for amputating a normal part of the body, it is mutilation. 

Circumcision is also a violation of four basic human rights:
- the convention against torture 
- the convention of the rights of the child
- the universal declaration of human rights
- and the international covenant on civil and political rights."

1,2023-11-02,"CMV: Being confident/choosy in dating is marginally beneficial at best, and it's not the be-all end-all that people say it is. Also dating as a man can be incredibly difficult",u/RayAP19,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17m67ph/cmv_being_confidentchoosy_in_dating_is_marginally/,changemyview,"The first thing I want to say is that this is a very sensitive topic for me, so at the risk of being made fun of or downvoted for being a sensitive snowflake or whatever, I just ask that you please try to be nice. Thanks.

Also, keep in mind, if it's important, that 99.9% of my dating prospects come from dating apps or cold approaches in public.

So I've been on both sides of this coin. I've been terribly lacking in confidence and so desperate that I'll do whatever I can to get women to date me-- lie about deal-breakers, shower them with compliments and attention, spend as much money on them as they wanted, etc.

Then I got a new look a couple years ago. I improved my physical appearance, started going to the gym and lifting weights consistently, started dressing better, took care of my hair, etc., and my confidence went way up.

I have deal-breakers that I stand on when that wasn't the case before. If a woman won't compromise in the case any of my deal-breakers, I politely tell her I don't think we're a good match, whereas before I would have just thrown my convictions out the window out of desperation.

However, besides attracting more (and better looking) women initially based on my looks, I've had very similar results in dating during both of those eras.

Still, I get ghosted consistently, a lot of women match me on dating apps and don't even bother replying to my initial message, and at least twice I've ended up as someone's backup plan essentially.

I recently told my ex about one of those ""backup plan"" situations, and she roasted me for not being confident enough to not be someone's second-best.

I tried to explain to her that me being more confident, to the point of refusing to be in that situation, would not have changed anything. I'd be in the same place I'm in right now, except I wouldn't be in that situation.

My confidence has been through the floor and through the roof in the last five years, the former for the first three years of that time, and the latter for the last two years and counting.

I'm someone who can tell you everything that makes me a great catch-- I'm tall, handsome, I exercise and I'm pretty fit, emotionally available, kind, caring, intelligent, witty, funny, affectionate, attentive, confident, assertive, and I'm great at communication and conflict resolution.

Of course, I'm not perfect-- I have anxiety and depression, which can cause relationship issues, but I've been in therapy consistently for about a year. I don't make a lot of money, and I can be a bit overly affectionate physically and sometimes selfish. 

Like I said, my ex said I'm not confident enough, but I think it's fairly obvious that I have plenty of self-esteem. I'm secure in confident in who I am as a person and how I look-- I love what I see when I look in a mirror.

And having all these positive qualities, and a high level of confidence, I still struggle to find someone who wants to build a relationship with me where there's mutual attraction.

So all in all, my point is that being confident doesn't greatly increase your success in dating the way people say it does, and also, it is almost ridiculously hard to be successful in dating as a man, depending on certain things (demographics, culture, etc).

Being a man doesn't automatically mean you're dating on hard mode, but being confident doesn't also automatically mean you're on easy mode."
23,2023-11-02,CMV: A ceasefire in Gaza would only lead to more bloodshed in the future and would ultimately strengthen Hamas,u/thatshirtman,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17m6ukr/cmv_a_ceasefire_in_gaza_would_only_lead_to_more/,changemyview,"Many people are calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza/Israel. They want Israel to retreat its forces and for Hamas to stop firing rockets into Israel. I get it. It makes sense on paper.

However, the recent Hamas massacre where over 1,000 innocent civillians were murdered (some tortured) happened DURING A CEASEFIRE. The idea of going back to that status quo seems baffling. If anything, it's the calculus Hamas counted on based on previous fighting  (i.e Hamas and Israel slowly escalate, then world opinion convinces Israel that a ceasefire is the best approach).

During a recent interview, a Hamas leader boasted that the last 2 years Hamas strategically limited engagement with Israel as to convince them that they actually cared about ""governing the people in Gaza."" In reality, they used the 2 years to plan the massacre.

 It's reasonable to ascertain that a ceasefire would just give Hamas what they want and time to regroup. 

Keep in mind - Another Hamas leader recently said that the ""October 7 massacre will happen 'again and again' until Israel is 'annihilated.""

Is this the type of group you make a ceasefire with? How do you engage in negotiations in good faith with a group whose sworn reason for existence is destruction and murder. Hamas is so extreme it's banned in Egypt. 

For the bloodshed to end once and for all, Hamas needs to be removed, either via surrender or force. A ceasefire would simply result in the same ""business as usual"" dynamic that resulted in the massacre in the first place. Hamas attacks, over time, would continue to become bolder and more sensational and murderous. And what would stop them, as they know any atrocities they commit would be immediately followed by calls for a ceasefire.

If there's a ceaesfire option that a) accounts for the hostages and b) would prevent Hamas or any other entity from enacting more terror attacks, I would be all for it. I've just yet to hear it broached or articulated in a practical way.

If you think a ceaesfire today can ultimately lead to a peaceful resolution, which is what most people want, I would love to hear an opposing viewpoint based on practical considerations.

I believe that a centrally controlled means of production is unviable in a world where that production is performed by humans, and the disparity in complexity/responsibilities between jobs makes equal compensation nonsense. 

However, I also believe that with the way technology is going, the means of production are becoming less and less human-oriented. More and more of our goods especially the more complex ones and \*especially\* things that are more research-oriented instead of consumer-oriented, are produced by machines that are controlled by human beings. The logical result of this is that as our technology becomes more and more complex, a smaller % of the population will be necessary to continue producing the same quantity of goods, or even more. This is absolutely a problem for capitalism, but it has a solution in the form of an ""automation tax"".

This may be a popular concept I don't know, I haven't heard anyone else talk about it but I'm sure I'm not the first to come up with it. A quick google search suggests that companies spend 15-30% of their revenue on payroll alone. If companies don't need to employ as many people but can continue operations, I believe an automation tax could completely solve this issue. This is how it would work (all numbers here are arbitrary, they are \*not\* final figures by any stretch of the word): Admittedly this metric is difficult to measure, but any percent above a certain threshold, say 10%, of a company that gets automated, a certain percent, say 50%, of that difference gets taxed. So if a company has 20% of its workforce automated, it works out as 0.5(20-10)=5% so a company that is 20% automated gets a 5% revenue tax, which gets used to fund UBI. I believe the taxes necessary to fund UBI are too extreme to be viable, but if the companies being taxed are already saving that money, it's a wash. Plus the money in question would already have been used to pay people their wages, so I think that makes it even more plausible. 

Anyway, that's how we make capitalism work in the short term. But very long term, looking at this same technology, there is reason to believe that at a certain point, only a negligible number of human beings will be required to manage the systems making everything humanity needs to survive. When this becomes a reality, the notion of the free market kind of breaks down. This is why I believe communism (or the functional equivalent anyway, if humans are separated from the means of production,  I think we might have to call it something different) is the most viable economic system long term. If the vast majority of people don't produce anything or work toward doing so because they don't have to, there's nothing meaningful to base purchasing power on, and capitalism ceases to function. 

&#x200B;

Additionally, the problem with communism is advancement. If everything is controlled centrally and people aren't able to benefit from novel creations, there isn't much of an incentive to do so. This means that introducing communism now would severely handicap mankind's potential, and maybe even prevent us from reaching the future I've described where communism is warranted. I believe introducing communism now is putting the cart before the horse. 

Any socialism seems to have taken the valid points that underpin the ideologies of both systems and cherry-picked the ones that make it as incompatible with reality as possible. Socialism has the advancement issue I mentioned for communism, isn't a good solution to the automation problem because the only way socialism solves that is by having large numbers of people doing meaningless jobs so they're eligible for their chunk of the company's profits that are primarily generated by automated production, which is far from ideal. 

&#x200B;

Essentially, I'm viewing this from the perspective that the primary drive of our economic systems in the future should be technology, and the future of technology seems to lend itself to capitalism with a very long-term switch to something akin to communism, but only once human beings are no longer required to work for the goods humanity needs to continue to be produced.

In a time where more and more Americans are only moderately or not religious, the quaker religion seems like a good fit. It is, generally, mild and progressive with few/no rituals or rules and unproframmed services. E.g. Most in the US support lgbtq+ individuals as equals and have so publically for some time (~2004) 

Why then is it not popular? Everyone thinks they are Amish thanks to Quaker Oats branding.

That said, for the vast majority of people in the First World, bottled water is a massively overpriced scam.

Firstly, bottled water companies upcharge massively due to the cost of producing plastic bottles, so bottled water costs hundreds of times more than tap water. It would be like paying $300 for something you can get for $1.

Secondly, bottled water is unnecessary if your concern is purification/safety since municipal systems are actually held to similar, if not higher, standards. The bottled water industry actually often uses the same source in fact.

Firstly, I DO believe ADHD is 100% real. ADHD is proven by decades of research to be a real, physiological condition. Some individuals have a very difficult time functioning normally, qualifying this as a disorder, in which treatment is necessary. 

HOWEVER I believe in recent years this concept has mushroomed into a massive scapegoat exploited by the population to recieve amphetamines. It seems in 90% of cases the individual presents to a healthcare provider, fills out a 6 question survey and then are promptly diagnosed with ADHD, where they will then go on to live their life dosing amphetamines all day everyday. 

I have been reading r/adhd for years where this issue is brought up constantly, by individuals experiencing profound life changes and complete personality reversals for the better. Rightfully so, people question whether this medication is bringing them to the normal state, or an elevated state above where most humans function. Any posts like this brought up are immediately shut down by the circle jerk. 

The claim that “I was diagnosed with ADHD, I am right in taking amphetamines” is incredibly naive and creates an unfair advantage. Of course you’re going to improve in areas of your life, your on an ampethamine. Members of r/adhd vehemently push the claim that amphetamines are necessary and warranted in the case of a diagnosis, and that all these incredible abilities are how neurotypicals operate. 

I have personally seen several primary care doctors, therapists, and psychiatrists who have all diagnosed me with varying mental illnesses. I have been diagnosed, prescribed medication that I have taken for years. And I can confidently say for a 100% fact, that I can walk into my doctors office today, explain my symptoms, and walk out with an adhd diagnosis. I know for a fact that I can receive a stimulant prescription by the end of the day. Why? Because I check the box for countless of the symptoms. I’m a fourth year university student. I have a lot of trouble focusing. It’s very difficult to concentrate and study as long as my peers and perform and their level. But we do not chalk this up to ADHD and drop adderall every morning. This is normal. I shouldn’t be able to naturally study for 12 hours a day. We muster up the willpower, build the discipline, and suffer the unpleasantness of life’s challenges. 

Would it be fair for me to walk into my family doctors office, fill out the questionnaire, describe my attention challenges, and walk out with amphetamines? I personally see this as an incredibly unfair advantage. These pharmaceuticals do not magically adapt to each individual and alter dopamine levels to that of an average person. The doctors labeling of me does not suddenly confirm I have deficient dopamine levels. 



Listening to years of r/adhd the most common analogous comparison, by far, is the following: “are glasses an unfair advantage? Do you think a person with naturally poor eyesight shouldn’t wear glasses? No, of course not. ADHD medication is the same. We have a deficiency that needs to be treated”

That’s incredibly dubious. Comparing seeing glasses to amphetamines is bizzare. Glasses level the playing field, a solution of equity. Amphetamines, on the other hand, do not normalize individuals. A fair comparison would be providing the person with poor eyesight a vision surgery that increases their eyesight to 20/10. Amphetamines provide a significant increase in abilities above normal. Think about it from my perspective. Sure, I could fit the bill for adhd. Does this mean the doctor labeling me suddenly warrants the option to just dose ampethamines all day, and eliminate my troubles? 

I see posts almost everyday from users who rightfully question this incredible life improvement, fell guilty, question an unfair advantage and whether this is what “normal” people feel like. Immediately these subs are flooded with comments validating their drug usage, comparing it to seeing glasses, hearing aids, wheelchairs, etc. Seriously? Give a normal person seeing glasses, a hearing aid, a wheel chair. Do they suddenly experience profound life improvement? No, of course not. Give a normal person amphetamine. Do they suddenly experience profound increases in some abilities? Almost certainly. Amphetamines are proven by research to provide benefit to neurotypicals. Are wheelchairs?

Still to this day I see posts on r/adhd where users aggressively push the ideology that a positive reaction to the medication confirms their adhd diagnosis. No shit. They’re taking an amphetamine, obviously they will focus better. You don’t respond to that saying “that confirms you have adhd, your brain has a nuerochemical imbalance that requires this medication.” Those changes they feel would be felt by nearly everyone taking that drug. 


TLDR: ADHD and mental illness is real, and medication treatment is necessary in some cases. I’ve been diagnosed with several, and have been prescribed several psychiatric medications. Taking a 5 question survey and chatting to a doc for 15 minutes does not validate your chronic amphetamine usage. Most of us can get an adhd diagnosis, that doesn’t instantly create a dopamine deficiency that requires an amphetamine. Sure, you very well may have a disorder that requires treatment, but society standing behind a diagnosis as an excuse to take amphetamines all day is not right. Comparing amphetamine usage to seeing glasses is inaccurate and harmful. Amphetamines increase dopamine. They make (almost) everyone able to study, concentrate, etc better. That does not mean we all have a developmental neurological disorder that requires amphethamine to function."

Whenever you see someone comment on marvel declining in quality, or movies like black widow and ant man quantumania sucking a lot. Mcu fans hound non mcu fans and swear their view marvel is always good and always amazing is the right view and anyone else is just hating on the community 

what does it say if Kevin Feige and marvel have acknowledged marvel has sucked a lot in its multiverse era, while its fans spend that much effort arguing otherwise? A recent story came out in gq that talked about how marvel is in decline and its executives are so desperate for a Hail Mary they are making plans to bring captain america and iron man back. On the surface this makes alot of sense, it will tie together the stories, bring a fresh perspective to the multiverse and time travel that will take place within it, and will make marvel a lot of money. But if you speak with mcu fans, you will notice their thinking does not line up with marvel. They insist iron man is a sacred cow who is untouchable because he died in avengers endgame despite the Kang saga being about time travel and despite iron man being a time traveler. And despite marvel saying years ago that secret wars is based on avengers forever, where the avengers bring heroes from the past present and future to fight kang. Marvel fans are such a cancer to cinema they openly contradict the agenda of Kevin fiege, their messiah, again Kevin feige said marvel has sucked while its fans argue otherwise

how can marvel improve or realize its flaws when it has fans who say quantumania was a good movie? jeff loveness openly says the movie sucked and he was fired over its quality. Black widow sucked. She hulk is stupid. Thor love and thunder was dumb. The eternals was the most confusing intro into the mcu ever. Im not saying marvel fans cannot enjoy the mcu and not give a care about what anyone says. But thats not what they do, they spout opinions that contradict their messiah, the market, and general consensus on whether those movies or shows are good at all. Bob Igor is who marvel fans can thank for Kevin fiege keeping his job as marvel studios president, bob Igor has openly said too many shows and movies were made and they should have never existed at alll. but if you ask marvel fans, they will spend their last Dying breath trying to argue otherwise

&#x200B;

marvel fans. Not marvel movies. Are a cancer on cinema. Their dogma has led the mcu to the decline in quality it has now. Because disney was convinced there would be enough dogma in the community to justify not justifiable content like she hulk. Also. Young avengers was beyond stupid to try in the mcu. Stop defending the characters, they totally derailed the storylines of several movies like doctor strange and the multiverse of madness. There’s a reason my time to shine hello is saying secret wars will be a multiverse avenger movie and not a young avengers movie. Young avengers wont even get their own tv show. Because all of their characters are stupid

It was upsetting to see somebody who, based on the comments, really hadn't done anything bash themselves over and over again for not being good enough. And this is by no means the first time I've seen this behavior. I think many on the left see it as a good thing, that if society can shake white men's core sense of self they'll be open to learning about other perspectives. 

I think the opposite is true. I think people who have no core sense of self who believe they are mediocre over all because of societal messaging are the most dangerous, and the most likely to lash out and hurt others.

229,2023-11-02,CMV: Current social media algorithms are a threat to debate and therefore to the well-being of society,u/Revolutionary-Ad5486,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17mazys/cmv_current_social_media_algorithms_are_a_threat/,changemyview,"The algorithms used by the most common social media apps skew the content you see to a dangerous extent of society.

Me and my dad for example, are both politically centered, while I'm a bit more left leaning and he's a bit more right leaning. There are but a few topics we disagree on, but our social media feeds look the exact opposite. My feed is made up of mostly left wing and some times extreme left propaganda while his is mostly right wing with extreme right propaganda. We once even got to the conclusion that the same news article was reaching us at different points of discussion, as in, he gets the article on his feed raw and I only get the article after someone countered the arguments.

This gigantic difference for two individuals who share the majority of opinions has been making it extremely hard to debate with each other over the years because we see information through the algorithms' lense.

In addition, my mother who's out of the social media loop, sometimes doesn't even recognize the topics were talking about due to these topics only being discuted by a very small percentage of the population (social media users).

This distortion makes it seem that people who actually think a lot like you are miles away and that consensus is not possible.

On top of that, debates with other people I know are becoming more and more based around sound bites and whataboutism because that's all the algorithm feeds us.

I therefore believe that these algorithms are a serious threat to the way we are debating several critical topics and consequently a threat to the well-being of society.

Abortions should be regulated like any other extremely safe procedure. Think of getting an abortion like getting a tooth filled. It should be a simple call to a doctor with no waiting period or any other obstacle that is not strictly medically necessary. But that is all pretty normal for a ""pro-choice"" person. 

I think abortion should be celebrated as good healthcare, and seen the best option for unwanted pregnancies. The right response to someone saying that they aborted an unwanted or surprise pregnancy is ""Good! I'm glad you made the smart choice!"" Any student should be able to schedule an abortion with their school without their parents being notified if they choose. Abortions should be completely covered by any health insurance or by the government for the uninsured. Giving babies up for adoption should be exceedingly rare (and I say this as an adoptee). 

More abortions! No restrictions! Be proudly pro-abortion, not just quietly ""pro-choice""."

The coach said something to the effect of: *""Americans generally prefer lots of scoring in sports because they find it entertaining. Non-Americans, on the other hand, like low-scoring defensive battles because they're more purist. If you ask Americans what score they prefer in a soccer game, they'd say something like '6 goals to 5,' but if you ask non-Americans, they'd prefer the soccer game be 1-0 or 2-1.""*

For clarification, the coach wasn't criticizing non-Americans at all. If anything, he was praising them. He was implying that Americans are more shallow and like cheap thrills (""score! score! score!"") while non-Americans have a greater appreciation for the thrill of the battle and find low-scoring games to be more suspenseful and make each goal more meaningful.

From what I understand, the implication also carried over to other sports: Americans would prefer a basketball game have a score of something like 120-110, while non-Americans might prefer 70-60. Americans might like a hockey game to have a score of 10-9 while non-Americans prefer 2-1. Etc.

I realize that the comment section will probably rip this viewpoint totally apart as stereotyping and broad-brushing. There are plenty of times when European soccer teams will rip apart a weak opponent 10 goals to nil, for instance. But when it comes to preference, I'm not sure.

1,2023-11-02,CMV: Free Will Doesn't Exist,u/ChamplainLesser,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17me0tj/cmv_free_will_doesnt_exist/,changemyview,"Okay, so I'm going to condense a few very weighty arguments down to a relatively condensed bit of text. Likewise, I am assuming a certain level of understanding of the classical arguments for determinism and will not be explaining them to a high level of depth.  
Laplace's Daemon  
In this argument, mathematician and physicist Simon Laplace said to imagine a Daemon. This Daemon is a hypothetical entity or intelligence with complete knowledge of the positions and velocities of all particles in the universe, as well as a perfect understanding of the physical laws governing their behavior. With this complete knowledge, the Daemon could predict the future and retrodict the past with absolute certainty. In other words, if you knew the initial conditions of the universe and had a perfect understanding of the laws of physics, you could, in theory, calculate the past and future of the entire universe.  
Argument From Physics  
The sum total of physical energy in the world is a constant, subject to transformation from one form to another but not subject either to increase or diminution. This means that any movement of any body is entirely explicable in terms of antecedent physical conditions. Therefore the deeds of the human body are mechanically caused by preceding conditions of body and brain, without any reference whatsoever to the metaphysical mind of the individual, to his intents and purposes. This means that the will of man is not one of the contributing causes to his action; that his action is physically determined in all respects. If a state of will, which is mental, caused an act of the body, which is physical, by so much would the physical energy of the world be increased, which is contrary to the hypothesis universally adopted by physicists. Hence, to physics, the will of man is not a vera causa in explaining physical movement.  
Argument from Biology  
Any creature is a compound of capacities and reactions to stimuli. The capacities it receives from heredity, the stimuli come from the environment. The responses referable to the mentality of the animal are the effects of inherited tendencies on the one hand and of the stimuli of the environment on the other hand. This explanation is adequately accepted in reference to all but humans. Humans are adequately similar in biology to other primates, particularly chimpanzees. Therefore the explanation also works for humans, absent an empirical reason to exclude them. Therefore human behaviour is entirely explicable through materialistic causes.  
\---  
The Uncertainty Principle and Laplace's Daemon  
Now you might be thinking that Laplace's Daemon is refuted by the HUP, and you would be right to bring up the Uncertainty Principle in this regard. However, it is not enough that Laplace's Daemon be refuted to prove Free Will since Quantum Processes logically predate humanity. Simply put, Quantum Processes are not a human construct and therefore, since empirical evidence suggest they exist, it must follow that they predate humanity. If they predate humanity, then the variable that determines the outcome of the wave function must be independent of human influence, else the Quantum Processes could not have predated humanity. Therefore, we can logically assume that apparent indeterminism is a function of incompleteness.  
\---  
I don't know if I can be convinced that free will necessarily exists (I hope I could be, the alternative is terrifying) but I do believe I can be swayed away from strict determinism."

I think the ideas work in tandem though. Being “ethical” and “right” gets more people on your side, making you more mighty. Why some things are “right” and others are not is a different topic that I think takes some historical and philosophical knowledge to answer. But generally if you have a convincing argument, it will win people over and make you more mighty, so I guess the two topics work in tandem.

I've seen a lot of people claiming that BPD (Borderline personality disorder) has the highest suicide risk of all mental illnesses and how it is absolutely the WORST mental illness to deal with. This is probably either due to the fact that many of them feel desperate because of the horrible symptoms of such illness or/and they want a lot of attention to cope with it.  
  
First of all no one has experienced all mental illnesses. You may have one, you may have many. But you do not have all of them so how could you say which mental illness is worse and which is not? It's all subjective and depends on the person.  
  
Second of all about the ""highest suicide rate"" many of them claim.

I'll admit I'm a bit frustrated right now so I will become a hypocrite and join in on the competition of ""which disorder has the most suicides"" since quite a lot of people with BPD seem to bring it up so often. Fuck it.  
  
Borderline personality disorder (BPD) does not have the highest suicide rates.  
  
Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have the highest rates of suicide. Here's actual studies that cover this and most other studies available also come to the same conclusion.  
  
Completed Suicides:  
  
Borderline personality disorder - Up to 10%  
  
Bipolar Disorder - Up to 20%  
  
Schizophrenia - Around 10%  
  
""Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is associated with suicidal behaviors and self-harm. Up to 10% of BPD patients will die by suicide.""  
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6632023/  
  
""Accordingly, the rate of suicide among BD patients is approximately 10–30 times higher than the corresponding rate in the general population. Extant research found that up to 20% of (mostly untreated) BD subjects end their life by suicide."" BD stands for Bipolar Disorder.  
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6723289/  
  
""A lifetime suicide rate in individuals with schizophrenia is approximately 10%.""  
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6681260/  
  
There's also this study showing psychotic disorder is in the highest suicide risk of all mental disorders. Both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (BD) do/can experience psychosis.  
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7721561/  
  
""It is well known that over half of the patients with BD (Bipolar Disorder) develop psychotic symptoms during their lifetimes."" In this study right under.  
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9521535/  
  
Feels stupid comparing who has the highest of what and who doesn't as if it was a competition and all struggles in life should be taken seriously as well as all mental disorders including borderline personality disorder. It is a severe illness that affects many if not all parts of your life but stop claiming bullshit misinformation.

The randomly appearing pillars in 2001 vs the strange magnetic field in interstellar; the betrayal shown in both movies emphasizing on the 'the-big-picture goal' while exhibiting insensitive in real time; the floating baby in the end, in 2001 vs coop's body floating in interstellar ; and a billion other scenes were observed in interstellar which were in fact a spoon-fed adaptation of 2001.

I can understand that certain aspects of interstellar could have been better than 2001 but my belief is that it comes from a place of better cinematic quality, due to evolved technological growth and not because of an evolved writing. The fuss on the perfect visualization of the black hole is a result of dearths on money invested in result on the relevant field of study and not due to superior imagination. 

What according to you makes interstellar superior to 2001?"

Yet Lucifer's name translates as “bearer of light” or “morning star”. Hell is filled with fire. Fire produces warmth and light.  
  
We refer to God and Heaven as something light. And we often refer to sky (space) as to where Heaven is. Yet, space itself is dark and cold.  
  
And we live in cycles of day and night. Day is related to God, night to Lucifer. But what gives day a light is a Sun, a planet that burns and will burn for a long time. And product of that burning is warmth and light. We can't see if it's dark, we have to wait for fire to burn and produce light in order to even see.

The most common counter point and ""resolution"" that should make me feel all better is that realistically nothing will ever happen.

Another common point is whether I myself have celebrity crushes. I did when I was younger, I still find celebrities and others attractive but I would never take anyone over my SO... Are my values and views so crazy?"

I love rock a lot, but I can't help but think that rock is dead in today's modern music scene. Today, sure, we have some legacy bands like Rolling Stones, Foo Fighters, Green Day, etc, still playing and creating music, but they aren't getting any fucking attention, and their new songs aren't that great either. When we look historically, the only truly GOOD bands that formed after 2000 were the Arctic Monkeys and Black Keys (although many great bands like the Chili Peppers and Green Day formed prior to the date and played some of their best shit in the 2000s.) No good rock band has formed in the 2010s, and CERTAINLY not in the 2020s. Without any new bands forming and maintaining the legacy, the genre will certainly die, if it's not dead already. The only true rock fans still alive are dads and some fringe teenagers. Their mainstream attention has declined, and replaced with the likes of pop and rap (rap is dying too.) It's always sad to see a genre die, especially ones who have had a profound impact on American history and culture. First it was jazz, now rock. Rap's death is on the horizon too, watch out (Lil Naz X is barely a rapper.)

You can change my view by convincing me that rock still has a mainstream presence and contemporary bands that can carry out its legacy."
0,2023-11-02,CMV: the war Israel is waging in Gaza is not a genocide.,u/willardTheMighty,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17mk7ee/cmv_the_war_israel_is_waging_in_gaza_is_not_a/,changemyview,"When Israel began the blockade of Gaza in 2006, the population of the Strip was about 1,500,000. At the end of 2022, Gaza’s population was about 2,000,000. That’s a yearly population growth of 1.8%. The Earth’s average population growth from 2006 to 2022 was 1.2%. 

The population of Gaza was growing at 150% the global average rate for the entire time they were under Israeli control. To compare their plight under Israeli control to a “genocide” like the Jewish people experienced at the hands of the Nazis or the Tutsi experienced at the hands of the Hutu is ridiculous. If either of those perpetrators had such control over the lives of their victims as Israel has over Gaza, the Jews and the Tutsi would NEVER last for 17 years, let alone see their population grow at a rate 150% the global average. 

In the last month, about 9000 Gazans have been killed (these numbers come from the Gaza Health Authority, which is run by Hamas, and in my opinion these numbers are most likely inflated. But we will take them at face value.) 9000 dead out of a population of two million is not a genocide. It’s a tragedy; it may be a war crime; it may be reprehensible and the fault for these deaths may lie entirely with Israel; these are tough questions, but my point is that it is not a genocide. 

Israel told Gazans to evacuate Gaza City; Hamas took steps to slow/hinder this evacuation. Egypt, Jordan, and other Arab countries refuse to open their borders to Palestinian refugees. Israel has an existential threat in the form of Hamas; they are taking drastic action but very few options were left to them. They have the clear goal of eradicating Hamas; they are not chasing Gazans down and killing them like people do in real genocides.

One final point; what “people” are being genocided, putatively? Gazans? That’s not a people-group any more than Manhattanites is a people group. Their nationality is Palestinian; their ethnicity is Arab; their religion is Muslim. The Palestinian nationality, the Arab ethnicity, and the Muslim religion stand no threat of being destroyed by Israel’s actions in Gaza.

1,2023-11-02,CMV: People with severe untreated mental illnesses should be locked in a psychiatric hospital,u/__Dreaming___,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17mla2h/cmv_people_with_severe_untreated_mental_illnesses/,changemyview,"Bipolar 1 disorder (due to manic episodes, not hypomanic episodes) and schizophrenia (pretty much due to psychosis in general) refusing treatment should be locked in a psychiatric hospital even before having an episode. 

Both disorders are very severe and life long chronic illnesses. If someone is stable without medication sooner or later they will have another manic or psychotic episode and will fuck up their own lives and possibly people’s around them. 

Both individuals with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have a tendency to stop medication once they’re on it due to denial, side effects or agnosia to name a few.

When they are diagnosed they should be forced to take medicine as injections. If the side effects aren’t tolerable they will go to a psych ward and switch them up. Risk is too high otherwise.

Yes it will be expensive. But let’s just transfer property taxes from their estates to the hospital they will be living in. Average time to be there could be 1-2 years and if they don’t get psychotic and manic within a year they’re free to go and hospital will buy them a new house. Just get a house. 

You might think that people with the potential disorder would be afraid to seek treatment because of all this. Good point. The illness will prove it’s severe enough when the cops or paramedics pick them up running around naked downtown."

1,2023-11-02,"Cmv: Nobody knows if we have free will or not, and that’s okay",u/Writer1999,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17mma1u/cmv_nobody_knows_if_we_have_free_will_or_not_and/,changemyview,"     The question of free will, as I see it, is unanswerable. For starters, there is no agreed upon definition of free will. There are some people who argue that free will is the ability to do otherwise while others would say that a person’s acts can be free even if they could not have done otherwise. There are still other definitions that one can appeal to. How can we figure out the truth about something if we cannot even define our concepts with some precision? 
     Another difficulty that stems from lack of agreed upon definitions is how the empirical data relates to our definition. We do not know if the universe is, all in all, deterministic or indeterministic. We can provide definitions of free will that correspond to both models of the universe, but that is not helpful unless we can figure out the answer to the determinism-indeterminism question. The fact that we can mold the concept to fit both models gives us further cause to be skeptical of the concept’s meaningfulness.
     As for our experience of free will, I do not deny that we act in the world. We act in big ways and in small ways. Sometimes our actions correspond to our thoughts and feelings, but sometimes they don’t. Sometimes, in fact, our own actions baffle us as much as the actions of others baffle us. I would argue that at the end of the day we are observers of our own actions as much as the actions of others. That is to say, the cause or source of our actions and the actions of others is unclear. We think that we are the cause of our actions, but perhaps that is less of a concrete fact and more of a byproduct of consciousness. In other words, our minds infer causation between events (billiard ball A hits billiard ball B/ billiard ball B falls into the pocket/ therefore, billiard ball A caused billiard ball B to fall into the pocket). But causation might not exist outside the mind. It might, but that has to be proven. But since our mind infers causation between events, it logically follows that our mind infers causation between internal events (thoughts, feelings, memories, etc.) and external events (external events including our own action and the actions of others as well as non-acts such as a natural disaster). In this way, it makes sense why free will seems so real. But this is not knowledge. It is an assumption based on our cognitive structure.
     To the people who argue that free will is necessary for people/society is function, I fundamentally disagree. We will continue to act in the world without or without a definitive answer on free will. That is, so to speak, our nature. Biological organisms act in their environment. We do not spend hours debating whether a dog is the ultimate cause of its actions or whether an ant is the ultimate cause of its actions."
1,2023-11-02,CMV: College classes should be structured like a typical 9-5,u/intoner1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17mmdin/cmv_college_classes_should_be_structured_like_a/,changemyview,"I think that it’s a bit odd that for your entire educational career you’re basically operating on a 9-5 schedule. Between homework and extracurriculars you’re essentially operating like a mini-adult. And then you get to college and your schedule drastically changes. You’re no longer in classes all day and instead you have 2-3 hour blocks of breaks throughout the day.

For most students they’ll have 2-3 classes a day. They’re typically out of the classroom by 4 pm and their day may not start until 10. On top of that you have 2-3 hour breaks in between most classes where you don’t have to do anything. 

It’s great in the moment but it kinda messes you up if the goal is to “prepare students for the workplace.” I mean thank about it: you go from having a structured lifestyle that parallels the typical 9-5 work style to having a loose schedule for 4 years before being expected to go back to that structure of a 9-5. If college is meant to prepare you for “the real world” why isn’t it structured like a typical 40 hour workweek?

Instead you get 12-18 hours a week and maybe an additional 2-3 hours worth of reading. If anything college doesn’t prepare you for the real world and it hinders your ability to go back to a structured life."

I don't see a solution for Gaza which doesnt include a ground war launched  to depose and liberate those living in Gaza from Hamas. A ground war would stop the carpet bombing that is killing so many innocent civilians and would allow more targeted arrests of leaders of Hamas responsible for the attacks on Oct 7th and would end the injust collective punishment of the people in Gaza. Hamas hasn't allowed elections in 17 years, publicly executes Gazans who disagree with Hamas, and steals international aid meant for the people of Gaza. Hamas is also to blame for the blockades along the Israeli and Egyptian borders that keep Gazans imprisoned and impoverished. The blockades were placed because Hamas was attacking targets in Egypt and Israel. An end to Hamas would leave Israel with no justification to continue to restrict the movement of the Palestinian people and would be a first step in an eventual either 1 state solution  with equal rights or 2 state solution with open travel between the two. Palestinians in Gaza don't deserve to be trapped in an open air prison and the first step to ending that is eliminating Hamas."

An eye for an eye— there is no purer, more just form of punishment. While I think every case is unique and there should be some exceptions (no directly harming anyone but the perpetrator), I see multiple reasons why our punishments should be updated.


To deter future crimes and restore a sense of justice to victims and their families, I believe that the punishment should be as close to the crime as possible.

Currently violent criminals, especially in jurisdictions like mine and others around the country, are given absolute joke sentences that are spitting in the face of the victims and make the perpetrators laugh and do it again. 

Let me give two cases on the opposite end of the spectrum—

1. A “smash and grab” robbery where a their smashes a victims car window, steals their valuables and flees

The sentence shall be for the perpetrator to be publicly forced to witness their own car being equally damaged, and their own valuables taken. They must also be forced to pay additional  restitution equal to the amount they stole originally.

If the victim doesn’t have a car, the most equivalent punishment should apply. (Damage their house, motorcycle etc)


2. A violent rape or murder

The perpetrator shall be secured and raped (in the case of actual forces, violent rape) to feel the helplessness and violation their own victim felt. The victim and their family (if they wish) should be allowed to witness this. They perp would then be imprisoned with a sentence based on a re-offending risk assessment.

For 2nd, 1st degree murder particularly the perpetrator shall be executed in the same fashion they murdered their victim(s). For particularly heinous crimes involving sadism and torture, the perpetrator shall be publicly tortured and executed in a manner requested by the victims family or by default in the same manner they tortured and murdered their own victims.

**I should also clarify that for serious punishments for violent crimes, these types of punishments should only be carried out when the evidence is undeniable and unquestionable. DNA, other forensic evidence  or extremely strong circumstantial evidence would apply here.

This is not a joke. I am 100% serious. I believe in a high degree of accountability for perpetrators and justice for their victims. The fact that “cruel and unusual” punishment is a protection for violent offenders is a joke and simply invites others and perpetuates a culture of crime. 

If this were implemented, crime would drop like a rock. This is how small communities have placed themselves since the Stone Age, but for some reason we gradually came to believe true justice was “barbaric”.

*Hot sauce enthusiasts and chili pepper aficionados around the world can attest to the fact that the current measurement system for hot sauces' heat levels is in dire need of an overhaul. Here are some compelling reasons why a new, more precise measurement of heat is essential*:

1. **Misleading Ratings**: One of the major issues with the current system is that a 9/10 rating is often labeled as ""mild."" This inconsistency leaves consumers bewildered and misinformed. It's time to align the rating system with the actual perception of spiciness.

2. **Absurdly High Ratings**: It's not uncommon to come across hot sauces rated at 16/10 or even higher. Such absurdly high ratings not only lack credibility but also make it impossible to distinguish between intensely hot sauces. We need a system that reflects reality, not one that inflates numbers for marketing purposes.

3. **Richter Scale Analogy**: Imagine if the hotness scale were redefined similar to a Richter scale, where each increment represents a tenfold increase in spiciness. This would provide a more accurate representation of the heat levels. A 1.6/10 would be distinguishably milder than an 8.9/10, and consumers could confidently select sauces that match their preferred spice intensity.

4. **Comprehensive Understanding**: The current 1 to 10 scale often fails to capture the nuances of heat. For those who enjoy a bit of spice but not an overwhelming burn, a 3/10 sauce might be too mild, while a 7/10 sauce is too much. With a more fine-tuned scale, like the proposed Richter-style system, people can make more informed choices.

It's time for the hot sauce industry to adopt a measurement system that aligns with consumers' actual experiences, eliminates exaggerated ratings, and provides a comprehensive understanding of spiciness. A Richter-style scale, where each increment represents a tenfold increase in heat, would be a game-changer for both hot sauce lovers and those seeking the perfect level of heat in their meals. 

**Now, I understand the difficulties in testing small batch sauces by Cottage sales or like, but they could be easily compared to other tested sauces to gauge scale, and a simple ""*"" added to reference it has been *Human tested* over lab/similar**

1,2023-11-03,CMV: The War on Plastic is a Mistake,u/phileconomicus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17mtjoz/cmv_the_war_on_plastic_is_a_mistake/,changemyview,"In the last decade or so plastic (especially in single-use products) has become the subject of a moral panic that is unjustified and foolish. Think for example of the successful campaigns to replace plastic straws with paper ones, or to ban or tax plastic bags and fastfood packaging. 

Of course the production, use, and disposal of plastic products does cause harms to people, animals, and the wider environment. But everything causes harms when 8 billion people do it. The significant thing is that using plastics for these purposes causes far less of these harms than anything else would. e.g. an organic cotton tote bag has a hugely greater environmental impact compared to a single-use plastic shopping bag ([link](https://qz.com/1585027/when-it-comes-to-climate-change-cotton-totes-might-be-worse-than-plastic)). Likewise, plastic packaging of food, e.g. meat, reduces food waste and hence reduces the total environmental impact of food production. 

Most of the criticisms of plastics focus on its disposal. e.g. because it doesn't break down quickly and is hard to recycle it persists 'in the environment' - e.g. causing unsightly garbage patches in the oceans, and killing animals in a particularly horrible way. But the problems plastics cause to the environment are really caused by inadequacies in countries' waste disposal systems, rather than the long-life of plastics. If you live in a first world country and put your plastic straw in a garbage bin after using it, then you can be pretty certain it will go to a landfill or incinerator and not end up washed into a river and hence to the ocean where a dolphin will choke on it. (And we are not going to run out of room for landfills.) Other risks commonly cited seem the product of the moral panic rather than a justifiable cause for it, such as the so far evidence-free claims about the dangers of 'micro-plastics' ([link](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/microplastics-human-body-know-dont-know-rcna23331)).

Of course humanity should try to improve the way we make, use, and dispose of plastics (e.g. researching and improving the safety of different kinds of different chemicals used in them; creating shorter-life plastics; helping poorer countries improve their waste-management systems; etc). But it is a huge mistake to see plastics themselves as an enemy of the environment that we are locked in some kind of moralistic struggle against (like cancer). The war on plastic is a huge political distraction from addressing actually significant environmental challenges, such as climate change. And even if it were achieved, a world with without plastic would be a much worse world than we have now, for both humans and the environment.

My current salary is $68,000 and I live in a rural area in Northern Georgia. While cost of living is low here, I can't help but look up what my pay would had been had I stayed in the military - even if I stay as E5, with my wife and kid, my base pay plus BAH would put me at around the same as my current salary, without the degrees and I am not even counting my qualifiers that would net higher pay. 

Both teachers and military are performing vital public services, so why is pay gap this enormous? Objectively, my job in the Army was far easier - I only need to focus on my mission and manage fewer than 5 personnel who have to complete basic training/AIT, so in a sense, self-selected. Whereas as a teacher, I am responsible for the learning outcome of 30+ young people who often do not want to be here.

I have to complete 6 years of higher education in STEM program to even get started in my teaching career for my current pay track (I would get paid even less if I only have a BS) plus it took me years in teaching before I firmly grasp the craft of education; whereas I enlisted in the Army when I was 17 with just a HS diploma, promoted to E5 after 2 years in services (I joined as E3 due to JROTC, received a waiver for E4 at 18 months TIS, then promoted to E5 in secondary zone), I know that is a bit faster than most, but I didn't really need to have much qualifications for my enlistment and promotions. 

As an E5, I was highly expendable. I get it that recruitment number are low but someone else could have easily done replaced me. Yet, as a math teacher, it is next to impossible for me to be replaced. Our department have been operating with 
 less than 75% faculty due to multiple people leaving within the past few years and we simply failed to attract new hires. As of the past 4 years, I am the only person in my department who is qualified to teach Statistics, all of us are teaching more students, committing more tutoring hours... The point is, the military recruitment shortage isn't due to low pay, but teacher shortage is.

My view is that Americans should commit to paying teachers just as much as paying military service members, after all, one cannot function without another."
1,2023-11-03,CMV: Every country should have mandatory miltiary and/or civic duty,u/macnfly23,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17muapb/cmv_every_country_should_have_mandatory_miltiary/,changemyview,"Before I explain why, I'd just like to mention that this doesn't have to be for a long period of time and could be for a few weeks or a month or two. Also, I mention 'civic duty' as there definitely could be objections to military but by 'civic duty' I mean something like working in social services like hospitals, youth organisations, nursing homes, rescue services, emergency medical services, etc. or similar activites, though the people involved would sleep/reside in a 'boarding school' type facility for the duration of the service.

The first reason for why I think this is because of polarisation and tribalism these days. People tend to just stay with the groups that share their values and are often not really exposed to people from other backgrounds or cultures. Yes, it can be said that this could be done by other means, but what means would really be effective?

A related reason would be that it could potentially reduce radicalization and isolation that often may lead to terrible consequences. One could say that that should be the role of schools but often people drop out and school is just a vastly different environment.

Finally this one is going to be controversial but there's of course the idea of patriotism and doing something for your country, which is definitely present in countries that still have military and/or civic service.

EDIT: There are many objections, mostly to the military aspect so instead I would limit my proposal to civic duty but it has to involve the people involved being in a common environment (i.e. a boarding school style set up) and not just going in for the day like school."
1,2023-11-03,"CMV: Last Generation activists actions, and the negative reactions to that, does not harm their overarching goals",u/yawaworthiness,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17mubt8/cmv_last_generation_activists_actions_and_the/,changemyview,"Whenever I see the Last Generation brought up, aka those people who block car traffic etc, many people act like their negative reactions somehow harm their cause. I simply do not see that. I'm personally rather apathetic towards climate change movements in general, but I do think that with their goals in mind they have a solid strategy. This I cannot say about other climate activism where the goals are similar, but frankly I do not see how they could realistically get what they want.

Why? Because negative reactions do not matter. With their view, the worst thing which could happen is that the earth is damaged a little bit faster. This would suck, but they think that if nothing is done and stuff continues as it is now, the same outcome is inevitable. Thus who cares whether the outcome comes in 50 years or 40 years?

But that is the worst case scenario. I do not however see how that could even happen, because this would require people to either actively go against their financial interests or it would require that climate aware people suddenly stop being climate aware.

Even if people hate the guts of the Last Generation, it is unlikely that they will inflict upon themselves financial harm to be more climate harming, on the grand scale. Sure, there might be some, but some outliers do not matter. Especially considering that people who have the financial means usually are more climate aware in the first place (the reasons are complex but are irrelevant to this discussion though).

Climate aware people who also hate the guts of the Last Generation also won't change their behavior. They do agree with the problem, they do not agree with the solution to solve it.

On the other hand, it creates more awareness. More people ask themselves why are there people willing to get so much hate? If people get more interested, they might remain the same (like me for example) or they might start supporting them be it in policy which could actually influence change or they would join the protests or somehow advocating for them."

But why - outside of nostalgia - would someone say that? 

I believe that with our modern tools, being an artist is easier than ever. You can't sing? There's a tool for that. You can't draw? There's a tool for that? You suck at design? There's a tool for that. 

Accessing resources, especially for someone with deep pockets, is easier than ever. See, *new pop artist X* doesn't need to be able to write songs, play an instrument, be involved in production, put together a show, have an opinion etc. We can get people who can do that or who know how to handle the necessary tools for that. The artist just needs to look pretty and let us do our thing. 

But in doing so, art can become just a product of an algorithm. The starting point is no longer ""I want to express myself"", but ""I want to make money/be famous"". Works of art become works of consumption, hollow imitations of what used to excite us, now just the blueprint for a copy of a copy of a copy. 

To add to that: removing the limitations from an artist will also make their art lackluster over time. Eminem was a fantastic rapper, The Eminem Show is an incredible album. But he hasn't struggled with being a broke kid from run down Detroit in ages. That, in combination with his talent, made him succeed as a rapper. Sure, he struggled with addiction later, but his later albums sounded overproduced and insincere. The message was lost somewhere on the way when it had to pass through too many hands that wanted to get involved because now they were gonna profit from a success, too. 

I'm not saying artists need to struggle to make good art, I'm saying they need to stick to the limited tools they had when they were on their own, in order to remain authentic. But even then, I believe the half life of an artistic career is much shorter than many would like. "

I'm not including any of the shows or newer Disney stuff or any of the books.

The point about them being kids movies is fairly uncontroversial but I'll touch on it briefly. Star Wars was written and filmed in such a way that a child who isn't following the plot or themes very closely can still basically understand what's happening and enjoy the movies. They're visually spectacular and contain themes that are obvious and appropriate for a young audience. They're also funny and a lot of the jokes are aimed at a young audience.

The second point about the series being a mature fantasy epic will take a little more support, I think. The movies were made with layers of meaning that build on each other. There are quite a few themes explored but for brevity I'll focus on what I consider the primary theme which is explored in a mature way. Love.

Anakin's life is a tragedy, and each major event in his life is an exploration of either the destructive or redemptive power of love.

His mother loves him, so she lets him go become a Jedi. Love is a selfless force.

He loves his mother, so he can't detach from the world like the Jedi want. When she's killed he becomes unstable and violent. A once gentle boy becomes a killer. Love is a corrupting force.

He loves Padme, and cannot accept that she might die. Having already been corrupted he is willing to do anything to save her. He is convinced to destroy the Jedi to save her. Love is a destructive force.

Later, it's his son's love which redeems him. Luke love for his father stopped him from killing him, which would have been the logical thing to do. Instead Luke risked his own life on a bet that Anakin wasn't just a monster. That bet paid off, as Anakin destroyed the emperor. Love is a selfless and redeeming force.

I've been brief, but I think you get the idea. The movies take multifaceted views of relatively complex subjects. Beyond this example there are examinations of politics, war, power, trauma, family, and the relationship between people and nature."

It is not total junk science, nor is it an actual valid and meaningful personality tool.",u/VanillaIsActuallyYum,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17n4ff1/cmv_the_mbti_model_is_kind_of_valid_it_is_not/,changemyview,"My stance on MBTI seems to be shared by almost nobody, and thus I seem to be at odds with basically everyone with an opinion on MBTI. Since I don't think it is an entirely valid tool, I piss off anyone who takes it seriously, and since I do give it a bit of credence, I frustrate everyone who dismisses it as a pseudo-science. But I am convinced that my stance on the issue here is correct. This CMV is driven not so much by the belief that my reasoning is flawed but more by the fact that since hardly anyone on planet earth seems to share my opinion on this stuff, I must have missed something.

My official stance is that MBTI is valid *to the extent that it mirrors the Big Five Personality Model.* And it DOES mirror that model significantly. 

MBTI has four dichotomies: introverted / extroverted, intuitive / sensory (are you more focused on big ideas or on literal / practical things), thinking / feeling (do you emphasize logic or feelings more), judgment / perceiving (are you more organized and want things your way or are you more go-with-the-flow). And I guaranTEE that someone out there is going to hate the descriptions I used there and say I defined them wrong, which of course I did, because there's no good way to define them at all and that's a large reason why MBTI fails so hard.

The Big Five personality traits are Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Neuroticism. MBTI does not really have a direct measurement of neuroticism, but otherwise there's some obvious crossover between the models here. Extraversion clearly mirrors the introverted / extroverted dichotomy. Openness to Experience KIND of mirrors intuitive / sensory, but not really, and that's where I think MBTI fails the hardest. Agreeableness essentially measures your emotional maturity in a way and doesn't try to pit it against your use of logic, which is exactly what the thinking / feeling dichotomy tries to do in MBTI theory, which is really stupid and is total nonsense. And Conscientiousness pretty well parallels the judgment / perceiving dichotomy also.

MBTI also has some total bullshit about cognitive functions and says that you use these functions in a totally symmetrical way. I don't need to get into explaining what they are; I've just never found any validity to them in the slightest and have always felt that we can throw that part of the theory in the dumpster where it belongs.

A couple studies to back up my stances here:

Here's a [study of the MBTI model](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/spc3.12434?casa_token=HOX8mujPZX4AAAAA%3AdGx0vH_bPkNiKqxSBU5Kgmtz7Vc0ifriybGnmG8Knf7HSZCWLqjU50fCD2j7uMYH8yo6BeNZdHEkEA) that finds that ""the MBTI theory falters on rigorous theoretical criteria in that it lacks agreement with known facts and data, lacks testability, and possesses internal contradictions"".

Here's a [study of the Big Five model](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-07586-007) that examined a test that utilizes the Big Five model, and the study found that the test ""had consistent and acceptable internal consistencies across five studies"".

So since a few of the dichotomies mirror Big Five, that means it is SOMEWHAT accurate and is NOT total nonsense. But it's also just not nearly as good of a tool. If someone really wants to understand themselves through the use of a personality tool, they should be using the Big Five. If people use the MBTI, I'm okay with the parts of it that align with the Big Five, but the parts of it that don't align, like the use of cognitive functions or this idea that logical people don't have feelings / feelers can't think logically, that they have any sort of balancing effect towards one another, is bullshit, in my opinion.

I’m pro-union, and I understand that right to work laws have reduced Union membership and bargaining power, but I disagree with the idea that it should be mandatory for employees to join or pay dues.

Unions are bureaucratic organizations that exist within capitalism and are therefore as prone to corruption as much as anything else. If someone decides they don’t want to be in a union, or if they would rather keep their wages, let them. 

The problem is that employers have too much power to fight against unions. You won’t fix that by involuntarily garnering people’s wages. It’s wrong to force people to be part of an organization, regardless of how beneficial Orr well-intentioned it may be, and it’ll likely make those involuntary members resentful to the labor movement, which is counterproductive.
 
Don’t give me wrong like I said, I am pro union. As long as we live within capitalism, we really need them. Undoubtedly, right to work has hurt unions, but I struggle to get behind the idea of requiring people to participate in order to make a living. Is there a flaw in this viewpoint?"

It potentially suggests that the #MeToo movement and other feminist causes have been effective in stopping men from seeing women in the workplace as potential romantic options.

But I feel no reason other than selfish ones to care about people more than animals. 

Some people will say we are smarter or more emotionally complex than animals, therefore we have moral value. However, I don't think that gives what we experience any more value than what an animal subjectively experiences. Dumb people have just as much fun as smart people, can live in the moment more at times, and love life just as much. If someone was incapable of feeling nostalgia, it would have very little impact on their life or any moral implication for them. Also, that would mean that more intelligent humans are more valuable than humans who are either unintelligent. 

Another argument would be that because I happen to be a human, I must support and care about other humans. As a conscious entity, or ""soul"", I don't think there is anything different between ""me"" and the ""soul"" that experiences the world as an animal. By choosing to care more about humans, who do so much destruction to animals as a whole, I'm essentially punishing those beings because their consciousness, which is inherently no different from mine, happens to experience reality through the lens of an animal. 

And then there's the social contract of sorts: I would want other humans to care about me and help me if I were in need. I wouldn't want to be neglected or not cared about by other people. But we, as humans, by living, destroy nature and harm animals. The animals don't want their forests slashed down, their habitats polluted, their lives taken, even if this desire isn't actively felt. Why should I value a random human's life and needs when the consequence of that is devaluing animal's life, if neither of them are important in my life?"

There have been several high profile accidents (Chernobyl and fukushima daiichi being the most notable) that did result in some deaths, but in general you are better off living next to a nuclear power plant than a coal one. And the impact on the planet is far lower. Nuclear waste can be safely stored (there has never been a nuclear waste leaking accident in US history).

The people afraid of nuclear power seem to frequently (in my personal life) believe that a nuclear power plant will somehow turn into a nuclear bomb when has an accident (which is physically impossible with the way they are designed).

If the US and the rest of the world had embraced nuclear power in the 70s and 80s the ""climate crisis"" would not exist today or if it did to a far lesser. China and India would have followed suit with nuclear plants.

The current designs for nuclear power plants are far far safer than either Chernobyl or fukushima daiichii (Fukushima was based on a 40 year old design).

1,2023-11-04,CMV: Utilizing more plastic can combat climate change,u/-Sliced-,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17ndps3/cmv_utilizing_more_plastic_can_combat_climate/,changemyview,"I want to preface by emphasizing that my viewpoint is focused exclusively on the impact of plastic on climate change, excluding other environmental concerns.

Here's my rationale - Plastic is derived from petroleum and biological sources. Converting petroleum into plastic changes it into a durable form that persists for millennia before breaking down. This process effectively locks away some of the carbon that would otherwise be released as CO2 if the oil were burned, thereby reducing potential climate change contributors. I'm assuming here that unused oil wouldn't simply remain untapped but would continue to be a source of global CO2 emissions.

Moreover, using oil to produce plastic increases its demand and, subsequently, its price. As oil becomes more expensive, there's a greater incentive to explore alternative energy sources and promote energy conservation, worldwide.

Similarly, bio-plastics capture CO2 through plant growth, which is then transformed into a stable plastic, effectively sequestering atmospheric CO2 in long-term storage.

I also propose that recycling plastic might be less beneficial from a climate perspective since it can lead to increased CO2 emissions compared to simply discarding it in landfills.

While acknowledging the energy/emissions costs associated with producing and transporting plastic, these are comparable to those incurred when oil is used as fuel. Disposing of plastic might carry additional energy costs, but they are likely similar to those for disposing of non-plastic alternatives. Therefore, overall, plastic use seems to result in a net decrease in CO2 emissions.

I am not suggesting that we should use more plastic and avoid recycling it as a general practice. My argument is strictly about considering plastic's role in climate change mitigation.

And if this haplens the jewish popultaion should of course be protected against the antisemitism of Israels neighbours. But heres why im an antizionist:

1. Israel is an ethnostate. I am fundementally opposed to ethnostates and Israel, by ""being a land for the jews"", would always be destined to be an ethnostate. Ethnostates either result from or are the breeding grounds for fascism. Meaning that this whole scenario with Palestine was inevitable.

2. Less to do with Israel as a state and more its location. Israel keeps the middle east divided. Since Israel has a bunch of powerful western allies, such as the USA, and it exists within the middle east, it can keep the middle east divided for the sake of its western allies. One reason for doing this are keeping oil prices in the US low for example. 

3. Israel is fundementally imperialistic. Since it was required for the the Palestinian people to be forcibly removed from their homeland to create Israel, it fundementally has a history of opression and genocide. This would be far less of a problem if Israel wasnt also extremely authoritarian and any mention of this can result in jail time. On top of that, Israel was also created as a tool by western christians to bring ""civilization"" to the ""barbaric"" middle east.

29,2023-11-04,CMV: The amount of international students we are taking into Canada is detrimental to our economy.,u/fingernailchewer,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17nn6l7/cmv_the_amount_of_international_students_we_are/,changemyview,"For the first 6 years of my life, I lived in Winnipeg on a military base where I had also gone to school. In a class of around 25-30, I was one of 5 or so white students. Growing up, I had no real
""perception"" of race, simply because the surroundings I had been put in didn't really allow anyone to be seen as ""different."" Obviously I understood that racial diversity is important, even from a young age, but it just wasn't something I paid attention to-- and quite frankly, still don't. Moving from a very diverse area to a small town in Ontario showed me at a very young age that there are a lot of places that are primarily one group of people. I had gone from having friends of various races and nationalities to only being able to make friends with white kids who were born locally.
Over the course of the last few years (at least in my immediate travelling area,) I have noticed a stark increase in international students from varying countries, with the majority coming from India.
Whatever-- doesn't bother me. Really doesn't. Some of the greatest connections I've formed at work and at school were international students. Largely, I commend them for travelling across the world at a relatively young age, striking on their own to pursue an education and a better life than what home would have provided. I can barely spend a few nights away from home without getting sick let alone starting a whole new life all the way across the world. Just unbelievable.               
In the town that I live in, I'd say probably 55% of the (visible) working population are Indian students. Generally speaking, don't care. Nobody else wants to work, so why should I be mad at the portion of the town that WANTS to work? (sidebar: the town I live in is currently facing a slight addiction/homelessness problem with a huge portion of the area on some form of gov't assistance and generally refusing to work.)
Anyway-- so why do I think that an increased workforce is bad for the economy? Surely, if there is a large portion that does not want to work, unemployment goes up-- if you bring in people that will work, unemployment will go down? More workers = more money circulating = more purchases = more taxes = boost economy. But the thing is... the money isn't necessarily staying in Canada.
See, I'm not sure if this issue is localized to my area or not, so please forgive my strawman argument-- I don't think my town is an anomoly, and is quite an average display of population. So, simply considering the average mindset, I've come to the conclusion below... (please keep in mind this contains actual feedback/information I've recieved from a number of my Indian friends and colleagues, as well as general observations that I've made about working college students in general, as well as rough pricing/financial info applicable to my area.).         
So, you have just arrived in Canada. You get a job, and you start going to school. Move halfway across the world, not super comfortable yet, make friends with people who share a cultural background.            
Awesome, you've now made a solid group of friends. You each get a job-- 2 part time or 1 full time doesn't matter, but you manage to land a job. First year is done, and maybe you're done with living on campus, so you and that solid group of friends move in together and rent a house. You find a 4 bed/2 bath house for $2200 a month (includes utilities - pricing found on FB marketplace and is located in my area so you and your friends move in together, splitting the rent. Assuming the barest minimum of 1 person each room, you end up paying $550/mo for rent-- however this isn't really happening. Much like most other student housing, you often have people sharing rooms or making use of other areas for bedrooms-- and yes, this does happen, I lived in student housing for a while, and one of my coworkers lives in a 3bdrm with like, 5 other people. This effectively makes your rent around $300/person. Adding another $100/mo to contribute to other needs like food and other household expenses like tv/internet is fairly reasonable given cost of living (at least in this area,) as well. Everyone has a phone as well, and with the phone plans the way they are now, looking at around $40-560 (on the low end,) a month. So far, we are at (rounding,) $450/mo expenses. Nobody in this world is living within their means, but students do a pretty good job at it-- so this number is purely speculative-- let's say an extra $200 of ""fun money"" each month.
But, people in this college town bus everywhere (sure, some drive, but our transit system runs to all points of interest, as well as the college,) and our bus pass is $70/mo. Assuming nobody shares this, that's now $720/mo, or $360/pay going towards expenses.
Okay so we've established how much is leaving, but what about coming in? Average hours of work for full time is around 40, so we'll go with that. Minimum wage in Ontario is 16.55/hr, so $2,648/mo (I've never understood how much taxes are taxen off each pay, but I've found it's a totaling 20.05%, so after tax, that leaves us with a hair over $2,200/mo, or $1, 100/biweekly.) After taxes, and expenses, that leaves us with $740/mo.
That's incredible! $740 which can go into savings, or go into the economy through irrational and spontaneous purchases which are generally not needed-- and sometimes that's absolutely the case. But it's not what's happening-- and this is why I'm upset.
So as mentioned, some of my work colleagues are from India-- and both work 40 hours a week. Both incredible people, I've learned so much about their homes and their culture, and they've grown to be fairly close (as far as coworkers can go.) However one of them lives on their own, spends frequently, and cycles the money back into the economy. The other, lives with a group of people-- and each month, sends upwards of around $500 back home (to pay for his parents expenses,) which he has been doing for the last 2 or so years. Around $12,000 gone from our economy, bolstering the economy of another country. But, at the end of the day, who am I to judge? His parents raised him, and sent him to Canada to pursue an education... what do you mean his cousin who lives in Canada paid for his schooling?
So when you consider us the average- - everything that I've described to you, what if I tell you that I've personally been told of houses (of roughly same monthly rent,) containing around 10 students? All of a sudden their expenses go down, and disposable goes up. All of a sudden there are more opportunities for money to be sent overseas to be spent somewhere else.          
      
I welcome my view to be changed— I really and truly do. But when I start do do the math like this, it’s less and less surprising to me why the gov’t wants to slow immigration (primarily student/work visas) down, and go back to a 20 hr cap on student working hours. These people (that was hard to type,) are coming to learn on a student permit, not to work 40 hrs a week and send money home. Please CMV."

It is also completely toxic and manipulative if any partner springs a marriage proposal on their partner without first having discussed the idea of marriage at length. They should know their partner's stance on marriage. If they spring a public proposal on them without knowing where they stand, it has the potential to manipulate the partner into saying ""yes"" just because of the public pressure and expectation that they will say yes.

I hold a large amount of beliefs surrounding libertarianism. Especially the belief that government agencies just aren’t right for us and certain ones need to be destroyed.

The biggest offenders that I think should be destroyed are the ATF, DEA,NSA, CIA.

My reasons for each are as follows:

The ATF has a not so positive history involving killing innocent civilians (ie. Ruby Ridge)

The DEA isn’t needed, we have mass drug problems in our major cities and they don’t do anything about it. If they aren’t going to work to solve our issues then why waste tax money on it.

The NSA spies on us (pretty straight forward reason)

And the CIA has a massive slew of problems all the way from MKUltra to disruption of governments in South America."

So the Karate Kid Part II features Daniel accompanying Mr Miyagi to Okinawa, unravelling his mentor's past, and facing both the highest-stakes and most emotionally charged encounter of the series when he fights Chozen in a genuine fight to the death, completing his understanding of Miyagi-Do karate and laying the ghosts of Miyagi and Sato's old rivalry to rest in the process.

The Karate Kid Part III then returns to California and puts the focus back on the rivalry between Daniel and Cobra Kai, with John Kreese returning as the villain backed up by Terry Silver, a character from his own past. Daniel has a bit of a villain arc and the whole thing ends again with the centerpiece of Daniel's relationship with Miyagi and with the All-Valley karate tournament.

Part III gets a lot of criticism, but I actually think on its own it's not that bad of a movie; it's just a bad direction for the series because it feels tonally like a step back from Part II. If Part III had come as the immediate sequel to the first movie, and then Part II had been the series finale, that would have worked *way* better, with the character relationships, Daniel's growth as a person and fighter and the stakes of the conflict progressing throughout the story in a better fashion. As it is, the series feels a bit disjointed; it would be like if the Harry Potter books had featured Harry beating Voldemort midway through and then gone back to him playing Quidditch and getting in trouble with teachers thereafter.

Anyway, that's my view. CMV."

My understanding is Israel was formed after WW2 to give surviving Jews their own nation. This displaced the Palestinian people and while some do integrate into current Israel, a large number are in Palestine and over several years Israel has treated them badly and displaced them from their homes.

A few months ago Hamas, which my understanding is a terrorist group but is also supported and elected by the majority of Palestinians, launched a cowardly terrorist attack that killed many innocent people.

In response, Israel has acted like the US did after 9/11 and has attacked Palestine relentlessly. 

Since then, I've seen a large population of left leaning and LGBTQ+ people supporting Palestine, as well as rightist nazi 4channers. This confounds me. I expect the nazi 4channer types to support Hamas because they hate jews and Israel, but the other side confuses me.

My understanding is a large amount of palestinians support the terrorist attack, and also a lot of muslims hate LGBTQ+ people and would kill them if they could.

So I don't understand how anyone part of those communities could support people who hate them and would kill them, just because Israel is taking revenge.

I feel like if you do a terrorist attack, you're now in the ""find out"" phase of the ""fuck around and find out"" phase.

Looking for some perspective on why so many leftists support Hamas/Palestine on this. What do they honestly expect Israel to do in response to this attack? If the attack leads to Israel bending the knee, wouldn't that encourage more muslim terrorists to attack Israel? they can't afford to look weak.

I'm open to having my view changed but I do strongly think it's foolish and a case of ""living in an ivory tower"" if you're part of these communities and pledge your support of Palestine/Hamas."

211,2023-11-04,CMV: It's nonsensical for Republicans to oppose Ukraine but support Taiwan.,u/SteadfastEnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17nqvkj/cmv_its_nonsensical_for_republicans_to_oppose/,changemyview,"There are some Republicans who support both Ukraine and Taiwan. There are also some Republicans who oppose both Ukraine and Taiwan. My thread is not about them.

Rather, my thread is about another category of Republican - which, by my guesstimate/observation, is about 60% of the Republican Party right now - **who oppose the United States helping Ukraine fend off Russia, but support helping Taiwan fend off China.** (For what it's worth, I'm Taiwanese-American.)

The situations of Ukraine and Taiwan are highly similar. Both are small democratic nations trying to fend off a much larger aggressor who historically claims them as their own (irredentism.) Both Russia and China are nuclear-armed nations (so there is the remote risk of nuclear war should the U.S. intervene directly or indirectly - one constant criticism by Republicans of the Biden administration is that we're inching closer to nuclear war by helping Ukraine.)  And both situations involve spending American taxpayer dollars on ""foreign wars"" (one criticism of many Republicans is, ""We have so many problems at home, so why are we spending $90 billion on Ukraine?"" - yet acting as if intervention against a Chinese attack on Taiwan wouldn't be spending U.S. taxpayer dollars all the same.) There exists no formal defense treaty between the USA and Taiwan, any more than between the USA and Ukraine (there is the 'Taiwan Relations Act' but that is not a defense treaty.)

If anything, U.S. intervention on Taiwan's behalf would be significantly *costlier* than helping Ukraine. China is a much more powerful aggressor than Russia is, and the economic ties between the U.S. and China are much more interlinked than betwixt the US and Russia (meaning, any sanctions would likely hurt the U.S. economy more.) All the U.S. is doing right now is sending relatively modest amounts of armament to Ukraine - some of it old and slated for retirement anyway - without putting any American lives at risk. That doesn't apply in a Taiwan situation, which may very well directly get U.S. warships, submarines, bombers, etc. involved.

Yet, for whatever inconsistent reason, Republicans insist that Taiwan is worth assisting but Ukraine is not. (Before someone says, ""semiconductor chips,"" Taiwan's chip industry would be toast the moment China attacks, with or without American intervention. And before someone says, ""it's anti-Chinese racism,"" Taiwan is also ethnically Han Chinese, so if the Republicans oppose China because of 'racism,' they'd also be supporting Taiwan which is of the same ethnicity - so the race argument doesn't make sense.) Indeed, Josh Hawley (R-Ark.) was the lone vote in the Senate against allowing Finland and Sweden to join NATO (the Senate voted 95-1 in favor of admission) - he said that letting NATO expand would distract America from its mission of opposing China.

Finally, it should be pointed out that, even as recently as 9 years ago, Republicans were criticizing Obama for not taking a tough enough stance against Russia. And during the Cold War, Republicans were typically the tougher anti-Russia/Soviet side. So it's not like Republicans can't or haven't opposed Russia before - in fact, this recent weird love for Putin and Russia is a very recent development.

In conclusion, the only real logical factor is that right now, Democrats are pro-Ukraine, so it makes sense for Republicans to oppose Ukraine just out of spite. (Remember, these same Republicans were okay with getting involved in costly foreign wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.) "

My place of work has recently been running workshops on ""anti-racism"". I myself have been trying to engage with it as much as I can to try and better myself. 

One aspect that I find difficult is the idea that racism has to have a power inbalance. In my own country (the UK) a white person cannot experience racism as they hold more structural power. They can be *discriminated* against but that is not racism. 

I find this idea difficult for two main reasons:

1. I always thought and was taught growing up that racism is where you disciminate based off of the colour of someones skin. In that definition, a white person can experience racism. The white person may not be harmed as much by it, but it is still discriminating agaist someone based on their race. 
2. In my place of work (a school), we have to often deal with racist incidents. One of the most common so far this year is racist remarks from black students towards asian ones. Is this racism? I can't confidently decide who has the greater power imbalance! 

I promise that this is coming from a place of good faith!

***Where this post is coming from***:

1. *Recently:*   
Revolut, a neo-bank, changed their Brand design for their 10 years anniversary. As I was scrolling through their sub-reddit, I noticed a lot of people complaining virulently about the new Logo. The most upvoted comment of one of them was the following: ""It's beyond me why people would get so upset about a bank's logo.""
2. *Some years ago*:   
After staying in a job for about 6 years, I was doing interviews. In my previous job, I had reached a managing position after starting as a basic junior dev.   
During an interview, I was explaining to the guy that although my previous job was interesting, it was getting me away from what I liked (coding), and that although staying would have gotten me further up the management ladder, it didn't feel right for me to stay there. I added that 6 years was long enough for me to stay in a single company and that I wanted to explore a new product, to start learning again, and just to code more.   
Then his response unsettled me.   
He said: *""I don't buy it. You could have been paid more and gained more responsibility just staying there. This is irrational. You're hiding something.""*  
I paused for a moment as I didn't expect this. I could have doubled down arguing why the decision made sense to me, but somehow this changed my state of mind to ""I never want to work for this guy"". And so instead of trying to convince him, I answered: *""If you think people make rational decisions, you're terribly mistaken. They try to make up rational explanations for their actions when they mostly just act based on their feelings"".*

***Where I'm at now:***

""People *usually* make decisions based on emotions. Thus, decisions are *mostly* irrational""

This is what I believe with what I've been given: The materials I've come across over the years and the interactions I've had with people. Some of the materials I've come across include:

1. ***Ethica, by Baruch Spinoza:*** In this book, Spinoza sets out the thesis that people are naturally *""passive"".* This, he explains, means that what we call ""free will"" is, *at first,* an illusion. People think they decide freely because they are ignorant of the causes that *affects* them and influence their thought process. He explains those causes are translated into emotions that then make people act based upon them. Spinoza's main thesis is that people are *incapable* of being rational *as long as they ignore the causes that affects them*, and that *free will is something that has to be conquered* by learning what our determinisms are. This is the only way to understand why we believe what we believe, and to open our decisions to options that we would naturally not have considered.
2. ***Looking for Spinoza: Joy, Sorrow, and the Feeling Brain, by António Rosa Damásio:*** Antonio D. is a Portuguese-American neuroscientist, currently the Chair in Neuroscience, as well as Professor of Psychology, Philosophy, and Neurology, at the University of Southern California. In this book, he explains how the recent discoveries in Neurosciences and Psychology are giving showing that the thesis Spinoza made in Ethica 400 years ago seems to be true.

Am I necessarily right? Of course not. I could be wrong, and I aware of it. Those elements are not enough to make a definitive statement. There might be more compelling evidences out there that people are mostly rational and that emotions have little effects on decision-making, even if that goes against my belief and my experience of life, and I would just not have stumbled upon these evidences up to now.

***Now, why does this thesis appeal to me?***

1. I *believe* conficts are *mostly* a net loss to society. (And yes, this is a very biased statement based on my very own experience of life and conflicts)
2. I believe conflicts are *mostly* caused by people hanging on to their opinions because they are firmly convinced they cannot be wrong, and that the counterparty is either dishonest or stupid.
3. The belief that you are necessarily right because you're rational makes you impervious to different point of views. It pushes you to adopt a firm stance. And I believe It dumbs you down by preventing you from improving your reasoning.

&#x200B;

To conclude this post, I would say I believe If people would accept their innate flaw in rationality, Society would be less polarized and less violent, and that the world would generally be a better place.

There are many reasons I believe that, which I will list below.

If it was a suit, it was beyond the capability of even hollywood, as we can see what planet of the apes looked like at time in the 1960s. Somehow two men managed to create a suit far beyond even the best practical effects artists. A suit which would had to have moving fingers, add considerable mass to the person wearing it while also being able to show muscle movement exactly as it should occur.

Furthermore they would had to have left anatomically correct tracks which match the film subject meaning that the person in the suit would have had to have being wearing several hundred pounds of additional weight, yet move naturally and smoothly.

Finally, even if somehow they managed to overcome all of the above, there is no way to move where your joints are. Your knee is where you knee is, your elbow where it is etc. Wearing a suit would not alter the positions of your joints, which is what we see in the film subject. They're in a different place than in humans.

I used to believe when i was younger that it must be a man in a suit, but as I've researched it I've changed my opinion."

To own something is to be able to defend it from being taken by another. Newborn animals/humans are not capable of owning anything, including themselves, therefore they are owned by whoever is capable of defending them. Now let's solidify the context of defending oneself to only encompass food/water/shelter. 

Humans require food, water, air and shelter to survive. Once a child is of age that is capable of building shelter and growing crops/raising animals, they are then capable of owning themselves. To do this requires land, shelter building materials/tools and time to raise animals/crops.

In today's society land/shelter/food is only acquired with money. Money is primarily acquired through selling your labor. Until you have enough money to own your own land/shelter/food, you are by definition owned. This is the debt I speak of. We are born into debt and must provide labor until we pay off this debt. Essentially from ages 0-18 we are owned by our parents and until we pay off a mortgage, we are owned by the bank/employer. We cannot choose any other way of living, we are forced into this at birth unless our parents provide us with free shelter of our own, as living with parents is still to be owned by them as it's their home, their rules and can evict you anytime. 

Yes, I know owning a home comes with property tax which can cause eviction if not paid, meaning we are owned by the government, unless you manage to get tax-except. 

In summary, we are born into slavery/indebted servitude, where we are forced to labor for the economy at whatever value the economy determines we are worth until a home is paid off, which is not guaranteed to ever occur within a lifetime. This world is founded upon slavery and progresses upon it. Instead of being assigned a slave owner, we get to choose who owns us as landlords/employers. Those humans of low economic value dont have much choice in employment where as higher value ones can choose employers that treat them well. The only close to free humans on earth are those who own paid off homes and truly free if tax exempt. Change my view reddit."

The sexual liberation of women - which includes the right to vote, receive high level education, work, and use birth control, among other things - inevitably leads to unsustainable birth rates and eventual extinction. In every place where this liberation has occurred we see birth rates decline steadily, with no signs of recovery. 

I'm a huge advocate for freedom for everybody, and I can't personally stomach the idea of taking these things away from women. It does seem to me, however, that these very things are obviously creating an environment in which humanity cannot sustain itself.

1,2023-11-04,CMV: Capitalism is superior for equal/fair pay.,u/Major_Banana3014,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17ntmqn/cmv_capitalism_is_superior_for_equalfair_pay/,changemyview,"CMV: Capitalism is superior for equal/fair pay.

My view is that capitalism achieves equal and fair pay generally better than a more regulated economic system like socialism or communism. 

I see “equal pay” being defined by many people using the metric of *money earned in a given amount of time*. Common examples are things like dollars per hour, salary in a year, etc. However, this is a completely arbitrary and even faulty metric to determine equal pay.

A superior metric to determine equal pay is *money earned for the value provided.* Lets look at an example:

Two employees are payed at the same hourly rate. But one employee accomplishes his tasks at ten times the speed as the other, at the same quality.

Are they being paid the same? According to the money/time metric, they are. However, according to the money/value metric, they are not. The harder worker in fact is making *one tenth* the amount of money for the value he provides.

The difficulty, of course, is how to measure the value of one task compared to another. How do you determine how valuable, say, landscaping is compared to business administration? 

*Capitalism does this naturally.* Capitalism will allow the business that produces 10x the value in a given amount of time, to also earn 10x the money in the given amount of time. Value can only be determined by the market, *or what people are willing to give for it*. 

Most or any attempt to redistribute this wealth is inherently unequal.

I should note that my view is NOT:

That capitalism is a perfect system.

That there is zero inequality or unfairness in capitalism.

That capitalism is only capitalism with a 100% unregulated economy. 

I want to know if there are any flaws in my logic, or if there are any axioms I am taking for granted which are not self evident."
1,2023-11-04,CMV: Pharmaceutical companies are justified in making enormous profits.,u/Storm_Duck,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17ntpnc/cmv_pharmaceutical_companies_are_justified_in/,changemyview,"If pharma industry profits were more heavily regulated (e.g. through drug price caps), there would be lower incentives to develop new drugs and technologies. If any industry should command massive profits, it’s one that benefits society to this extent.

Common counter-argument 1: “No industry should make that much profit.” I’m not talking about changing the system. I’m saying if we are going to tolerate ANY industry making large profits, it should be pharma. This argument may apply to other industries, but I can’t think of any that attract as much criticism and have as great a benefit to society.

Common counter-argument 2: “Pharma companies price-gouge sick people.” I don’t condone this practice. But if drug prices were more heavily regulated, we would need another way to make the industry as competitive as it is. Again, my argument is just that pharma companies deserve to command as much profit as they do relative to other industries that have less benefit to society. It’s a question of incentives.

Common counter-argument 3: “We could significantly lower pharma industry profits and they would still be competitive enough to incentivize R&D at the same pace they do now.” This does not seem possible to know for sure, and do we want to find out?

Common counter-argument 4: “You must work in pharma or an adjacent industry!” I don’t, but even if I did, this is not a refutation of my point."

I have over 1000 hours in the game (unfortunately) and recently loaded it up again, as they have brought back the original map.

In my experience 75% of fights are luck based or at least they unfold in ways that make it very difficult to survive an encounter.

My theory is that pros are so quick they can mitigate these unfair mechanics. So while their skill the ceiling is so high that it is unreasonable to think the average player can play like that.

Examples of things that make me believe this.

1) Epic doesn't 'tighten' the build radius. I play on controller usually and 50% time I place a build it is all over the place. Conveniently the bloom always seems to hit me through the cracks.

2) My character always seems to hit things in game and fall off of builds yet in practice that never happens. I blame it on server issues but it honestly seems suspicious.

3) You can aim directly at an opponent and they will take no damage. You can be shooting them for several seconds. Then they will shot and fell all health instantly.

4) Gimmick items that allow people to propel to you instantly and shoot you. When I build to block they some how end up getting through every time. 

5) Times I have switched to shotgun and notice I still have a machine gun or something. Epic could have implemented a different way to select weapons years ago now. It's like they want to keep the 'chance' that your inputs don't register in game so you can get into a shotgun fight with the wrong gun.

Lastly I will say I strongly do not think this is a skill issue. I can only point to my hours in game and I have made 'champs' in two different season. I never played competitively. There are other things like which loot you get, I think they may favor different players to encourage purchases, battle pass etc. "

I don't know why this is even allowed, why land and buildings are allowed to just sit completely empty and unused when we're in the middle of a severe land/housing crisis and prices for land are so ridiculous. We have so much land, but you can't actually do anything with it because someone arbitrarily owns it and refuses to actually do anything with it. Freeing up ""unused land"" would be a titanic boon to economies and would pave the way for plenty of new housing, businesses, and more. If every abandoned property rotting underneath an investment firm sitting on it suddenly got auctioned off at fair prices, it would go a long way.

I definitely think you should be able to own land, but I don't think you should be able to own land that you don't have any plans to actually use, you're just wasting the most valuable and scare resource on earth.  That goes for the government too, while they should maintain control of ""free land"", it should be available with people with plans to use it for something, provided it doesn't result in severe harm to the environment (for example, if someone wants to build a cabin in the woods, they should be allowed to)."

Imagine that Hitler and the Nazis were choosing mulsims instead of Jews as their target of ethnic cleansing. Imagine arab muslim immigrating to Israel seeking  safety. Would there have been war in the middle east. Probably not. The war happened because the survivors of the holocaust were jews. But let's pretend  that there was a war. Would the world care? Definitely not. After all no one in the intenational media cared when over 300,000 civilians died in Yemen. The world doesn't care when the perpetrator are arabs.

2) The current conflict have a pure villain, Hamas. Hamas dug tunnels for their soldiers, but not for their civilians. They built their shelters underneath hospitals and schools. They hide in neighborhoods and ride in ambulances. They infiltrated Israel, and committed crimes against humanity. They beheaded children and burned children a live. Then they stole children and hid them in tunnels. This attack was not conducted to eliminate Israel. It was to piss Israel off. They wanted Israel to attack Gaza and kill civilians. They knew that it will put Israel in a no win situation - if Israel don't react, Hamas gets public admiration in Gaza, which will encourage them to do it again. If Israel react, civilians will die, and the world will hate Israel. Yet, when I'm looking at demonstrations against the war, I don't see any signs saying free palestine from Hamas. It is always free palestine from Israel. As if the entire world is playing to the Hamas song and dance (and thus support them).

3) Israel left Gaza in 2005 with the hope that it will become a peaceful nation. The plan was that if there will be peace with Gaza, similar separation can happen in the west bank. Instead, Gaza is sending Israel an average of 3 missiles a day. As a response Israel closed Gaza's borders. Israel is repeatedly described as keeping Gaza as an open air prison. But Israel offered Hamas on numerous occasions full control over their borders in return for peace (or at least stop trying to murder jews). In what other prison, the prisoners offer the inmates freedom in return to not attacking the guards. Time after time after time, Hamas responded to these offers with missiles and attacks on Israel. Yet, the international media treats Israel as the one not wanting peace.

4) The occupation of Gaza and the west bank. Repeatedly, Israel is treated as if it conquered the land. The land was given to Israel by the British. Primarily because the Jews were the victims of their enemies, the Nazis, and the palestinians sided with the Nazis. Even with that, the british offered 2 states, one for muslim and one for jews, and the palestinians refused the offer. Then it was the palestinians (and 5 arab nations) that attacked the jews, which resulted with them losing the land. It seems that in every step in the story, the palestinian were the aggressors. They missed every opportunity for peace that was given to them. So, clearly there was no conquest. The jews were just holocaust survivors who lost their homes and families, and were adamant at surviving at all costs, fought against nazi supporters, and surprisngingly won. Was the jewish crime was that they won the war?"

Representative nation-states are pretty much exclusively the form of government seen throughout the world.

Our government can go to war right now while a majority of the population is negatively impacted by it and is not in support of it. 

Governments use their constituents as pawns . Violence is apart of this barbaric planet we live on but a group of people in suits sitting in a conference room can send thousands 20 somethings with nothing to do with the conflict to their death. They can bomb and provoke others into bombing their own or other nations civilians. They have unimaginable le power and control throughout the planet and most people have no clue the extent to which these governments are operating. 

It makes zero sense to me that millions of people allow a few people who likely just have their own interests in mind to make decisions that impact humanity to this extent. The pentagon is currently working on some bomb that is multiple times stronger than a nuke.. who tf voted on this? In what world would a population support such an idiotic waste of resources?

Everyone I know who has taken shrooms agrees: there is a connection between shroom and trees. I haven't actually heard anyone who has taken shrooms dispute that. However, I've known many people try to explain that connection. It usually has something to do with nature and everything on the earth being connected. Some try to compare it to an information network, like in avatar or the sequel to enders game. But I just think there is no explanation - that it is literally unexplainable.

The exception is special elections if someone dies or retires while in office. But other than that there should be zero elections between November of a presidential election and November of a midterm election. This includes municipal elections, referendums, or governor or legislative races (looking at you, Virginia, New Jersey, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Mississippi).

These sorts of elections are basically guaranteed to have low turnout. A lot of people don't even hear about them, and even those that do often don't discover them until after they've happened. This means the results will inevitably skew towards the preferences of a small minority of highly engaged voters. This isn't desirable if your goal is to adequately represent the preferences of the whole voting population. 

You could argue that mandatory voting would fix this, and I'm not opposed to mandatory voting, but there are way too many separate elections in the United States. The [2023 Dallas mayoral election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Dallas_mayoral_election) was held on a random date in May and had *7%* turnout. Only 7% of eligible voters decided who would lead one of the nation's largest cities. This could be fixed so easily if Dallas simply held its mayoral race at the same time as the midterm or presidential elections (and honestly, preferably the latter). Instead, 7% get to decide for everyone because of the absurd scheduling of the election."

I’ve already made CMV on that in the past and don’t want to discuss that here. This CMV is about the goal of the campaign itself.

 I am of the view that this campaign is best described as a terror campaign. For reference, the definition of terror bombing I am using is: 

> Terror bombing: An air mission whose purpose is to destroy the enemy's morale and, consequently, provoke its surrender, through an intense and unexpected attack against a target of great symbolic or non/minimal military value.

And in this regards I think the atomic bombing clearly falls into that category. Leslie Groves, head of the atomic program, would describe the initial stages of the targeting process; stating:

>  “**I had set as the governing factor that the targets chosen should be places the bombing of which would most adversely affect the will of the Japanese people to continue the war.**

For the sake of transparity, he does go on to say: 

> “ Beyond that, they should be military in nature, consisting either of important headquarters or troop concentrations, or centers of production of military equipment and supplies. To enable us to assess accurately the effects of the bomb, the targets should not have been previously damaged by air raids. It was also desirable that the first target be of such size that the damage would be confined within it, so that we could more definitely determine the power of the bomb.” 

Clearly though, by his own admission, morale was the main goal. And this is confirmed in planning documents as well as documents after the bombing. I have a post where I go into a lot of detail so if you are interested check it out. Suffice to say, I am of the opinion this was a terror bombing expressly with the goal of harming morale and am interested if anyone can change my view. 

Listing military assets in the cities won’t CMV unless you can demonstrate with sources (preferably contemporary) that they were a factor in aiming/targeting. Listing target descriptions from the targeting meetings won’t CMV in that regard. I already know about the 2nd General Army HQ and the POE. I will give a delta to ANYONE who can show me that the planners even knew of the 2nd General Army HQ."

Given how society has come to accept mental health's importance as being tantamount or equivalent in magnitude of importance to physical health, as well as the equivalence of mental illness with other physical illnesses, it makes no sense that if you die of a physical illness it should be rewarded whereas if you die of a mental illness it is punished by society.

There is, of course, the argument that paying the death benefit for individuals who take their own lives would incentivize perverse behaviors, or abuses of the system, tantamount to enabling insurance fraud. But I would argue that seeing as how the very action quite literally terminates your ability to exist, that total cessation of all consciousness and any future in this world being calculated as worthwhile for something like a death benefit should raise alarm bells not for the possible fraud, but for the fraud being enacted on behalf of the insurance companies. After all, if the society we have created is so completely devoid of value to exist within, and has made life so unbearably intolerable for specific individuals, it is a slap in the face to deny them any benefit for the misery they have endured. How can you insure one's life, and then refuse to pay out any amount for one of the leading causes of death? 

Furthermore, life insurance that does not pay out for suicide can be considered disgusting and perversely incentivized in its own manner. For example, under the present system, insurance companies will oftentimes be caught manipulating evidence or the system in order to ""prove"" that a deceased individual played some level of willingness in their own demise in order to avoid paying the benefit. Your husband or your father died in a tragic workplace accident? What if we just randomly cherrypicked conversations, or conjured up testimony from coworkers that he ""wasn't feeling too well"", and used that as evidence to submit that they threw themselves into that piece of machinery? Self-inflicted, purposeful, and case closed; your bereaved widowed family is now income-less and that life insurance was worth nothing. 

A society that does not make life worth living should not have companies that exist solely to insure against death, refusing to do so when said death is caused by society. There is no consistent or morally justifiable stance against this practice in the face of societal expectations for reality, or at least that is what I think."

To persuade not only through sound logic and evidence but also through self assurance. However, I don't think that this time in history calls for it for this particular malady of society

Cooperation and competition: the carrot and the stick. Both strategies are integral to advancing our will and advancing as a society. Unless you're actually trying to wipe out a group of people, the only way to move forward is together. And that means telling each other whats going wrong. Certainly we have been doing so with some things, but not with one thing that is fundamental

Some people think that anything they have to say is a positive addition to a conversation. That is not true. Some things are dangerous to be said. But that thought is part of a larger attitude that knows no sense of self reflection. It manifests as overconfidence and as victimization over the slightest ridicule. It comes from privilege. But again, privilege has its time in the spotlight

Willful ignorance does not though. Those people played the refs well enough in earlier decades, so we didn't risk alienating them by telling them that not every opinion they have is valid. That's what many dishonest manipulative forces have done recently: taken advantage by kissing the asses of anyone with fringe or conspiracy theories. And it has been having a world of consequences, but that's a rabbit hole that doesn't need to be addressed at the moment

I'm not talking about people who clearly understand they don't have the full picture. That's just good faith. And accidents do happen. People misunderstand something, or don't come across some information or another. What I'm talking about is not an accident. People are deliberately staying away from accurate information because it feels better, and they're acting authoritative anyway

You might ask how a person could be lying if they believe what they are saying. And I'll ask, why isn't it lying if the consequences are exactly the same, and the person misrepresented themselves as someone who knows? Not knowing the law is not a legal defense. So why is spreading a lie better than creating the lie in the first place. Arguably it is more dangerous because hearsay cannot be challenged

People should be responsible for what they say. And they should be held responsible for what they say. We've crossed passed the point when there was enough doubt to give people the benefit of it. People need to be told that it is unacceptable to present their feelings as facts, no matter how much other people are kissing their asses

It's not nearly as important that they know they're wrong as much as it is that they didn't do the work. And not doing the work is an act of dishonesty

Two points here that are subjective and deserve criticism: first that it is dishonest, and second that it is deserving of ridicule"

14th Amendment states that no person who has:  
(a) engaged in insurrection, or  
(b) - rebellion against the United States, or  
(c) - given aid or comfort to its enemies,  
shall hold any office under the United States.  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
  
CMV:  
I believe that efforts to remove Trump from ballots in some states, based on 14th Amendment challenges to his eligibility, could backfire by generating additional support  support in 2024.   
  
Here's my reasoning:  
  
First.  
\- According to Pew Research Center, less politically engaged voters called ""stressed sideliners"" make up 15% of American adults, but due to their low turnout rate in 2020, they only made up 10% of 2020 voters. They're labeled “stressed” because they are more likely to  describe their personal financial situation as no better than fair. And they're labeled ""sideliners"" because they tend to feel disconnected from the political system and the two major parties. These descriptors underscore voters' discontentment, generally, as well as serioius displeasure with the country, specifically. The effort remove Trump from ballots could alienate and antagonize these voters, because they may see it as an attempt to silence their voice. These voters may value the principle of letting the people decide who should be their president, and may resent any interference or manipulation by the courts or the politicians. They may also distrust the legal arguments for applying the 14th Amendment to Trump, and may suspect ulterior motives or partisan bias behind the challenge. They may feel that the efforts are a politically-motivated attempts (as opposed to the motivations of criminal prosecutors) to foreclose the option to choose for themselves, potentially antagonizing many voters who, rightfully or wrongfully, may see it as an attempt to silence their voice. The effort could also backfire and provoke a backlash from Trump and his supporters, who may challenge or resist the decision in the federal courts or in other ways, and who may use it as a rallying cry and a propaganda tool to mobilize and energize these voters who, otherwise, wouldn't be. The efforts could make Trump look, from the perspective of disillusioned voters, like a underdog who are easier to relate to and root for.  
  
Second.  
These 14th Amendment challenges could distract from or overshadow the more legally tested criminal cases against Trump, which are based on established laws and precedents, and which have more clear and direct consequences for his actions and conduct.  For instance, the 1th Amendment doesn't define what constitutes insurrection, rebellion, or aid or comfort. Thus the Amendment challenges stack dimensions to the saga of legal battles that news media must allocate finite coverage towards. This could divert the public's attention away from more straight-forward cases, as the newer cases spark separate debates about the meaning & scope of the amendment.  
  
I am open to changing my view if you can provide me with convincing arguments that 14th amendment challenge poses risk to Trump's presidential prospects that isn't already surpassed by the threat that the crimincal cases pose without downsides.   
....as well as convincing arguments that there's a realistic chance that any successful cases can be replicated in the states most tipping-point states (GA > AZ > WI > PA > NC > NV) (e.g., whether the party ID of a state's leadership would have an impact on the threat Trump faces).

With that being said, suicide is for most people a very reasonable thing to do and I think preventing people from taking that right is straight up inhumane and unethical.

Let me explain, no one chose to be born, existance and reality itself is a nightmare if you think about it. I think we as humans evolved too much to a point where we can question who we are and what everything is, something we cant comprehend. No one chose this, no one actively wanted this, yet it happened. So if I dont consent to being born into this existential nightmare then why do I have to ask for other peoples consent to end it? How is it the laws buisness, my families buisness or anyones buisness to end my life? I am an adult, not pregnant and have no kids to look out for. In other words I dont owe anyone anything.

Secondly, the world is awful. Climate change will kill millions if not billions of people in the next decades and the chance for another world war aren't too small either. People eat meat and other animal products despite them being completely unethical and awful for the environment. We are boned, there is no hope, lets stop pretending, it is already pretty bad only that we first world people havent noticed the effects quite as much yet. So why not just end it and not deal with the consequences of other peoples mistakes?

And lastly, being alive just kinda sucks in general. I am not saying there arent things to enjoy, there certainly are, but in the grand scheme of things everyone is out for themselfs. Life is so full of problems, our goverment makes awful decisions for temporary profit and most probable your dreams wont come true, even if you work hard for them. Now, some people might find happiness but some people (like myself) are royally soically awkward, degenerate and not very intelligent or charming. Being alive is just a chore for most people.

So in conclusion, how is suicide not the best solution? I wasn't asked to be here, the future is absolutely grim and awful with no hope, the current is at best boring and at worst a living nightmare full of meaningless tasks, depression, panic attacks and restless nights and no one really cares about anyone beyond a surfacelevel. Suicide is completely reasonable."

I mean, a few cents for anything edible sounds crazy to me (I'm talking about dollar stores, something non-existent in Brazil). I'm from Brazil, basically nothing that isn't low quality costs less than 7-10 bucks here (heck, even the extremely low quality stuff that would be in a dollar store costs 3 bucks here), and seeing people from the US that are getting paid in dollars complaining about a 10 dollar Starbucks drink is insane.

Of course it's not like 10 bucks for a drink is cheeeeap, but saying it's expensive when it barely takes anything out your wallet just doesn't sound quite right, even more considering what goes into a frappuccino (which is usually what costs 10 dollars there, maybe even cheaper).

Most food chains (McDonald's, BK, Starbucks etc.) here are crazy expensive, I'm talking almost R$40 for basically anything that isn't some meat and cheese on a bun... Seeing people in the us paying basically change money for this kinds of things is shocking to me.

Sure, maybe it isn't good that fast food is so cheap in the US, but it's not like healthy food is THAT expensive there either. I'd kill to 3 bucks for a kg of seedless grapes, A SINGLE PACKAGE of those babies are almost 20 bucks in my local market. Although in general this is a point that I agree the US kinda lacks in general, since fruit and other healthy stuff in the us is basically the same price you'd have to pay in Brazil (i.e, $5 for a kg of oranges, R$5 for a kg of oranges. The difference being that if you come to Brazil to pay in dollars you'd actually pay $1 for a kg of oranges but that's not relevant in this case.)

This may sound like a ""oh the US doesn't know how hard others have it"" kind of rant, but I genuinely want to know if there's something more behind people thinking 5-15 bucks for elaborate and high quality stuff is overpriced.

You can get months worth of groceries+junk with $100 in the US for what I've seen, I don't get how that's something to complain about. It might be because of how I'm so used to the outrageous prices here in Brazil that seeing the people complain about the significantly lower prices of things in the us is absolutely unracional.

When I hear someone saying $2.99 for a subscription is expensive I can only think ""are you serious? That's so ungodly cheap"", cause I'm sure absolutely no subscriptions in Brazil for ANYTHING costs R$2.99, best you can go is a R$10 sub that does barely anything.

Also, I think it's important to note that this opinion is based on my personal experience only, as I know someone from somewhere else might complain about me complaining about having to pay 40 bucks on a Starbucks drink etc."
53,2023-11-05,"cmv: The ""Neurodivergent"" movement is stupid, and actively harmful to many of the conditions it subsumes under its umbrella.",u/Xenon009,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17o9gbg/cmv_the_neurodivergent_movement_is_stupid_and/,changemyview,"I'm sure the neurodivergent movement is great for autistic people. Unfortunately, autism rights couldn't just stop at being autism rights, and instead decided to include absolutely every neurological condition in the book, and I think that's actively harmful to, well frankly every condition other than the autistic flavour.

To preface, I suffer with Dyspraxia, Sometimes known as DCD. It is covered, by name, under the Neurodivergent umbrella.

What Dyspraxia is, is essentially a form of developmental brain damage that makes co-ordination somewhere between difficult to impossible, the worst cases are unable to co-ordinate walking. Mine personally is vaguely midrange. Handwriting is basically illegible, using cutlery is relatively tricky, and driving a manual transmission car is out of the question, but I'm still able to move around unaided, can vaguely play sports at an incredibly low level, and can drive an automatic car.

What Dyspraxia doesn't do, is change the way you fundamentally think, like autism does. That means that the two conditons have *very* different needs.

For example, when I was in school doing my exams, I was often offered quiet rooms and extra time. But to me, both of those things are useless. I Don't need time to reprocess things into a way that makes sense, and i *Certainly* dont need a blank, quiet room. What I would have deeply appreciated was the ability to dictate my exams, or at least type the damned things. Eventually, after a lot of back and forward with the school, I ended up typing my exams and got to use a computer in class, but being lumped under this banner of ""neurodivergent"" or whatever actively made it *harder* for me to get the help I needed. And I can't see how such an umbrella term for conditions that, while potentially comorbid with one another, are completely different in needs is even remotely helpful. I've seen the same manifest for my brothers, one dyslexic, one with tourertes. Both a named member of the neurodivergent umbrella, both with entirely different needs from an autistic person.

Perhaps a pet peeve of mine as well, is how wr are portrayed as having superpowers in the areas that aren't affected by our conditions. I know for Dyspraxia they claim we are expert communicatiors, but the simple truth is, thats just the part thats not broken.

And finally, the thing that angers me more than anything is the pushback against medical research into treating, or perhaps even curing these conditions.

I understand for the autistic, who's brains are wired in completely different ways, I can see that becoming a defining trait.

But I, and most of the people under the umbrella, don't have a different wiring of the brain, something is just broken, and I know from my experience, most people with these non autistic conditions would litterally kill to make them go away. Because we are not neurodivergent superheros, we are ordinary people with something broken, that if at all possible would be lovely to fix.

Or at least, thats how I feel. A lot of people seem to think its a great thing, so maybe I'm just missing a trick. I'd love to hear what people make of it, have a good one all!"

Judge men for their height, something you can’t change 

Judge men for their race

Judge men for their money, accent and other superficial features. They judge men for not being “man enough”. A female friend flat out told me she likes it when guys are dicks to her. And then they complain that they feel unsafe around men?

1297,2023-11-05,"CMV: There is no ""good side"" in the Israel - Palestine Conflict",u/Schmurby,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17o9tyn/cmv_there_is_no_good_side_in_the_israel_palestine/,changemyview,"I just want to say at the outset that I am talking about the political leadership of both sides.  I have nothing but sympathy for the civilian victims of this conflict and any other war for that matter.  I also want to say that I understand that wars are inherently evil undertakings but there are times where there is a clear aggressor and a clear victim.  I would count the current conflict in Ukraine among those.  

I was born in the Russian-speaking Eastern portion of Ukraine in 1980 and I am still in touch with many relatives over there.  I know people who have gone all in for Putin and his narrative of “Nazism” in Ukraine (I also have relatives who moved to Israel in the 1990s, they have excommunicated me for my opposition to Israeli militarism).  People who support Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are among the most gullible and least intellectually curious people on the face of the earth.  Russia is clearly the bad guy.     

With that out of the way, to me there is no clear “good side” in the entire Israel-Palestine conflict. Why do I say so?

Let’s start with Israel.  Displacing an indigenous population with settlers is a real 17th century move.  What the fuck did you expect when you opened up a “safe haven” for Jewish people in the Middle East?  And your claim that the Bible gives this venture legitimacy to some ""promised land for Jews"" is just laughable.  The Bible also says that a guy put two of every species of a wooden boat, the Bible says that a lady turned into a pillar of salt.  I don’t think that the Bible is a valid document for making political claims. 

 After forcibly removing the local Palestinian population the Israelis settlers forced them into smaller and smaller reservations, essentially mirroring what white settlers did to native populations in North America.  Is it any surprise that people are pissed off, that this has resulted in a lot of violence and death?  Could there have been any other outcome?  Maybe they should have tried what South Africa did in the 1990s, instead of doubling down on apartheid and oppression.  

As for the Palestinian leadership, I am certainly sympathetic to their cause, but their approach is just disgusting without fail.   Going back to the 1970s as far as I know, they have been consistently targeting innocents: [athletes in the 1972 Munich Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_massa), [1990s suicide bombings of buses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Palestinian_suicide_attacks), and now [this sickening attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hamas_attack_on_Israel) that happened a couple of weeks ago. 

A lot of my left-leaning friends will say, “how can we tell an oppressed people how they should resist oppression?”, to which I say, “we can’t, but we sure as shit don’t have to support this!”  And, of course, look at Gandhi and Martin Luther King!  These guys were able to take on far more powerful and wealthier opponents because they refused to meet violence with violence and were able to expose the inherently brutal nature of racism and colonialism for the world to see. 

And at the end of the day, it is a popularity contest.  Palestine has a cause that any rational person would see as just but when they commit terrible acts against innocent people, it’s easy to lose sight of that.  Especially if you are courting the favor of fickle and easily distracted American voters.  Which is something they ought to be doing.  Whether it should be this way or not, it would be extremely beneficial to their struggle if there were popular demand in Western societies to support a free Palestine.  

But violence is not only ugly, it also does not work.  Can you imagine if Gandhi or MLK had taken beheaded hostages or kidnapped athletes or bombed a crowded bus, the retribution taken upon their followers and the populations they claimed to represent would have been swift and terrible.

Just as we are seeing in Gaza now.  This does not make it OK, of course, but it was absolutely to be expected.  If the Israelis have proven one thing to be true since 1947, it’s that they are pretty tough in a fight.  So, I think that we can say that violence should be a non-starter for any Palestinian leader and I’m going to say, I have absolutely zero sympathy for any of their leadership that undertakes attacks on Israeli civilians. 

  
Can anyone change my view?  Am I wrong to not be able to see one of these sides as better than the other?

1,2023-11-05,CMV:Traditional courtship norms are hypocritical under a feminist viewpoint,u/JacketComfortable642,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17oab2a/cmvtraditional_courtship_norms_are_hypocritical/,changemyview,"Under traditional courtship norms, it is common that males are the pursuers, and females are the pursued. At least from my experience from a male, this is a dominant and commonly accepted reality: if you are a Man, you are expected to pursue a woman if you want to court one, otherwise you are in for tough luck.

I believe this norm is the source of the epidemic of ""male loneliness"" with no equal counterpart for women, women generally getting more attention from men. Therefore, I argue that men are not equal to women in this context since women recieve more attention from men, thus having more opportunities to be courted, while a man will typically recieve no attention unless he himself pursues. Though both genders have the capability to initiate, the inequality comes from a ""no action"" scenario, where if done nothing, a woman will still likely recieve advances while a man will not. A reticent man who still desires a relationship would be pressured to take this first step, when the same could not be said for a woman in the same circumstance.

If feminism is concerned with gender equality under the context of social equality, then a feminist should argue that courtship norms should be equal then, since it is currently unequally in the favor of the pursued, who recieves more attention and opportunities to be courted?"

Let’s start off with acting.  
Acting: There is nothing wrong with the acting. Specifically the main cast, because that’s what most critics didn’t like. Matt Smith‘s performance was amazing, a lot of people loved it and called him “too good for Morbius”, so I‘m not going to elaborate on him since so many people love him. No, I’m going to focus on Jared Leto’s performance, because people have a problem with him. Yes, it is creepy how Jared Leto acts like a cult leader. But he only does it with his fans, fans who already are a cult. Think of it like subreddits, where there is a clear cult, and sometimes, the person the cult is following is one of the mods. But what about his performance? Well, even though his part in Suicide Squad kinda sucked, I saw no problem with his acting as disabled scientist Morbius, nor as vampire scientist Morbius. Compared to Marvel, I’d say the acting is equal.  
CGI: Alright, Morbius’ CGI doesn’t really look that good, it kinda looks like a 3D animated movie at times, but it is not THAT bad, especially compared to Marvel movies. If I was comparing Morbius to something like Avatar or Pirates of the Caribbean, then CGI would definitely have gone to the latter, but I’m not doing that. I am comparing Morbius’ CGI to Marvel, and when you compare them, there’s not much of a difference.  
Writing: The component that people attack the most, and I could easily see why. Morbius ends off in a confusing note. But notice how I said ”end off”. Throughout the rest of the movie, I was able to easily understand what was going on. Everything established ended up being used, such as the scene in the beginning where Morbius receives a reward for his work on artificial blood, which gets used later in the movie when Morbius tried to delay the inevitable need for blood. In fact, the story was so clear, I‘d say it is better than most other Marvel movies these days. All the multiverse stuff makes it less clear and less personal. It makes the comic world so big, a little too big than what is healthy. If a city ever gets destroyed in the recent Marvel movies, it’s hard to care about it because the world is so big that it doesn’t really matter. In Morbius, we get to know all these different characters in this small world, and when Milo starts killing them off, it feels more deep. The writers of Morbius managed to put off the multiverse crap for as long as they could, until the post credit scene. But the post credit scene isn’t as confusing as you think it is. All the supervillains in their own universe was being handled by another superhero, so the Vulture needs to find supervillains to fight Spider-Man from elsewhere. He goes to Morbius’ universe, where we know Venom, Kraven, and the others reside too. We see the Vulture hire Morbius, but it’s safe to assume he hired the others too, until he has enough to form the Sinister Six. So yeah, the scripting is not that bad and confusing.  
Yeah, I think that is enough on my end. Now I want to hear your end."

Not having sufficient money can range from a minor inconvenience to the most stressful thing in the world depending on the situation. Sure people with money still have other problems that can put them in a unpleasant mood but atleast it isnt money problems.  
  
2. They've been single and haven't gotten laid in too long, too many lonely nights jerking off. Its been one too many years in a row without you getting it in and getting it wet. This wont drive everyone into ""incel"" territory, but it sure isnt fun or a good feeling either.  
  
3. They aren't fit in good physical shape with a fresh haircut. This makes them feel not their best self makes them feel ugly and inadequate in the eyes of both men and women even family. Which in turn makes them feel insecure and not enough. Even if you dont fix the first 2 points fixing this one will instantly make you feel better about yourself and more confident, even if only temporarily for as long as you maintain it.  
  
If most men that claimed to be depressed were to suddenly fix one or all of these things then they would Instantly become happy. Most men who are stuck in a cycle of feeling so bad for themselves, that they dont do anything to try to change whats making them feel bad about themselves, which leads to them just continuing to feel bad for themselves. They claim to be depressed, but in reality they are just not satisfied with they way things are and have the capability to be as happy as anyone else if circumstances changed. The actual medical diagnosis of depression is much different, what most men claim to be depression is just sadness."
129,2023-11-05,CMV: There is little reason to believe that housing values will drop in the foreseeable future in the US,u/Money_Whisperer,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17oc5s0/cmv_there_is_little_reason_to_believe_that/,changemyview,"I believe that the following 3 forces will prevent US housing from dropping substantively in the foreseeable future-

1. **Our population continues to rise**. Yes, birth rates are below replacement level in the US, but we are propping up population growth with immigration, and our politicians will fill the boats with as many immigrants as they possibly can before letting our economy go through what Japan is going through. A perfect example is Canada, which is taking in 1 million new immigrants a year, despite having average home prices of $716,000 CAD, and only building a fraction of the needed new housing for them. In other words, Canada is completely comfortable with creating and aggravating their housing crisis, so long as it means their economy remains strong. And the US cares about its economy even more than Canada does.
2. **We are barely building any new housing.** Whether it be overly restrictive zoning laws, nimbys shutting down new housing developments in their neighborhoods, builders heavily incentivized to stick to luxury homes, etc., the fact is that we are building a fraction of the homes needed to meet our population growth, which again, will be forced upon us whether birth rates go up or not.
3. The federal reserve is **unable to effectively avoid this**. They have raised interest rates such that mortgage rates are now at 8%, vs 3% less than 2 years ago. This has only frozen home prices, not caused a substantial drop, because sellers a. refuse to sell their homes into unfavorable markets (hence historically low inventory right now), and b. because they refuse to give up their 2% mortgage rates. So the federal reserve can freeze home values, but they cannot crater them without triggering a massive recession, something they won't do.

1,2023-11-05,CMV: The abortion argument essentially boils down to whether you believe in the human right to life,u/StickyPurpleSauce,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17odojk/cmv_the_abortion_argument_essentially_boils_down/,changemyview,"There are several arguments for and against abortion. I’m not here to specifically make either side’s argument. But in researching the topic rather heavily, I find that ultimately it comes down to whether you believe in the right to life

First off, let me clarify I’m not religious and don’t believe life is sacred. 

The bodily autonomy argument is pretty well established as a weak argument. It is a limited rather than absolute right, and there are times that a person’s autonomy is compromised lawfully

The consent argument is even weaker. People who think consent to sex doesn’t entail a consent to the risk of pregnancy don’t understand how consent works. 

From the utilitarian ‘maximising rights’ perspective, the anti-abortion stance is stronger. By allowing abortion, you deprive one person of one absolute right and one limited right (foetal right to 1. life and 2. bodily autonomy). By banning abortion, you only impair one person’s one limited right (woman’s right to bodily autonomy)

The ‘potential’ person argument essentially says that potential is generally considered equal to the eventual outcome 

So we are left with the personhood argument, which is where most of the true disagreement is rooted. Also, any disagreement of the points above will usually be rooted from the fact that some don’t consider the foetus a person with rights. Personhood is the only area where both sides can make a strong argument and the debates haven’t been concluded. My favourite pro-abortion argument is that someone possessing a ‘conscious human experience’ is a person. This is the basis for my pro-abortion stance. 

But interestingly, it’s also ambiguous that humans actually need to attain ‘personhood’ to be protected by *human* rights. And the distinction between a human and person is quite synthetically created to legally excuse the act of fetal killing, as we don’t identify any other human groups that aren’t automatically given personhood status. 

So with most arguments being in favour of anti-abortion - and the personhood argument being unconcluded and a little ambiguous - I would argue that someone who advocates for human rights and *aims for reasonable consistency* should not advocate for abortion. Instead, I think that any reasonable person who advocates for abortion should justify their stance by explaining they don’t believe humans are entitled to an absolute right to life"
8,2023-11-05,CMV: Being pro-life except when the pregnancy was the result of a rape is by far the dumbest position you can have when it comes to the debate on abortion,u/JMoon33,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17oe09n/cmv_being_prolife_except_when_the_pregnancy_was/,changemyview,"First of all, I am pro-choice, so I totally understand those that are pro-choice as well. Women should have control over their body, and it should be up to them, with the input of medical professionals, to decide if they want an abortion or not. There is also the argument that abortions help lower criminalization in the long term. 


Even if I disagree with pro-life, I think their position makes a lot of sense. They believe human fetus are a people with rights, and we shouldn't allow them to be killed, especially in a way that potentially causes them a lot of pain. Of course some people are pro-life for dishonest reasons and just want to control women, but that's a whole different subject. 


**In that pro-life vs pro-choice debate, there's always someone who says something alongs the line of ''Abortions shouldn't be allowed unless the pregnancy was caused by rape.'' which basically means ''I'm against killing babies unless these baby was the result of a rape, in that case, go ahead and kill the baby.''**

I was ***not even*** alive when we nuked Hiroshima or committed slavery. I know those things were wrong, but I am not responsible for actions I did not do.

In 2018 (I think), I became a victim of the Equifax Data Breach and was provided free credit monitoring from Experian IdentityWorks due to being a victim. For the past 6 years, I see ad for ad for ID theft insurance and they always say on the ads that freezing your credit, monitoring your credit files, using strong passwords, using multi-factor authentication, and verbal passwords is no longer enough to keep you protected.

&#x200B;

The problem is that some of the ID theft insurance plans cost $35 a month and they even make the disclaimer that...

>*""No person or company can prevent all forms of identity theft or monitor all transactions. But it's still a good idea to get protection.""*

Now obviously, they are a business and they are trying to market a product to maximize profits. I checked out the subreddit r/PersonalFinance and all of the recent posts say that identity theft insurance is a waste of money and that they cannot do anything that you can do for free. They refer to the website [IdentityTheft.gov](https://IdentityTheft.gov) which provides a free step-by-step guide on how to recover from identity theft. However, according to the LifeLock commercials, recovering from identity theft can be stressful, and a hassle. They said...

&#x200B;

>*""If you are in a situation where a mortgage company, payday lender, or a police department do not believe that you were a victim of identity theft, would you rather prove your innocence on your own, or get a dedicated expert who can take of the restoration process for you?""*

By the way, freezing your credit and monitoring your credit does not protect you from all forms of identity theft. For example, medical identity theft, unemployment identity theft, tax identity theft, investment identity theft, or criminal identity theft (where someone commits a crime in your name) do not involve accessing your credit file.

The dollar is the flexible part of the equation. You can't change the value of an hour because you cannot simply dictate a price to an international market. We could try saying ""gold you buy from america costs twice as much per kilo"" but in the end, we are just going to find that nobody wants to buy it, right?

I understand that labour is more regulated than gold, but that's only in very specific places. It seems like, without fair trade, this might work because local business would have an advantage to make up for increased labour costs. But i think we can see the general effect of ""constantly increasing minimum wage"" in north america has clearly been the outsourcing of industry and jobs in general, to cheaper places, whiich has hurt our economic performance relative to those places.

However, the hidden truth about him is much more chilling and disturbing.

Gandhi used multiple women — including underage girls and the vulnerable women under his control — for sexual experiments.

For example, in his late 70s, before he died at 78, he would sleep naked with his grandniece. He said he wanted to test his willpower to abstain from sex.

Gandhi wrote that white people should be ""the predominating race."" He also said black people ""are troublesome, very dirty and live like animals.""

If that wasn't enough, Gandhi also suggested that the Jews should've obeyed the wishes of Adolf Hitler. He wrote: *""the Jews should have offered themselves to the butcher’s knife. They should have thrown themselves into the sea from cliffs"".*

Gandhi was a sexual predator and a racist."

Not only do I think people learn more before 15 than we give credit for but it will give young adults more of a sense of responsibility instead of saying you’re a child and not responsible for anything until you’re out on your own.

I would also say that any benefits or advantages should be limited to those in school or graduated from school.

CMV: America should set the minimum wage to $1000 per hour.

The arguement for this is obvious. People deserve to benefit from the fruit of their labour instead of being exploited for profit. This measure would reduce wealth inequality that has grown to unacceptable levels.

Furthermore it would increase consumer spending by giving consumers more money to spend, thus increasing the size of the market and the amount of money that american buisiness could earn selling to customers. 

This would also encourage skills and development by allowing cross generational access to training anywhere in the country for otherwise disadvantaged groups.

In the end this would be a net benefit for the government since people would be able to pay more taxes and would be less dependant on programs like oas, food stamps and welfare programs. 

This would also reduce the debt outstanding in the united states by giving people the means to become liquid. "

The reason why closed adoptions and anonymous donors should be banned is because it’s absolutely immoral and unethical to deprive someone of knowing who their biological family is. Don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing wrong with adoption, that is if it’s an open one. But closed adoptions should be banned without question and adoptive parents who want to hide information about an adoptee’s biological parents is just despicable and even worse adoptive parents could hide information that the child was even adopted and the child could be raised under the impression that the adoptive parents are its biological parents and that is completely unacceptable. Moving on to why anonymous donors should be banned. Now whether you consider donor eggs, sperm, or embryos, at least consider an open donor. Consider an anonymous donor and have the child not know who the biological family is, then you really be ashamed of yourself. Now to glue everything together, for anybody who is adopted or do it conceived, having information about the biological family can be useful, especially if such a person needs to know it’s medical history but if you hide such information then the adoptee or donor conceived person wouldn’t know it’s medical history and say such a person has a medical problem, then that person could be in big trouble.

They buried their heads in the sand. They routinely denied the CDC's requests for more funding. Even after his friend Rock Hudson died of the disease, Reagan himself was still hesitant to publicly talk about it; his own Surgeon General released a report in 1986 calling for AIDS education, and as his own Secretary of Education and domestic policy adviser worked to undercut and defund this effort, Reagan himself said nothing.

So, why was the Reagan administration so hellbent on burying their heads in the sand? It's simple. Because the data showed that the epidemic was disproportionately impacting gay men, IV drug users, and Haitian immigrants. They knew exactly what they were doing when they made the decision to bury their heads in the sand; they wanted these groups to die. This is the very definition of genocide.

I believe A.I. companies have collaborated to trick us into changing definitions to ""artificial sentience"" to distinguish the terms. Since perseptiveness/consciousness is required for intelligence - intelligence already implies sentience.

Bottom line: 

There's a big different between an algorithmic extraction of data and intelligence. Intelligence and consciousness doesn't look to me as computational. There is no amount of data that could ever teach a computer what the color blue looks like. It can fetch the data on the code for blue, but it can never know it unless we artificially create neuro synapses."

I can't find specific reasons this POV is wrong, though. 

In my mind, if a ceasefire happens right now, nothing much will change.

Hamas will eventually attack Israel again. They've promised to do this, and Hamas does not agree on a two-state solution. They will continue to attack Israel again and again, and Israel will have to live with that fear for the foreseeable future. 

With a pause, that allows Gazan people to recover, receive aid, and for foreign nationals to leave, will lead to more short-term deaths (I'm not trying to trivialize this at all, so apologies if it seems like that), but fewer deaths in the long-run. If Israel does get rid of Hamas entirely, with the sheer amount of bombing they're doing, they will probably also ruin some of Hamas' infrastructure as well, including their system of tunnels. 

Even if a ""Hamas 2"" starts (I think this is inevitable) after Israel kills Hamas leaders, they might have fewer ways to attack Israeli people and the attacks won't be at the same magnitude. 

My two main issues with this are that 1) it's fairly speculative that ""Hamas 2"" will be less effective than Hamas right now, and 2) Israel seems to be indiscriminately bombing Gaza. The one counterpoint to (2) is that with the 80,000 tons of bombs they've used on Gaza, around 9000 people have died. With so much of Gaza ruined, and so much bombing, it seems like more than 9000 people would have died without the evacuation orders they've been giving to civilians. 

THE OTHER SIDE:

Two scenarios seem inevitable: 1) hundreds to thousands more Gazans die from the current Israeli terrorism + Hamas 2 continues to attack Israel with help from Iran (even if their tunnels and whatever are somewhat ruined) and Israeli citizens continue to be killed, or 2) A ceasefire prevents more innocent Gazans from being murdered but Hamas continues to kill innocent Israelis.   
Neither seems ideal, but the second seems better - is that correct? Why or why not?

Instead of focusing on equality between individuals they began to focus almost exclusively on statistical equality - equality between all the large groups that people.

This sort of issue has been picked up with gutso by the media. They can push the absolute limit of controversy and sensationalism with stories like this, and that sort of thing generates an unusually large amount of traffic in modern media formats.

Some background, I'm 20 years old, but have made an higher than average income since I was 15 by identifying anonymous people online in exchange for money. And been doxing people since I was 12. I am very experienced in this and most people on here are a way, WAY easier to identify than people purposely trying to stay anonymous. 

  
Every time I have actually doxed someone on here leaving hateful or arrogant comments, their social profiles have (suprise surprise) no mention of these powerful opinions and stances they have on here. They only react that way because they feel protected by the imagined guise of anonimity and the subreddit they're posting on mostly agreeing with them. 

  
I bet if I posted some of their comments on social media, they would do everything they can to get it removed instantly. I don't think they would want anyone to see what kind of person they really are when they think they're anonymous. The urge to wipe that smug tone of their replies by commenting who they really are, and exposing it on their social media profiles has been getting stronger and stronger. 

  
Is there any reason I shouldn't do this? If their opinions are really that strong, if they stand for them with so much heart, that it warants hate brigading, insulting, and dehumanising others for simple opinions while not knowing anything else about them, shouldn't it only be right their in real life connections know how strongly they stand for this too? Shouldn't they be fine with people knowing who they are on here, as they're apparently so morally superior and know so much more than others?

1,2023-11-05,CMV: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a broken concept that is hurting research and policy discussions.,u/PsecretPseudonym,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17op8aj/cmv_artificial_general_intelligence_agi_is_a/,changemyview,"Within the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, the research community has long discussed the concept of “general intelligence” with, at times, slightly different meanings and nuances in different contexts.

Now that industry, regulators/governments, and the general public have taken more of an interest in setting research goals and safety guidelines, the number and types of people participating in these discussions has greatly increased.

For som, like Deepmind and OpenAI, AGI has long been a stated goal of their research.

However, I recently saw an interview of Dario Amodei of Anthropic, and he made some comment about the term AGI that has me rethinking the meaning and usefulness of the concept.

For many years, the concept of AGI was a useful way to describe a set of general and highly adaptive human-like cognitive abilities, allowing a machine to pick up, learn, reason, and work with ideas and information with the same or better agility and breadth as humans.

However, as he pointed out, this concept was a useful way to describe this sort of goal when we were further away from it, when it made more sense to roll up all the different things we’d expect from a machine showing a human-like level of intelligent into one sort of vague concept. As we now get closer and closer to that, we start to see more and more that maybe this is too much of a high-level, abstract, and vaguely defined idea to still be useful.

By analogy: Imagine I print out a big road map of the United States, and I ask you use it to describe how we might drive navigate from LA to NYC. The map would be excellent for that. Now suppose I ask you to use to provide a description of the boroughs of New York City and turn by turn navigation once there. The map at that point would be virtually useless.

Similarly: We know what we mean when we talk about a good “general education” at a foundational level, and we design tests for that. However, it’s unclear what it would mean if someone did their PhD in “general studies.” At some point in the educational progression, we have to start being more specific to be meaningful.

Similarly, now that we have machines which are increasingly intelligent in a variety of capacities, what exactly we mean by “general intelligence” becomes somewhat useless. How many tasks or types of reasoning must a machine be able to do to qualify? How good at each must it be? How good at learning or working with new ideas and information must it be? Does it matter what kind? Do we mean human-like intelligence, and, if so, how are we distinguishing this from less intelligent animals? Humans have some degree of neurodiversity, so what balance of cognitive abilities do we actually consider to be canonically “human-like”? For example, someone with autism may experience the world and exercise intelligence in somewhat different ways.

At this point, this is too blunt of an idea, and we’d do well to try to deprecate it and use more specific, testable, observable, and meaningful terms for the sorts of cognitive abilities we are studying or trying to replicate. 

Continuing to just work toward “general intelligence” and even to try to regulate it is a recipe for chasing your own tail with semantics. It’s a hinderance, and we should move beyond it."

In this decade, we are bound to cross the 1.5 C threshold. We could have averted the imminent collapse of civil governance had we taken action decades sooner. Unfortunately, powerful corporations retain their hold over the most influential politicians and stand invincible against any opposition. 

Too often, we have democratically elected leaders who have promised to enforce earth-friendly policies only to renege on their word. This seems to be the actual case across Canada, Europe, and even the eco-friendly Democratic Party in the United States. Sure, they might have taken *Some* small actions to appease environmental activists and the scientific community,\[whereas the right-wingers would deny it and do nothing,\]  but it's never enough. 

Environmental activists have insisted upon non-violent activism to affect change. Guess what? All these years, peaceful activism hasn't done shit, or if it has, it's been too minimal. Wasteful corporations have cleverly suppressed peaceful dissent by bombarding the public with mass distractions, advertisements, and amusement. Capitalism has bought off everyone - the police, eco-friendly businesses, activist leaders, NGOs with the best intentions, etc.

I have concluded that the only way to save the planet would be for the masses to launch a violent overthrow of the current global system. Simple eco-sabotage of oil pipelines is not enough. After the hypothetical revolution, we will then have to deal with the counter-revolutionaries and right-wing extremists who will get pissed off/apeshit. Undoubtedly, a bloody war with the far right is to be expected.

To appease the proponents of peaceful activism, let's pretend that we are somehow able to peacefully and democratically elect an eco-socialist government into power. A one-world eco-socialist government is what we need to take climate action; it cannot be confined to North America. Through education and reason, let's say that most of the world realizes the severity of anthropocentric climate change and votes to form a uniform, global socialist system that abolishes the old capitalist order. 

After establishing this better governance order and properly redistributing wealth, we would need to ban all fossil-fuel industries and vehicles that run on said fossil fuel.\[Sorry, electric vehicles are not sustainable in the long run. Manufacturing their components creates additional emissions\] Cattle farming and high-emission businesses would come next. 

We would have to ban rural living and force everyone to live in sustainable, green cities. This would involve everyone taking residence in government-subsidized housing apartments.

Perhaps we will attain net zero. We could find ways of reversing the climate crisis with enough ingenuity coupled with sustainable living. We would undoubtedly eliminate inequality. We may enter a post-scarcity world order. the only problem will be the right-wingers. 

Again, neo-fascists will likely commence their violent counterrevolution, and we may find ourselves having to resort to lethal methods to contain them. 

Sure, we would probably outlaw ownership of private firearms to keep extremist groups in check, but they will likely gunsmith their firearms or raid weapons/ammo stockpiles. Keeping neo-fascists and extremists in check would require a militant democracy that cracks down on certain freedoms to protect other greater freedoms. Right-wing militants will see this as 'communist oppression,' which will send them into further hysteria. 

In the end, we will be forced to treat the neo-fascist insurgents like ISIS militants and will have to use military force to blow them off the face of our world. However, neo-fascist militants won't be the last of our worries.

There will likely be a second group of right-wing/white separatists. These people would not endorse a violent rebellion but would instead prefer to be left alone in their own community enclaves. They will refuse to move into green cities and continue living unsustainably in the countryside.  

This will be the hardest decision. If we tell them what they are doing harms their children and the earth's environment, they will just ignore our plea. We would then be forced to relocate them to a better urban dwelling. They will probably put up a fight and start shooting at us the moment we enter. The end result is a bloodbath.

&#x200B;

As for the current situation, we will likely see ecosystems collapse, heatwaves along with droughts intensify, mass climate refugees going north, and said western countries in the north going authoritarian and erecting barriers and shooting innocents to keep people out. Suppose a Western country decides to be generous and accept as many refugees as possible. In that case, the welfare system will likely collapse after the population surpasses its threshold, sending that country into a third-world death spiral. 

If that doesn't happen, a bunch of right-wing ultra-nationalist partisans will probably target refugees and shoot up the country. Civil war would likely ensue between nationalists and progressives.

Either way, I don't see a peaceful resolution to our climate crisis at this stage. We might have had the chance if we acted democratically years ago, but now I doubt it."

But that may not be true, because only Ashkenazi jews have above average IQ, yet other jewish groups that score average or lower are still Wealthy.

Here, in Brazil, we got example of the Safra family and who are a family of serphadic jews that own a huge bank. We also got Silvio Santos, a serphadic jew that own a TV channel, and he was born poor. He has an ancestor who did financial consulting to iberian kings and things of sort. (Silvio Santos real name is Senor Abravanel, and his famous ancestor was also an Abravanel).

There is also registers of Sahara jews being rich during Songhai Empire Era, as the teaveller Leo Africanus wrote "" In  there were some very rich Jews. The intervention of the preacher (Muhammid al-Maghili) of Tlemcen set up the pillage of their goods, and most of them have been killed by the population. This event took place during the same year when the Jews had been expelled from Spain and Sicily by the Catholic King.""

So, even having average IQ, non-ashkenazi are also either rich or associated with Wealthy.

Everyone is welcome, but I rather see what Ashkenazi-IQ supporters think of that"

4,2023-11-05,"CMV: The only way to solve the Israel-Palestine conflict is to have Israel stop interfering with Gaza and the West Bank while 3rd party peacekeepers act as a police force in both areas, guaranteeing no attacks on Israel.",u/LXXXVI,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17ory1q/cmv_the_only_way_to_solve_the_israelpalestine/,changemyview,"Since the whole thing kicked into high gear again, I've watched literally hundreds of hours of videos from both sides, trying to figure out what the hell is actually happening. After all this time, I've come to two conclusions that underpin my current opinion:

1. Israel as a state primarily of and for Jews isn't going anywhere unless quite literally forced to, which is not happening.
2. The opinions of who the bad guy is in this entire thing seem to come down to the ""level of zoom"" one takes of the conflict. People who see it as isolated to Israel vs Palestine seem to mostly be pro-Palestine. People who see it as Israel fighting for its safety in a wider (somewhat unfriendly to openly hostile) geographic area tend to be pro-Israel.
3. Pro-Palestine people seem to believe that Palestine would flourish if it weren't for Israel keeping Palestine subjugated in an apartheid-style state.

Hence, my proposed solution:

1. Israel stops its attacks on Gaza. Hamas releases all the hostages.
2. The UN puts together an international ""police force"" consisting of countries that support Palestine and places them in both Gaza and the West Bank. This police force has two jobs - to keep Palestine from attacking Israel or Israeli settlers already in the West Bank and to keep Israel from interfering with Palestine in any way.
3. Israel's naval blockade gets restricted to only confiscating arms. Apart from that, Gaza can start freely participating in naval trade.
4. Until local self-sufficiency is achieved, Israel must provide Gaza with water. Everything else (except arms) can be provided by anyone/everyone else without interference from Israel. Whether Israel allows that trade to flow across its territory or not is Israel's decision.

The rationale here is simple. If the main reason why Palestine cannot prosper and grow peaceful is that Israel is truly keeping a boot on Palestine's neck, that boot is immediately removed.

There's a caveat, however. If attacks on Israel continue at an annual rate or with damage that's higher than the average of the preceding x years, Israel has the right to solve the situation however it sees fit. 

I'm absolutely open to changing my opinion on whether this could work as a way to bring peace to both and prosperity to Palestinians as well. 

There are, however, 2 arguments that won't change my mind:

> It's not fair that Palestine has to accept the two tiny specks of land in what's a de facto two state solution that's much worse than any of the previous ones.

Well, perhaps it's not fair, but neither life nor history are fair. There's a ton of countries on the planet with territorial claims that won't ever get fulfilled. Hungary would ""ideally"" triple in size according to their irredentists. China claims a ton of land and sea all over the place. And this doesn't even begin to describe the claims Native Americans could make.

The current situation is such as it is and having people stop dying and helping Palestine become prosperous is more important than land claims.

> If Palestine grows more prosperous, that would mean they'll become more dangerous to Israel as well.

Could that happen? Yes. But, first, it's the job of the ""UN Police Force"" to make sure it doesn't and second, since Palestine would have international safety guarantees conditional on pacifism from, hopefully, the US as well, any arming of Palestine beyond building its own legit police force could be considered a casus belli by Israel, which would void the entire deal and then Israel could respond however they'd like.

There, that's my position. I'm curious to hear why it might not work."

It doesn’t matter what any politician says or does or believes if the military who work under him/her refuse to engage in war

After I changed my thinking and started meditation, I feel less need for sex and less attraction towards women and it has reduced by 90%. Some of other more advanced meditators don't even feel attraction anymore.

Not just sex. We meditators are also not attracted to other pleasures of life. I had eating disorder. After practicing mindfulness I stopped eating so such an extreme that I realised my weight has reduced to 59kg and now I am eating again those chocolates and biscuits not for taste but for increasing weight (In moderation btw). If someone offers me food I feel disgusted and if they say ""why restrain, just enjoy the taste"" and I am like ""wtf is there to enjoy, it's boring as fuck"". Now that I am eating tasty foods for weight gain they are thinking as if I have given up lol. I also lost interest in gaming and need to force myself to play to pass time which itself feels boring. I am now more focused on some other more important aspects of life like developing Concentration power for Advanced level Meditation.

Note- This question has nothing to do with Sexual orientation. I am discussing about the power of attraction rather than the sex they are attracted to. I am open minded towards Homosexuality and accepting of same sex marriages."

The proposal could be accompanied by chemical castration for men if there is an issue of mistaking the vascectomies for birth control.

Why do I hold this view? There is a push for ""reasonable"" abortion laws, and I think that democrats in the US who support abortion should concede to the Christian right under the condition that the right support legally compelled vascectomies for men who have fathered more than two children or are convicted rapists. 

I know how ridiculous this idea is, but it is just as ridiculous as the idea of ""reasonable"" abortion. Abortion as it is defined in the minds of the Christian right does not exist. One cannot argue fiction with facts. Case in point: a certain conservative Christian influencer who receives a surgery to save her life after an ectopic pregnancy. It's technically an abortion, to which she is opposed, but she doesn't see it this way. Is this ""reasonable"" abortion? 

If women must be legally compelled to carry a birth to term, men must also be legally compelled to be sexually responsible. There is no reason men should be free in their reprodictive health care, but women shouldn't. Neither practice is medically ethical, but the two ideas properly... complement... one another."

You can argue that men retain institutional power or that men have an easier time moving up the ladder yada yada yada, but the flip side to that is that if you “fail” at that as main, you’re basically worthless scum. Men simply aren’t afforded the same emotional, social, psychological or financial security as women and it shows in just how disposable our physical lives are. 

I find it hypocritical when society focuses on violence against women (not saying that isn’t a serious issue, because it is) but then treats violence against men as an almost non-issue, when in reality it’s a massive cause for stress and anxiety for countless men around the world.

Unless we legitimately want to go back to the barbaric age of might makes right and that only strong, aggressive men deserve power in society, we should endeavour to make a world more accomodating for men who don’t fit the Type-A “alpha male” stereotype, something that in many ways society has completely failed to do."

Keep in mind, when I mention Hamas, I’m referring to the governing body of Gaza. When I refer to Israel, I’m referring to the government. Not the civilians. I’m aware that neither state has a majority approval rating, especially not Hamas, but this is the nature of totalitarian bodies. It only takes an extremist base of 20-40% the population who wants to destroy the opposition to maintain a nation like that. 

I’ll give a list of reasons I don’t see a solution to the problem and go from there:

1. Both governments are hell bent on exterminating the other side. This is pretty obvious.

2. Israel is never going to integrate palestinians, as evidenced by their apartheid-state abuse of them.

3. Israel has a right to apprehend Hamas, and we can’t just force them to let it go when Hamas has killed Israeli civilians, but Israel is never going to apprehend Hamas in a responsible way because of their aforementioned prerogative to kill muslims. Since Israel is never going to approach this responsibly, their terror campaigns will continue to force civilians to join Hamas. Terrorist groups are like coyote packs, you either wipe out all of them, or make them grow faster. For evidence, just look at what we did in the middle east. Millions of deaths later and the Taliban’s back in control. 

4. If Palestine is given independence, Hamas will continue to attack Israel because of their aforementioned prerogative to kill Jews, and with independence, they would just have a greater ability to do so. 

5. Hamas won’t just disappear if Israel withdraws because this conflict has gone far enough for them to maintain it easily. All they have to do is continue provoking conflicts and Israel will come back and they can scare the palestinians into tolerating them.

6. Every major global player probably has stakes in this and wants it to go down. Any money we give to Israel (they’re saying 100b right?) is going straight in the pockets of military contractors who’ve bribed our government. Iran and probably Russia supported Hamas’ attack on Israel. 

7. We can’t just force either group out since that is their homes. Some israeli families have probably been there for four generations now. Plus forcing them out would create a massive refugee issue and you know nobody is going to take them in.

Like I said, I don’t know how to unfuck this situation. This project was probably doomed the moment Churchill thought to put the Jews there. Maybe the UN could do something about Hamas? But I guess that won’t change their use of human shields. 

The whole things feels hopeless when Hamas treats the Palestinians like sacrificial pawns and Israel treats them like shooting targets."

If you are aware of the atrocities committed by imperial Japan during WW2, such as the rape of Nanking and unit 731 It seems obvious that imperial Japan had to be stopped at all costs. It was apparent that it would take an immense show of power in order to persuade Japan to surrender. Additionally, Japan planned to release the Bubonic Plague onto the West Coast of the United States. This was luckily stopped as a result of the nukes being dropped on Japan. That's not to say I think the USA was justified in all of its actions during WW2, but I think this action in particular was completely justified and prevented a lot of suffering, especially in China.

As the terms of the mandate required, the British should keep the Arabs from becoming a political or even a military threat to Zionist goals. Therefore, for the Zionists British policy was more important than Arab policy.

Arab opposition was of course known to the Zionists. Ben-Gurion said in 1918: ""We as a nation want this country to be ours; the Arabs, as a nation, want this country to be theirs"". Resistance was to be expected. Jabotinsky said in 1921: ""I don't know of a single example in history where a country was colonised with the courteous consent of the population.

According to Flapan, one of the basic concepts of mainstream Zionism with regard to the Arab Palestinians was economic, social and cultural segregation as a means to create a Jewish national life. Especially the struggle for ""100 per cent of Jewish labour"" in the Jewish sector of the economy occupied the energies of the labour movement for most of the Mandatory years and contributed more than any other factor to the territorial, economic and social separation between Jews and Arabs.'According to C. D. Smith the Zionists did not intend to create a joint society with the Arabs, no matter how difficult this might be.

Although the establishment of a Jewish majority or a Jewish state in Palestine was fundamentally at odds with the aspirations of the Arab inhabitants of Palestine, Zionists did not doubt their right to establish a Jewish majority in Palestine. Zionists justified this by referring to the 'unique' historical bond of the Jewish nation with Palestine, while the Arabs of Palestine were part of the Arab nation and therefore had no special bond with Palestine. Many Zionists claimed a 'preemptive right' to Palestine, the Jews had a right as a Nation, the Arabs only as individuals."

Demagoguery can really only occur if the population is ignorant enough to believe that the would-be tyrant isn’t lying; or that history repeats itself. 

Take Trump for example. Those who haven’t read primary sources reflecting the rise of the German National Socialist Party might not see the parallels between American populism and German populism. Or at worst, people might not even know what populism is. 

From a policy perspective, the ignorant might think a bunch of government stimulus is a good thing and will never have any negative consequences. Whereas anyone who took high school economics could tell you that inflation will rise as a direct consequence of free money injected into consumer wallets.

But the overwhelming majority have no actual link to this team.  It's not like their friend or cousin or whatever is playing for them.  If you're friends with someone on a pro sports team, go ahead and cheer them on.  You're not who I'm talking about in this post. 

The way I see it is this: lots of games are exciting.  Surprise plays, turnovers, and things like that can be thrilling to witness.  But if you're rooting for one specific team, then there's always this sort of ""NO NO NO NO NO!"" reaction when these plays aren't in your favor, or even when a completely different team that you're not even playing against wins a different match and adversely affects your playoff chances.  

But if you're just watching for the sake of seeing a bunch of professional athletes excel at what they do, then there's never any drawback.  An exciting game is an exciting game, regardless of who wins, so you come away happy for having watched it.  

Here's an analogy: compare a horror movie to an entire sports season.  Say you pick a character or actor who you want to see survive until the end of the movie, but they get killed (eliminated from the playoffs) long before the movie is even over.  Now you're bummed that the character is gone, right?  But what if you're just watching the movie for the sake of seeing the story play out, regardless of who lives or dies by the end?  No matter what happens, as long as it's an interesting movie, you've won.

This is meant to be a light-hearted CMV.  I do not begrudge anyone for cheering for any given team.  I'm not trying to say that people who cheer for a given team are somehow bad in any way.  I just think it makes more sense to watch the game without putting your hopes into any particular outcome, and tying your enjoyment of the match to the relative number of points scored by one group versus another.  

And let me throw this out here: yes, I have seen my local professional teams win championships before.  I have witnessed, in-person, the home team be down almost the entire game before coming back to win the championship in the final three minutes.  It was exciting to watch, but no more so than had it been *any* two teams playing against each other, in my opinion.  "

(Also, I’m not saying I’m a pretty person who has gone through these experiences so just keep in mind it’s a lot of assumptions)

For example, if you’re applying to a job, and you get hired simply for being “eye candy”, it takes away from all the hard work you’ve done to get to that point. I would much rather be appreciated for the skills I bring to the table than my looks.

 I know some people may say “well you’re still getting the job easily  and shouldn’t care what other people think”. But many do care what other people think, and wouldn’t want to be known just for their looks rather than all the years of hard work they went through to learn the skills they did for that job. Many people work hard to earn the Dr title, and want to be appreciated for it. Similarly, many people work hard to get the job they want and want to be appreciated for their skills over anythingelse. An engineer doesn’t study for years just to be a Model at their workplace. 

Even in regular friendly relationships, prettiness may cause you to be surrounded by fake friends. Girls would be jealous of you and probably find any and every opportunity to take you down (guys if you’re a pretty guy). And with guys, you never know if they’re truly a friend or just someone who has sexual intentions with you. They too would just see you as an object, and fail to appreciate the whole person that you are. As a pretty person, you just become an object of desire and not much more.

Of course, a pretty person will go through small privileged interactions where they’ll get free ice cream or a compliment from a stranger (those are nice). But the reason why I say it’s more of a curse is because the people you actually know around you are the ones that can harm you, through their fake intentions, and not just a random stranger complimenting you.

 Basically, what I’m trying to say is that your major life interactions, such as in work and with friends, are the ones that don’t see you more than your looks. And that’s way more harmful to be neutralized by small friendly compliments on the street or getting free food. The cons outweigh the pros, so pretty privilege is more of a curse than a privilege."

I was raised to believe that there are seven days in a week and that Monday is one of those days. Every seven days we experience a Monday and, according to my calendars, we are in fact there again.

I don't believe in any kind of time manifestation - i.e. You cannot make it a different day simply by believing and doing affirmations as if it is that particular day. I believe that it is either Monday because of where the Earth is and according to the time conventions we have set in place, or it is not.

Take some drinks/foods, on the back it says ""natural flavours"" now it took me a long time to realize that it is an outright lie. ""natural flavours"" sounds like it should just be natural flavors... but it's a bit worse than that. This is now just semantics. This is completely unessecary confusion to a child or single mother or adult or the general public or ANYONE. WHY  THE LABEL NATURAL FLAVOURS ALLOWED TO EXIST WHEN IT IS DELIBERATELY TRYING TO CONFUSE PEOPLE. How can a government look at this situation where nobody, definitely not the general public or even 95%,  actually knows what ""natural flavours"" means and deem it ""ah just a side effect, nothing wrong with that, better not to touch it, I need money, more money please, I am the goberment and i still need money because this is less about helping people and more about keeping the empire alive""...

&#x200B;

also the names like delinanphilanihyde or some made up crap you find on most shampoo bottles (just to illustrate a point)

 Your government does not care about you as much as it should, capitalism seeks to profit over your death, regardless of who or what you are, and semantic ingredients should not exist today. We're far too technologically advanced to let simple shit like this slide. As a species, the only ""correct"" way is forward. We know what we must do and we should do it. 

I propose a solution that is better than the current situation, here's my update: 

Simply add a big fucking 5 inch dick sticker onto the offending products (pretty much 95% of anything in a isle) that says ""the ingredients list is all a lie, the names are fake, nobody knows what's actually in this, choose your poison"" because FUCK this situation

&#x200B;

alternatively: make big add campaigns and run them year around that say the same thing. ""nobody knows what the fuck the ingredients is in this bottle of cola, even if the names clearly say it is x, science is cucked by money shortages yet again and this product really could just be full of dogshit, here are pictures of smokers lungs, this could be you"". 

&#x200B;

What do I mean by streamlined? Well, maybe names like  delinanphilanihyde (made up word)  or alike shouldn't exist on the back of a product because a single mother wont know what the fuck it means and wont have the time or care to look it up before buying.

You need to work twice as hard on various everyday skills (such as socializing) to have your words hold the same value as an average/taller male. You are openly made fun of and at the same time expected to not take any offence. If you do express taking any offence, you will then be labelled with the term short man syndrome. If you express the pains of being a short man, most will never sympathize with you and will just tell you to get over it.   


I am a 5”6 Indian male, people sympathize more with me when I talk about the times I faced racism. But nobody cares about my height pains, which I honestly find worse than racism. I have done okay in terms of dating and I have a good group of friends so socially things seem fine. Yet, there are too many occasions where I have been made to feel like less of a man. Too many occasions where I don’t get the same respect as an average male. Enough occasions to make me conscious about my height.  
  
If there exists a surgery that can help me live a normal life like most other men, then it is completely worth it in my view. Why is it looked down upon? If you visit a good surgeon who has a near 100% success rate and you have the time and money to do it then why not?

I've even seen people go so far as to say that Palestinians are living the black experience. You'll also see people bemoaning the fact that white people took land from brown people. 

This, in my opinion, shows how embarassingly uninformed people are about a centuries old conflict happening thousands of miles away. You go to Israel and you see people of every color, black, brown, white, and every shade in between. You go to Palestine, or Lebanon, or Syria, and you see brown people, and also the whitest shade of skin you've seen.

There are many factors at play in the conflict - religion, ethnicity - but color has literally nothing to do with anything. I think it's just an easy way for people with no deep knowledge of the conflict to frame a complex issue in terminology that's familiar to them. While this makes things more digestible, it also serves to inflame passions and create more hysteria."

For starters, you may think that Florida is only a Southern state, geographically but how about I tell you that Southern culture hasn’t disappeared completely from Florida and it’s still prevalent in the rural areas of the state. Now, in larger urban areas of the state such as Miami and Orlando, there’s certainly a lot less of it, but look at it this way. Atlanta is now a lot less Southern than it was before and it’s cosmopolitan compared to the rest of Georgia, so with this said Atlanta is different from the rest of Georgia, just as Miami is different from the rest of Florida.

Moving on, Florida does in fact have some Southern credentials and let’s start with the fact that Florida is a former Confederate state and let’s not forget some Florida natives who were also some of the most Southern people you could ever come across such as Tom Petty, Delta Burke, Mel and Pam Tillis, John Anderson, and Gov. Lawton Chiles.

Now, I explained earlier that Southern culture is still prevalent in the rural parts of the state, and  let’s not forget that in rural Florida, it’s home to the Florida Crackers, who are are cattle ranchers and just so happen to be some of the most Southern people you could come across. Just go to YouTube and search “Florida Crackers” and watch one of the videos and you’ll easily convinced that they’re Southern.

Now, I understand if not every Floridian considers theirselves Southern, but I will at least speak for all the multi-generational Floridians as they usually consider theirselves Southern.

Moving on, I realize that Florida has a lot of non-Southern transplants but that doesn’t automatically make Florida unSouthern and those people typically live in the larger urban areas of Florida, but you know a lot other Southern states have gotten a huge influx of non-Southern transplants as well.

Anyway, some of you just might say that some parts of Florida are Southern, but some parts aren’t, which is understandable, but if you argue that none of Florida is Southern, then that argument just doesn’t hold water. SORRY! Now, some of you might argue that North Florida is Southern, but the rest of Florida isn’t, but that argument isn’t quite accurate, because Central Florida is Southern, if you go out into the countryside and South Florida is Southern, if you step away from the coast and go further inland.

So to close it all up, I’d love to hear your input and I’m sure all of you will each have a different argument. Is at least some of Florida Southern. Is all of Florida Southern? Or, is just North Florida Southern? I’m open to different arguments."
1,2023-11-06,"cmv: Israel is not a ""settler-colonialist"" state.",u/Material_Produce,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17p6k3p/cmv_israel_is_not_a_settlercolonialist_state/,changemyview,"I first want to point out that I think that Israel's actions in Gaza are indefensible and should be condemned. I think an immediate ceasefire is needed and I deeply sympathise with the plight of innocent Palestinian civilians (likewise, I was horrified by Hamas' attacks on innocent Israeli civilians). This is a conflict in which Israel clearly has the superior power and military capability to act as an oppressor, and has illegally occupied the Palestinian territories and breached Palestinians human rights on countless occasions.

However, I keep seeing claims that the founding of Israel must be understood as a ""settler-colonial"" project sustained by the 'settler-colonial' ideology of Zionism. I have three problems with this reading of history, although I am open to be convinced otherwise:

1. Firstly, every single settler colony throughout history has been controlled by an imperial authority, a 'metropole' which exploits land, resources, labour, human beings, and geopolitical influence from their colonies on the periphery. Israel was not settled by an imperialist state and organised military, but by a minority group from many different countries, who did not set out to further the economic interests of those countries but to start a new life for themselves. Most Jews who came to Israel during the first and second aliyot were refugees fleeing persecution, as were the many who fled from Nazi persecution and the Holocaust. Surely this is a fundamental difference between Zionism and (for example) British settler colonialism in North America and Australia. It seems to me that the motivations of Zionist Jews in Eastern Europe had very little in common with British capitalists sought new markets for their goods or resources to extract.
2. Secondly, every single settler-colony throughout history has seized land through violent warfare and maintained it through force. Whilst this has been true of Israel since 1948,  early Jewish settlers bought land legally by purchasing it from absentee landlords. Early Zionism was not built around the violent annexation of territory, but immigration and land purchase. The conflict leading up to the UN separation of Palestine was at least partly the result of Muslim Palestinian nationalists who opposed the non-violent settlement and purchase of land by Jews (many of them refugees). On the other hand, both the Arab and Jewish communities in Palestine resisted and fought against *British* Imperialism. This seems like a very different process from (for example) the early United States wars against Native Americans, forced displacements and military-backed colonisation of the frontier.
3. Thirdly, settler-colonies seek the forced removal or extermination of the home population. I think it is clear that Zionism was not originally a project to remove the local population from Palestine, even if Zionists ignored and minimalised the question of what they would do if Palestinians rejected their vision. At many Zionist conferences they affirmed the need for unity and their desire for both Jews and Arabs to flourish in the new state. More often, it seems leading Zionists like Herzl held that Arabs would benefit from Jewish immigration to the area and the economic resources that European Jews would bring. Even Ze'ev Jabotinsky said in 1931 that ""We don’t want to evict one Arab from the left or right banks of the Jordan.” The minority of Zionists who rejected the Peel Commission did so because they wanted a united Palestine, not because they wanted to forcibly remove Arabs from the Arab areas. After 1948, this is a different story, but I don't think the ramifications of that war are best seen as an integral part of a pre-meditated plan of ethnic cleansing baked into the 'settler-colonist ideology' of Zionism.

For these reasons, if Israel is a 'settler-colony', it is a settler-colony *sui generis,* unlike any settler-colony in the history of the world. This doesn't justify Israel's actions, but I think it is important to understand when thinking about the history of the conflict. 

The French Marxist Maxime Rodinson, who was the first to call Israel a settler-colonial state, argued that if the 1947 United Nations partition plan had been adhered to, settler-colonialism 'could have been left behind'. But if Israel was never a settler-colonial state in the first place, then its actions since 1947 need to be understood in a different light. I think there are some important differences between the current actions of the Israeli government and the settlement of the West Bank by an aggressive and heavily militarized state and the history of Jewish immigration to Palestine under the Ottoman and British Empires."

I consider myself pretty firmly a “liberal” but I don’t consider myself a “Democrat” if that makes any sense.

I have repeatedly heard that RFK Jr. is a nutcase, an anti-vaxxer, a grifter, and more recently, a Russian shill. I never really gave him the time of day.

However, I recently listened to his Lex Fridman interview, and I cannot say in good faith that I don’t think he had very good points about the Russia vs. Ukraine conflict.

The United States has global hegemony. Russia is scared of us and our power. The Russian people have been generationally scarred by decades of war, espcially WW2, in a way Americans could never really comprehend.

NATO has been consistently pushing its boundaries toward the Russian border. We have military bases scattered around Russian territory. As far as I can tell from what RFK said in this interview (and he may be wrong, which is why I’m here) these strategic moves by the US have been clear encroachments on previous treaties and peace agreements.


To Russia, Ukraine is strategically necessary for them to protect their western border and to maintain their trading ports. They are constantly afraid that Ukraine is going to join NATO and that will be the last line of defense between them and their mortal enemies in the US.

Now, I agree that the majority of people in Ukraine do not want to live under Russian control. But RFK’s point seemed to be, regardless of what happens in Ukraine, they are going to lose this fight. Their military strength just doesn’t compare to that of Russia’s.

Yet the West has led a charge to fund this conflict, an unwinnable conflict that is, to prolong the war and weaken Russia’s military. There is nothing humanitarian about our military support for Ukraine, it is pure geopolitical strategy. 

RFK’s point was that by supporting Ukraine in this conflict we are essentially waging a proxy war, and making the possibility of nuclear or global conflict worse than it has been in decades.

And I can’t help but kind of agree with him. Nothing he said sounds like he’s being paid off, or that he’s a shill, he just sounds like he’s making reasonable arguments, and the mainstream media has written him off because they can’t allow someone to challenge the US’s geopolitical agenda.

So - how is RFK wrong about this conflict? How is he a conspiracy theorist/shill/Russian agent for making these arguments?"

I will use the definition from US Code. 

[18 U.S. Code § 2331](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2331). 

There are three parts: the act, the intent, the location

* **A: Violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws.**   
Israel has engaged in ""[Indiscriminate attacks](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/customary-ihl/v1/rule11)"", which are a violation of of International Humanitarian Law (IHL). I think there are numerous examples of this, but maybe the most clear example would be the bombing of Jabalia refuge camp. This is the most populated refugee camp in Gaza, and even if there were military targets, it is obvious that such an attack would kill military and civilians alike. This also violates rule 14.  
There are many other examples of Israel violating IHL. They are not allowing humanitarian relief (rule 55).  Israel has been accused of violating IHL way before the October 7, and obviously those situations have not improved.
* **B. Appear to be intended .. to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion**  
**OR to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping;** Israel's [stated goal](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/idf-official-on-goals-of-war-with-hamas/) in this was has been to ""destroy Hamas' leaders, infrastructures."" Hamas is (unfortunately) the government in Gaza, so the fits ""intent"" definition.  I think the scope of what Israel is doing leads one to believe they are doing it in order to force Hamas to surrender, i.e ""*influence the policy of a government by intimidation*"".
* **C. occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.**  
 Obviously, this is happening outside the US.

→ Israel's actions fit all three parts of this definition.

∴ it is currently conducting international terrorism.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

I can predict a number of counter-arguments that are unlikely to change my mind because they do not actually address my argument:

1. **All is fair in war**.  IHL would not exist if this was the case. I agree that the victors rarely face consequences of war crimes. However, that doesn't mean they were not committed.

2. **This is Hamas's fault.** I think the acts Hamas perpetrated on Oct 7 was horrific. It, too, was textbook international terrorism. But as most of us learned in kindergarten, two wrongs don't make a right. Israel has made a choice on how to respond, and that response included violations on IHL.

3. **Israel isn't subject to IHL.** This may technically be the case. I believe they have dropped out of the International Court, which I believe has jurisdiction to prosecute war crimes.  However, that does not change whether or not their actions fit the definition. It is clear Israel believes they have to right to do what they are doing. But I think they are wrong.

4. **This isn't as bad as \[fill in the blank\].** There is no doubt that you can point to other atrocities that make Israel's actions look reasoned and restrained. I likely consider them as IT as well.  I think the scope of terrorism the committed by western nation states is much larger than the terrorist organizations we typically consider (ISIS, Al Qaeda, FARC, etc.)

Most people don't wake up in bed one morning and decide, ""You know, I think I'll be a victim from this point onwards."" Rather, it's usually a very insidious process that is so subtle that even the person themselves doesn't realize it's seeping in.

Usually, a victim mentality arises from a long series of injustices, discrimination, betrayal or deprivation (although it can also come from a single big traumatic event) that is either **more** than what the normal/default person would experience, and/or goes repeatedly unaddressed. 

The cumulative effect of each adds up, and eventually a victim mentality becomes a form of self-defense: You become pessimistic because you don't want the hurt of having optimism lead to disappointment again. You distrust others because you don't want to be vulnerable again. Making matters worse, things are often self-fulfilling, so you actually end up getting precisely the bad outcome that you didn't want.

Of course, some people are born with a chip on their shoulder or an unusually entitled attitude. But they aren't as common.

None of this is to say that a victim mentality is *good*, or that someone should wallow in and remain in it - it's self-damaging. But there are usually valid reasons why someone who has such a mentality feels that way."

While I do not agree with this reasoning, I agree that placing cameras in classrooms is a good idea for these reasons.

1. It's a good anti bullying measure. It allows instances of bullying to be both documented and placed in context. So if John complains that Jack hit him ""for no reason"" we can review the footage and watch John throw stuff at Jack for several minutes. We might even be able to eliminate zero tolerance policies that punish victims along with bullies.

2. The footage can be used to dismiss parent complaints. Mad that Susie failed her test and think it's the teacher's fault? Here's Susie texting during the entire class every day.

3. Confirm/refute accusations of kids cheating. If two kids have similar answers on a test, you can see if they copied off each other or not.

Overall there are a lot of pros to putting cameras in classrooms and it's not like there is any expectation of privacy in a public school classroom. But I could be missing something."

I now realize the folly in trying to arbitrarily restrict the vote to people deemed “educated.”

The solution that I gleaned through the comments is a narrow, easy test to administer either on the eve of an election or when one registers to vote. 

The test should follow the design of the naturalization test only it should be easier. There should be a general English literacy component, a civics component, and a candidate identity component. 

One should generally know & understand English; one should generally know & understand the limits on political powers that the candidates would posses; and one should know who the candidates are, their party, and basic platform. 

Such a test could be no more than 15 questions with more depending on how many candidates are on the ballot. Again, it could be administered at the time of registration and the candidate section at the time of polling, or all at once during polling. If a voter fails the test, their vote is uncounted, they are ineligible for the current election and they are notified. 

Such exams should have the questions and answers posted well in advance of the election and should be altered as infrequently as possible. 

my reasons for even thinking like this despite the horrors of Jim Crow are summarized as follows: 

It’s extremely easy for demagogues to swindle ignorant and stupid people. *These* people are the true dangers to democracy and their votes should be suppressed. Politicians should not be able get away with relying on platitudes and slogans that appease fools. They should have to argue substantive policy to a learned electorate if democracy is to function."

i will start with the Balfour declaration which was done by the British mandate.

Walter Rothschild

As an active Zionist and a close friend of Chaim Weizmann, he worked to formulate the draft declaration for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. On 2 November 1917, he received a letter from the British foreign secretary, Arthur Balfour, addressed to his London home at 148 Piccadilly. In the letter, the British government declared its support for the establishment in Palestine of ""a national home for the Jewish people"". The letter became known as the Balfour Declaration.


the British mandate didn't own the land of Palestine its a colonial super power they have no right to decide to establish a state for jews on the land were the Jewish were a very small minority.


arabs felt betrayed by the British mandate that promised them that they will be able to establish arab state on Palestine.

so they started violent riots against the jews which caused many wars between arabs and zionists."
1,2023-11-06,CMV: The world would be a better place if cameras were nearly everywhere and people recorded every second of their lives through some kind of wearable technology (like that Black Mirror episode). Why? Accountability,u/Sh4rtemis,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17pdc3p/cmv_the_world_would_be_a_better_place_if_cameras/,changemyview,"  
I was inspired by the recent post about adding cameras to the classroom.   


What if cameras were pretty much everywhere except restrooms, bedrooms, and other niche places that would be too risky if a recording got leaked?  


And what if everyone recorded every second of their lives through wearable technology like in that Black Mirror episode?   


In that CMV about classroom cameras, the biggest argument against it is that students wouldn't feel comfortable knowing that they would be held accountable for their behavior.   


Why shouldn't we be held accountable for all of our behavior outside of our own homes?   


More cameras often means more truth. Cameras help us determine who was at fault in vehicle accidents, the identity of criminals, who is knocking at your front door, etc.  


What is wrong with a society where nearly everything we do is recorded?  


I think it would be a great way to settle disputes. Outside of video manipulation, I think it is helpful to have a nearly-objective source of truth during most kinds of disputes.   


In the classroom, kids exhibit all kinds of behavioral issues that the teacher notices (and nobody believes when they complain) or that the teacher doesn't notice. Video evidence would be great here.   


Do people feel all scared as if anything they say or do will be used against them? Good, get used to it because you are going to be on cameras for of your lives, kids. Get real used to it right now because it will only get worse.   


I have so many ""he said, she said"" arguments with my wife. It would be so refreshing to just pull the tapes and figure out who was right. The person who is wrong should apologize and move on. Everyone will get caught in a moment of dishonesty sooner or later. Apologize, learn from it, and move on.   


For me, the people who won't own up to their mistakes when presented video evidence wouldn't be allowed in my life. This would force honesty and anyone that resists would be punished by society. How could you be friends with, work with, or be around someone that continues to lie in the face of evidence?  


I'm not for private videos of us doing non-public things being leaked to the internet. But if everyone is recording, there were be footage of that person recording ""non-public"" behavior, and they should get the entire book thrown at them for trying to damage someone's reputation. 

&#x200B;

I think we should have a healthier relationship with cameras and understand that everybody has to live up to the standards of truth. I'd love for my boss to show me where I contradicted myself, so long as I have the power to go after him/her for broken promises. Same thing with personal relationships.   


I want to live in a more honest society. I think people were scared of always being recorded in the past.   


Now they aren't as much, and there is opportunity to take truth to the next level.   


Granted, footage can be doctored, edited, or taken out of context for someone's gain. But if two drunk people are getting rowdy and start swinging, as long as both are recording, that's two sources of truth to go off of. Lying and manipulating the truth is a lot harder when there are multiple sources of truth. 

&#x200B;

I think this could be the tech that really slows down school shootings. If bully victims can now record their situation at all times, they will be able to compile masses of evidence. Not having a source of truth when it comes to interactions among youth is how we get to people that want to commit suicide but want to cause the same pain to society that they feel they experienced before they go out.  


The only point of weakness in all of this would the bias of the judge or whoever is responsible for going through various video footage when there is any kind of dispute.   


That still puts us in a much better and more truthful situation than ""he said, she said"" situations and witness testimony.   


Combine this with extremely harsh laws against revenge porn, blackmail, or any other way a human could hurt another human by releasing unsolicited images/videos to the internet, I think we would be better off.   


I know most of you are going to come at this from a ""What could go wrong"" mentality. Could you also try and refute my ""what could right"" arguments as well?  


I appreciate you all! This is a fun way to test out my big ideas. I am open to being wrong.

1,2023-11-06,Cmv: Donald trump helped create the Chinese hypersonic nuclear missile program,u/Goos_Blah_Blah,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17pe0xz/cmv_donald_trump_helped_create_the_chinese/,changemyview,"Hello reddit

As many of you know Donald trump is charged with the espionage act. And I think it's as nasty as we can imagine. He helped create china's hypersonic nuclear missile program by taking classified us nuclear documents to mar a lago so they could copy our technology and find ways to attack us easier at the same time. My guess is since he deleted footage at mar a lago we need to assume he did something nefarious like put the documents in front of cameras for them to see as they hack them 

https://www.npr.org/2023/07/28/1190787038/trump-ordered-security-footage-deleted-doj-alleges-in-new-charges

Here's evidence 

2016- steele dossier says trumps connections to russia are dirtier and deeper than his connections to russia. Says trump team enjoys russia focus because it distracts from China 

https://www.salon.com/2020/10/22/steele-dossier-claimed-trumps-corrupt-ties-to-china-were-more-extensive-than-his-ties-to-moscow/

2017 - trump becomes president. Spends lot of time at mar a lago. Talks classified stuff where Chinese spies are

January 2021- trump leaves office. Takes a pile of classified documents with him. Including how to build hypersonic weapons the United States cannot defend against to mar a lago. We can assume it's because he likes to read, or we can assume thay espionage violation is the worst case scenario 

Summer 2021- United states departs a Chinese spy . Chinese spy said to have sensor to detect hidden camera. Had malware etc. If my theory that Donald trump put those documents in front of cameras wasn't true. Why would Donald trump delete the mar a lago footage right as the fbi is arriving at his doorstep? Because this is what really happened 

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/07/mar-a-lago-trump-nuclear-documents-spies



Summer 2021- China fires a hypersonic missile around the world. U.s. intelligence and military say they have no idea how they did this. Jon hyten says they are preparing for a first strike on America. And I'm saying trump is helping them

https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/17/politics/john-hyten-china-hypersonic-weapons-test/index.html

December 2021 Trump admits he gave it to them. Because trump knew and openly said before anyone else on earth the Chinese missile program is based on stolen u.s. technology he gave to them and poorly attempted to blame on Obama . The person he accused of being born in America 


https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10291063/Donald-Trump-claims-Chinas-hypersonic-missile-program-uses-stolen-American-technology.html

This is why trump is being charged

1,2023-11-06,CMV: Autism is bullshit.,u/T12J7M6,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17pfsyi/cmv_autism_is_bullshit/,changemyview,"So recently I bumped into autism in some YouTube talk videos, which got me thinking, and hence I looked up how people get to be diagnosed with autism, and to me it seems like the entire thing is bullshit. 

To go over why I think it is bullshit, here is an online autism test ([link to the test](https://www.clinical-partners.co.uk/for-adults/autism-and-aspergers/adult-autism-test/test)), and below are the test questions with the right answers which will diagnose you as 30/30 autistic, and my comment regarding the question and the right answer, which I made to illustrate my point better:

# Question 1: I prefer to do things on my own, rather than with others.	

The right Answer 1: Definitely agree

Sounds like a normal introvert. Nothing to see here. Also, if you have had bad experiences with people, why would you want to spend time with them? Good people are rare, so nothing wrong in preferring to spend time alone. 

# Question 2: I prefer doing things the same way - for instance my morning routine or trip to the supermarket.

The right Answer 2: Definitely agree 

Can it even be called a mourning ""routine"" if you do it differently every time? Also like who does trips to the supermarket differently? You know what you want and you know the easiest way to get there, so why change anything? Agreeing with this just sounds like the most reasonable thing. If I want to do something fun I don't try to make my supermarket trip fun, but instead just do something fun when I get back home. 

# Question 3: I find myself becoming strongly absorbed in something – even obsessional

The right Answer 3: Definitely agree

Well good for you! Would sounds super sad if you wouldn't be able to do this, or wouldn't have anything that would feel like being worth obsessing over. Having things that you see are worth obsessing over just means you're curious and not dead inside, so this again feels like the most healthy thing to agree with. 

# Question 4: I am very sensitive to noise and will wear earplugs or cover my ears in certain situations

The right Answer 4: Definitely agree

If you are thinking a lot, like when in walks, and you do your walks near cities, I would think wearing earplugs would be a smart thing to do. Also, people in libraries wear earplugs all the time and most libraries even provide them free, so what's the problem? They obviously help concentration so if you have annoying noise and you are often trying to concentrate, it would be dumb not to use earplugs. 

Like disagreeing with this just sounds like that you don't really think anything that often, and hence  you don't need to concentrate, and so by you don't bother with earplugs. 

# Question 5: Sometimes people say I am being rude, even though I think I am being polite.

The right Answer 5: Definitely agree 

Most of the people are too sensitive anyways and just care about feelings and doing and saying the right thing, so all agreeing with this means is that you have some original thoughts and aren't a total conformist and hence have the balls to state your unpopular opinions. Like good for you for not being a total NPC.

# Question 6: I find it easy to imagine what characters from a book might look like.

The right Answer 6: Slightly disagree

Well... Like... what's the book? If you read a lot of non fiction books, like we learn below that autistic people do, one would think that the appearance of the characters isn't that important and hence isn't given that much though in the book and hence you have harder time forming an opinion about it.  On the other hand if you read a lot of non sense novels for example, I would think those types of books put a lot more effort into describing the characters and hence you have easier time imagining what they would look like, so all in all, this just sounds like it is asking ""do you read bullshit or real books"" and hence the answer means nothing. 

# Question 7: I find it easy to talk in groups of people

The right Answer 7: Definitely disagree

Like who is comfortable in talking publicly in front of people, especially when we already agreed that our guy is an introvert? Like basically this question is just asking ""did you agree with the question 1,"" since introverts mostly don't like to talk in big groups.  

# Question 8: I am more interested in finding out about ‘things’ than people

The right Answer 8: Definitely agree 

Like doesn't psychology have some categorization for people who like to think systems and people who like to think people ([Empathising-Systemising\_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathising%E2%80%93systemising_theory))? Like so what? If you have more systemizing mind, good for you, but so what? Its not like it shows in some brain scan or anything, so who cares. 

# Question 9: I find numbers, dates and strings of information fascinating

The right Answer 9: Definitely agree

So basically our guy likes math and connecting dots, so how is that a diagnosable clinical ""condition""? Good that he has interests - leave the guy alone you creeps. I feel like all psychiatrists should be diagnosed with a Diagnostic Exuberance Syndrome (DES), which number one symptom is the need to over diagnose everything, and they should all be treated for it with lobotomy by force, since they are danger to the society if left untreated. 

# Question 10: I prefer non-fiction books and films to fiction

The right Answer 10: Definitely agree

The real world is stranger than fiction, so why would you bother with fiction anyways? Again, the ""autistic"" answer is the most reasonable answer, so well done again displaying your Diagnostic Exuberance Syndrome (DES) you creeps.

Like I really don't get why I need to be part of this epidemic of the Diagnostic Exuberance Syndrome (DES) from which the whole psychiatry seems to be suffering from. Like you fix your shit and leave me alone - I'm fine and totally happy the way I am.  

# Question 11: I find it upsetting if my daily routine is upset or changed

The right Answer 11: Definitely agree

Who wouldn't? Like it is a routine for a reason, the reason being that you have a need for it, and hence obviously if someone messes it up, you get upset. Like to not agree with this means that you wouldn't mind someone just stealing your wallet also, since what the hell - you like a little surprise now and then, don't you?

# Question 12: It’s difficult for me to understand other people’s facial expression and body language

The right Answer 12: Definitely agree

Okay, so maybe our guy has little issues with socializing, but so what? Maybe he was the only child and/or didn't have a lot of friends and hence he haven't had that much practice, so he is just inexperienced. Like are we now pathologizing the condition of being inexperienced? What about virgins? Should we diagnose all virgins with Novice Intimacy Syndrome (NIS), and treat them for it with drugs? Sounds to me like our Diagnostic Exuberance Syndrome (DES) patients in white coats would agree with it. 

# Question 13: I don’t have any problems making small talk with new people

The right Answer 13: Definitely disagree

I would think it takes a rare kind of person to be totally okay with just staring to talk to total strangers about small talk topics, for so reason, and hence the ""autistic"" answer is again the most reasonable one.

# Question 14: I notice very small changes in a person’s appearance

The right Answer 14: Slightly agree

So our guy notices details. Good for him. I bet his girlfriend can appreciate that, since I can't even number the times I have offended some woman by not noticing right away that they did something to their hair. Seems like our guy is just one step ahead. 

# Question 15: When I was young I used to play lots of ‘let’s pretend’ or imaginary games

The right Answer 15: Slightly disagree

Really? So we are now diagnosing people based on what games they played? Okay, so what diagnosis do I get for playing Diablo II as a child? 

# Question 16: I like collecting information about things I am interested in

The right Answer 16: Definitely agree

Who doesn't?!!! If you are interested about it, like the question tells us that you would be, why would you not collect information about the topic? Again, the most common sense answer is the ""autistic"" answer, and hence autism is total bullshit. 

Like what kind of irrational maniac you would need to be to not being autistic? 

# Question 17: I like meeting new people

The right Answer 17: Definitely disagree

Well... I mean... who are the people you would be meeting? Do you live in a bad neighborhood?  Have the people you have met before been assholes to you? Like if Yes, then I understand and wouldn't want to meet them either, so again totally normal answer.

# Question 18: People close to me say I talk about the same things repeatedly

The right Answer 18: Definitely agree

Like when we already established that our guy is passionate regarding some topics, how does it come as a surprise to people than that he acts as if he would be passionate regarding those things? If you are passionate about something, one would assume you like to talk about it a lot, so are we now double diagnosing people who are passionate? 

Also, if people close to him say that he talks about same things, it means that he is talking to people, so how severe can this introversion of him be after all? Like in numerous previous questions we were diagnosing him as autistic for being introverted, and now we are diagnosing him as autistic for expressing extroversion. Like what is going on? our guy can't win this game, since even a the tiniest use of logic in these test will make him ""autistic"".  

It truly sounds to be like ""autism"" is the label how these Diagnostic Exuberance Syndrome (DES) patients try to diagnose logical normal people, and hence the entire thing is bullshit. 

# Question 19: I find it easy to work out what people are thinking or feeling just by looking at their facial expressions

The right Answer 19: Definitely disagree

Well, like we already went over, our guy is socially inexperienced, so if we are going to diagnose that, then lets just call all virgins as Novice Intimacy Syndrome (NIS) patients.

# Question 20: New social situations make me feel anxious

The right Answer 20: Definitely agree

There are people who they don't? Like if the social situation is new, meaning you have never been in a social situation just like that one, I think it is super normal to be anxious about it.   


# Question 21: It’s important to me to carefully plan any activities I am going to do

The right Answer 21: Definitely agree

Its never a bad thing to plan things. Don't really see a negative in being thoughtful.  

# Question 22: I find it hard to work out what people’s intentions are

The right Answer 22: Definitely agree

For the how n:th time, our guy is socially inexperienced - leave him alone. 

# Question 23: I would find it really hard to play imaginary games with children

The right Answer 23: Definitely agree

To be honest, I don't see that often many adults, parents of little children included, playing imaginary games with children either, so I wonder how common it even is to be good at this as an adult, which leaves me wonder how much can be concluded from a question like this. 

# Question 24: I am a good diplomat and can help ease difficult social or work situations

The right Answer 24: Definitely disagree

I would think being a good diplomat takes social practice, which our guy lacked, so naturally he isn't a great diplomat than. Kind of feels like we are just asking the same things in different scenarios, which are

1. Are you an introvert?
2. Do you think a lot?
3. have you had a lot of social experience? 

# Question 25: I am often the last person to understand a joke

The right Answer 25: Definitely agree

Again we are in the topic of lack of social experience. 

# Question 26: I like doing things spontaneously

The right Answer 26: Definitely disagree

I would think that people who have a lot to think about in general don't like spontaneously things, since they like to take time for thinking which spontaneously things interrupt. 

# Question 27: If I am interrupted doing something I find it hard to get back to what I was doing before hand

The right Answer 27: Definitely agree

Again, if I am thinking ""What is 3 + 23"" it might be easy to get back to that, but if I for example am thinking in my head, how I will structure this post, I might experience it way harder to get back to thinking that if someone would interrupt me, so again, we are dealing with the reality that our guy just thinks a lot and his thoughts are complicated and deep. Like how in earth can that be diagnosable thing? Like should we all just think alcohol and not thing - like is that what these people thing is normal? Mind bugling. 

# Question 28: I notice patterns in things all the time

The right Answer 28: Definitely agree

So you brain works. I bet a lot of people in universities hope they would have a better ability to notice patterns. Like aren't some IQ tests pretty much just pattern recognition tests, so doesn't thins just mean that our guy has high IQ? Again, I have really hard time understanding how this would be a bad thing. 

# Question 29: I have some very strong interests and get upset if I can’t pursue them

The right Answer 29: Definitely agree

Who wouldn't!? Our guy is passionate so of course he will be upset if he isn't allowed to pursue his passion. Anyone would be upset. Does one need to be depressed for not be autistic or what? Who in earth would be okay with not being able to pursue their passion?   

# Question 30: I can tell if someone I am talking to is getting bored

The right Answer 30: Definitely disagree

This could be many things. Maybe our guy just assumes all people find his passion interesting and hence isn't looking for signs of boredom in people who hint that they are also somewhat interested in the topic, or maybe this is yet again due to our guy being socially inexperienced, which again doesn't mean anything other than that he is socially inexperienced.

Why did she willingly return to Italy in 2019? 

I was listening to one of her conversations with her parents that had been taped only days after Meredith Kercher's death. She said the words ""I witnessed a murder."" Freudian slip?

i've seen so many f up documentaries about kids who are beaten abused and or killed, and the amount of times they would have been saved if someone one person had just walked.

  
this is a real invasion of privacy but what if there was a trusted group (for the purposes of this hypothetical yes they are actually trusted) that could for example do welfare checks on houses come in look around and check up on the house but the catch is any drug fronts or anything illegal they find have to turn a blind eye and they don't disclose that info to the government they are purely focused on checking for murderers kidnappers etc.

  
similarly in crime docs where people are kidnapped, as a woman walking down the street late at night i'm in fear and so i avoid leaving my house in the evening which is unfair but hey thats life.  
i saw with the invention of ai in china they've started putting cams on crossings so if you dont cross in time your face is put on a screen and you are fined. it got me thinking how would i feel if there were these large screen cameras on the street everywhere as long as the cameras were working i feel as though it would deter a large percentage of crime ( even in a mask they could just follow you from camera to camera on a live feed until you got into a vehicle/ building.)  
how would you feel if it this was the new norm? i like my privacy but i have nothing of importance to hide if i could sacrifice that for a safer place i would.

72,2023-11-06,CMV: I don’t think it’s wrong to have a punishment aspect even if the overall criminal justice system is rehabilitative.,u/Spindoendo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17pig1u/cmv_i_dont_think_its_wrong_to_have_a_punishment/,changemyview,"A lot of people like the concept of rehabilitative justice and I agree for nonviolent crimes. I don’t see the point of throwing someone who’s addicted to coke in prison. 

But I don’t agree that for violent crimes we should primarily focus on rehabilitating the perp. It makes no sense to me for me at all. I asked questions to try to figure this out but it seems like people truly believe punishment shouldn’t even be a goal. For the following reasons I think it should be. 

1. The only reason violent crime is wrong is because it harms the victim and their loved ones, so the victim and the loved ones are the important ones who’s needs should be taken into consideration far before any “rehabilitation” of the person who chose violence.

2. There’s literally no deterrence if you know there’s actually no consequences to your actions. 

3. Some violent crimes disabled their victims permanently, mentally or physically. Or take away their life forever. They deserve some sort of recompense or justice that is not served with the perp doing some therapy and support groups. 

4. Therapy isn’t an exact science and there’s no guarantee it will work, resulting in the individual committing the same crimes and destroying lives. 

5. Unlike property crimes and such the victim can’t be made whole with money. How do you make up for your body being violated?

6. The crime can punish the victim repeatedly in ways they can’t escape. Like stuff like child pornography is on the internet for the rest of the victims lives they have to know people are watching their trauma over and over. Or other ways the victims have to deal with the crime for the rest of their lives. The perpetrator is allowed to walk away with no consequences. Actually, in some models they would have a significantly better life after committing a crime that ruins someone else’s.

I am open to changing this is someone can give me a solid idea of how victims will receive any justice. I would like to advocate for prison reform but not for this awful idea of victims just suffering while the perps are treated with care and respect."

Serbia is *not* in NATO and is thus a ""totally legitimate target"" /s

The obvious result of this would be that Serbs in Serbia would fight like hell, and maybe even the Hungarians in Serbia would pick up arms and fight. It would not be over in three days, or a fortnight, or a month. It would not be a ""police action"" or a ""special military operation"", this would be totally justifiably called war.

I contend that the right and moral thing to do, even as a citizen of the UK, would be to support the Serbs in their effort to cleanse their country of invaders. There's such a thing as international law, which considers irredentism and annexation to be condemnatory acts, never mind laudatory. Change my view?"

In my opinion, I think dying hair is considered really bad and I just don't understand why women are in favor of dying hair despite the fact there are more disadvantages than advantages. Some of the disadvantages include the fact that:

1. Dying your hair is very bad for your health in the long run. Studies show that dying your hair could cause diseases such as cancer at old age
2. It makes you look ugly; in fact, for some women, it will make them look more sexually seducing rather than cute. In fact, I always get erections and a temptation to jerk off on porn videos whenever I see an Asian girl in their 20s with colored hair in public due to the fact Asian girls with dyed hair look like many pornstars
3. It also smells extremely bad as well, with it having an ammonia like flavor
4. If it fades, then you look like a weirdo with half hair and not uniform; people should just keep their natural hair because it looks good on them
5. It could be permanent and if you want to return to normal, you have to redye it and you don't look anymore attractive due to the natural color looking fake (my wife had black hair, if she were to redye it to be black, then she will not look good like she did in 2014)."

It occurs to me, that basketball is a game of a lot of slapping, swiping, and reaching, as well as a lot of exposed skin and faces.

Professional athletes have to meet lots of conditions to play in their games. Long, unkempt, or dirty fingernails pose an obvious health risk to other players. Especially as it relates to the eyes.

So why shouldn’t every NBA player be required to have their fingernails quickly and simply inspected before a game?  It could be done really efficiently for all 15 players over maybe a total of five minutes at almost any point before tip off.

Players that have nails that are deemed too long or dirty would just go back to their athletic training staff and get a tidy up with an nail file or clippers. It would be really easy to address by professional athletic trainers.

What am I missing? Why would this be burdensome? Isn’t the overall improvement in player safety worth a very small, discreet, quick check on player fingernails? Who wants a long dirty fingernail in the eye?"

People went way off the deep end with Orwellian 1984 stuff. The crux of my arguments were more about wearable cameras that people will use to record every moment of their lives and keep ""permanent memories"" on cloud storage. 

I wasn't interested in talking about government corruption and conspiracies. 

So that's the topic of this post. 

I predict that Apple will unveil their new version of Google Glass in 2025-2026 and it will be marketed as the next ""smartphone"" in terms of ground breaking technology. 

It'll have a ton of AR capabilities, which is entirely its own discussion. But what this tech will kick off is the idea of recording your entire life and keeping those videos in cloud storage, which an AI will be used to help you find a memory to relive. 

The first several AR headsets won't be able to record everything. You might have a button to start recording or say a command. Battery and storage bottlenecks will be issues until the market is saturated by the 2030s. 

Eventually a very expensive service will release for the wealthy that allows them to use a wearable device to record their lives for 16 hours a day and keep the footage in permanent cloud storage. Some might even house their own servers in their house if they have the tech knowledge and cash for it. 

By the mid 2030s, it will be wildly popular and millions of people in first world countries will be willing to pay to have permanent memories and an intuitive way to browse them. 

Now, what are the unforseen consequences of tech like this on society? 

That's what I'm here to ask you all. This could become one of the biggest changes in human capability in all society. 

Pairing augmented reality, with AI, with the ability to record your whole life and use AI to better understand your memories is profound. 

Pros: bullying, harassment, rape, and just being an asshole will be faaaaar more difficult to get away with if the victim is recording their experiences. This could reduce crime significantly. People will have crystal clear memories to relive and share with family and friends. Accountability will be far more prioritized. Having a video of you promising one thing but doing another will encourage people to stay true to their word.

Cons: people will be afraid to be genuine in front of even their closest friends and family. It could hurt human connection if every time you leave your home, your actions and words might as well be uploaded to YouTube since you'll be on so many people's recorded footage. If you make a mistake and say something racist or offensive, it will very likely be recorded by someone else and potentially used against you. This could cancel you and banish you to a life without the ability to make a good living due to cancel culture. 

If you become infamous enough that googling your name brings up a video of you saying something racist, it would be a terrible PR move for any company to ever hire you. 

Revenge porn will be huge, but hopefully extreme prosecution of violators will deter people. 

I think that everyone will have to live in a world where nearly all of their actions are pretty much broadcasted to the world, where viewers are waiting to watch cool, hilarious things, or life changing mistakes. 

I think we will all be better off for it though. I love the idea of never forgetting any experience ever and getting to relive memories as if I was really there again. 

People will be less genuine and will be far more scared about the state of their reputation. But bullying, assault, harassment, rape, and other crimes will be so difficult to get away with if there is video evidence that their rates will drop dramatically. 

Asking if someone wants to stop recording and talk off-the-record will be a very intimate thing since you are stripping away your protections in that moment. 

There will be issues around corporations owning your memories (and how they might try to sell your real data) and government warrants to your memories. 

Feasibly, should the government be able to search your entire life experiences for specific crimes? Any crimes if they have a warrant? 

It's a lot to work through. 

At this point, I'm not asking if you would support this future. I already think it's going to happen. It'll be the next big technology after the previous heavy hitters like internet, smart phones, and 3d printers. 

To change my view, tell me why either this future would suck or why you don't think it will even happen. I'm open to changing my mind. 

As a bonus, even if you disagree with everything, try to think of a pro from society going this way. It can't be ALL bad..."

It reminds me of the movie Fantastic Planet where these large blue alien creatures called Draags keep humans-like creatures called Oms as pets and make them dress in silly outfits and make them do tricks and stuff. That's what we do with domesticated animals. Sure we feed them and keep them safe, but like I said, we've basically hijacked their evolution, so now they don't survive and live and evolve on their own, they're under our control; we control their lives completely.

We all suffer pain and discomfort from this world and we cannot escape it, it is the nexus of our reality, instead of blaming each other for our misfortunes we should be blaming the constant flux the world is in, and declare war upon it.

Trauma controls us not politicians, or even infectious ideas. The only path forward for humanity is to accept each other's faults and suffering, whether they be Christian, gay, lesbian, Republican, or Democrat. We discount each other's worries and trauma based on where they are relative to our party line, so we will forever be in pain until one side has hegemony over the other.

If most of you sat down and talked with your enemies you would slowly come to realize that their worries come from a genuine place, so what madness drives you to discard it? Have you really ever tried to understand them or are you just going on what the T.V. man says?

I know most people reading this will only think of the pain they cause their enemy as virtuous, but I hope a few of you see my appeal to humanity for what it is: a hope to foster understanding between us all.

The path forward is obvious but not easy, understanding your enemy and trying to quell their fears is integral to stopping them from thinking they have conflict with you. Shitting on both ends of the extreme left and right is a moral obligation for those of us who want peace in our time. The worst that can happen from this approach is that you understand your enemy, and can destroy them better."

Now while that is true; as an Asian-ethnicity whose parents immigrated to the West, there aren't enough coloured people in power. 

But whites make up 60% of the population of America, 70% in Canada, and upwards of 80-90% in many European countries. So in many instances it does make sense for there to be an overarching majority of white people within these countries, as it accurately reflects the overall population. 

However; the Jewish population is incredibly low at an incredibly minuscule 2%; yet there are upwards of 25-50%, sometimes even 70-80% majorities of Jews in positions of power across entertainment, corporation execs, finance, healthcare, and government administration. It's a definitive power imbalance in the West, and it's odd that pointing it out is considered antisemitic. 

Jews also have an insane amount of Jew/Zionist/Israeli lobbyist groups in America that are basically the reason why the US supports Israel. I don't see NBPLA or something with the same power as AIPAC or the ADL, even though black presence in America far outweighs Jewish presence in terms of population count.

I've heard the counter-argument as to why they are over-represented in entertainment and banking; that those were the only jobs available to them. But it has been a very, very long time since and Jews are and have been equal citizens in the West for decades, and most of them look very Caucasian which  is a big benefit as they look similar to the majority population (some Levant Arabs have this advantage as well), which means more acceptance.

It works absolutely perfectly, with one exception: the battery is going.  This phone is over five years old, so I'm not surprised.  

Now, in a perfect world, I'd be advocating for the phone to include a battery that is easily replaced by the user, but I know this isn't going to happen.  So I'm going to shift my focus instead onto Low Power Mode, which is found under Settings > Battery.  

When I use this mode, my battery life gets much better.  But there's an annoying catch: when the phone is charging, this mode automatically turns off once the charge hits 80%.  Now, there are workarounds requiring multiple steps that allow users to somewhat circumvent this, but my view is that Apple should simply program in another toggle switch on that settings page that says something like ""always on"", and then the phone stays in low power mode until the user explicitly turns it back off.  And before anyone says it, yes, I understand that it's more than just ""adding a switch"", and that other parts of iOS's operating code would need to be modified.  But updates to iOS aren't entirely uncommon, so I'd advocate that this be added to the list of changes made in an upcoming release. 

Yes, this setting has an impact on a number of phone features that some people may not love.  But for people who primarily use their phone as just that - a telephone or texting device - those features aren't really necessary.  And of course, if people did want the low power mode to turn off once the charge hit 80% again, that would still be an option.  Adding this toggle switch wouldn't remove the feature; it would only give people the choice to enable or disable it. 

So CMV, Reddit.  Why would this toggle switch be a bad idea?  What harm would it cause?

Functioning meaning, lower rates of crime, longer life, more education, and closer to equal opportunity. The only arguments I tend to hear is “it is the best option we have” or “it is better than Socialism/Communism.” I think it is very limiting to think there couldn’t be a better system - one that is new, just because it hasn’t happened or been labeled yet. I also don’t think “the best we have” is an argument against criticism. My main issue with Capitalism is valuing money and growth above all else, which often results in  bad outcomes for workers and money pooling into the hands of smaller and smaller amounts of people who gain more and more power. I also don’t believe “free market” and “Capitalism” are interchangeable. I think it is entirely possible to have a “free market” model not based on values of profit and growth.

according to the telegraph newspaper


  Ben Gvir announced his ministry is purchasing 10,000 rifles in order to arm civilian security teams, specifically those in towns close to borders, as well as mixed Jewish-Arab cities and West Bank settlements.

The minister, who heads the far-right Otzma Yehudit party, says 4,000 assault rifles have already been bought from an Israeli manufacturer and will be distributed immediately.

Helmets and bulletproof vests have also been acquired and will be distributed along with the assault rifles.

Ben Gvir said the weapons and equipment will be distributed to “hundreds of towns that have civilian security teams linked to the Israel Police’s Border Police force.”



my point of view i think instead of supplying arms to settlers Israel should have increased police forces in the settlements.

giving arms to settlers will increase violence and terrorist acts ."
1,2023-11-07,CMV: On the conservative reaction to the leaked manifesto.,u/Mitoza,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17px80z/cmv_on_the_conservative_reaction_to_the_leaked/,changemyview,"Title line too small to capture the scope of my view. 

CMV: The conservative reaction to the release of the Nashville shooter's manifesto being leaked by Stephen Crowder is purely a search for ammunition to reify a white persecution complex, distrust of the media, and anti-left sentiment.

Facts of the Case:

1. The Nashville Shooting happens in March 2023. The police relatively quickly kills the shooter, investigates their apartment, and finds their ""manifesto"" an allegedly 20 page document. The cops note its rambling and unhinged nature and deem the motive to be unclear.

2. Conservatives wasted no time to scapegoat the shooter's transgender identity and supposed left-aligned politics to paint trans people as dangerous and the left as guilty of something amounting to stochastic terrorism. https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/03/30/nashville-shooting-transgender-shooter/

3. During the investigation and media storm that follows, families of the victims lobbied the government to seal the shooter's writings believing that it would be harmful for their healing process. 

4. Organizations like the scammy [National Police Association](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/investigations/2019/03/17/national-police-association-says-its-helping-police-chiefs-say-its-scam/3144585002/) are lobbying to get the documents released.

5. Stephen Crowder posts a leak of 3 out of the 20 pages on twitter. The story begins to spread around places like reddit. Since the document is full of hate speech and since a sizable amount of the utility conservatives see in releasing the document is to make more hate speech, and since the documents are being linked perhaps illegally, reddit removes it.

And now, if you head into any thread in a right wing leaning sub, you will get some version of a conspiracy theory: 

1. That the manifesto is being kept from the people because it demonstrates anti-white terrorism that the left wing political project desires and needs to remain covert

2. That the media is trying to cover this up unlike other shooting cases because they don't want to say anything that could be seen as negative regarding a transgender person. 

Both of these conspiracy theories are based on a post hoc rationalization of a white persecution complex, a distrust of the media, and anti-left sentiment. To believe them is to ignore the actual facts of the case, which is why conservatives talking about this issue don't talk about the facts. They ask leading questions meant to tease the edges of their conclusion while ignoring facts that actually answer the question.

**""Why was manifesto XYZ released shortly after the shooting but the media wouldn't report on this?""** Because the manifesto wasn't released on urging of the families of the victims.

**""Why is it when the shooter is right wing the media talks about it forever but this one is brushed under the rug?""** It was talked about, a lot. The Democrats in Tennessee have been reacting to it for the last 6 months with support from the state's Republican governor to pass gun reform bills. What they aren't doing is using this as a scapegoat for anti-trans rhetoric, which is what they want. 

The conservative interest in this case is a disgusting politicization of the events on that day to push identity politics and culture war nonsense.

You can change my view by convincing me that conservatives are largely acting in good faith despite the obviousness of the tactic, that the true facts of the case as I know them are incorrect, or that the conservative project in this case is something other than a slimy attempt to turn a tragedy into a culture war battle."

Conversations about what restaurant to go to that night? They are all overpriced businesses that want to make money.

Meanwhile, the only topics these people are capable of holding a conversation about are their job, schoolwork (if they have kids), and what chores they need to do that day. They think it shows they have priorities.

Based on the context, it sounds like they're just complaining about diversity. I think more diversity is a good thing, because the world is diverse. That's just reality.  
  
I love the show Friends, but I'm going to pick on it a bit just as an example. It takes place in New York, and all the main characters are straight white people. Almost all the supporting characters are white people. It isn't very realistic in its portrayal of New York, because the city in reality is not 99% white people.  
  
My point is-- having more diversity makes sense and is more of a good thing than a bad thing. It's a net positive.  
  
Now let's look at some of the arguments these people make:  
  
**""Executives are forcing diversity just to pander.""**  
  
Probably. But executives have always pandered. Their job is to appeal to people in order to maximize profit. Why zero in on diversity as the main cause of this? It's a broader issue of studios chasing the dollar. At least in this case, the result of having more diversity isn't really a bad thing.  
  
**""They sacrifice good writing for diversity.""**  
  
Once again, these are two separate things. I agree that telling a good story should be the focus. Why would diversity have anything to do with this? Why pick out diversity as the thing that is making movies forget to tell a good story? There have always been poorly written movies long before diversity was encouraged.  
  
**""They make unnecessary changes to things we love.""**  
  
Anytime something is brought back for a reboot or new adaptation, there are going to be changes. Not all of these changes will be strictly ""necessary"". As long as you don't have an attitude of being resistant to all change, I don't see why changing something just to be more diverse is a bad thing. Why not instead just blame the changes that actually harm the story and characters? A minor change like a character having a different skin color does not sound harmful to me. It sounds like a very minor change.  
  
**Conclusion**  
  
To bring it all together, let's suppose they rebooted Friends with entirely new actors playing the same characters. And none of the acting was good. And they changed the race of one of the the main characters. And the writing was terrible. What would you think of all this? What would you mention in a critical review of it?  
  
I would think rebooting it in the first place is a completely unnecessary cash grab. I would be irritated by how bad the writing is. And I would point out how the new portrayals are not nearly as good as the original cast. So I'd have a lot of criticisms of the reboot, but none of this has anything to do with diversity or being ""woke"". If they decided to make Rachel black, I wouldn't care that the character was black. I would care that the new actor doesn't do as good of a job as Jennifer Aniston.  
  
Am I missing something? Where does this anger towards diversity come from? "

51,2023-11-07,CMV:Zee makes more sense than Zed,u/Tuvinator,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17q0ech/cmvzee_makes_more_sense_than_zed/,changemyview,"For starters, it rhymes better with the song (twinkle twinkle little star tune).

The English letter names can be divided into two main types: Consonant followed by vowel structure (A,B,C,D,E,G,I,J,K,P,Q,T,U,V,Y,Z), or vowel structure followed by consonant (F,H,L,M,N,O,R,S,X). Then there are the exceptions that don't quite match. H could be removed from the second structure because it isn't quite a consonant. W is a description of what the letter looks like (although calling it double v like other languages would probably make more sense) rather than a pronunciation indicator. Then, we have Z, which Americans call Zee, and other English speaking nations call Zed. Zed is in all likelihood a remnant of zeta from the Greek alphabet, but since in English we have gotten rid of other remnants (we say ay instead of alpha and bee instead of beta, etc..), why would we insist on keeping this particular remnant? 
(weak additional comment) In general languages simplify over time, and zee feels easier to say then zed since only one consonant needs to be formed by the mouth."

The largest sources of CO2 emissions are electricity and heat production (25%), agriculture/forestry (24%), and industry (21%).

So, if we were able to replace 100% of personal vehicles with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) overnight, we'd still be pumping over 93% of the current amount of CO2 into the atmosphere the next day.

The only organizations powerful enough to force change in industry, electricity generation, and agriculture are federal governments. Instead, what we see in many first-world countries is billions of dollars being handed out in subsidies to get consumers to purchase BEVs, when even in the best case scenario we already know it will make a limited impact on climate change. The money, time, and effort would be better spent on literally any other sectors that are responsible for the overwhelming majority of CO2 emissions.

1,2023-11-07,CMV: Gun control is good,u/56king56,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17q0i1y/cmv_gun_control_is_good/,changemyview,"As of now, I believe that the general populace shouldn’t have anything beyond a pistol, but that even a pistol should require serious safety checks. I have this opinion because I live in America with a pro-gun control family, and us seeing all these mass shootings has really fueled the flame for us being anti-gun. But recently, I’ve been looking into revolutionary Socialist politics, and it occurred to me: how could we have a Socialist revolution without some kind of militia? This logic, the logic of revolting against an oppressive government, has been presented to me before, but I always dismissed it, saying that mass shootings and gun violence is more of an issue, and that if we had a good government, we wouldn’t need to worry about having guns. I still do harbor these views to an extent, but part of me really wants to fully understand the pro-gun control position, as it seems like most people I see on Reddit are for having guns, left and right politically. And of course, there’s also the argument that if people broke into your house with an illegally obtained gun, you wouldn’t be able to defend yourself in a society where guns are outlawed; my counter to that is that it’s far more dangerous for society as a whole for everyone to be walking around with guns that it is for a few criminal minds to have them. Also, it just doesn’t seem fair to normalize knowing how to use a highly complex piece of military equipment, and to be honest, guns being integrated into everyone’s way of life feels just as dystopian as a corrupt government. So what do you guys have to say about this? To sum, I am anti-gun but am open to learning about pro-gun viewpoints to potentially change my view."

I think that's a pretty reasonable thing to ask of a politician. Yes, Trump may win because of this, but I refuse to endorse genocide, no matter what.

And please believe me that I am a pragmatist. Politicians lie. They say what they want to get votes. It is up to me to choose the party which I believe have my interest in mind or at least does less harm than the other. I'm all for doing what ""needs to be done"". I understand compromises are the name of the game. I'm an avid lover and fan of history so I do get it. 

But as a young Black American, I can never compromise on slavery, and I can never compromise on genocide. If I was asked to wipe out all white people so it meant slavery never happened, a part of me would definitely want to choose the heinous option, but I could never willing condemn innocent people to death for my own gain.

All that to say, there is no ""lesser evil"" when both evils commit equally heinous acts."
1,2023-11-07,CMV: Here's some of my views. I've explained each below: Black Face isn't racist. You can't own land. Most cops don't deserve our respect. We should eat prisoners not pigs. Men should lose their dicks if they rape someone. Guns don't kill people. Politicians not working for the people should be hung,u/Parzival_59,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17q1578/cmv_heres_some_of_my_views_ive_explained_each/,changemyview,"I just feel like stirring the pot sometimes. And yes there are general statements. Obviously they don't apply to every unique situation. 

Black face paint doesn't mean anything, it's how someone uses it that makes them racist. Same with actors dressing up in fat suits, or acting disabled. Who gives a fuck? If they're disrespecting people it's on the individual not the act of dressing up or impersonating. 

Owning land blows my mind. You're gonna tell me that the plants, rocks and trees that have existed for 100-1000000 years are now yours just because some white people said so lile 300 years ago? You're going to shoot people if they come onto ""your"" land? WTF. 

I've met a lot of cops who are just doing their jobs. Not critically thinking about what they are doing with their lives. And are just enforcing policies that some group of probably old white people decided on. I don't respect people who enforce rules and take money from me because they're blindly following orders and ""serving the public"". Lots of cops have power issues, will ticket you if you don't stroke their egos.  

Pigs who we eat daily probably have more intelligence and compassion than pedophiles, rapists, bankers who participate in recession causing activities, car salesmen, and Facebook scammers. All I'm saying is there's a lot of meat to be had with creatures we don't need around. 

Some men haven't evolved past the caveman age. That's fine. But if you rape my daughter I should be allowed to cut off your balls without going to prison for ""assault"". No I don't forgive you. No I don't love you and believe you can change. Tough shit. 

I wish everyone had a gun. Maybe people would stop lying and abusing each other if they knew that a lack of integrity could get them shot. Maybe I wouldn't need to pay for the cops to pull me over and ticket me for having tint on my god damn windows. 

Politicians? Don't work for the people. Obviously. If they did we wouldn't have so many problems."

So I’ve come up with a solution to fix everything:

**Give the state of Mississippi to Israel.**

The way I see it, there are no long-term drawbacks. 

- the conflict ends immediately and completely and nobody else has to die. 

- Israel is close to their greatest ally and protected from any harm that would come to them. 

- The US gets to benefit from a close ally connected by land borders and can forge new alliances with Levantine countries that are much happier about controlling more land. 

- Jews still have a homeland with a solid base of infrastructure, direct ocean access for trade, and plenty of opportunities to recreate their tourism and technology sectors. 

- Mississippians can either choose to stay where they are and receive dual citizenship, or easily move elsewhere (the governments can help by buying houses/land at or above market price)

Outside of the logistical issues, I see nothing but positives. Yes, you give up some historical monuments, but you won’t have to worry about stepping on eggshells or having a mosque built on top of you holiest site. Hell, they could rebuild the whole temple if they wanted to. I think there could be a way to work out a deal where Jerusalem becomes a free city so nobody can impede travel there."

She’s not super pushy about rights or anything, but she stopped eating at Chic Fil A. She stopped the moment she learned that Chic Fil a donated to anti Lbgtqia groups, meaning they didn’t support gay folks. Honestly before I got with her, I wouldn’t have cared, but out of respect for her I avoid chic fil a and even when I’m with friends, I’ll suggest something else if it comes up. Well today, my suggestions didn’t work, after quite some time of not eating at a chic fil a I ate at a location directly across the street from a college. The place was PACKED! I mean, no room for thought, wall to wall, club scene packed. This forced me to look around at who was there, and I see pink hair, loose fitting bad bunny jeans, and other things that scream “im young and I want you to know that I’m from the LGBTQIA community!!” (I don’t judge, but the looks are definitely telling.) It made me wonder, why doesn’t anyone actually care enough to stop eating here? Im sure if you took a poll, no one in that restaurant would oppose gay marriage. Yet the place is busting at the seams with people who look like they may be in a gay wedding. I also literally saw a gay couple eating once I got my food and sat down, I asked them how the chicken was… “delicious”. 

Child Labor: When I was younger, I remember adults being weary of items that were *too cheap*. You knew that there had to be a catch, the catch was sometimes poor quality, but typically even the quality couldn’t be compromised so much to deflate the price so drastically. Child labor was the next guess, especially if you know the labor was coming from Asia. Today places like Temu (I think shien too) are operating from provinces that are known to use child labor, and they have the low prices to prove it, why won’t people stop buying from these places? People want to complain about child labor, but turn around and utilize it when it’s convenient. 

I think people like to complain more than they like to take action. What do you guys think?"

If it is not pay2win, then the only source of income is cosmetics.  Which are one time purchases.  You are'not gonna get very rich off of that.  Plenty of people will be more interested in the pvp or the PvE then cosmetics, and they won't buy them.

Some games severely limit free accounts if you don't pay to subscribe.  This is NOT Freemium. Freemium theoretically means you can do everything without paying money.

So to get more people to pay, you allow buying boosted experience, or ingame items.  It's still in theory not required. But now it's pay2win if they are allowed in pvp. and now non payers really are second class.  And even if it's just exp boost or currency, it heps you get better gear, which may be needed for PvE or PVP.  

In theory it's possible to have it so whales subsidize the game so other players can play without spending a lot.  Usually the plan is people with more time than money can farm and sell to people with more money than time.  Seems fair enough.  In practice, inevitably some free players end up gaming the system, and there is a crackdown that severely limits the ability for people to mange to do it without paying.  

A subscription model, or trail with subscription after is more honest. it's not pay2win cuz everybody pays the same. everybody helps pay for the server and development costs.  if its' a good game people will pay.  

Let's take mobile games.

Nearly all have IAPs.  In theory they aren't mandatory.  In practice without some sort of energy limit bypassable with spending or stupidly impossible level that you won't beat in a million years without paying (and usually the game has both) you aren't gonna pay money. The only reason to pay at all is either because you are annoyed with the ads that are constantly spamming you, or becaus eyou are stuck. But getting stuck because you didn't pay is predatory in of itself.  There's no game of that type that doesn't do this.  Can you find even ONE modern mobile casual freemium game that doesn't do this? One that never gets you stuck cuz you aren't ponying up money?

The more honest way would be a limited number of free levels, with unlimited lives.  Once you beat them, pay for the next batch of levels.  they can keep adding levelpacks, and you can keep buying them.  If the game is fun, the levelpacks will be worth the money. maybe allow you to watch ads over a period of days to pay for the next level pack.  

Gacha games?  All pure evil and pay2win.  Gacha+4X? evenmore so.  They litereally don't work at all without pay2win. Which is predatory.  Buy to play with grindable gacha and no energy limit is the best you can do and not be predatory.  Gacha is in itself fun, 

Please tell me i'm wrong. :)"
1,2023-11-07,CMV: Inflation in of itself doesn't make things more expensive.,u/RageQuitRedux,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17q354k/cmv_inflation_in_of_itself_doesnt_make_things/,changemyview,"In an unrealistic scenario in which inflation is totally uniform, then everything increases in price by the same amount, including wages, and then it becomes a wash -- no one is any better or worse off; we can afford exactly the same as we have before. 

This is not true for savings and debts, but put a pin in that for a second.

Of course, inflation is never uniform. It's an average based on a basket of goods. Some products will rise in price faster than that average, some products will rise in price more slowly than the average (or even decrease in price). The same goes for wages.

So the best way to think about it is: items which increased in price faster than inflation are more expensive; items which increased in price more slowly than inflation are _less_ expensive -- even though the sticker price went up.

So if your spending is dominated by things like cars and housing that have outpaced inflation, and/or your wages have not kept up with inflation, then you're probably having a bad time.

But even in those scenarios, the sticker price is misleading. If you see the price of a car rise by 10% in a year, that doesn't mean it's 10% more expensive in real terms. If average inflation that year was 5%, then the car is actually only 5% more expensive.

And even if the index (the CPI in the US) doesn't reflect your personal spending very well, it's likely that you're somewhat balancing that 5% increase with items that got less expensive in real terms.

Back to the issue of savings and debts.

If you have money in a savings account, inflation will erode its value, so that's bad for you.

But if you have debts, then your real debt payments have gotten smaller, which is good for you (bad for the bank).

If you're a net debtor, then inflation is good for you in this respect."

You like playing monopoly? Isn’t it cool and catchy how the game evolves and the fight and struggle catches our full attention and creates joy?

Exactly.
It immediately stops being funny. Instantly.
It becomes meaningless to approach more because you can only utilize so much.

What if life is the same? What if you only then realize that you can only sleep in one bed/house, have so many meals or drinks a day? 
What if you wasted all your life to achieve that material security only to realize that it destroyed all the ambitions and goals in your life?

Think carefully what you want and wish for. 
Think carefully what you let into your mind.
The thoughts will become ideas, the ideas will become habits and the habits will become you.

I think all movements from veganism to BBM should be respected on their own and their representation is admirable in itself. They have a purpose to exist. It is one of the reasons that it's sad to see these once meaningful movements be used for power and manipulation by people that in reality could care less about what they claim to represent. 

An example of this is feminism. There's two types of approaches to feminism. One is pretty amazing. There are women that defend other women from abuse, assault, give shelter and safety, help others with their kids as a community and truly care and want to inspire other women to stand up to injustice. The other types are what I call feminism Karens. They are the type that see men as less than, tear and judge other women down for their life choices, seem angry all the time and want to push their agenda on others so other women can be like that. They just have an overall entitled behavior. I think it's these karens that people see within Feminism often and it is this negative influence that makes others treat feminism as something to make fun of and the real feminists get blamed for it. 

Veganism is another example. There are vegans that are very nice, respectful, share their beliefs and want educate on animals and the conditions that they live in to others that might not know about it and make an effort to represent their beliefs by not eating animal products. That should be what it's about. Then you have those extremists that insult anyone that eats a bacon cheeseburger and uses shame and guilt tactics and some can even become aggressive and demanding, thus making a beautiful movement look like something to joke about and mock. 

Trends are another thing. One can argue that a movement becoming trendy can lead to more attention and more support but that support and attention through that treatment is fleeting because trends are fleeting and for people that support it just for views or it's what's popular can distract from what it's about and what movements were made for.

It's often these factors that ruins the purpose and heart of what a movement is supposed to be and make others not take these things seriously within society.

Sadly other newer movements could follow this pattern of poor representation as well and decrease help and support that it once had when it started but this is Cmv so I would like to hear other people's opinion on this. I will say that I won't answer any comments with insults directed at me or aggressive comments towards me and my view so let's just be respectful, please."

School system right now teaches one of the most important life skills in life. Discipline. It hardens you to never be late and on time, carefully listen to instructions given, ask questions and learn by yourself. Without those skills, society at large would fall apart since we humans must stay productive.

Another thing is that those same angsty teens say that ""school is unfun"" and that ""school doesn't teach you anything useful"". Well that's because you aren't engulfing yourself in the material, and instead choosing to spend all day behind a mini tv screen meant to drain away all your attention span.

This leads a lower quantity of funds to be loaned in response to the price increase, which results in lower inflation due to decreased consumption. 

The issue with this is that the net payer of interest in the US economy is the government. This means that higher interest rates lead to the government paying more money into the economy, increasing the money supply. General economic consensus suggests that excess growth in the money supply has a direct positive relationship with inflation."

China has icy relations *at best* with most of her neighbors. China however has (had?) a faster growing economy compared to the U.S.  Additionally, a *historical* map would reveal that the region of “China,” governed by a Han Chinese authority, has dominated the region for centuries. In Chinese history, their “de jure” sovereignty was interrupted by western expansion during the 19th-20th century. America and her allies currently occupy this “historic” territory due the aftermath of WW2. 

US influence hegemony since the “end” of the Cold War is waning in Eastern Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean, the Near East, and obviously with China & in the South China Sea. The US Domestic position is “problematic” to put it gently, and her economy whispers of recession while the global economy still requires medication since COVID.  

The Chinese domestic situation is also troubling, as is her economy. But her military has likely never been sharper, although lacking in recent combat experience. They appear to be the supreme partner their “axis” of friendly powers (Russia, N. Korea, Iran(?)), and they currently draw less ire than the West in the sputtering Global South. 

Taiwan possesses the worlds premier semiconductor facility, TSMC, which supplies the bulk of the global supply of high-tech equipment, which is needed for modern war. Taiwan is a U.S. “ally.” China claims Taiwan is a rouge province. Military science evolves at a rapid pace one moment you’re in the bleeding edge, the next you’re obsolete. Perhaps a splendid first strike is the difference between subjugation and revolution. Or perhaps it’s a road to complete domination. 

There likely has never been a better time for China to upset America’s delicate global leadership as she deals with two massive crises, and a tense domestic election looming…or this could be a path to complete destruction. It likely is a path to complete destruction regardless, for the entire world. So maybe the gamble would be insane for China and pax America will continue for the coming century. And perhaps by some diplomatic miracle Washington & Beijing will carve stable spheres of influence, and they will continue to be a satisfied global power in their respective zones. 

Although I doubt it… but please Change My View!

TL;DR: china and the US will inevitably conflict soon because the U.S. is weak but could get stronger, and China is strong but could get weaker. Taiwan is the linchpin and the need to control the region and its resources in the near-term will force China (or America)’s hand."

Society doesn’t suffer because their’s nothing about masculinity that makes it necessary for soldiers, engineers, prime ministers or CEOs to be successful. Many feminine men and many women excel in these roles. The problem here is men aren’t getting the message that masculinity isn’t necessary anymore. You can chose to engage in it if you want, no one’s starting a war against men. But society, women and even your own wellbeing is increasing no longer affected by it. Back when men needed to be stoic breadwinners perhaps it served a purpose, but now? Men should mind their own business and live their life however they want, if you want to me masculine that fine, if another man doesn’t that doesn’t make them a beta it simply means they’ve chosen to no longer engage in an archaic institution that serves no benefit, but increasingly does more harm, to our society.

So let me explain my reasoning and I'll be honest, it's a bit shallow, which is why I came here.

I believe that the United Kingdom is on course for some sort of political revolution. The recent protests against Liz Truss' government and the crisis in Palestine has shown that the government isn't keen on respecting civil rights, illustrated by the authoritarian behavior of Scotland Yard in suppressing said protests. This is even worse now with the Palestinian solidarity marches in London, with the MET police saying the planned march on Saturday (October 11) should not take place and will probably ban it (current speculation). 

These are a few recent examples of authoritarian behavior by the MET Police and their actions aren't condemned by the government, in fact, they're sanctioned. This is why I believe a grassroots revolution by the people could take place. I don't believe it could possibly be violent (beyond riots and massive civil disobedience) but I do believe such a great pressure could be placed on the government through extremely disruptive actions, depending on the severity of the government's response, we may also see domestic terrorism, but King Charles III may even get involved if the military were to be loyal to the crown so he can whip Parliament into shape, draft a new constitution perhaps, with the people's consent (I know, ludicrous idea but this is an extreme circumstance).

The UK's politique has long been in turmoil with useless Conservative governments one after the other doing no good for the British population, failing to properly react to the immigration crisis, Scottish Independence/autonomy, Brexit, close to bringing back the Troubles in NI by violating the Good Friday Agreement in several ways and not allowing an Irish unification referendum, NHS underfunding and the threat of privatization, etc. The government's actions have been particularly authoritarian lately and it's not out of the question that these suppressions of civil rights and the strength of Westminster's grip will worsen. Their reaction to, and support for Israel is typical Western bias and underhanded interests in the Middle-East but it is absolutely morally vacant, the UK's government has no leg to stand on when it comes to human rights, considering they violate their own civil rights regularly and have been documented committing war crimes and human rights abuses in foreign countries, FOR IT'S ENTIRE EXISTENCE.

Like many Western governments, the UK is haunted by neo-fascism and Eurocentrism, and of course a sprinkle of some disgusting ethnic nationalism that keeps them distanced from the continent while still believing Europe is superior to the rest of the world.

Anyways for the conversation, I'd like polite, sincere, and intelligent responses. I'd like for you guys to give me the knowledge and wisdom I lack, the nuance I miss.

Please NO COMMENTS ON ISRAEL OR PALESTINE. I do not care to argue the morality of supporting Israel with anyone, that's off topic. I will not change my mind, Israel is heavily documented committing human rights abuses and war crimes on live TV and the UK Government shamelessly supports them.

And please no tu quoques against other governments.

Than you! Look forward to a productive and eye opening conversation."

Long term weight loss can come from a calorie deficit below your maintenance calories maybe about 300 to 500, same with long term weight gain. 

Exercising will help you burn more calories throughout the day and add to your calorie budget and overtime the additional muscle mass will burn a little bit more at rest compared to the standard body.
 
This is how you lose weight. I'm not sure why I see so many people disagree with this when this is exactly how I have always been taught it works.

Sure there are other minute factors: 

Water retention from medicines, illness, surplus of carbs or sodium.

Less calorie burning effectiveness due to illness.

Proper water intake, sleep amount, fat and protein intake, vitamin and mineral intake will make you burn calories will make you burn calories more effectively.

At the end of the day, there really isn't a big difference between airbnb hosts and landlords. But what I find is that airbnb hosts make more effort, solve household problems faster, and give far more respect. And why is this? Because of reviews.

For the past year or more, I've taken the digital nomad life and practically move around places with daily bookings. For example, I'm currently doing 40+ days in a hotel/condo through Agoda. Me and my partner keep returning to this place in particular because it's in a good location, spacious and has a kitchen.

When we report a problem to the staff, it gets resolved within an hour. They then apologise for making you wait. If we were renting it and had a landlord? Pfft, wouldn't expect it fixed for at least a month.

What do landlords have in common with hotels and airbnbs? They all provide accommodation.

What do they not have in common? Landlords provide terrible service because there's no downsides to being a terrible landlord.

Bring in landlord reviews. Every rental listing should have a link to the reviews page of the landlord renting it."

Violence would only make the situation worse.

Second thing out the gate is that I am not from the US, so I'm watching the US meltdown from overseas. I mean no disrespect, I enjoyed visiting the country (a few years back) and everyone I met was an amazing ambassador for the US.

My view:

- There is a deeply ingrained focus on ""identity politics"" in the current political system of the US, with these two men being focal points for it. The focus is less on domestic and foreign policy, and more on which side of the culture war you land on.
- Somewhat related to this, people tend not to be expressing interest in electing a particular candidate, but are more interested in stopping the other person from being elected by ""voting for the other guy""
- This has led to the obsession on the ""Who"" of the presidency, rather than a cumulative ""What"" and ""How"" of the presidency
- Neither party leaders seem willing to step down or give up their race, and seem to want to endorse this focus on the 'Presidential Who', and the centrality of identity politics
- Having both party leaders die (peacefully), would mean that the candidates would be less known, less influential, carry less baggage, and be less arrogant about their chances of victory
- This would cause (especially amongst purple) voters to reassess their current leaning for president, and investigate the positions of the respective parties
- Voters would be more informed about what their vote will do
- The only real democracy is an informed democracy.

Change my view,

A concerned Australian."

805,2023-11-08,"CMV: The narrative that ""a voice actor should only voice characters of the race they belong to"" is not only nonsense, but has the potential to horribly backfire on the people promoting it if applied to them without excuses and compromises.",u/Delusional_Gamer,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17qex82/cmv_the_narrative_that_a_voice_actor_should_only/,changemyview,"Let's deconstruct this narrative. It's very straightforward. A voice actor of race X, should only voice a character also of race X. If character is of race Y, then only a voice actor of race Y should play that character.  
I disagree with this. To me, voice acting comes down to the quality of your voice, your ability to take on the role and voice it. To me the narrative being put forward is nonsense, because what it is pushing goes against what I see voice acting as. It promotes the disqualification of a so many talents, based on solely on their race. We demote ourselves from choosing quality to now choosing skin color.  
Now to be clear, I am not saying people of a race are not good at voicing certain races or their own race. Rather, I am arguing that we are making quality less of a priority. And to illustrate this, let me entertain two scenarios:  
1. A white voice actor is chosen to voice a person of color because they are better at voicing the \*\*character\*\*, than the voice actor who is of the same race of the character, \*\*but\*\* is not as suited to the character as the people making the content desire.  
2. A \*\*non-white\*\* and \*\*non-Japanese\*\* voice actor, is chosen to voice a \*\*Japanese\*\* character in an anime, even though the character is not their race, because their voice acting ability is better suited to that character than the available Japanese voice actors who are the character's race, but not as suited for that character.  
I support both of these scenarios for being reality, because in both cases the \*quality\* of the persons ability to voice the character is what took priority. If the voice actor is chosen for a character who is also of their race, it should be because they had the talent to voice a character, who is not just defined by their skin but their way talking, the \*personality\* of their voice, which the actor was able to bring out better than other actors. Not because they were the same race as that character.  
Now I also made the claim in my view that the narrative has the potential to \*backfire\* on the people promoting it. And to explain it quite simply I need only point out that the people promoting these views... A themselves voicing characters not of their race. I don't even mean voicing non-human-like characters. I mean human beings or human equivalent characters who are of a certain race/ethnicity, being represented by voice actors who are not that race/ethnicity.  
For example:  
Mr SungWon Cho. Ethnicity: Korean.  A prominent promoter of this narrative.  
His roles include:  
Vice Admiral Legrange - Anglo-French ([86](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=24481))  
Kajinosuke Tanikaze - Japanese ([Records of Ragnarok](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=24643))  
Koutaro Tatsumi - Japanese ([The Honor Student at Magic High School](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=23898))  
This nice video reel of his roles [on his Twitter (X) account](https://twitter.com/i/status/1717961644331208749). Plenty of non-Asian, let alone non-Korean roles there  
Ms Shakyra Dunn. Ethnicity: Black as per her twitter. An example I wish to put forward of who this would backfire on.  
Her roles are all compiled her by herself which saved me a lot of trouble:  
[On her instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cx5yR18uKwW/)  
Now if we were to apply this narrative upon them, then they would have to relinquish a great number of roles, not because they can't voice them well, but because they are not the same race/ethnicity. And I am willing to bet that a good number of the voice actors who promote this narrative would also lose a large portion of their roles, because they do not fit the race of the character. In other words, it would backfire on them.  
The only way to avoid this backfiring would be to make exceptions and compromises. To say ""Oh well but this is different...."". No if we are going to go with this, then we need to go all the way. If this narrative is going to dominate voice acting then everyone should face the consequences that come with it, regardless of their race. And that would be the biggest backfire for the entire voice acting community for what I believe is absolute nonsense.  
It would reduce voice acting to be a race based profession first and talent based profession second. The mighty Kratos from God of War (Norse) is voiced by Christopher Judge, a man who has my favorite voice for Kratos in the series. But Kratos is Greek. And since voice acting is supposed to be done by the matching race.. Oh well I guess Christopher loses his job huh?  
I hope I have properly illustrated my view. And hope to see if anyone can find a way to change my view. You may change it by convincing me that voice acting should be about race first and talent second and that this would not backfire on the people promoting it."

I would argue that traditional values have a unique ability to provide stability in times of increased social instability. In the wake of World War II, the United States saw a return to traditional values, such as patriotism, family, and personal responsibility. These values provide a sense of unity, purpose, and identity that is often sorely missing in times of uncertainty. Furthermore, traditional values have been a stabilizing force throughout human history.

Moreover, traditional values provide a sense of continuity and connection between generations. They provide a foundation for our societal norms and institutions, and a sense of unity and shared purpose that can be sorely lost during times of turmoil. Ultimately, traditional values provide a foundation for social and cultural stability, and play a crucial role in maintaining the health and well-being of our society.

Traditional values are the tried and true moral foundations of healthy societies. Throughout history, they have helped humanity weather storms, promote unity, and foster meaning and purpose. They have provided essential guiding principles for how to lead moral and dignified lives. In times of uncertainty and social unease, traditional values are more important than ever and can provide a desperately needed lens to identify, understand, and address contemporary challenges. Let's not underestimate the power of these time-tested and timeless principles."

They have the right to identity themselves as whatever they want, I just have an issue when they expect the whole society to systematically change fundamental things (eg language, especially other than English) for such a small percentage of people.

The reality is that non binary people are either male or female, there's nothing else (don't come at me with intersex, because intersex is a genetic defect, not a third sex. There are only 2 types of reproductive organs and sex characteristics. There is no third set, therefore There is no third sex. Just a combination/mutation of the two). 

I though we want to move past gender stereotypes, yet everytime I read/hear an explanation of what NB is, these people always talk about not fitting within the gender stereotypes. Well the fact is, not fitting in the box exactly doesn't make you not a man or a woman. I though that was the whole point of fighting gender stereotypes. 

My point is, it's not the society who doesn't accept who this person really is - it's that person. Reality is they're male or female, fitting the box more or less, but still just one of those 2. They are the ones who can't accept that. Society just doesn't want to accept and support then in their delusions caused mostly by trauma.

The government would not run afoul of any 1st amendment protections because they’re not “banning” any content. It’s about regulation, AI content can still be posted it just requires an acknowledgment that the content was AI generated. 

Key to this suggestion is that it should only apply to *visual* content, not text. It’s important that when people see an image of a human being, especially a famous one, they’re aware that it’s fake. Political ads especially need to be subject to this rule, as well as celebrity likeness, even if the celebrity is dead. And even if the content isn’t for a commercial/political purpose, AI content even of memes should be required to have a disclaimer when posted.

 There is significant evidence on the ground that genocide is happening and many in UN human rights bodies, as well international human rights NGOs have been warning that not only ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity are occurring but also genocide is occurring or at severe risk occurring(they said this earlier on)."

1,2023-11-08,CMV: Abortion rights is a political issue,u/Xparda,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17qnqyd/cmv_abortion_rights_is_a_political_issue/,changemyview,"Let's disregard the whole ""is a fetus a living being or not"" argument. Instead, let's focus on the ""governing women's bodies"" aspect of it.

Due to Roe vs Wade being overturned by the Supreme Court, it has been up to the states to decide what to do with abortion rights.

One can argue it's ""murder"" when abortion is done but that ties back to the fetus argument. Murder is of course illegal everywhere. Despite that, it still happens on a daily basis. 

Now, let's consider the Prohibition era. The government banned alcohol at one point, but all it did was create a black market for it. Because of that, an amendment was passed to overturn the Prohibition era rules. 

Here's another example. Assault weapons were banned in CA. But it was ruled unconstitutional. 

And now, back to abortion rights. The states that have banned it has made it harder to get it done within their own respective states. But women will still get abortions regardless by traveling to the states that have it legal. Essentially, a legal loophole to the ban. As far as I know, states have not banned traveling for abortions...yet. Or if they really wanted to get it done, there's the good ol' coat hanger method or some other unsafe method, thereby putting themselves at risk.

So at the end of the day, why bother wasting time with this issue then? If it's banned, there's a legal loophole anyway or women will use an unsafe method to get it done. 

Conservatives want it banned cause ""abortion is murder"", but their whole agenda is ""fuck the government and leave me alone"". Why do they care what OTHER women do with their bodies? They're ""pro-choice"" for any issues besides abortion? A bit of hypocrisy there. They don't want the government telling them what to do with most matters and want freedom of choice. But when it comes to abortion, all of a sudden they want the government to step in and eliminate the freedom of having an abortion.

My point being is even if ""abortion is murder"", Conservatives have no business governing women's bodies, just based on their whole agenda and political view. So abortion is purely a political issue. CMV?"
1,2023-11-08,cmv: Educating Oneself on LGBTQ Issues,u/Waxflower8,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17qnyu3/cmv_educating_oneself_on_lgbtq_issues/,changemyview,"
I’m asking this question because unfortunately the person I had this conversation with blocked me. Which I understand if you don’t have the time and energy to go back and forth with someone. They had every right to block me. I say this in good faith and from a place of wanting to better understanding a different perspective. I’m a little frustrated trying to better understand but that does not mean I have a closed ear. It just means I haven’t reached your level of understanding.

First off I don’t believe it’s anyone from the community’s responsibility to educate me nor do I think anyone outside that community has a right to educate people about it but if they choose to, some find an issue with the listener speaking out their conclusions or assumptions from what they have been taught or observed if they’re not apart of the lgbtq community.

In the video I was watching, this gay man was in defense as to why specifically being gay has nothing to do with morals. This commenter said they should have included trans into the discussion and my response was that it seems like something for a separate discussion to better help people understand one step at a time deconstructing from homo/trans-phobia ideology.

The person clapped back and said it’s not their place to educate me (never said it was) and that I have no place to teach others (again never said that) and I need to educate myself (I agree but that could mean watching Blair white which isn’t well favored) and that I can’t be included in the discussion. I will say I made a stupid remark implying that I know how conservatives think which made it seem as if I was saying they didn’t know.

So should I only have these discussions with fellow cis straight people? Creating more echo chambers of ignorance? 
Idk I’m the type of person that believes if you have something stupid to say then say it. Because there will always be someone to come and correct you.

Look at the RP community. Some of those men only know women through statistics and from negative experiences and what they see online.

Idk perhaps my perspective of creating balance and middle ground is delusional. That’s why I don’t believe in censoring anything unless it’s telling someone to hurt themselves and others. But I guess the problem for that individual is giving them the impression that I’m telling them how to educate me."

Long story short, a good chunk of a class had already seen all the solutions without knowing, including myself. To save my own skin, I decided to explain that to the professor soon after taking the exam, taking a friend with me after convincing her it was the best course of action.
Especially because I assumed nobody would get in trouble, I just explained things quickly and he seemed to be annoyed with it, but with no intention to pursue anything as we fessed up without waiting for a substantially higher distribution. She starts blubbering out apology after apology in tears, and we’re both consoling her for like 15 minutes, and then we leave. 

I think a lot about the difference between men and women, it is an utterly fascinating subject. We are divided down the middle, each group with such foreign behaviors to the other. We are perceived differently, we are treated differently, we act differently, we think differently. Especially since reading Beauvoir maybe a decade ago, it is one of two branches of philosophy I find interesting - that branch being, feminist philosophy.

Women are brought up being treated as delicate, precious things. That culture creates femininity, not a natural affinity for emotionality or personal aesthetics. One is not born a woman, they become one (stolen from Beauvoir) Pre-feminism, they were little more than sexual slaves and bargaining chips, which is a stifling and depressing existence. In Beauvoir’s time and ours, they inched towards the freedom to be a subject among objects, and yet, that status as precious and delicate persists. Even if you don’t think that to be true, am I wrong that you (speaking to men) treat men very differently than women? You feel no desire to protect a man from their social woes, nor do you have any obligation to reassure them that the consequences of emotionality don’t exist. If a man acts meek and timid, you will only feel disappointed that they did so, and you would expect them not to be.

Let’s put myself in her situation. She calmly explains what happens, he responds, and then I burst into tears in front of both. It would be awkward, not endearing. No one would give a hug, say “it’s ok, shh shh” like I was a child. Both of them would probably have a hard time looking me in the eyes later on, let alone speak to me. Afterwords, I felt no ill will towards her - in fact, I found it very endearing and even I viscerally felt this urge to support and protect a “delicate creature.” It’s universal, because men were brought up with that notion of gender roles as well. 

What if I was in a woman’s body, with my mannerisms and outlook? I struggle to believe I would be babied, and my peers would respect me enough to feel nothing but disappointed in themselves for believing I wasn’t a helpless or pathetic if I cried in front of my boss. If I legitimately believed myself to be supremely competent relative to everyone else and acted accordingly, my peers would treat me as such"

If a license lawyer is like a professional baseball team, a minor league team wanting to play them should be allowed. It's totally up to the minor league team to step on the field against the pros. If someone wants to support the minor league team, they should be able to do that. If a cleint wants to hire or be represented by a non-licensed attorney, that is their choice.

You shouldn't need a profession using the power of the government to put artifical barriers for other people to become that profession. NOTE: I am NOT debating this argument for other professions like doctors so I will not entertain ""what about doctors?"" as a valid answert to this question. This is about lawyers and only lawyers.

Acknowledgements:

* I agree with most that it's unethical to distribute deepfake pornography of a real individual without their consent, this is noncontentious. We know it causes real harm to the subject, even if the content is not monetized.
* I agree that generating deepfake porn is distinct from fantasizing about the subject in that it creates a digital artifact that could be leaked or stolen, even if the creator had no intention of distributing it.In this situation the creator is taking a risk *on the subject's behalf* without the subject's knowledge or consent and I agree that's unethical.

But here's the scenario where I disagree with people who say that generating deepfake porn is *always* unethical:

AI image generation tools (e.g. StableDiffusion) exist that can be run entirely offline on consumer-grade hardware. Both training and diffusion can be done without ever exposing the output to a computer network, or even a storage device.

I do not think it's unethical if someone generates deepfake porn of someone entirely on an airgapped machine (i.e. separated from all computer networks and communication protocols) solely for personal use, and securely deletes all content immediately after use.

In this situation, where the risk of accidental exposure is eliminated, it seems ethically indistinguishable from simply fantasizing about someone.

I should probably note that I am *not* willing to change my view that simply fantasizing about someone is not unethical – only whether deepfake porn is unethical even when risk of exposure is not a concern.

EDIT 1: clarified that I meant fantasizing/generating at *ethically* indistinguishable when there are safeguards.

EDIT 2: clarified that distribution is unethical *without the subject's consent.*

EDIT 3: I've been convinced that this scenario is unethical, just much *less* unethical than doing the same thing without safeguards, because there is still *some* (very remote) risk of disclosure. It still seems to me that the only material harm is the risk of exposure and so the degree to which this scenario is unethical is directly proportional to the risk (i.e. converse to the degree to which precautions are taken), and if it were possible to guarantee 100% that images (or the finetuned models, etc) were never shared then there would be no ethical issue."

These days, media seems to just be succumbing to the woke ideologies of millenials, and now affecting Gen Z. I myself am a millenial of Latin American and Jewish background, my favorite movies as a kid were Lion King and Aladdin, I was neither Arab nor a Lion and yet I truly felt like they were characters I could relate to and look up to. From Lion King I learned I can't run away from my problems, from Aladdin I learned that my choices have concequences. Now for a certain Mermaid movie and an upcoming ""White"" German Princess movie... I have seen and can understand certain arguments made for them, but for the mermaid movie, no matter how much mermaids don't exist, it's still a Danish tale about a European mythological creature, it makes sense to cast someone who looks like the original character, and even so, it was cast the way it was not to promote diversity, it was done for marketing and profiting off the African American community. For Snow White, it was the Latin American community, and as a member of that community, I do not appreciate it. Diversity is about learning from eachother, how do you do that by casting minorities in European roles? My suggestion is that instead of casting minorities into already European roles, just make new movies about those cultures. Coco was fantastic! One of my favorite movies. Why can't we have an African story with an African casting and learn about African tales? I would be the first in line at the movies to watch that! Same with every other group. We don't need to be in European movies to promote diversity, what we need is to have our stories told as it should be."

Human nature fascinates me. I'm looking at the failures of huge countries with amazing military industrial complexes repeatedly get beat up and drug down by farmers with 80 year old guns and welders. 

This has happened historcally. The mongols lost in vietnam, the british lost in Afghanistan. To a much lesser degree the russians lost in Afghanistan. The ottomans in southern greece. Successful asymetric warfare has always been a tactic, just rarely a successful one. 

Traditionally the solution has been the squad wipe. The greater power comes in, kills the men/everyone and enslaves the women and children. Send someone to all the other towns and say this is what happens. Then repeat the process. 

This has worked successfully relatively recently. The Russians in motern Ukraine under peter the great had the tar tars wipe out the circassians then replaced the tar tars under the ussr. 

This was the mongols main strategy. 

""Punitive raids"" were extreamly common, but less brutal solution also used. Where one group would act up and the bigger power would come in and pilliage/burn. Poison wells, kill peasants, burn crops. This also proveded defense in depth, the population would now have to travel further without supplies. 

This has  completely falling out of favor since world war 2 in the western world. Even in Korea and Vietnam great restraint was shown overall. 

With the future going tward drone warfare, both man in the loop and without, combined with massive disinformation campaigns, and plausible debiability (wagner) i wonder how much of this strategy will return going forward. Many countries allready dont care (china, Ethiopia, drc). If russia, iseral or some other power says fuck it will it be global condemnation or viewed as nessarry to fight age old tactics?"
1,2023-11-08,"CMV: Despite society getting more and more open minded, sex is still seen as way too much of a taboo thing to do casually or talk about",u/Heyguysloveyou,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17qxtoe/cmv_despite_society_getting_more_and_more_open/,changemyview,"I strongly believe that sex is great for mental health. Obviously this varies from person to person but I'd argue that a lot of people would feel better with sexual intercourse every so often.

Now of course, people can go in clubs, use the internet and so on to meet people but not only can still result in hours of work without finding anyone but also is hell for people who are maybe socially awkward or just dont like talking to strangers all that much. Plus there all these other issues such as slut shaming still existing for women which is absolute nonsense. 

What I am trying to say is that I think more people should be open minded about casual sex (aslong as they're over 18, dont have a partner/one that approves and other obvious guidelines). I think A LOT of people would be way more open towards sex if they tried it out more with friends. I strongly believe it would further someones body image, their self worth, reduce stress and make people more open minded in general. 

I would even go as far as to say that it should be allowed in public places (where no minors are for example clubs) because it is completely natural. Some might say it would be gross to watch but I honestly wouldnt really care, its just a body part going in and out of another body part, its the same as two people kissing for all I care. But I can see how that would still make people feel weird or grossed out even though I dont really understand why, so I am open to maybe having specific rooms in clubs and such where it can be done.

Maybe I am just biased because I am very sexual and active and maybe my annoyance at how hard it is to find someone to sleep with is. But I also really think that more sex in the world would improve peoples overall mental health and reduce stress."

Now, of course, if the woman is **not** fat, then you should say, ""No, it doesn't make you look fat.""

1,2023-11-08,"CMV: Israel is a terrorist state, and Palestine deserves to be free.",u/KManYuksi,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17qzjfr/cmv_israel_is_a_terrorist_state_and_palestine/,changemyview,"Hi, first of all, an introduction. 

I am a white male, from the US.

I am in no way affiliated with Hamas, or the IDF, or their people in General. 

I used to be Pro-Israeli until the massacre that broke out on October 7th, 2023 by Hamas terrorists. Now I am just confused because there are stories from both sides that are complete lies.

Those are my current views:

1. Hamas ARE terrorists.
2. IDF and Zionists are also terrorists. 
3. Palestine should be free and left alone.

&#x200B;

Now getting to those points, I will be elaborating on each point, and I will not accept any views without any reputable sources.

1. Hamas are terrorists: Hamas, from my understanding has been established in the mid-late 1900's with the sole purpose of getting the Israelis out of their country. I do not see anything wrong with a movement solely established to gain freedom from an occupation. The US was once occupied by the UK and they got their independence after a long fight on July 4th. The only reason why I consider them terrorists, are because they do kill Israelis in cold blood, and they don't care about who they're killing. I also saw the post uploaded by the IDF today, about the names of the deceased on October 7th, I noticed that 90% of those names are military aliases, which means IDF personnel, where did the claim that all the 1400 murdered were civilians come from? why does the IDF lie about this stuff?
2. IDF and Zionists are also terrorists: the IDF has been spreading lies on social media that have been debunked, one of the lies was the 40 beheaded babies, which was, according to Biden's own eyes, a horrific thing to see, but the statement was retracted the next day by the white house and called a lie. The IDF has been bombing hospitals, children schools, while saying it was not them, creating a couple of lies and they would eventually say that ""Hamas has been shooting rockets at us from there"". Two things are wrong here, one, there was no bases under the hospital that was blown up. [This link shows it.](https://twitter.com/shaykhsulaiman/status/1721977469597589554?s=46&t=XSEsvjMzXRGHHd-yW4NomA) It was an investigation done using the IDF ""proof"" that they had bases down there, and two, a hospital with over 500 people was bombed. It was later claimed by the IDF that ""Palestinians overexaggerated"" the amount of dead civilians at that hospital, it was not 500, but around 200-300. Why would Israel say that Hamas overexaggerated, I thought they didn't bomb it? Also why the different lies? The day it was bombed, an Israeli spokesperson appointed by Netanyahu himself on twitter (forgot their name) tweeted ""Blew up a hospital in Gaza that had Hamas base in it"" <-- something like that, and then he deleted it 20 mins later after people shit talked him for being proud of blowing up hospitals. Then the IDF said it wasn't them, it was a failed rocket by Hamas, and then after that was debunked (they used the rocket audio, before it hit, sounded like an Israeli rocket and also the damages done, Hamas does not have those kind of missiles), they said that Hamas has a base there. Also, aren't Hamas muslim terrorists? Why [bomb a church?](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-hamas-war-gaza-strip-conflict/card/israeli-military-claims-responsibility-for-church-blast-in-gaza-ItyUvoIPaeNBEsIeIS6J) There were also no Hamas there. 40+ mosques and 5+ churches have been destroyed until today. There were 0 Hamas deaths there. Only reason I could think of, is Zionism, because Israelis do not want anyone other than Jews living in the state of Israel. Now, prior to the October 7th attack, I have seen lots of things Israel has been doing, that I just found out about, because Western media does not cover it. For example, [can anyone explain, why this man is stealing the woman's home?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNqozQ8uaV8) Does that seem right to anyone? Can someone also explain, [why the IDF is beating up Palestinian kids?](https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/07/19/israel-security-forces-abuse-palestinian-children) I've also seen Palestinians in videos throwing rocks at the IDF and then getting live bullets shot at them. What is happening here? And the most disgusting thing I've read, that switched me from Pro-Israel to Pro-Palestine is this, [why are they building an amusement park over a Palestinian cemetery????????????](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20211027-outrage-over-israel-s-building-of-a-jerusalem-park-over-palestinian-cemetary). Another point, an Israeli said he saw a baby being burned in an oven? Why lie? That was debunked by a video that was filmed in the 1990s, where a Palestinian man who  was talking about when he had to watch a Palestinian baker and his toddler being thrown in the oven by Zionists and burned alive. Also, Why are Israeli protesters yelling in their protests ""Death to Muhammad"", ""Death to all Arabs"", ""We will burn you alive"", while Palestinian protestors are saying Free Palestine? Also, to end this, Israel has broken since October 7th 28 international laws, and has not been sanctioned yet, double standards?
3. Palestine should be free and left alone:  
Why do Zionists want to live in Jerusalem? because their holy book told them to? Fine, ok. If the Islamic holy book said that Muslims should live in the US, would that give Muslims permission to go into the US and kick the US citizens out of it? No? Then why is Israel doing the same exact thing to Palestinians? Israel never wanted peace with Palestine, they beat their kids, they built amusement parks over their cemeteries, and they forcefully take their homes. I also heard from a friend that any Jewish person can go to Israel, even if they weren't born there, and they will get a free house (stolen ones), and a monthly salary until they are able to find a job, is this a joke? I have seen many Palestinians in the US who are unable to go back to Israel, even though their grandparents and parents were born there. That's just despicable. Arabs do NOT want Israel in the middle east. Palestine has been there for over 1000 years, I don't care if Jews lived there before Christ, shit, American Indians lived in the US for so long before Chris. Columbus showed up, and he still occupied their land, but at least now they have all the freedom the need and want. Only the US wants Israel in the middle east, how about they take a piece of the US and give it to them since they love em so much?

Finally, the most important thing I'm thinking of, is the kids that are dying, and that are being orphaned, because of Israel.

So what? It’s like the die hard progressives who want M4A. Biden not giving it to them or even promising it in the first place didn’t stop him from winning, because if you’re a die hard progressive you have done the calculation and see that a Biden Oval Office is more conducive to your goals. In their view, it’s at least harm reduction

If the GOP abruptly abandons this priority, so what? Why would they be afraid of doing what’s necessary to stop the bleeding and win competitive races again? At the congressional, state, and local level the GOP was doing far, **far** better during the Obama years than the Brandon era. Outside of Florida their victories have been few and paltry in comparison. 

Dobbs is at least 90% of the reason why things have gone so sour for them. Trying to put the lions share of the blame on Trump or “Trumpism” is cope from old guard conservatives that can’t face how unpopular their project actually is (I mean for fucks sake, I’d wager my next check that DeSantis is less electable than Trump). It’s pretty clear at this point that they can’t come up with a new angle or pitch to give the pro life movement some juice. Trying to compromise on a certain week limit will not work either. “Abortion” and “ban” in the same sentence is electoral seppeku in the post Dobbs era. Period. So long as you have pro life at all as a mission, so long as the issue is salient, you’re facing a severe debuff at best. 

If you’re a die hard pro lifer to a point where it affects your vote, you’re probably all in on the culture war stuff. If the republicans do a hard pivot on this issue, what are you going to do? Are you going to vote for the democrats trying to get teachers to sissify your sons by the millions? Stay home and let Brandon flood the country with Uruk-hai? (I know this sounds demeaning, but trust me Fox News is almost at this level - the social media right certainly is). 

Take abortion out of the equation and I see a road back to where they used to be. The snake handling fundamentalists and Francisco Franco groyper  avatars on Twitter will be upset, but who cares? Take a page out of the DNC playbook and take your extremists for granted. Stop letting the tail wag the dog"

A similar argument is made for Game of Thrones. The final season is, arguably, the worst. In my opinion, it is bad. But most people who start to watch it, finish it (from people I know). There's no real drop off rate as there is for TWD.

For instance, telling someone who is sensitive to the issue of genocide that there’s a “genocide panic” in a country that is both (i) actually committing genocide and (ii) spreading misinformation about that genocide, could inadvertently invalidate the feelings people have towards the moral abomination.  
  
Ask yourself, who is more likely to use terms like “pedophilia panic”? Is it someone who is acutely aware of the dangers of child sexual abuse, or someone who is less concerned? As I see it, the term “pedophilia panic” could potentially be used by those who seek to downplay or dismiss valid concerns about child abuse. I mean, would advocates for LGBT rights use the term “LGBT hate panic” to describe hypothetical societal misconceptions that give rise to fears of hate towards them?   
  
There is a long history of dismissing valid concerns about marginalized groups as mere “panic,” and this needs to be acknowledged. However, the language we use to do so should not inadvertently invalidate legitimate concerns or provide ammunition for abusers and their sympathizers.

In fact, the consumption of animal flesh may have caused our brains to become as advanced as they are. In addition to eating other animals, we ate ourselves. Yes, most of our ancestors were likely cannibals, though the reason why is debated, as humans apparently weren't super nutritious.

Of course, humans have evolved to find other reasons to hate and kill. We evolved to kill because other humans don't look like us. We evolved to kill because other humans believe a different schizophrenic's auditory hallucinations were the truth. Of course, these are arbitrary justifications that really only serve one purpose. When you find an arbitrary difference between different peoples, the other people will become your enemy. Rather, they will become your prey. You must kill them in order to survive. Failure to do so will cause your own demise. That is what humans evolved to believe. That is what you believe. That is what I believe.

Because of that, war has been an endless cycle throughout human history. And because of that, war will continue to be an endless cycle until humanity dies out completely. We can never overcome our nature. The only reason we create justifications is so we can kill without remorse. We view other humans as animals to be culled, when we are ourselves animals.

I could point at a picture of one person shooting another and ask any of these pacifists, which of those two people in the picture would you rather be.

Religion and culture are much less clearly defined than a lot of other things. I mean, what qualifies as a religion or culture seems to be ... vague and nebulous at best. I'm not even sure how it's legally defined in different countries, or even IF it is actually defined. Some would say this has been taken advantage of by some organizations. To me, it's actually surprising that Nike hasn't declared itself a cult based on the worship of Nike, the ancient greek deity of victory, just for the tax breaks.

In Asia, a large number of foreigners (primarily EU and NA) are the main customer base for prostitution (due to how cheap the prostitutes are there, and how young they can be). Another issue is that Asia holds one of the highest underage trafficking rings, which just makes me raise an eye to anyone who goes there for sex.

There’s one NSFW site that I’ve been looking into for this specific purpose and he purposely impregnates women in Thailand and Taiwan (which some look SEVERELY YOUNG) and I can’t see how that’s ethical at all.

This claim has no sensible basis. I think there are are many ways I could tackle this but by far the strongest arguments against this claim is just in a review of the numbers.   


Hamas states the current death toll as around 11000 about 0.55% of the total population.   
The population of Gaza being 2 million.  
Also, Gaza is about as densely populated as Hong Kong.  
Therefore currently 99.45% of Gazans remain alive.

Israel has the military capability to nuke Gaza, but not only that they have enough conventional ordinance to do as much damage as nuke on Gaza would do. 

Gaza city specifically has a population of 590,481and is likely the most densely populated part of Gaza.

If Israel wanted to they could destroy that city entirely within a night and literally kill virtually the entire population. 

They haven't - therefore the only logical conclusion is that they are not attempting to kill as many civilians as they can and therefore are not committing a genocide.

People (particularly women, and I say this as a woman) will ignore blazing red flags right in front of their face and make excuses when they know they shouldn't stay with him. I especially lose sympathy once children are involved - at that point, a person's primary role is a parent, and their primary responsibility is the well-being of their child. It's a form of child abuse to allow them to watch their mother get smacked around and screamed at.

On the other hand, if the abusive spouse really is an abusive POS, there's no good outcome for the child. If a judge grants him visitation, the kid still has to be subjected to a bad person; and if the mother gets sole custody, then the kid is out a father. It all comes down to picking better partners and not rushing into a relationship.

Verbal/mental/emotional abuse is bad enough but once it starts getting physical, I can't fathom how anyone can justify staying. It's just asking for more trouble, pain, and drama. Anyone with a brain at this point knows the signs and that it is almost unheard of for abusers to ""get better"" and become a decent person. Short of literally being tied up in the house, there's no excuse for staying with someone dangerous. It's common sense. And letting a bad situation snowball into exceedingly worse situations is not an excuse for not taking action at some point. 

The only real ""solution"" to domestic violence is people looking out for themselves and making better choices. Abusers don't change, they don't act right and they never will."

In the twisted fantasies of those incels who transition, they are becoming what they believe they deserve: a hypersexualized version of the woman of their dreams. Those who exist within and around the circles of transgender individuals refer to them as 'trans-maxxers.' From the perspective of psychology, they are narcissists who, through self-objectification, rampant sexism, and a diminished sense of empathy, become what they covet. They deem themselves cosmically important; their grandiosity and self-esteem form the fabric of their psyche. In an attempt to bolster whatever scant ounces of self-esteem they possess, they attempt to transition, some successfully, some not. The primary catalyst for most transgender individuals is 'gender dysphoria,' which is characterized by a cognitive mismatch between one’s physical body and one’s experienced gender. But if gender is merely a social construct, so is transgender identity. They are built on definitions we choose; their existence is not an objective truth of the natural world but merely observations of the human society we inhabit. However, it borders on narcissism when it is used to gain an advantage, to become someone likable, someone worth loving, or to become the object of one's own desire in a twisted narcissistic fantasy. If one asks, ""Do I want to be with him/her, or do I want to become him/her?"" then one is bordering on narcissism. Because in the end, you either are or you are not.

They fool themselves into thinking they're confident than anyone else, while the rest of us just find it pathetic. Same goes for open relationships; it's just garbage.  
  
And they couldn't care less what others think. Successful people bust their asses to maintain a good image, but cuckolding invites judgment and makes people question their ability to handle anything socially. It's a colossal lack of self-respect.  
  
By handing over all control to their partners, trashing their dignity, and consistently making boneheaded decisions, cuckolders are basically setting themselves up for shit. Their choices show they can't handle authority, lack self-respect, make dumb decisions, and everyone else sees them as a walking disaster, a self-inflicted journey into a life of constant failure.

1,2023-11-09,CMV: Bikes should have license plates,u/macnfly23,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17rcsdj/cmv_bikes_should_have_license_plates/,changemyview,"This is definitely a controversial view and of course it's easy to see arguments as cost and bureaucracy as an argument against this but bikes are becoming more and more common and they often use car lanes when there's no bike lane available so why be treated differently?

First of all having bike license plates would lower the rates of theft as it'd be easier to recover bikes with stolen license plates and difficult to get new ones without proof of ownership. 

Second of all it would deter reckless riders or people who think just because they have a bike laws don't apply to them and allow public safety cameras or even people to identify when cyclists commit offences

Finally in terms of the arguments against and the potential to discourage biking in my concept it wouldn't be nearly as hard to get a 'bike license' as it is to get a driver's license and it would basically just be obtained by showing an ID and proof of ownership/purchase of the bike."

Asia will be the undeniable center of economic and political power by the end of the century.,u/Grandemestizo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17rdbsu/cmv_europe_and_north_america_cannot_maintain/,changemyview,"People have gotten used to the idea that ""the West"" (a nebulous term at best, here I'll roughly define it as western Europe and North America) is the dominant force in the world. Western countries are the richest and have their tendrils all over the world because they've been so dominant for so long. It almost seems like the natural state of things.

But it isn't, it's a historical abnormality. For most of human history the most important and powerful countries in the world were in Asia. It's easy to understand why, Asia is where most people live. It's the largest continent and the eastern half of Asia has always been densely populated. If you draw a circle that includes China, India, and southeast Asia, your circle will include most of humanity.

Western Europe had a technological revolution and industrialized. This upset the normal state of affairs and allowed for European colonialism then western dominance. This head start allowed the West to maintain dominance for a long time but that head start is rapidly disappearing. Technology and industry are no longer unique to the West and if you haven't noticed, Asia has gotten pretty good at both. At this point it's only a matter of time until the balance of power shifts back to Asia.

How could it not? It's simple numbers. More people means more inventions, more money, more labor, more and better ideas, larger armies, larger economies, etc."

203,2023-11-09,CMV: Body image problems for men are just as real and damaging as the body image problem women can have,u/Mallee78,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17rdet5/cmv_body_image_problems_for_men_are_just_as_real/,changemyview,"To make something very clear before I say anything further this is NOT a ""men have it just as bad/worse as women in life!"" I completely recognize the plight of women to attain equal status in even ""forward thinking"" countries is still a long way from being over and I am not here to make light of the struggles women deal with when it comes to the ""ideal"" body that the media can push on them.

What am I here to say then? Well basically we all know women have been told by various media influences through their whole lives their is certain ""ideal"" versions their bodies should be whether than be thin, ""slim thic"", whatever. These are harmful and can destroy women's self confidence if they do not fit what various forms of media say they should be. Here is the thing, men deal with the exact same problem. 

There is very much parameters set by the media as to what a man should look like and I am not just talking about the ""men should be ripped"" people, there is various versions of idealizing certain male figures that have caused untold damage on the male psyche. I am not just talking about the stereotypical super ripped Channing Tatum in Magic Mike bodies either. These body shapes include ""dad bods"" which is supposed to be a more ""positive"" take on what men should look like but often their examples of dad bods are still men who are clearly very muscular and have a certain build where while they still have a gut, most of their body is still very much muscular. On the opposite end of this we have the glorification of the skiny, and for lack of a better word, effeminate (please dont take this wrong I simply mean smaller frame and cant think of another word) body frame where we see women gushing over  very thin and softer featured men (often asian.) 

With this defined I can tell you most of us men struggle to attain one of these body types and women can say ""oh thats not what we reaaaally want! We dont care about just looks"" We see what you share on social media, we see the pictures and movie stars you fawn over. They are very much VERY attractive men or have crazy nice bodies in way way or another (super muscular, thin and soft , dad bods) and while you may not see the harm in it we still are very much affected by things things just like women are. I have had women tell me I dont need to worry about trying to get super muscular or lose weight or whatever because ""women dont care about that as much as you think!"" Then they will turn around and share on their social media those exact body types they tell us we dont have to strive for. Yes I know they are just sharing something they enjoyed and it doesnt encapsulate their entire spectrum of what they find attractive but since when has self worth and self esteem ever been logical. 

So wmen, yes, you deal with a lot when it comes to body image and fighting hundreds of years of mysogany and forced perspectives on how a woman should look. But so are us men, so when a man you know tells you he struggles with his body image because he feels like he can never look like Tatum, Hemsworth, that one super hot K-Pop star, dont dismiss his feelings. Remember we are humans with emotions and self esteem issues just like you."
1,2023-11-09,"CMV: The ""standards of the time"" argument is a fallacy",u/TrueKoreshan,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17rf153/cmv_the_standards_of_the_time_argument_is_a/,changemyview,"I'm going to use slavery and Christopher Columbus as an example of why it is a nonsense.

Let's go on a very simple basis, when Christopher Columbus took slaves of native Americans and cut their noses and ears off for disobedience would Columbus want his ears or nose cut off, and would he like to be enslaved? If the answer is no as it very obviously would be, then he knew it was a horrific thing to do. He just didn't care aka an awful person.

Some would even make the ludicrous claim that a man wouldn't be able to tell cutting someone's ears and nose off would make them suffer cos ""standards of the time""

Standards are not linked to any time, we all know what is right and wrong from our inner conscience that develops in our early years and is linked to feelings, it is the whole reason there is psychopathy. I'm not capable of even harming one person physically without feeling bad, so we are not all like psychos like they were in history, I get shaky just seeing a small fight situation.

What ""this standards of the time"" fallacy does is skirt round being honest about the type of people they were in the history books, we are too scared for some reason to call them the monsters they were. When I read history I don't go to it thinking how great and glorious they all were as some do, I realise they are repulsive and despicable monsters, but I just think okay it happened, never again, let's learn from it. The problem is the people who use the standards of the time argument want it both ways, they want to acknowledge it happened and for us to all say how nice they were really cos ""standards of the time"" it's an excuse tactic.

If a human does something they wouldn't want done to themselves to someone else, then it is cos they don't care about the victim they do it to, there is a word for people like that, psychos or monsters, take your pick.

Ask any slave owner (hypothetically) if they would have wanted to be slaves themselves, if they answer is no as it obviously would be they knew right from wrong, and it throws all standards of the times arguments out the window.

Ask those medieval kings if they'd want to be forced to fight and then violently decapitated in battle, if the answer is no then they knew right from wrong.

That's why the ""standards of the time"" is a complete fallacy that is an insult to the intelligence of just about anyone, and an excuse making tactic for evil. What is needed is more insight as to why our ancestors were such terrible people. If they knew it was wrong for themselves they know it is wrong for others whatever time they lived in, end of really to me."

AR-15s kill less thab 300 people a year. This is horrible, but drunk driving kills 10,000-15,000 people per year. 

Even so, the vast majority of people who want to ban AR-15s wouldn't want to ban alcohol even if they're non-drinkers, because it's pretty clear how essential drinking is to our society.

It is far *less* clear to non gun owners how essential AR-15s are to our society. Perhaps one day there will be so few gun owners that guns will no longer be considered a part of American life the same way that alcohol is. At that point we might collectively decide that its harm to society outweighs its recreational benefit, and Congress might overturn the 2nd amendment. And that's fine. But that's not out of any moral high ground. 

Just like when we banned Kinder Surprise eggs, it wasn't because they were killing more people than alcohol. It's because their recreational value to society didn't outwgih their hazard."
1,2023-11-09,CMV: It’s okay to cheat on your partner if your relationship becomes sexless,u/worminthebud,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17rfsa2/cmv_its_okay_to_cheat_on_your_partner_if_your/,changemyview,"To clarify my point, if your partner denies sex once or twice a week, I do NOT think that makes it okay to cheat. However, if you are in a long term relationship, and your partner stops wanting to have sex with you for the foreseeable future for whatever reason, then I think it’s okay to go find sex somewhere else. 

Sex is a base need, a primal urge that needs to be fulfilled. Sex and love are usually connected, but that doesn’t have to be the case. I believe you can still love your partner and have sex with other people at the same time. 

I’m thinking specifically of cases where a couple has been together for a long time and sex kinda just falls off the menu for whatever reason (age, libido decline, etc), but one partner (either the man or woman) still wants to have sex. What should they do, never have sex again? I think it’s unfair to trap someone in a sexless relationship just because you are married. 

I understand the aspect of betrayal and violating the other’s trust, but if your partner wants sex and you stop giving it to them, thus trapping them in a sexless relationship forever, that’s also pretty messed up imo. You’re essentially trapping someone in a relationship and depriving them of something they need. 

You could always break up/divorce your partner if they start to deny sex, but often times it happens when you’ve been together for a long time and already have a life/family together. It’s not that you want to lose all of that, you just want to have sex.

So I say, go and do it.

TL;DR: If your long term partner stops having sex with you for the foreseeable future, it’s okay to go have sex with other people because your partner created a situation where they left you with no choice but to do so. The other option would be to never have sex again, but that sucks. Divorce would also uproot your life, which also sucks. Just cheat and you can have everything you need that way."

1,2023-11-09,CMV: A super intelligent AI would never think hurting people or exterminating the human race was a viable solution to world peace,u/TheJostler,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17rg1ft/cmv_a_super_intelligent_ai_would_never_think/,changemyview,"Spoilers for some sci-fi movies/TV shows that have been out for at least 9 years below.

The sci-fi trope of the super intelligent AI that controls everything and makes the decision to hurt, imprison, or exterminate humans to ""protect them from themselves"" is entirely unbelievable. Examples include *I, Robot* and *The 100*, but versions of this trope are sprinkled throughout other sci-fi media (*The Matrix*, Thanos in *Avengers: Infinity War* and *Avengers: Endgame*). This is entirely different from tropes regarding betrayed, homicidal, obsessed, buggy, or generally disturbed AI, like *Battlestar Galactica*, *Alien*, or *Avengers: Age of Ultron*. The ""disturbed"" or ""vengeful"" AI is not part of this opinion. This entirely about an AI trying to do the right thing and ""helping"" humanity with a very bad idea.

The reason the trope exists is that audiences are supposed to understand that ideas made entirely based in ""logical"" or ""data-driven"" thought are bad ideas, and that good ideas come from emotionally engaging with an issue along with logic. Essentially, a human makes better decisions than a robot because humans make decisions based on the entirety of the circumstances (both logical and emotional), not just the numbers.

However, it doesn't make sense that a super intelligent AI would come to the conclusion that humans need to die to obtain world peace. That is the self-driving Uber solution to world peace, not an ultra-intelligent AI with access to all data in the world solution. It doesn't make sense even at the ""logical"" or ""numbers"" level that the AI is supposed to be an expert in.

The majority of war and suffering is caused by unequal distribution of resources -- people here don't have enough water, people there don't have enough food, etc. Anyone can see this, and it's something many people have pointed out as a huge loophole in the *Avengers* story with Thanos. If Thanos can magically kill half of people to cut down on overpopulation, why doesn't he double resources instead? Audiences see this as a massive loophole because Thanos is a person, with feelings and rational thought. He should be smart enough to make this basic logical leap. However, when an AI makes the same mistake, there's a pass because the audience is supposed to accept that the AI is misguided by default.

What do others think? Is there a more logical reason I'm not seeing here?"
1,2023-11-09,CMV: I feel like we as a collective social species would feel more united and less divided if everyone suffered the same or similar way.

I'm also tired of the constant narratives of ""I'm special because I've been a marginalized victim so I should get free rewards"" 

Just as much as I'm tired of ""you're privileged so your problems are invalidated because you haven't struggled as hard as us""

That's why I feel like (hypothetically) if we all suffered the same exact way and went through the same exact struggles, then everyone would feel empathetic and relate to each other's issues, and no one would feel like they're any better or less than one another. Because they've been through the same

This renders the arrogance and superiority aspect of the high horse criticism effectively meaningless, which leaves only taking a ""morally superior"" aspect left.

As many know New York is a melting pot and beautifully diverse. I am very aware of different cultures, perspectives, ways of life, cultures and religions and had friends of almost all types. However, As I become older and am seeing things for what they are. I developed a disgust and dissociation with blacks. Black men constantly do stupid things, commit crimes, put themselves in the position to get in trouble; but then want to blame the white man. You can not tell me that “the white man” is oppressing them so much and claim that’s why they are so vulgar, violent, poor, and act like animals. *Racism isn’t exclusive to them.* They are just stupid and have the worst culture.  Asians, Indians, Arabs, Hispanics, Latinos, Africans from Africa are ALL people of color/brown/black and why do they have better cultures, have nicer cleaner functional communities, and stay out of trouble more than African Americans? 
Asians and Indians out earn everybody and most Asians and Indians are BROWN/dark skin. 

Everyone else is functional and mostly pleasant to be around expect for black men. The woman, however are dominating cooperate America, smart, successful, the most educated and stylish. 

I truly have developed a disgust, hate, and I’m just totally repelled by black men. I don’t want to be anywhere near a black man. Everytime there is one near by I make sure my car door is locked. Because they are like pitbulls: irate, suddenly snap, have psychological issues and are more likely to be violent compared to others. I have no sympathy for their victim mentality, calling everything racist, I can’t stand how degenerate most are, they kill, destroy and act like animals compared to every other persons in America. They put it on themselves. They don’t want to change, they just want to blame and call everything racist and remain scum.

What benefit is there to associating with a black male? What benefit or experience do you get from living in their community, or dating, marrying, or procreating with them? When blacks start making good money they move out the hood and into civilized WHITE or HISPANIC neighborhoods. They don’t even want to live amongst themselves, because they destroy and are dirty.

Blacks murder more people than all other races combined and lead every category of violent crime. Not only in America but ALL OVER THE WORLD. They are only 13% of the population, and that 13% of the population commits MORE crime then 87% of the population? If they worked that hard looking for a job they would never be unemployed.
How many times have you seen these big groups of 100 people go running into stores and steal everything in sight, except work boots, and were they almost all white? Asian? Hispanic? NO. All black.  They can't seem to act civilized, it's really not that hard to obey the law, you actually have to go out of your way to break the law. So why on earth would I like them?  Look what the do to their communities; they destroy every place they live, garbage everywhere, stolen cars, drug dealers everywhere, gangs shooting up each other, super irate. Highest unemployment, least married, highest STDs, most likely to abuse any race of woman they get with, and children. They never been able to build and maintain a civilization.

1,2023-11-09,CMV: Humans shouldn't judge each other at all,u/WhyDoNamesExist,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17riwu0/cmv_humans_shouldnt_judge_each_other_at_all/,changemyview,"It's a delusional thought I've had in my head.   
I feel like I already know the truth yet no matter how many times I tell myself I still cannot come to terms with it.  


\---  
It seems to me that we shouldn't judge and decide for each other at all. Not in any shape or form whatsoever. Rather than we treat each other as enigmas, autonomous black boxes that fulfill their own fate, whatever it is.  


Paintings, music, writing - they're all forms of art that we use to communicate our mind to one another. To open up the inner contents of one mind and spill it out like a flood for others to see. The window that connects internal and external.  


But there is only so much we can communicate. There's only so many times you can use 'very' in front of an adjective to emphasize it before it just stops meaning anything. Our vocabulary is a finite size. There are more pitches of sound than that of which the human ear can hear. There's only so many colors that our eyes can see. There are just somethings that can't fit through this window, or it would take a whole lot of work and time to shove it through.   


We can't ever communicate everything, so can you ever say you can understand someone fully? Could you truly understand their pains, their anger, their regrets? Their joys, their love, their dreams? The piled-up luggage of their yesterday, the position they stand in the world today, the yet to be fulfilled uncertain tomorrow that is theirs as well? What they find to be their weakness, what they find to be their strengths? Could you ever truly understand what they take out of an experience, what emotions they feel about it?   


So why then, would you assign people values when you cannot possibly begin to grasp them at all? Are you really just going to make an assumption given only the tip of the surface? To say who is a good person, a bad person, an evil person, a hero. To say that someone is just a weak coward, another a defiant fighter. To say that one is just 'down on their luck' but the other is a lazy bum who just doesn't want to work. To say who is valuable and who should just be discarded like worthless garbage.   


Should you really just write people off like that, as if assuming you already have an objective view of them and can compute defined values to determine who they are as a person as if there was some algorithm or function that some dead person from a couple of centuries ago already discovered?  


We are the authors of our own books, except we take our pen and start writing someone else's story for them even though we can't read the language it is written in and we have not bothered to try to read the book up to that point. We are painters with a canvas except we decide to use our brushes on someone else's painting even though we did not even take a step back to look at what the picture even looks like yet. We are singers except we start adding our voice into someone else's song without having even heard a single second of it beforehand.  


Shouldn't a person be the decider of their own name, their own identity? Shouldn't they be the one in charge to decide how their story is written, completely by themselves?   
So why then, do we still judge others and determine each other's fates?  
\---  


Yet having said all that I know I myself cannot truly live with this ideal, for if I were to describe myself at all a 'foolish lying hypocrite' would be somewhat accurate.  


I understand that we do not exist separately from each other like parallel lines, that we will eventually intersect with each other over the progression of time. That no matter what, any action you will have a consequence on someone else out there in the future. To fulfill one destiny is to deny another - it's impossible to guarantee that everyone comes out a winner.  
I understand that within the foundation of cooperation lies the concept of mutual suppression.   
That the price we pay for order and structure, is that of our own autonomy, freedom and agency.  


I also cannot judge humans for behaving this way, for in the end we judge and label our surroundings as a way to understand it and where we are in relation to it. Humans cannot be faulted for falling short in understanding each other, for a mortal creature will naturally have to adopt a self-centered framework in order to survive at all.  


Yet having understood all these truths, some part of me cannot let go at all. There is still the nagging feeling of dissatisfaction, that something is still so incredibly wrong about it all. Even when faced with the notion that it is just how reality is there is still the lingering thought of ""If only there was a way to make this wish come true"". It seems like I can never be at peace with the answer.  


So please, someone enlighten me, and provide a verdict that can truly dispel the thought, so that I might be one step closer to join the ranks of you who have come to terms with the world."

You shouldn’t worry though. Some wholeheartedly believe they’ll reincarnate! Some beleive they’ll live again! Some beleive they’ll enter heaven! Jannah! And non stop lots of beautiful things like this you see? If all of this is true why not kill uourself and meet these fates and make these things happen! If your unhappy you must kill yourself and in ur finality you’ll have another chance to reincarnate! You get my point? Or you’ll go to heaven or jannah or whatever stupid thing they beleive 
lmao…. FLYING SPAGHETTI MONSTER HEAVEN!!!! Ur solution is suicide. U want to solve ur problems? All that’s waiting for you to do is the death of yourself and you’ll be granted what you believe so much so why not do it"
1,2023-11-09,CMV: Affirmative action type measures should focus on income level above all else,u/AgreeableSeaweeds,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17rjj1v/cmv_affirmative_action_type_measures_should_focus/,changemyview,"This is regarding the US specifically. I understand how racism etc has played a role in poverty in the US. This is especially true for african americans for many many reasons. This country did everything it could to keep certain demographics poor and powerless. Affirmative action, or related concepts, focus on race above all else but I don't think it's the best measure. I think changing to income level would have a greater impact. Race can be included by is very secondary. My main points are:

&#x200B;

1. Family income has more of an impact on success than race. 
2. Changing it to income level would *still* help to elevate underrepresented minorities as they make up the highest poverty rates. African americans, who I would easily argue face the MOST discrimination in the US, are also the poorest demographic.
3. It would increase upward mobility in the US more than race related affirmative action because it's actually using the same criteria.
4. It would get rid of any complaints about model minorities and which races should/shouldnt benefit from affirmative action. Poor asian americans could actually benefit from affirmative action instead of being lumped with rich asian americans (who are lumped with white people anyway). I don't think it's fair to assume that all ethnicities faces discrimination equally and thus it's a bit unfair to characterize them as the same. But we can't switch this system to acknowledge things like that asian americans have high mobility whereas african americans do not because we come back to the model minority problem. 
5. It would have more wide reaching support and wouldn't turn into lawsuits constantly while still helping underrepresented groups. 

I will say, as of this year, some institutions are now including low income as an underrepresented category but it's still not a common thing and just started very recently. Right now I'm ready to push very hard for this change but I'm not sure if I'm missing something. "
1,2023-11-09,CMV: There's nothing wrong with being a 'Passport Bro',u/ICuriosityCatI,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17rjxzz/cmv_theres_nothing_wrong_with_being_a_passport_bro/,changemyview,"As a lonely man, I understand wanting love and connection- emotional, mental, spiritual, and physical. I've been hearing the term passport bro recently, generally used in a negative way, and after reading more about it I don't understand the hate. I think it's amazing that some men are taking a huge risk traveling across the world to find love and connection in an effort to cure their loneliness. 

A couple things I've heard people (mostly women) say as to why passport bros are bad:

-they're looking for sex, not love. 

I'm not sure how anybody would know this and many men do get into relationships with foreign women. And even if they are just looking for sex, I don't think there's anything wrong with looking for consensual sex in other countries. And if they lie and claim they're a billionaire in their home country and a woman in another country sleeps with them because of that, that's just two users using each other. Neither had noble intentions. 

-These men are interested in these women because they think they'll be more submissive

Some men want a submissive woman some women want a dominant man and vice versa. Submissive # abused and Dominant # abuser. This dynamic is seen all the time in American relationships. Dominant women with submissive men. Dominant men with submissive women. 

If a man travels overseas to rape a woman of course that's evil and sick, but that has nothing to do with being a passport bro. Remove the passport bro part and they're still evil. 

It just seems like people are beating down on men who are already down on their luck and are trying to do something to take control of their lives. Personally, I'm not even sure how many of these men succeed and if they do it might be because they're more confident in that environment and more able to be themselves and engage with the world. And foreign women are perfectly capable of saying ""No"" and men need to respect that. But if a lonely man finds love overseas or even has consensual sex overseas in my view that's not a problem. 

But feel free to change it!"

The anus, a part of the human body often deemed dirty, is posited to be intended to be enjoyed in its unadulterated, natural condition. In the past, humans relied on river water without the abundance of chemical products like body wash, shampoo, and conditioner. Despite these limited resources, historical humans successfully reproduced without resorting to concealing themselves behind artificially scented substances. This prompts the question: why the contemporary inclination to use such products? Perhaps the enjoyment of this particular body part in its natural state could be seen as more logical. Analogous to individuals who appreciate the natural scent of a vagina rather than an artificial fragrance, a similar approach might be taken for the anus.

Exploring this involves delving into the historical context of hygiene practices and the evolution of societal attitudes towards bodily functions. In ancient times, reliance on natural water sources was out of necessity, and the lack of advanced personal care products did not hinder the basic functions of reproduction or overall health. The argument extends to the premise that modern reliance on chemical-laden products represents a departure from our natural state, suggesting a societal shift in perceptions of cleanliness and acceptability.

Moreover, it can be argued that the current obsession with scented hygiene products is a result of societal pressures and marketing influences. Advertisements often portray the use of such products as essential for personal well-being and social acceptance. This, in turn, may contribute to a perceived need for individuals to mask their natural scents, including those associated with the anus. The argument then raises questions about the authenticity of these preferences and the societal constructs that shape them.

In examining the historical and cultural aspects of hygiene practices, one must also consider the diversity of perspectives on cleanliness and what is deemed acceptable. Different cultures throughout history have had varying standards of hygiene, with some emphasizing natural bodily processes over the use of chemical products. This cultural relativism challenges the universality of contemporary hygiene norms and encourages a reconsideration of what is truly necessary for maintaining health and well-being.

The discussion on the natural state of the anus and the human body as a whole can be expanded to include the broader discourse on body positivity. Embracing one's natural features, scents, and bodily functions challenges societal norms and fosters a more inclusive and accepting environment. Advocates for natural hygiene argue that accepting and appreciating our bodies as they are can lead to a more genuine and liberated sense of self.

 the argument against the use of scented hygiene products for the anus stems from a perspective that values the natural state of the human body. This viewpoint draws on historical practices, questions societal influences, and promotes body positivity and acceptance. By delving into the intricacies of hygiene norms, cultural diversity, and personal preferences, we can gain a deeper understanding of the evolving relationship between humans and their bodies."

You would think after the moral awakening the US has had over the past several years that people would have softened up a bit but all that's happened imo is we have adopted new targets for our cruelty. Those targets include political rivals, foreign countries, celebrity personalities, etc. humans seem incapable of decreasing their propensity to hate, they can only redirect it as cultural and social norms make hating certain groups/individuals untenable.

To be clear this is true of the entire world, not just the US. It seems we as humans will always have roughly the same proportions of tolerant to intolerant people. It's unfortunate when you see the same people who are tolerant in regards to many politically or socially charged topics be so intolerant of others due to things like differing beliefs. I hate to sound like such an idealist but I just wish we could begin a trend to treat everyone with tolerance and understanding no matter what they believe.

I do hope I’m wrong and maybe someone can demonstrate it to me but all I am seeing is us adapting to the times. Still, I agree we have made tremendous progress as many who have previously been unfairly targeted have much more widespread support now, but at the same time it seems that was done at the expense of others. The crux of my argument comes down to my fear of what division will do to the county/world as I believe the biggest casualty of this atm is civil political discourse. Sell me some hope people!"

* This type of food is finer and more developed than other types of stereotypically american food such as hamburgers or pizza


* This food has a finer pedigree and tradition than hamburgers or other types of american food


* This type of cuisine is varied, including swamp animals like crawfish and alligators as well as pigs and cows which makes it more eclectic and interesting

1,2023-11-09,"CMV: The minimum age to enter a 4-year college should be 22, not 18",u/amazingAudrey5,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17rmiac/cmv_the_minimum_age_to_enter_a_4year_college/,changemyview,"There are many reasons why I believe the minimum age to enter college should be 22 instead of 18.  


1. For the same reason, I believe the drinking age should stay at 21, even though someone can join the military at 17 with parental consent. Young, able-bodied people should be encouraged to learn how to contribute to society, do something productive, and add value to their communities by learning real responsibility. Only once they have done so can they decide to pursue their personally driven ambitions and be allowed to have adult vices.

2.	If 18-year-olds weren’t allowed at any 4-year institutions, their next best bet would be to attend either a trade school or a community college and obtain a certification from that college to pursue a specialized trade. There would be a surge of jobs in all fields: hospitality, government, law enforcement, construction, and transportation. Additionally, one of the most common employers of people from trade schools are unions, making it an overall win-win for employers and workers. More people will be educated on workers’ rights and unions, and companies that primarily hire undocumented workers without providing benefits will face serious competition. (Also, trade schools are mostly awesome!)  
	  
3.	Taking 3-5 years away from a school environment can be seen as a gap year or a break from the stress that derives from society or one’s parents, to pursue higher education and perform well or better than others, especially those around their age. The thought of comparing yourself to your peers won’t weigh you down as much if you both enter the same field or different entry-level fields.  
	

4.	If the age was 22, the number of people deciding to go to college would make that decision with much more caution. At 24, they will be able to apply for financial aid as an independent, so the “rush” feeling to immediately apply just because you are eligible, won’t be there. People in the middle class won’t have to worry about taking on a huge amount of debt just because their parents make a lot of money. People from low-income and middle-class families alike can relate to each other more. There will be less of a class divide on the college campus. I hate to say it, but I see a lot of shaming just because some people were more fortunate than others.  
	  
5.	Less Bullshit Jobs = Better cities. This is clear: Its primarily the Blue Collar, Pink Collar, and workers in scrubs that allow our society to function on a day to day basis. With more young adults taking on actual jobs where the value they add to their employer is distinguishable from their peers, there will naturally be more teenagers being held accountable for their actions. This, in turn, will lead to more people using public transportation, resulting in increased demand for improved public transportation infrastructure, and better-maintained buses and railways. Its easier to be a car owner when you have some easy 9-5 white collar job where the performed tasks can become so unnecessary you have to be micromanaged by your boss to make the office space look productive . Also,  As of right now, a fresh high school graduate doesn’t have much reason to use public transportation.I mean, Why take the bus and ride your bike everywhere when everyone you know has a car or is saving up for one? You can’t impress your crush that way !   
	6.	There will be Fewer people changing majors while they are in college, and less confused people overall. If it was your dream to become a doctor, the most sensible idea right after secondary school would be to get into a soft trade, such as being a pharmacy tech, CNA, dental assistant, and gain real experience in that environment. Some people may find softer trades more attractive than hard physical trades and decide to pursue higher education in that field. Vice versa, people who dislike that kind of work might discover they prefer working with their hands. After they graduate from college, they will have relevant experience on their resumes. This discussion reminds me of a common military subject, where former enlisted military officers are much more preferable than “west-point” or ROTC cadet officers.  
	7.	If people were truly serious about returning to college, they would have to force themselves to brush up on their math and reading skills. This takes a different type of discipline, as you’re imposing the expectation of reaching an educational goal on yourself, and it won’t be someone else doing it."

Their positions tell me whether or not they are nuanced, grounded, and progressive enough.

Cannabis: Must support legalization. This tells me that they're able to acknowledge in some form that the War on Drugs has been a massive failure, and that they believe to some degree that people should be able to choose what they consume. It indicates they might be open to other drug law reforms down the road.

Guns: Must be opposed to banning semi-automatic weapons and regulations which make responsible ownership of them expensive. This tells me that they understand the right to self-defense and the importance of the role guns play in self-defense. It also indicates that they understand how guns work, and aren't pushing to arbitrarily ban some semi-automatic weapons and not others.

Gay Marriage: Must oppose efforts to ban gay marriage. This tells me two things. Most importantly, it demonstrates that they believe in equal application of and treatment by the law. It also indicates a lower likelihood of bigotry and injection of religious views into government.

A candidate who supports these three positions is likely to be level-headed enough to govern effectively, even if I would sometimes strongly disagree with their positions. There could absolutely be other stances which disqualify them, but this is a great starting point."

poker is a zero sum game. if i win a chip, you lose a chip. blackjack is different - every player at the blackjack table can win together.

 That would mean that, for some people, if you find out that one party is more guilty, it means that the other party must be less guilty. In general these people would be quick to disagree with the statement ""both sides have a lot of responsibility"". They are more inclined to think that if they support one side, they need to disagree with everything the other side does, and that is often their instinct.

It's this narrow ""one or the other"" perspective that keeps a lot of moral debates going long past the point where they are actually useful. It contributes a lot to partisanship and political division in North America.

People who easily accept that people can have a wide degree of responsibility and that sometimes both sides are unjustified are more likely to work with other sides and try to actually effect change, in non violent ways."
1,2023-11-09,"CMV: From an American strategic POV, it was a mistake to expand/stay in NATO and we should have cultivated better relations with Russia in the post-Cold War era",u/jadacuddle,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17roi6z/cmv_from_an_american_strategic_pov_it_was_a/,changemyview,"NATO was originally founded to prevent the Soviets from trampling the Western European countries while they were rebuilding after WW2. We wanted to prevent this because a hostile power becoming the regional hegemon of Europe would be an existential threat to our national security. However, once the Soviet Union collapsed, we no longer had a reason to worry about this scenario. The Russian Federation is nowhere near a peer competitor to America, with their main geopolitical importance coming from their nuclear weapons and large resource deposits. Even if they wanted to invade all of Europe, they wouldn’t be able to take on even just Poland. So the original purpose for NATO is now dead and gone

In a parallel universe where we changed our policy towards Europe and either withdrew from NATO or at least didn’t expand it, Russia would have economically recovered in the 2000s, and started re-asserting its dominion in the region. This would be unfortunate for the Eastern Europeans who wanted to turn towards the West, but their desires are wholly unimportant to American security.  

Under such a scenario, Russia probably would be satisfied with its western front (their most important), and would look to reinforce their southern and eastern fronts, where they clash with China. I can't imagine that Russia would be a docile American ally against China, but I'm sure that they could be a gigantic India to the north, in competition with China. This would obviously surround Beijing and reduce the amount of energy that they can bring to Taiwan & South China Sea, or Korea.

In our universe, however, Russia's most imminent
security concern comes from their Western border, and they have to attend to that first, regardless of how they feel about China. This has given China an ally to their North, as well as a source of natural gas, grain, and other materials that used to fuel European economies instead. Pushing Russia and China together has been a blessing for China beyond anything else we could’ve done for them, outside of perhaps handing over Taiwan. We’ve strengthened our current greatest rival, and for what? To ensure the sovereignty of a handful of Eastern European states that have no relevance to our security?"
41,2023-11-09,CMV: Objective morality does not exist,u/eachothersreasons,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17rphrr/cmv_objective_morality_does_not_exist/,changemyview,"**Thesis**: Objective morality does not exist. This is not a morally relativistic position. This is a morally nihilist position. This is not a debate about whether the belief in an objective morality is necessary for society or individuals to function, but whether objective morality exists.

Morality and ethics are artificial. They are human-made concepts, and humans are subjective creatures. Morality isn't inscribed in any non-subjective feature of the universe. There are no rules inscribed in the space or stone detailing what is moral, in a way that every conscious intelligent being must accept.  The universe doesn't come with a moral handbook. There would be no morality in a universe filled with inanimate objects, and a universe with living creatures or living intelligent creatures capable of inventing morality isn't much different. We are still just matter and energy moving around. The world is a sandbox game, and there are no rules menus to this MMORPG.

**Moral intuition**: Humans may have visceral moral intuitions, but just because people have a moral intuition does not make the intuition necessarily ""moral."" Many humans may have rejected moral intuitions that others may have had in the past. These include common moral intuitions about female sexual purity; interracial marriage; women's marriage outside of one's ingroup; one's social station at birth being a matter of fate, divine will, or karma; the deviancy of being left handed, physically deformed, ugly, or neurologically atypical. There are those people with strong moral intuitions about the value of animal life and consciousness that others don't have. Even if supposing that humans largely share moral intuitions, that doesn't make those intuitions necessarily moral.

Humans have largely gone about intuiting morality, but I think the overwhelming majority of people feel that history is filled with events they consider immoral, often by those who believe they are acting morally. Human cognition is faulty. We forget things. We have imperfect information. We have cognitive biases and perceptual biases and limitations. Our intelligence has limitations. Telling people simply to follow their moral intuitions is not going to create a society that people agree is moral. It's probably not even going to create a society that most individuals perceive as moral.

**An optimal set of rules**: There is no optimal set of rules in the world. For one, in order for there to be an optimal set of rules, you'd have to agree on what that optimal set of rules must accomplish. While to accomplish anything in life, life is a prerequisite, and we are all safer if the taking of human life is restricted, there are people who disagree. There are those who believe that humans should not exist because human civilization does incredible damage to the nonhuman ecosystems of this planet.

Humans have different opinions about what an optimal set of rules is supposed to accomplish: we have different preferences surrounding the value of liberty, equality, privacy, transparency, security, the environment, utility, the survival of the human race, ect. We have different preferences on whether we should have rules directly regulating our conduct or simply whether we should decide the morality of the conduct by the consequences such conduct produces. 

There is no country that says that it has the perfect set of laws and forgoes the ability to modify that law. This reflects 1) not only human epistemological inability to discern an optimal set of rules 2) especially as times change 3) or the inability of language to fully describe a set of rules most would discern as optimal, but also 4) human disagreement about what the goals of those rules should be 5) changes in human popular opinion on what is moral at all.

**Behavior patterns of animals:**  Animals have behavioral patterns, many of which are influenced by evolution. But just because animals have behavioral patterns doesn't mean those behavioral patterns are ""moral."" Some black widows have a habit of eating their mates, but that doesn't mean that if they were as conscious and intelligent as humans, they would consider it moral compared to the alternative of not eating their mates. Maybe there's a reason for chimpanzees to go to war, but there probably are alternatives to going to war. Even if you determine that the objective of morality is to survive and reproduce, evolutionary adaptations are not necessarily the optimal path to achieving that end.

And we fall into this naturalistic fallacy when we consider that just because a bunch of animals close related to us behave or refrain from behaving a certain way, that this way is ä basis to say that this behavior is objectively moral. Just because animals poop in the great outdoors doesn't mean humans must agree that it is moral to defecate in the great outdoors. Just because animals don't create clothes for themselves, doesn't mean humans should consider it moral to go around naked. Humans are different than all other nonhuman animals, and may very well consider common animal behaviors immoral.

**So then what is morality?** I think a better question is how humans regulate their conduct according to certain frameworks. Ethics is invented and proposed. Others may agree or disagree with a proposed ethics - a proposed conception of what people should approve or disapprove of or a code of conduct. Those who disagree with a proposed ethics may propose their own ethics. People may prefer one proposal over another. As a matter of physical reality, there's often strength in numbers. Whether by physical force or persuasive power or soft power, an ethical framework often dominates over a particular time and place and those who disagree are made to comply or incur punishment. As a practical matter, humans are more likely to agree to frameworks that advance their mutual interest. Even if there is no objective morality, it doesn't mean humans can't propose and advance and enforce moralities.

The reason for many divorces occur due to a belief in incompatibility, lacking the tolerance to see through differences between the partners, and lacking the ability to forgive their partner’s mistakes. So when people do go through these patches in their relationship when they start arguing, I think their decision to go straight to divorce is too fast.

 It’s not a healthy mindset to have because people need to learn to compromise in their differences and tolerate each other’s differing personalities. And they should first at least attempt to understand what is wrong in their relationship and try to fix it, whether through couples counseling or simply directly communicating and making compromises with your partner. Going straight to divorce loses any hope of bettering the relationship. And more often than not, the other side of divorce is not too bright. 

Additionally, when a person makes a mistake in a relationship, you see all too often that the advice given to the partner is to ask for divorce straightaway. Of course, cheating is inexcusable but many other mistakes are simply too small to not be able to forgive. Couples need to be more forgiving of their partners and take that opportunity to grow together, instead of breaking everything off the moment disaster strikes.

The more time I’ve spent watching and listening to arguments from both sides, the more and more I’ve become convinced that the socialist viewpoint of “redistribution” is inherently Very greedy.

This is not to be confused with socialistic programs like welfare or universal healthcare (I personally support these type of programs) but more on the “eat the rich” “billionaires shouldn’t exist” “profit is stolen wages” viewpoints.

You don’t get to become rich in the US unless you create a product/service that the market wants/needs, provide it at a cost the market is willing to pay, and pay your hired help the wage they agree to be paid.
All of this is voluntary- people aren’t forced to work there, customers aren’t forced to purchase from you… Then consider 80% of millionaires today are 1st generation- meaning they didn’t inherit the wealth, they built it over the course of their lifetime. None of this sounds greedy or like it’s hoarding wealth - in fact it sounds more like helping people and contributing to society effectively.

Meanwhile, the vast majority of the “eat the rich” crowd is young people, who mostly work lower wage jobs - which is totally fine, but by those two metrics it indicates they have contributed to society the least out of the adult populous. And they yell the loudest about wanting to in some fashion or another take the money from the rich and give it to themselves…. Isn’t that actual wage theft? Isn’t trying to take from someone else and keep for yourself selfish? Isn’t wanting to take money someone else worked for so you can have it the very definition of greed? 

I understand younger people today have it tough - they do, I’m one of them, and I sympathize and empathize….. But this vilification of people who’ve managed to make it in the US and take what they’ve spent a lifetime building, just so you don’t have to spend your life working towards the same, sounds very much like the greed they SO claim to hate.

It’s ok to want and to champion for change - but I feel this crowd is becoming exactly who they think they despise

Very often in news outlet and media coverage of the conflict between Hamas and Israel,I hear that Hamas is using civilian infrastructure to hide their weapons and is using the population of Gaza as human shields. 
We’ve all heard it and it helps paint an even worse picture of the organization: not only are they committing atrocities against their designated enemies, but they also use their own people to protect themselves.

I have an issue with that talking point. Every time I hear “Hamas is using [insert civilian infrastructure] to send rockets/store weapons/etc”, I’m like wondering where else are they supposed to do this? 
Gaza is so densely populated, it’s not like Hamas has tons of land they could use to create proper military bases and do their operations from.

So of course they are putting their stuff in civilian infrastructures and between civilians, maybe they like it, maybe they don’t, but I don’t see how else they should do it? So this idea of “human shield” is not necessarily an active tactic, but more a collateral damage if the situation.

TL;DR: Gaza is so densely packed that Hamas has no other option than to operate from within civilian infrastructures. Please CMV."

1) national debt. American interest is at ...like almost a trillion dollars today. That didn't just ""happen"", obviously ""hey do you want to borrow money somebody else will have to pay""... who says ""no"", right? not america or canada. 

2) constantly increasing minimum wage throughout their working life, while engaging in free trade deals to make it easy to outsource work for cheap products. then, engaging in mass immigration because foreign workers will accept jobs for passports that kids just wont do that cheap.

3) underfunding education once they or their own kids had graduated. They increased class size, started giving university spots to foreign students, and allowing raising tuition to make it less accessible/more daunting. they also removed or reduced public childcare programs in many places.

4) sending cities and other governments into debt with spending that increases the value of their land,    and not raising property taxes like other taxes.

5) the bailout. measures to keep their investments and economic predictions and pension on track, at the expense of everyone else.

A lot of these things amount to short sighted behavior, in my opinion. It's selling out the future to make things better today. And a lot of them seem to be, kinda obviously, ""too good to be true"" - national debt and minimum wage, esp, seem like free money."

117,2023-11-10,"CMV: When Trump told Hannity ""Do you know that they ended up paying Nixon $18 million for his documents?"" he was alluding that he stole the classified material found at Mar-a-lago for the purposes of personal financial enrichment",u/JiminyDickish,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17rx0ne/cmv_when_trump_told_hannity_do_you_know_that_they/,changemyview,"No matter your political affiliation, or whether you think he was legally entitled to, it's been difficult to understand or explain exactly *why* President Trump took boxes of classified material with him when leaving the White House and stored them at Mar-a-lago. The documents, according to the federal indictment, including several pertaining to the ""nuclear capacity of a foreign country"" and at least one document dealing with ""nuclear weaponry of the United States."" Some of these documents were ""so closely held, only the president, a Cabinet-level or near-Cabinet level official [could authorize others to know.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/09/06/trump-nuclear-documents/)"" There's been lots of speculation as to the reason why Trump would have interest in such documents to begin with, let alone why he would think he was entitled to take them.

Trump said something really curious to Hannity during an interview in March that seems to expose a horrifying possible reason: Trump took these documents with the intent to sell them back to the US government. Trump was asked why he took the documents:

>“This is the Presidential Records Act. I have the right to take stuff. Do you know that they ended up paying Richard Nixon, I think, $18 million for what he had? They did the Presidential Records Act. I have the right to take stuff. I have the right to look at stuff. But they have the right to talk, and we have the right to talk. This would have all been worked out. All of a sudden, they raided Mar-a-Lago, viciously raided Mar-a-Lago.”

In 2000, the US government settled with the Nixon estate to the tune of $18 million for seizing presidential papers in the course of the Watergate investigation. Nixon's estate had argued that the Fifth amendment provided that the government couldn't take ""private property … for public use, without just compensation.” It was a strong argument, so they settled. but the President Records Act was written in the aftermath to make all presidential records public.

The problem with Trump's comparison is twofold: Classified nuclear secrets aren't presidential records, and in any case, the Presidential Records Act made all presidential records public and therefore the fifth amendment is irrelevant.

So, back to the quote. Why did Trump say that about the $18 million in reference to the documents he took to Mar-a-lago?

The only explanation I can fathom is that Trump misremembered—or perhaps never actually fully understood—a story about Nixon receiving money for documents turned over to the government. And so at the end of his term, he decided to take some home to do the same thing—perhaps thinking that the more sensitive the documents, the more valuable they'll be—with the full intention that the government would come asking for them back, and he would be compensated for them. One interpretation of when he says ""They have the right to talk, and we have the right to talk,"" is that Trump is actually referring to *negotiations over the price.*

Obviously the implications here are catastrophic; an embittered former president stealing our country's nuclear secrets for the purposes of personal enrichment. I haven't seen this theory floated anywhere, and yet, it's the only explanation I can fathom for why Trump would say such a thing. So I would really like to hear other possible explanations for Trump saying this that I'm overlooking."

And I thought to myself: wow, that's just how I feel all the time in the relationships, so relatable, but then it just came to me that I don't believe it's authentic and valid, when coming from a woman. So either:


1. Women are lying when singing stuff like this (Beggin', Just A Dream, Something Stupid >>> I Will Always Love You, Dedicated to the One I Love, falling for you)


2. It's only women who feel that way, no man shall feel this.


or 3. it's ok both ways (that's just not realistic, let's all be honest here).


So, the first thing that came to my mind is no. 1, hence it's how I feel, but my mind thinks the third option is the right one. And since I was really struggling to find any subreddit to express this, I ask for you guys to prove me wrong or tell me I'm right.


Oh yeah, why do I have this view?


1. I didn't have any experience with a woman who was honestly afraid of losing me, nor did I knew one who was afraid of losing her bf or crush, or whatever.


2. (Generally accepted idea in society is that) women are desired, sought-for, so they don't have to do any initiative in relationships - it's men's responsibility, hence they shouldn't care for one man, when another one would always come by.


Yes, this logic is flawed, but flawed logic is permitted by the rules, so please tell me I'm right or prove me wrong, thanks."

Almost all of these threads eventually see comments cropping up that ""most sex workers in country x, y and z are trafficked"" 

I believe that this has become a mantra across internet debates, which has little to no evidence to back it up.

Human trafficking for sex work absolutely is a significant issue and anyone purchasing sex from a trafficking victim is absolutely committing an unethical act. However, all evidence and statistical analysis available would suggest that *the vast majority* of sex workers are not victims of trafficking.

This UN report conducted field research which suggested a figure of around 4%. The writers absolutely do admit the limitations surrounding the way evidence was gathered, but do not suggest they would be out by a factor of 10 or more (which would take us to a '*most* prostitutes are trafficked figure')
 https://www.unodc.org/documents/toc/Reports/TOCTA-EA-Pacific/TOCTA_EAP_c02.pdf

This article from the Guardian, albeit an old one suggests that much of the research and claims on this topic are blown widely out of proportion, and that there is no evidence which supports claims that most sex workers are trafficked 

https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/oct/20/trafficking-numbers-women-exaggerated

Some more mathematical analysis here suggests a figure in the US of around 3-4%

https://aella.substack.com/p/what-percentage-of-sex-workers-in

What would it take to change my view - this one is a pretty straightforward one, I'm looking for any data or statistics that support the view that the majority of sex workers are trafficked (globally, or in a sex tourism destination) or that supports the idea that anyone engaging in purchasing sex is *probably* having sex with a trafficked person.

What I'm not looking for is a debate on the ethics of prostitution, which while an interesting topic, is not the one I'm looking to discuss."
1,2023-11-10,CMV: Arranged marriages with the option to say no leads to better outcomes for both parties than bar dating where you just hope to randomly meet someone,u/Money_Whisperer,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17s1sn6/cmv_arranged_marriages_with_the_option_to_say_no/,changemyview,"Specifically thinking of the US for this post.

Dating in the western world basically boils down to meeting randomly. The most common stereotype is that a man sees a random woman he finds physically attractive at a bar, and approaches her with pick up lines. Not a great system.

This may be stereotypical, but it’s not far off. The most common advice on Reddit is simply “do lots of social events, and hopefully at some point maybe you’ll just randomly hit it off with someone.” Aka, the bar stereotype, with extra steps. So it’s more than a stereotype. And I’ll be referring to western dating as bar dating from now on in this post. 

I’m arguing that bar dating leads to worse outcomes in the long term, vs a system of arranged marriage where your family has come to some agreement with another family. You’re not forced to go with it, but it provides a baseline option for courtship that allows you to skip the chaotic randomness of bar dating if you so choose. 

This default option also better ensures that- your families will get along, and you’ll likely share similar values from aforementioned families that raised you having some mutual understandings. Any kids you may have will benefit from having a large, cohesive family rather than just whatever the randomizer came up with. It’s my firm belief that family cohesiveness is not considered a big factor in bar dating, or it’s resulting relationships, and that people don’t put enough consideration on it unless it’s something considered by older people in the family who know how important it really is. Not having a family network sucks. Learned that one the hard way. 

With bar dating, you’re beholden to physical attractiveness first and foremost, something that is not as important for a long-term relationship. Dating apps take this issue and amplify it further. Arranged marriage is about family values. What is a better foundation for “love”? A major reason for the stunningly higher divorce rates in the west than most of the world is diverging values, I.e. financial ones, philosophical ones, or even something as petty as losing sexual attraction to someone and starting to fantasize about someone else. 

Some common retorts to my argument I anticipate and will address here- 

1. “What if you have different values than your family”- this is possible, but I’d say most people share at least a majority of their values with their family, hence the surprising consistency of how different geographies in the US vote. Assuming 1/4 people diverge from the base level values of their family, they always have that option to reject the courtship selected to them by their family. 

2. “Building a big friend network that will eventually try to set you up is also a common recommendation on Reddit” - I see this as just a worse arranged marriage system. Friends come and go, it’s just how life works. You only get 1 family and they stay with you for your whole life. They raise you. Your random group of friends that you got from randomly meeting people who you had fun hanging out with is not what you should rely on for something like further building out your personal family."

Since humanity first grasped the concept of extinction and a finite world, it has been understood that once an animal disappears from this planet, it is gone forever. In recent decades, this has alarmingly become reality. 

In 1996, the first viable cloned mammal, a sheep named Dolly was born. Suddenly, scientists had living, breathing proof that cloning from somatic tissue was possible. This opened the door for some of the most unethical scientific experimentation imaginable. Using the same methods that produced Dolly, a team of researchers attempted to resurrect an extinct species of Spanish Ibex, with the last wild individual being confirmed dead in the year 2000. In 2003, after many failed attempts, they brought the world’s first extinct species back from the dead, in the form of a sickly, deformed ibex fetus that died only minutes after birth. 

Since then, scientists around the world have wanted to expand on this possibility with other, more iconic species — the Wooly Mammoth, the Sabre-Toothed Cat, the Dodo bird. Though the technology is still imperfect, rapid advances in genetic science mean it’s only a matter of time until a new species is brought back into a world far different than the one it left. As scientists, we have a moral obligation to object to this at every level. These aninals went extinct for a reason. Their habitats no longer exist, their predators/prey no longer exist, the climate they are adapted to may no longer exist. They would be the utter playthings of humanity, with no chance of a natural life. Even species that went extinct through the actions of man, like the Pyrenean Ibex or the Dodo, would have no place in the world — the factors leading them to extinction in the first place still being present. 

We need to learn from natural history and our own failures and protect the species still living, not attempt to play God so some Russian billionaire can keep a mammoth in a pen."

Lately I started feeling that I need to get that plate removed, I wanted to feel normal. So me and my father talked to the doctor and scheduled the surgery on 13th of this month (November). 

We came back home and my mother informed my grandmother about this and she reminded her that it is amavasya(new moon) on that day. My mom told me about this. I didn't believe in astrology and stuff so I wanted to clear up my mind and I did some Google searches but it made the situation even worse. People claiming that astrologers predicted very specific events and stuff scared the shit out of me and I couldn't find a logical reason to it. I very much want to get the surgery done because I dont think I'll have holidays later and also the dates are fixed. But this concept is scaring the shit out of me. Also I'm a believer of God but I don't want to believe in amavasya and stuff.

Tldr: I got a fracture last year and I want to get the hardware removed on 13th. It is amavasya and is scaring the shit out of me. Change my views on this"

215,2023-11-10,CMV: Pi should've been phased out and Tau should've been used instead.,u/GoSouthCourt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17s92mm/cmv_pi_shouldve_been_phased_out_and_tau_shouldve/,changemyview,"As you know, pi is the ratio between the circumference and the diameter, or 3.14. But I think the ratio between the circumference and the radius is far superior. It's also known as tau, or 6.28.

Here are the reasons why:

* When you ask someone to draw a circle, it's far more intuitive to tell the person the radius rather than the diameter. If you tell them the diameter they'd just divide it by two internally and draw the circle with the radius. The circumference would just be tau*r, which shows the linear relationship between the radius and the circumference as clear as possible.

* The area of a circle would've then be (tau/2)\*r^2. While it looks inferior to pi\*r^2, the former actually makes more sense if you consider the mathematical connection between the circumference and the area. The area of a circle can be calculated with a simple integration of the circumference formula from 0 to r, hence we get the 1/2 in the formula. This is very similar to other physical formulas like (mv\^2)/2 for kinetic energy, (kx\^2)/2 for potential energy in a spring, (Iw\^2)/2 for rotational kinetic energy, etc because they are all derived from simple relations of momentum = mv, force = kx, and Iw = moment of inertia. 

* The Euler identity would've been written as e\^(i\*tau) = 1, which is far more intuitive than e\^(i\*pi) = -1 because it shows that one rotation of tau in the complex plane brings you back to the same point. The number ""1"" is much more fundamental and has existed for far longer than the number ""-1"". In fact, it's also intuitive in that e\^(i\*tau/2) should bring you to -1 because you're only rotating half a circle in a complex plane. 

* Similarly, sine and cosine functions would've made more sense because completing one tau covers the entire function, whereas one pi only covers half of it. So when someone asks ""what is sin(tau\*0.87)"", you can think ""oh, it's somewhere between 3/4ths and a full revolution, so around -0.7 I guess?"", instead of needing to convert everything in terms of 2\*pi.

* Edit: Also, the relationship between radian angles and degrees would've been easier too. The most important number in degree is 360, while the one for radian is pi, but pi radian ≠ 360 degrees. If we use tau to study radian angles, the relationship would've been tau radian = 360 degrees, much more intuitive for students to learn.

I concede that it's virtually impossible to ask the mathematical society to change a constant as fundamental as pi now, I mean look at the mess with imperial vs metric. But I want to argue the point that mathematics could've been much easier and significantly more intuitive for a lot of students if, idk, during the 1700s or so, prominent mathematicians like Euler started to phase out the use of pi and use tau instead."

Whether in book clubs or high school, the question most frequently asked is ""what did the author mean by this?"" Perhaps the best example of this is Hemmingway getting mad about people trying to figure out what he meant in ""The Old Man and the Sea"". He famously said ""the sea is the sea, the old man is the old man... all the symbolism that people say is shit."" Yet, this book is still touted for its symbolism and is frequently analyzed in schools.

The problem I have with this is that it cheapens the contributions these authors have actually made. The truly great novelists use their unique voice to make almost any story resonate deeply with the reader. Their use of metaphor, dialog, and exposition is so much more powerful than the notion that there is some hidden meaning. 

What if the author's intent was always taught as being the same thing: telling an engaging story? Instead of asking the intent, what if we asked how the author accomplished that goal? Maybe even, what about a time period made this story resonate particularly well with readers of that time period? 

Reading would be a bit less of a chore, because it doesn't narrow your analysis to some sort of core concept. Forcing students to read ""The Old Man and the Sea"" and analyze every word for how its a story of man overcoming nature makes you have to look for that constantly. If you, instead, had to pick three choices the author made and tell us what made them resonate, it makes reading the book a lot more open-ended.

You could easily make an essay prompt that makes ""Hemmingway's use of metaphor to describe the sea on pg. 86 makes it seem mysterious, cruel, and emotionless in contrast with the exhaustive technical explanation of pg. 101, which provides us with a quantifable frame of reference"" a more acceptable answer than ""I liked when this happened"".

Anyway, I'd love an educator to CMV on why author intent is such a high priority in literary analysis."

An ancient person couldn't understand their place in the universe - their choices were wildly inaccurate science or religions that no one else believes in anymore, whatever they believed we looking back at them can see how wrong they were.

So whatever you believe, whatever branches of science or whatever religion, you're probably wrong. In the future people will know just how wrong our current beliefs are.

This would mean no protests targeting the places of worship within 150 metres.

I'm usually in favour of freedom of expression, but not when it results in violence or intimidation.

Last night, a protest was held in a park close to a synagogue. Violence [occurred](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-10/gaza-protest-burgertory-caulfield-ceo-fire-victoria-police/103090562) between the protesters and Jews.

The protest happened in the suburb of Caulfield, which is [40% Jewish](https://www.abs.gov.au/census/find-census-data/quickstats/2021/SAL20521), during the Sabbath, partially on the anniversary of Kristallnacht.

A Palestinian restaurant burnt the previous night in the same suburb, but the police is saying there's no indication that it was politically or religiously motivated. There is no indication it was done by a Jew, let alone that it was done by a Jew who worshipped at that synagogue, or that the synagogue played a role in it.

There has been a large number of violent incidents during the Israel-Hamas conflict affecting Jews and Muslims in Australia and similar countries. The night after October 7, at rally near the Sydney Opera House, individuals shouted [""gas the Jews”](https://www.reuters.com/world/police-investigate-pro-palestinian-protest-sydney-opera-house-over-alleged-anti-2023-10-10/) and “fuck the Jews”, and police [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/10/police-defend-arrest-of-man-carrying-israeli-flag-after-antisemitic-chants-heard-on-steps-of-sydney-opera-house) Jews to avoid the Opera House. A Palestinian child was stabbed to death by a landlord in [Chicago](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/17/us/6-year-old-boy-palestinian-boy-chicago-profile/index.html), a 69 year old [died](https://abcnews.go.com/US/evidence-arrest-jewish-protester-death-police/story?id=104777340) after a confrontation between pro-Palestinian protesters and pro-Israeli ones, an Indiana woman crashed her car into what she [thought](https://abcnews.go.com/US/indiana-woman-allegedly-crashes-purpose-thought-jewish-school/story?id=104663088?id=104663088) was a Jewish school, and in Paris, France a Jewish couple had the door of their home [attacked with gasoline](https://www.lefigaro.fr/faits-divers/la-porte-du-domicile-d-un-couple-juif-incendiee-a-paris-un-suspect-transfere-en-psychiatrie-20231021) (French-language).

Restricting where people can protest is no greater a restriction on expression than other restrictions recently imposed in Victoria - the Safe Access Zone for abortion clinics was [introduced](https://www.health.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/migrated/files/collections/factsheets/s/safe-access-zones-information-sheet.pdf) (PDF) by the current Labor government, and it also prohibited [Nazi symbols and salutes](https://www.vic.gov.au/fact-sheet-nazi-symbol-prohibition).

Free Palestine Melbourne has subsequently [apologised](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-11/clashes-between-pro-israeli-pro-palestinian-groups-melbourne/103093814) for the location of the protest, and said that they were [unaware](https://twitter.com/Leo_Puglisi6/status/1723227823706636590) of it being close to a synagogue. If this is the case, the law is still useful, as organisers of a protest will check to avoid being close to a synagogue in advance.

Some people may argue that engaging in violence, harassment or intimidation in Australia may influence the behaviour of one of the two parties in the Israel-Hamas conflict. My response to that is I don't want conflicts occurring in other countries resulting in violence in Australia.

The term is used in this regard primarily to refer to intentional violence during peacetime or in the context of war against non-combatants.

However, definitions of terrorism typically emphasize one or more of the following features:

Its effect of extreme fear.
Whether it targeted  the state from within
Its strategic goals.
Its random or indiscriminate nature.

Whether it was planned and prepared in secret.

and also terrorism has many types like:
civil terrorism.
political terrorism
anonymous terrorism


this definition is applied on hamas and Israel both kill civilians for personal gains , both are random ."

They're a safety net for those who screw up the first time, offering a cushion for failure rather than a push for excellence. In a world where results reign supreme, relying on a second chance is like admitting you're too weak to get it right the first time.

People prattle about growth and learning from mistakes, but let's cut the crap – in real high-stakes situations, there's no room for error. You think a heart surgeon gets a ""second chance"" if they botch a procedure? Hell no. It’s about precision, skill, and delivering under pressure. This isn’t about being unforgiving, it’s about high standards.

What's worse, this whole 'second chance' culture breeds complacency. People slack off, thinking they'll always have another shot. It dilutes the drive to excel, to push boundaries, and to achieve greatness on the first go. The hard truth is, second chances are a luxury, not a right, and they’re often not available when you really need them."

I suggested this recently, on r/prolife, and it was pretty much peed on.  But I think it's a good idea.

The idea that I expect all people to appreciate is this:  it will place our country's future directly and completely in the hands of those who can be expected to care about it the most.  Those who have the biggest stake in that same future.  If men lose their kids, they can make more.  Women have much more limited possibilities, for having children.  For them, the children they have may be the only ones they will ever get.  And so they can be expected to care about that future much more than anyone else.

The idea that I hoped prolifers would appreciate is this:  it shows that prolifers do actually value women.  We get tagged a lot with ""anti-woman"" views, as though half of the slaughtered (or more) weren't going to be women, if they had the chance.  And it's a way of trying to bring down the abortion rate without using the law to punish people whose concerns you will never share.

I would say that shows two things:  1) racism is a huge part of our lives today, and 2) racism (real racism) isn't conscious, but subconscious.  Reducing ""conscious racism"" hasn't reduced real racism.  And so ""conscious racism"" isn't racism, but just the APPEARANCE of racism.

Sure, doing so has saved lives.  But that doesn't make it real racism.  If that marriage rate had risen, at the same time all these other wonderful changes took place, I would agree that it might be.  But it CAN'T be.  Because that marriage rate hasn't budged.

Obviously, Hamas is a terrorist organisation. Doubt anyone is going to argue with me on that one.

Why Israel is a terrorist state:

* Israel's blockade and aerial bombardment on Gaza citizens over the last 15 years or so are to pressure the Gaza citizens to overthrow their Hamas government. This is terrorism. It's not done with suicidal bombings but with bombardments of civilians and civilian infrastructure and a restriction on basic necessities. You can claim that Israel is doing so in the name of ""security"", but you cannot deny that Israel is committing terrorist acts in the process of protecting their borders.

* The IDF and IDF-backed settlers often arrest, kill and [torture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping_and_murder_of_Mohammed_Abu_Khdeir) Palestinians in the West Bank for ""crimes"" like [throwing stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_stone-throwing#Deaths_and_casualties) at the IDF, [waving the Palestinian flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_prisoners_in_Israel), or just rubbing a settler the wrong way. These are acts that incite fear and terrorise a population. Also, whatever deterrent Israel has is clearly not working as it is still happening after decades of occupation, so Israel is complicit as well.

* Many members of the Israeli government and IDF have called for a [second Nakba](https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2023/10/08/Israeli-Knesset-member-calls-for-second-Nakba-amid-ongoing-conflict-with-Hamas#:~:text=Menahem%20KAHANA%20%2F%20AFP\)-,Israeli%20Knesset%20member%20calls%20for%20second%20'Nakba,amid%20ongoing%20conflict%20with%20Hamas&text=Israeli%20member%20of%20Knesset%20Ariel,overshadow%20the%20Nakba%20of%2048.), or [a genocide of Gazans,](https://news.yahoo.com/israeli-president-says-no-innocent-154330724.html) or simply called [Palestinians ""animals""](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2023/10/358170/israel-defense-minister-calls-palestinians-human-animals-amid-israeli-aggression).

Many many class in the curriculum feel the same feel, by themselves its fine, but in the grand scheme of thing its feel like its a very very broad learning and its feel really hard brain wise to jump from one learning to another that are sometimes quite unrelated. How do you get from learning programming to learning how OS works to learning how computer works, sure I understand why you need to know, but its feel nonsense and doesnt provide good evolution between them.

I have a hard time understanding how do you evaluate such broad knowledge and then its prove that you have enough knowledge to help.

When I did my first semester I also had a language proof class (class you have to prove you understand good level of the language to attend the university), but the class was entirely nonsense and that I dont see how does class like that were supposed ""prove"" anything really, 90% of the homework were proving we know some random conjugation, giving the plurals of some hyphenated words and some other things that felt totally random.

The competition for these journals is incredibly intense.

In Academia, it often feels like there's this unspoken rule that you have to overwork to be successful. Most of the researchers I know who've made it into these top journals have had to put in an extraordinary amount of time, often at the cost of their personal life and even their own health.  
But I'm here to have my view challenged. Maybe there are researchers out there who've managed to balance it all and still get their work into these top publications? Or perhaps there are institutions that have found a way to encourage high-impact research without pushing their staff to the brink?

No one is owed anything by definition, there's no set of laws set in stone or written in the clouds, every right that we have is because (as a society) we decided that people should be owed something (right to private property, right to be safe from violence, right to vote, etc...) because we believed that society would function better if people were ""owed"" a right to something. Kids are not owed by anyone a free education, but we collectively decided that having a reasonable level of culture would be good for society, etc... people demanding a living wage clearly believe the same applies to living wage

For those of us in the northern hemisphere, we'd probably pick something in the spring when the weather of the fall and winter don't hamper travel or outside activities.

Caffeine, unlike some drugs and alcohol, doesn't cause severe withdrawal symptoms. (And if you slowly cut back the amount you have over a few weeks, you may not have withdrawal symptoms at all.) Because of that, experts don't label regular caffeine use as an addiction.

No sane person would approve of armed resistance over border grievances to the level of Hamas's conduct anywhere else in the world, be they Northern Ireland, South Tyrol, Kosovo, The Kashmir. etc. The Settlements in the West Bank are condemnable, but their retraction has never been the focal point of Hamas's negotiations, only the release of more fighters from Israeli prisons.  
  
2: The civilian population of Gaza is too vulnerable and pathetic to be subjected to a full-scale war, and therefore war should be avoided at any and all cost.  
  
This also is not an issue that can be applied across the board to the same standard. Despite its lower level of legitimacy as a political power, Hamas did achieve that political power through the mandate of Gazan citizens. There are underlying reasons for this, but we have always understood that populations across history have elected aggressive leaders at their own peril because we are centuries past the era when warfare was conducted on an open field of battle away from civilian populations . Israel has at least ostensibly tried to lessen civilian casualties where they can. They can probably do more, but the danger of Hamas is still present and will probably remain so unless they're wiped out, and there is the exigency in rescuing a multinational group of hostages that number in the hundreds.  
  
3: The actions of Hamas are Israel's own fault.  
  
While Hamas did exist at its very first stage as a non-violent political entity at the encouragement of the Israeli government, this is not a novel concept in global politics. Sometimes the policies of a nation can indirectly lead to conflict down the road, but that doesn't take from a nation's obligation to protect itself. The most good will I could grant Hamas would be in the case of exclusively targeting military installations/personnel, but that's not what happened. Again, while Israel's policy of subjugation of Gaza and the West Bank are condemnable, peace through a wide variety of negotiations has been refuted by both parties for decades to the frustration of the rest of the world.  
  
FWIW, I think Israel should dial it back immediately when they find the off ramp, but the rescue of hostages is still an issue that can't be avoided.  
  
  
  
TLDR: Much of the global conversation is trying to assign a level of exception to Palestinians from the realities of war and regional struggles. This is doing great damage to our global understanding of warfare."

Most claims in favor of the Palestinian cause that I see just show conplete ignorance of the truth or the history of the region and conflict.

Examples:
Claims that Israel was given to the European Jews as an apology for the Holocaust.

Claims that there was once an independent Arab country named Palestine.

Ignoring Arab violence towards Jews in the region even before 1948/1967."

To me this kind of thinking of ""someone spend what they are willing to spend"" is just proof that you should not care. Personally I have a hard time to not stop someone to be this ""dumb"" on spending so much more for an item that they could have spend way way less. I dont understand people not caring about financial intelligence when spending 3-4$ for a can of soda in a restaurant, to me its literally nonsense and unwise.

No matter how lazy you could be, people spending extra dollar instead of taking a few extra minute to not do it is immense, the worst is when I see people paying that soda 3$ when barely the store next to it is a convenience store you could have paid 1.50$.

Its gets ever weirder when you look at some service like ""influencing"", I have a hard time understanding the logic, if I dont use a promo code to buy the service I have to pay more, but wit the code I get the service cheaper AND the influencer gets money, what? how does that make sense customer wise?

Let not get into brand that sell luxury, the whole idea is to sell just because of the brand name, nothing else.

How do you sleep at know willingly ""scamming"" people to buy something way way pricier just because of the name"

This is critical based on the state of the climate and our delicate ecosystems.  
  
Plant-based diets can also be a huge improvement over what many in the west are currently eating. For example, my country (USA) gets 150-200% of the protein we require and only 5% of us hit the minimum recommended daily fiber intake. This is critical based on the chronic disease epidemic we're in.  
  
We need to protect what is left of our biodiversity and change the way we interact with the environment. The WWF has stated we've lost 69% of wild animals in the past 50 years, and 96% of mammals left are humans and our mistreated livestock.  
  
We defend our current diets not because they are optimal, but because they're baked into our societies and current behaviors. It's true that diet is a personal choice, so why not choose a more efficient, compassionate, and sustainable one?"

Feminism has done a great job in uplifting women, in allowing us to access spaces previously only allowed for men, to give us more independence and societal power. Earlier waves of feminism haven't focused on uplifting femininity because they had bigger things to focus on like, like fighting for women's right to be ""masculine"".

However, I think we as a society, men and women, need to now grapple with the fact that anything traditionally feminine is never seen as important, hard, or worthwhile as things that are masculine. Child-rearing, teaching, housework, its all seen as ""less than"" compared to being a CEO for example. Even art that was traditionally done by women, like cross stitching, weaving, etc etc, aren't seen as ""fine art"" in the same way that sculpture or painting is. I think thats stupid. I think that it also makes men feel like they shouldn't try to do ""feminine"" things because femininity is ""embarrassing"".  Masculinity has always been seen as empowering, thats the reason why women needed to fight so hard to be able to be ""masculine"", but now we need to fight for femininity to be just as empowering. 

Feminism fights for equality between the sexes, so it also fights for men's rights, and now i think we need to fight for men's right to ""feminine"". I feel like anything that is labeled as ""feminine"" is seen as bad, and this ranges from wearing dresses to being emotionally in tune with yourself. I think it would be great if there was a body positive movement for men, for example. However, a lot more men need to get involved and fight in the movement for this to happen. While feminism has made a ton of strides, we still have a lot more work to do to protect women's rights that are being threatened. I also just don't think that women pushing for men to be more in tune with their feminine side, for their body positivity movement etc, would be nearly as successful and powerful as men pushing for it themselves. 

To be clear: I do NOT think this means more women should be more feminine. Thats an individual choice. However, I do think that men and women who choose to be feminine are still seen as less than (and I think that traditionalists who want women to go back to being feminine also see femininity as less than, which is terrible). We need to make it so femininity isn't seen as inferior to masculinity. We need to make it so there is no shame or stigma for man or woman to be as feminine or masculine as they want. "

6.children born from these marriage will get less time from father and might abuse by step-mom

5. Attractive men takes all women to spread their seeds while unattractive men and poor men will use  non- consented sex

6. Above reason may increase prostitution and women trafficking

7. Since there are less women so older men will marry little girls hence child marriage. 

8. some men will use wife count as pride while giving none emotional support to them.

9. step-brother , step-mom , step-wife all will fight for property ownership. Since more people are involved it Will be more complicated.

Yes SBMM is necessary for competitive games (I’ll use shooters since that’s what I’m most familiar with) such as CSGO and R6S, because they are competitive by nature.  As well, in those games you can see your rank and the point of playing is to win and rank up.  But in casual games such as COD it is absolutely unnecessary and even detrimental to the ability of anyone at least slightly above average to have fun playing the game.  In theory it should match you up against people your own skill right?  So what’s the issue?  The issue is it doesn’t work that way.  You have a few good games then the algorithm throws you into lobbies where each player thinks they’re competing for $1000000 otherwise their family will  get executed.  Then since you get absolutely buttfucked in a few games, the algorithm then sends you down to the lobbies where it seems like no one has thumbs or eyes.  These lobbies aren’t fun either because it feels like playing paint ball with an M16.  Since you do good in a few games, you’re right back up into the sweaty cesspool with everyone who can’t leave their mother’s basement.  Rinse and repeat.  Genuinely, who finds this fun or thinks this is a good model of matchmaking?  You can’t see the invisible ranking they are basing your matches off of.  They sacrifice your ping/connection just so they can fuck you over with unfun lobbies.  It doesn’t even feel like I’m playing the game at this point.  Everything feels pre determined as if whether my team wins or loses isn’t something that happens organically.  I haven’t ever seen one person claim that they enjoy this system, so why in god’s name does this persist in so many casual games?  It’s absolutely atrocious"

That is to say I know a lot about the genre (umbrella) and this isn't going to be blind bashing à la ""kpop cringe"".

This ended up becoming way longer than I planned, sorry for the text wall. I think my points are backed up pretty well though and this is a complex topic involving personal taste, economy and culture so it's difficult making it shorter.

While there is genuinely impressive facets to kpop, like select choreographies or music video productions, in my opinion, Kpop is a parody of the modern music industry. It concentrates all shadowy practices from other countries' industries, which exist too of course, into an apex of 

1. Shallow productions. With a few exceptions, a lot of Kpop tracks are objectively boring. Writing mainstream music is really challenging because you have to walk a line between mass appeal and being excessively formulaic/not having any highlights to your production at all that would risk not working for some part of the audience. I'm not talking down from a horse about how mainstream music is cliché and uneducated or something like that, I mostly listen to mainstream myself. But as I said, there is good and bad mainstream. Given that Kpop isn't one single genre music-wise (some songs *of the same artists* lean into pop, some into melodic hiphop, others into edm and again others into rock), you have to somehow boil down lots of preferences into a melting pot. It just doesn't work most of the time. You have unappealing synth lines, soft-boiled e guitars, drops that would make any edm fan laugh in how kids-bop they sound and seriously, **seriously** bad rap. This is one of the musical aspects that bugs me most about Kpop, what the audience acknowledges as ""rap"" is so, so bad usually that it sounds like an unfinished lorem ipsum working-copy placeholder. Something something the hood, bad bitch, buzzwords without flow or personality. Another great example of how Kpop runs down good ideas is with the demo versions I've heard. For instance, one song of the group Ive was originally written and demoed in English by a talented songwriter. The whole appeal to it, other than melody, was it's sexual undertone in a poetic manner. Now, the group that was going to release this song had a minor on it (we'll get into that, don't worry). They ended up, in my opinion, butchering the lyricism to something SFW that can be performed with the same aesthetic as always. There isn't any alternative to this, you can't make minors sing about BSDM, but this wouldn't happen if the debut age issues wouldn't be a thing (in other words, if they were sane and had adult artists as employees), which I'll talk about next. 
2. Jailbait. Kpop artists are getting increasingly younger. They've already normalized debuting 14 year olds instead of the previous 17 to 19 year old unwritten reference. For the record, if a kpop artist ""debuts"", they've already undergone several years of ""training"". So effectively, these kids have been at it since like early middle school age. The labels invest ridiculous ressources and reputation risks into their artists, turning them into de-facto venture capital stakes that can make or break a company. That pressure is simply not appropriate for kids still in school (theoretically). It's the socially acceptable version of child labour for the benefit of private equity. Now this is where things get seriously shit. One of the last high profile group debuts of the large labels hit the game with a mini album containing a track that is without any doubt about sex. Not only was it the worst song I have heard last year in terms of production, it was also super blatantly talking about vaginas. Why, on earth, would anyone think this is acceptable to perform for 14 and 15 year olds on a world stage? The answer is: cope! The stans, which this group had already gathered prior to releasing anything at all because of them being operated by a large label, started defending the song by saying that it isn't about sex and that the Korean lyrics were mistranslated. Which is complete nonsense because the English parts of the song are suggestive too. I felt super bad listening to that music despite being like 18 at the time and just dropped them from my release calendar straight away. We could go on about this forever, e. g. about too revealing clothing that the artists don't even really have a say in. Lots of sinister eyes are on female kpop artists in particular. The second search result (by sub count) when you type in ""kpop"" on reddit is an nsfw subreddit. I don't give a shit about how safe your safety shorts are, stop making kids wear shit like that on a stage for an audience so large that it statistically includes many adults nomatter how kids-focussed you are.
3. Parasocial relationships. Kpop banks very heavily on creating a bond between fans and artists that exceeds typical fan sentiments. This does exist to some degree outside Kpop too, for instance with Taylor Swift, but the significant difference is that the Kpop equivalent fosters romantic relationships on top of that. Kpop entertainment agencies prevent most artists from any sort of romantic relationship on their own because that prevents two key models: shipping different kpop artists and shipping yourself with a kpop artist. The only exeption to this rule is when artists get so popular that they command some leverage of their own over their employer and cannot realistically be prevented from dating someone. Kpop stans sometimes seem like proxies in an MLM, conditioned to shoehorn ""their"" group into as many awkwardly unsuitable memes and twitter threads as possible.  I used to see it on Twitter, now I'm seeing it when checking Tiktok sounds usually tied to a trend performed by Tiktok users themselves. And then kpop stans try their very best to find some footage of their idol that could remotely fit the trend and edit it in a similar fashion. This might not translate if you haven't used Tiktok before but just trust me when I tell you that it seems desperate somehow."

Before anyone assumes anything: YES, it is 100% the owner's responsibility to train their dog and make sure they do not show signs of aggression or any inappropriate behavior, especially if it's a naturally aggressive breed like Dobermanns or pitbulls. And yes, most of the time dogs that attack people unprovoked live in bad conditions or were untrained.   
  
Imagine if people said ""there's no such thing as a bad person, only bad parents"" to defend a serial killer. Obviously the environment they grew up in can be the make or break of their evil desires, but it does not MAKE them into a killer. Those actions come from within when they are born. In my opinion, it is the same for dogs or any animal. People need to stop blaming the owner of a dog they spent time and effort on in training when their it suddenly goes haywire out of their control. Some dogs, like human beings, are just naturally evil and it's not anyone's fault."

I believe men and women are equal and should be treated as equals. My reason for not using the term ""feminism"" is quite simple- when I say I believe this the follow up question is ""are you a feminist."" 

To me the idea that men and women are equal and should be treated as equals is a fantastic idea. No notes. If I express a humane, sincere belief like that and the person I'm talking to says ""but are you this"" my instinct is to say no. Because it's clearly not the same thing to them. 

There are two ways to look at this. Either they are the same and feminists ask ""are you a feminist"" because they feel like they need to- in which case I would say that habit is bad for the movement- or they are not the same in which case the movement itself is the problem. Either way, if at some point in time you could say ""I believe men and women are equal and should be treated as equals"" and the person who asked said ""oh cool I'm a feminist too"" I think way more people, men and women, would refer to themselves as feminists. That really should be the same thing in my eyes, because that idea is perfect as is. 

But I look forward to hearing other thoughts and possibly changing my view."

I believe marriage is a life long commitment and knowing someone for one year is not enough time to fully know them or make the biggest decision and marry them. I know couples in my personal life who got married quickly just to divorce less than two years being married. I’m 20 and i’ve noticed a lot of people in my generation don’t believe in marriage, I think there should be a talk to have a few months within dating to see if that is both of your guys end goal. And i know it’s different for couples who are 30+ and dating but i still see this getting thrown around at people in their early 20s. Another thing to mention is I know after 8+ years and still no ring then that is considered a red flag, but as mentioned earlier i think each person should be aware of what they want to get out of the relationship within the first few months of dating. To summarize it up, get married at whatever time you feel is best and you fully know your partner. If you’ve been dating for 2 years i don’t think you should automatically expect a ring."

let me now counter the most immature and baseless argument that “not all men are bad but if i gave you a box of chocolates and 1 was poisend you’d be cautious right?” or any other analogy along these lines.

are you seriously comparing humans to chocolate? is that your moral compass? not only that it is the EXACT same argument racists use to defend their racism. for example “of course not all black ppl are bad but MOST of them are. so i have to be cautious at all times”.

if you use the chocolate analogy to somehow justify your hate towards men and wonder why racists are the way that they are- congrats you are no different from them and share the same world view."

I think the majority of workers are inherently lazy. They want and expect a full salary but when it comes to working they just want to coast, basically they are free loaders. You get to realise this when you begin hiring people for gigs and jobs. They will put in the least effort yet expect the full pay. I gave this guy a job to clean the yard at my construction project. We worked together since morning then i left to get food at 12. When i came back at 1230 he had taken a shower and was out of his work gear yet the job was far from over. I had brougt some coffee and forgot to put sugar since I don't take sugar and he wanted me to go and look for sugar and also to pay him. Bear in mind he is a poor lad and should be working more than me since I'm paying him but yet helping with the work as well.

An uncomfortable chair is the best chair.",u/welcometodumpsville,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17td5ir/cmv_egononomic_officegaming_chairs_are_a_scam_an/,changemyview,"Overly cushioned and 'supportive' chairs cozen you into spending hours on end in a single position, which is worse for you in the long term than sitting in a suboptimal position for a short period. The best chair is the chair that encourages you to reposition frequently and isn't an impediment to natural shifting/fidgeting. I think if you have a job or a hobby that requires prolonged sitting in front of a computer, the best way to protect your body is to use an uncomfortable chair.  
I don't pretend to be an expert on spinal health or ergonomics, I'm not an OT or an orthopedic surgeon, but I am a nurse. I base my opinion on the ffollowing:  
a. My back and neck are fucked, and  
b. A huge part of my job is preventing and managing the results of prolonged static positioning: [bedsores](https://www.hauoratairawhiti.org.nz/assets/Uploads/Pressure-Injury-Grading-Chart-April-2019.pdf)  
A goodly chunk of most nurses' workload (and the reason why so many of us have back issues) is manually repositioning immobile patients like human pancakes to prevent their skin from breaking down. Afull thickness bedsore can develop in as little as 2 hours of immobility, and then theres all the [other effects of prolongued sitting.](https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/sites/default/files/2022-03/literature-review-of-the-hazards-of-sedentary-work%202.pdf)  
So while I'm familiar with back pain, my take on how to manage it is to choose a chair that is so devoid of padding and supports (my dream chair = wooden platform on a pneumatic height adjuster) that it forces the user to fidget and reposition, and maybe get up, frequently.  
Sure, you may spend some time with less-than-optimal alignment or posture, but I'll bet that it's still better than your body than blobbing out for hours on end in a chair that's so comfy you can't feel the damage its doing to your body.

1,2023-11-12,CMV: There are no actual idiots,u/ColossalFuckboy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17teyyu/cmv_there_are_no_actual_idiots/,changemyview,"If you're someone who frequents the Internet, you probably hear the term ""idiot"" thrown around rather generously on a daily basis. Gotta admit, in my earlier years, I not only called a lot of people idiots, I *thought* everyone was an idiot. They wouldn't hear me out, wouldn't believe me, didn't understand what I was saying, etc. As I grew up, I figured out two things: (1) I was terrible at communication, and (2) everyone is amazing at something or most likely many things. So now my point of view is that, any time you think someone is an idiot, first consider the followings (in no particular order):

* **Personal beliefs:** In this group we have religion, culture, family rules, personal upbringing, etc. Any of these things could be ingrained in your mind at a very young age, and can follow you for a long while in life, until you learn new information and can think for yourself. And even then, the effect can still be so profound that you decline new evidence / explanations.
* **Lack of knowledge / experience:** No one calls a 4 year old an idiot because he doesn't know why the sky is blue. Heck, I bet if I asked 20 somethings why the sky is blue, most of them wouldn't know why, let alone come up with a coherent, science-based answer. But any of them can Google and about 2 minutes later they would be able to tell me why. Does this mean they were an idiot in the first place? The same thing applies for experience. You might think younger people are idiots because they don't know their ways in life or can't handle basic tasks, while it's just because they haven't had enough exposure to such things. An adult can't fold clothes? Well their parents never let him. An intern messes up some Excel formulas? He has just seen them for the first time this week. He might also never have had a computer in his home growing up.
* **Poor adjustments:** You hear an adult say something awkward/unfunny/mean, and you think to yourself wow what an idiot. Guess what, maybe his parents never joked with him around the house, always yelled at each other instead of having civil discussions, everyone was mean towards him at school, girls never went out with him because he looked like a dork, etc. The reasons are endless, but you can blame none of this on the guy. He was never properly *adjusted* for life.
* **Lack of care for society:** You just spent 20 minutes explaining to your roommate why he can't leave socks everywhere on the ground, and he just doesn't seem to get it. I'd say maybe he just doesn't care. Maybe he left socks on the ground for 20 years in his house, no one ever complained about it, and now you're making it a big deal. Maybe he's stressing about his failing grades, student loan, morbid  weight gain, girls' rejections, etc. It can be anything, the point is what's getting your OCD triggered is *currently* none of his concerns. He's just putting himself first.
* **Lack of care for subjects:** I made this a different point because it concerns knowledge more than feelings. Let's say you talk to your cousin about world events, and he doesn't even know a financial crisis occurred back in 2008, much less why it happened. He can't tell bonds from stocks, and he dumped his life savings into crypto because many tiktokers vouched for it. You think dude is absolutely clueless, and he is an idiot. The thing is, at another event where people talk about medieval art, dude just goes on for hours discussing timeless works and their contexts and influences, while you have no idea what's going on and immediately forget what it was about afterwards. All because he cared and you didn't, which is totally fine and natural.
* **Attempt to communicate:** Someone approaches you and asks a *noob* question, maybe makes a wrong assumption therein, you give them a patronizing smirk and think they're an idiot. But have you entertained the thought that they just wanted to start a conversation with you, get the ball rolling with something minor, easy to discuss? Doesn't mean they are incapable of asking more complex questions. Also, see point above about lack of knowledge / experience.
* **You are bad at communication and might even be wrong:**  There's that situation when you keep on explaining things again and again and the other person doesn't get it. There's also that situation when you assume something is too basic and the other person should know it, without you explaining it in the first place. I touched briefly on lack of knowledge, but the problem might also be coming from you, maybe you're just not speaking your mind well enough, or in a way the other person can understand. If you are not explaining it because you think it is too basic, remember that a basic thing for someone can be a totally advanced thing for another (see point above about lack of care for subjects). Besides, you might be wrong. You corroborated a story with what *you* know and came to conclusions based on it, but you didn't know all the pieces in the big picture, you just made assumptions about the rest.
* **Actual mental disabilities:** I'm not gonna say anything about this case, except no one should ever call them idiots.

These are some of the points off the top of my head, they might be overlapping and I might be missing others. What I'm mostly trying to say is, everyone has had different experiences in lives, so everyone is an expert at something. If you think someone is an idiot for some reason, there might be a different, equally legitimate reason why he'd think you are an idiot as well. I think it's just natural and human, because no one has enough time and, more importantly, care to learn about everything and think everything through before they act or speak. Based on this premise, it must follow that everyone is an idiot, or no one is, and I'm leaning towards the latter."

I don’t care how many little nodes of information you can place between an input and output. I don’t care how many things might influence one particular outcome. Things either happen or they don’t. There is no cosmic “in between” in any way, shape, or form.

I don’t understand why people think that an effect with multiple causes cannot therefore be dualistic. As if the effect does not still either happen or not happen. It’s great if you can isolate the variable that ultimately decides if the event happens or not, even if that’s multiple variables, but the outcome is still the same: it either happens or it doesn’t.

It doesn’t even matter if you try to say “well we mean non-dualism as in it could be C or D, not just A or B”. Sure, and it could also be A and B and C and D. But that doesn’t change the fact that if the outcome is D, then it is D and it isn’t A nor B nor C. And if it is A or B or C, then it isn’t D, nor any of the others. It’s dualistic. Is or isn’t.

And I’m not going to go into pairs because I don’t want to send myself down that rabbit hole before bed but, c’mon, so many things naturally occur in two’s yet dualism isn’t reality? Right.

“Is or isn’t” is a phrase that can be applied to LITERALLY everything. A or B. Name one thing that isn’t “is or isn’t”. Oh, but that sentence right there is dualistic itself. Funny!

One of my math teachers said to me “you can’t be close in math, only right or wrong”. He’s right. And as an extension of that: sure, you can actually be close, but you’re still wrong. Are you picking up what I’m putting down or do I not get what I’m putting down?

Some may think that the Soviet Union’s Great Famine in Ukraine or the famine caused by China’s Mao Zedong-era Great Leap Forward are evil. But the more I understand American history, the more I think the American government is even more inhumane. Unfortunately, many Americans and their puppet states do not know this because of the brainwashing of the American government. If China and Russia are rogue regimes in the world, then the US government is the devil of the earth.  
I must tell you a fact: Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Norway, Italy, Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands are all just colonies of the United States, or puppets of the United States, or satellites of the United States. country, definitely not a sovereign country. The U.S. government is like a circus, making people around the world think that many countries are engaging in equal diplomacy, and the international order of these equal diplomacy is led by the United States. The show looked so real that it fooled a lot of people. Because France is not stationed by the US government, it has a certain degree of diplomatic autonomy. Macron even shouted the slogan ""European independence"", but it is completely meaningless. This is a failure. Because there are American troops everywhere near France, and there are American troops stationed in Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain.  
Canada is an economic colony of the United States. On January 30, 2020, the powerful Trump replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and the United States deepened its control over the North American colonies. Canada also buys various machinery and equipment, industrial materials and food from outside every year. The total import volume is almost 45 million US dollars, of which 65% comes from the United States and only 7.4% is purchased from China.  
Germany and Japan are stationed by the United States with more than 20,000 troops, and their foreign policy has completely obeyed the orders of the American father. In domestic politics, these American colonies have a certain degree of autonomy, but the people of these countries like to imagine that ""international"" diplomacy is about equality and ""free, democratic, and equal"" exchanges between countries, but they are unwilling to admit it. The fact is that their country is a colony of the US government.  
Every time I see the U.S. government saying ""China challenges U.S. allies..."" I find it ridiculous. Does the U.S. have allies? Isn't it a colony?  
\> In the new strategic guide released, U.S. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro listed China, military culture, climate change and COVID-19 as the four major challenges facing the U.S. Navy. Among them, the guide states that the long-term challenges posed by China are the most important.  
\>  
\> Del Toro wrote: “China is a looming challenge and we must plan our battle strategies and investments. For the first time in at least a generation,\*\* we have a strategic competitor. China has the same capabilities as us. have comparable naval capabilities,\*\* and seek to use deployed force to challenge American principles, partnerships, and prosperity.""  
Well-known German writer Michael Lüders has published a new book, ""Pseudo-Saint America: Why We Must Step Out of Its Shadow,"" which provides an in-depth analysis of the ways in which the ruling class in the United States and the West controls public opinion, influences national will and collective spirit, and incarnates ""invisibility"" government” and “the true ruler” process. This is what American politics really is, a classic circus.  
Why do so many people know this, but some still don’t believe it? In fact, the CIA invented the term ""conspiracy theory."" The author of the book ""Conspiracy Theory in America"" ​​is Professor Lance Dehaven-Smith, which tells how the CIA invented this term. The original purpose was to attack those who questioned Warren's Commission's report after the Kennedy assassination. Later, the use of this term in the media was vigorously promoted by the CIA.  
The book has been overlooked because the American media and public are shaped to view the U.S. government as truth-tellers and those who expose government crimes as ""conspiracy theorists."" This is a very good brainwashing effect. You don’t have to believe what I say and continue to hate China and Russia, because many Western countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Australia, etc.) are in The Truman World, but they have nothing known.  
As far as Internet censorship is concerned, not only does Internet censorship exist in the United States, but many ignorant people also think that they have ""free speech"" and ""democracy.""

Ohio train derailment sparks perfect TikTok storm: https://www.wired.com/story/east-palestine-ohio-train-derailment-tiktok/  
If there were no other social media with a large number of users, it is possible that the train derailment would have been more closely scrutinized by the US authorities, and it would have been harder for the news to reach people around the world. The spread this time relied on Tiktok, and now it has exploded in Russia and China. In the end, the US government was unable to control the spread of the news, so the news media reported it on a large scale.  
Moreover, the riots triggered by the death of black man Floyd in 2020 were themselves spread through Tiktok. Tiktok has become an excellent tool for Americans to defend their rights. This is why the US government banned Tiktok because it would threaten the interests of Wall Street capitalists.  
In fact, the biggest impact of China's Tiktok on the US government is that they can no longer block information arbitrarily.  
The structure of the U.S. government is different from that of the Chinese government. The top level of the U.S. power structure is Wall Street capitalists (Wall Street capitalists also own a lot of land), the middle level is the government, and the grassroots are workers; while the top level of China's power structure is the ruling party and top officials, and the middle level is State-owned enterprises and private enterprises, the grassroots are workers. The greatest achievement in human economic and social history is China's more than 40 years of reform and opening up, which has allowed China to develop from the poorest country (in 1980, China's per capita GDP was even lower than Bangladesh), using the production method GDP, compared with the Western expenditure method GDP, to An economy with a GDP per capita of US$12,000. Not to mention that the U.S. government’s GDP is produced by printing money, playing with the financial industry without real industries, resulting in monetary inflation. This is the hollowing out of the industry. In China, roads, railways, airlines, electric power companies, water and electricity companies, high-speed rail, banks, etc., these industries are all state-owned enterprises, and they can operate at a loss. In the United States, where enterprises are highly privatized, medical expenditures account for 18.1% of GDP. , but the effect of medical insurance is not better than that in China. What does this mean? Can you believe there is no medical complex behind this?  
Regarding human rights, it is even more ridiculous for the United States to accuse China and Russia. At present, the United States has actually admitted that it is a country that condones torture. President Bush also issued an executive order on July 20, 2007, reauthorizing the CIA to operate a detention program in which they can conduct long-term incommunicado detention at undisclosed locations. This form of detention, which in itself amounts to torture or ill-treatment, violates international law and involves many countries to varying degrees. The CIA placed detainees in a situation without legal protection and even concealed their fate and whereabouts, making them victims of enforced disappearances. The number, identity, fate, and whereabouts of those currently and formerly secretly detained by the CIA remain unknown.

How can a country that cannot even guarantee the safety of its people have the right to mention the word ""human rights""? it's a shame. What does it mean that a country with the largest GDP in the world has such a serious failure in large-scale urban governance?  
I hope to see the economic collapse of the US government and the collapse of the political system before 2050. Let Americans achieve better economic development and lower crime rates, instead of zombies filling the streets of Philadelphia and robberies everywhere in big cities. More importantly, the world will no longer be troubled by wars forcibly launched by the United States, fewer people will die because of American conspiracy, and the hundreds of millions of souls massacred by the United States can rest in peace.  
Countries that have caused their people to suffer because of the financing and instigation of the United States: Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Vietnam, Panama, Yugoslavia, Georgia, Ukraine, Libya, Tunisia, Egypt, Hong Kong...  
O suffering people, hundreds of millions of dead souls, may you rest in peace.

1,2023-11-12,"CMV: to cycle on public roads, an easy to obtain license should be required.",u/catboy519,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17tky5q/cmv_to_cycle_on_public_roads_an_easy_to_obtain/,changemyview,"Before anyone thinks im a carbrain, I only commute by bike and don't have a car or a car drivers license, my view is that: bike good, car bad.

I know one of the arguments against it: bike good, car bad, people should be encouraged to get on a bike and requiring a license would get in the way of that goal.

However I don't think that requiring an easy to obtain license has to be a problem. A license for cycling does not have to be nearly as complicated as the one for cars. There should be a cycling exam with mostly safety-related questions.

Lets say there is an exam with mostly safety questions.

99% of the population passes, good for them because the fact the passed means that they've learned how to ride safely in traffic.

The other 1% will have to keep learning until they eventually pass the exam, and until then they can walk and use public transport. Which totally sucks very much, but if they failed an easy exam it means they would be a big danger on the road, so let them learn and pass the exam first, then they can ride.

Whats the downside of an easy to pass exam? A very very small amount of people will be limited to walking and public transport. Is it a problem yes it is, but its not a big enough problem to be worth more than the lives that will be saved by licensing."

1,2023-11-12,CMV: Therians will never be fully accepted by the society.,u/Cutest-Kangaroo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17tm0td/cmv_therians_will_never_be_fully_accepted_by_the/,changemyview,"This is a topic I genuinly believe to be an unfortunate truth, but also something that conviniently prevents me from feeling bullied here, or at least it should, so I'm hoping for constructive discussion for a change folks.

\---- 

Acceptance is a difficult term to define, because it seems somewhat subjective, but what I want to talk about is a state in which someone like me can feel safe to discuss their identity, treated with common decency, free to express themeselves without fear of repercusions and having a right to be ensured mental and to possible extent physical wellbeing. So an average person should be at least aware of the topic and receptive to it.

Therian is anyone who identifies as a non-human feral animal on a deep integral level. I myself prefer to use term transspecies as I believe it betters reflects how I feel, but it's not that common of a term between therians even if it is universally understood.

An average therian knows they are in a human body, but for some reason feels like a different species inside or that they should have been born a different species or that they should become a different species. This type of identity is involuntary, develops in some form in young age and is universally accepted by the individual.

\----

Now if you ask me, I don't see a reason for why we wouldn't be accepted or at the very least tolerated, but experience has tought most of us that we aren't exactly welcome anywhere. There are very few of us which means few people have heard the term or even contemplated idea of someone not feeling like a human. This of course means there's very limited research on the topic and as such the origin of our identities eludes us. I can only tell you for a fact that most psychologists have ruled out species identity disorder for us. We are by all means sane and healthy and well functioning indviduals and yet we still identify as non humans, improbability to most. There's a very nice [article](https://unherd.com/2023/05/the-animals-trapped-in-human-bodies/) that explains a lot of things about us in an impartial way and again if someone isn't biased to hate us there's no reason to dislike us.

Still most common reactions to meeting a therian is to call them mentally ill, impaired, a troll, attention seeking or a zoophile. For most people it's difficult to believe someone could be genuine about this and usual reaction is to deny and ignore the idea alltogether and I can't exactly blame people for ignorance (I can for hatred) since we are so few, which makes breaking this loop nigh impossible.

\----

Of course that's just external part of it, because we also have to deal with our problems on our own. Every therian is different, vastly different. Some have urges, others don't and those with urges may have hard time hiding them, things like barking or ear twitching. There's a question what should we eat, what should we waer, hell to some it is important how they shit. Now they may not be big issues, but everyone deals with them differently and then can make us seem weird or not decent. And these are just mild issues.

Because there's also a very important question, how do we get offspring? Can we mate with our own species? Isn't being with a human a bestiality too? Most therians are still into humans, some are exclusively into other therians, but at the end of the day the topic remains grey for therians, there's no good answer, because you wouldn't blame a human mating with a human and we are no different, why blame a therian for wanting to be with their kind and having correct offspring, it's not a fetish. Of course if anyone needs me to say it, no therian would ever endorse rape in any form or shape. The point is the very existance of this topic makes for a poor line of argumentation when somoene can just call us a zoophile which is a social death sentance and that just rallies people against us.

There's also dysphoria. Some don't experience it at all, some feel longing and pain of not being their species and some fall into depression and even become suicidal. You wouldn't blame someone trangender for feeling pain of not being their gender, but while these people get care and affirmation, we are blamed for all out shortcomings in life, our mental state is dismissed and people drive us to the egde and sometimes beyond it, there have been victims of suicide already. Dysphoria about gender is one thing, but when your entire body is wrong, your hand, legs, face, you lack fur and tail, you can easily fall into a pit of dispair and it really is a nightmare and hell to many of us. If anyone has dysphoria that they can't deal with it, there's no support coming from families and friends or doctors or anyone else and instead of making us look like we are in need of help, it makes people further distance themeselves from all of us while we continue to suffer and then possibly will die.

It's a really difficult topic to talk about, I could recommend some sources like r/therian and r/otherkin and [therian guide](https://www.therian-guide.com/index.php/1-home.html), but at the end of the day people make opinion based on first impression and we are not very good at it. And we haven't talked about implications of anthropocentrism, it's not one sided, there are some of us who don't like or even hate humans and not without reasons for it. Animosity between both parites don't exctly drive dialogue, does it?

The list keeps going, I'm sure you can figure out something uncomofrtable yourself.

\----

Summing this up, there are very few of us worldwide, we are too different to be trusted as genuine and therefore ignored or persecuted for who we are. We can't really break this cycle at all and there's no source of validation we can seek other than each other. So how in this state can therians become recognised as equals in this world? How could humans ever accept the fact they aren't the perfect species and that some are repulsed by the idea of being a human? How can humans deal with that legally and morally which undermines the whole anthropocentric base of the society? I'm not going into detail about any rights or being entitled to anything, I would just like to know that one day I won't be persecuted for who I am and that I can have right to be as close to my real self as possible. But that's just a fever dream...

So yeah change my view, restore faith in humanity, that is, if you didn't give up reading that while cursing my name... which you know, would prove my point. If mods remove this due to rule 4, which I don't believe I broke, but maybe I somehow did, then, well, it would kind of prove my point as society would limit our ability to spread awerness. Good luck? I realy hope you can convince me, it's in my best interest."
1,2023-11-12,CMV: I shouldn’t have to change for you.,u/intwined,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17tmb9n/cmv_i_shouldnt_have_to_change_for_you/,changemyview,"Forgive me if mental health posts aren’t allowed, I did just re-dig the rules but I also interestingly didn’t find much with the DeltaLog. Guess I’ll write this and see if it stays.

I shouldn’t have to change for you.

‘I’ refers to mentally ill folk (though it could refer to anyone, realistically; if you relate to this without having mental health issues then GOOD!). ‘You’ is not literally you, rather society as a whole. Please do not feel targeted this post. Forgive me if I get carried away, but understand I am not mad at YOU.

None of us should have to change anything. We didn’t ask to be brought into this world. We didn’t ask for the cards we were dealt. We didn’t ask to be raised the way we were. And we certainly didn’t ask to come out like this.

“But nobody did.” EXACTLY! So why should ANYONE have to change for anything?

**And let me clear, I don’t mean that I think we should be handed everything.** No, I don’t want you to ban from me a job and put me on financial aid because I’m depressed. What I DO want is to de-stigmatize it (not just depression but all mental health) and stop feeling like it’s something I need to change. **No, that doesn’t mean I expect everyone to like me by default.** But do I HAVE to do therapy? Do you HAVE to put me on emotionally numbing drugs? Why can’t I just have my own place in society? **Why do I have to fit my space, not the space fit me?** 

I don’t understand why we as a society in all our modernness and exponential advancement still cannot learn to accept & embrace people who are different. Let alone accommodate them sufficiently. Do you think people in wheelchairs can really go wherever they want? No? Then the world does not accommodate them sufficiently.

So, I don’t think anyone mentally ill should have to change. I think as horrible as a thing it is to say, it’s beautiful in its own way. But maybe because that’s what I want to hear from society.

Lastly, I don’t want to give the impression that I’m irrationally against self-improvement. **I do recognize that it is up to nobody but myself to better my situation.** I don’t expect society to hand me everything and I do try my best to build a good future for myself. The problem is the fact that I have to better my situation. The other problem is how damn difficult that can get, not just dealing with said issues, but dealing with society’s reactions to said issues. Probably because I feel that my situation is only a situation because of how society treats it, not because it actually needs to be a situation.

Forgive me if I’m being delusional.

Oh, and it’s very clear with the recent (past century) changes in our understanding of mental health that it is WAYYYY more of a societal norm than initially thought. There is quite literally a reason that society might need to adapt to us.

Please CMV. I want to live a more normal life."
87,2023-11-12,CMV: There is no scenario other than using adblock where people would justify using a service providing no compensation.,u/SwagMaster9000_2017,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17tmlt4/cmv_there_is_no_scenario_other_than_using_adblock/,changemyview,"The arguments for why it's not wrong to use adblock don't make sense to me. 

People are saying they need ablock because

  * Websites have started showing to many ads etc.
  * Some ads on Youtube are unsafe/have malware

This logic would not apply to any other scenario for example: 

* ""Walmart raised the price of a service from $1 to $10 so now i'm taking it for free"" 

* ""Walmart is unsafe because there was a credit card skimmer on a cash register. Therefore I can take items I want for free every week."" 


These would be considered stealing because someone would be getting a benefit that costs money even if it only costs Walmart 25 cents.

What scenario would arguments for adblock justify costing a business money but paying no compensation in return?

__________________________________________________________________________________

A rationalization is not a justification. 

 For example someone could be:

* annoyed by price increase
* offended by the fact that YouTube has unsafe ads
* not caring 

But these would be reasons why they deserve something bad not reasons why adblocking is not bad."

* There is nothing particularly *wrong* with well done steak, especially if enjoyed with and open mind. The taste and consistency are great and the only reason people consider it bad is the societal construct around it


* Well done steak does not taste worse than medium or rare, it just tastes different. It is very pleasant and is a good way to mix things up, and it is not a waste of the meat

* I would argue that well done steak is actually better than rare/medium steak with certain sides such as mashed potatoes, whereas rare steak would be better than well done with something like green vegetables. They just have different roles to play and one is not better than the other 

* Ground beef is almost axiomatically cooked well done and largely consists of cuts like sirloin. This demonstrates by implication that well done steak tastes fine and most people like it as long as it is not labeled as such

* Likewise it is nearly impossible to cook thinly cut steak rare. Think of fajitas. Generally speaking these are cooked well done, and people enjoy them"

Yes I know it's not too hard to find the studs (it can be on the edges of weird geometry, though) and it also can be a PITA to find pipes and conduit.

1,2023-11-12,CMV: There are two ways to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: total annihilation of one side by the other OR learning to share the land peacefully in one state,u/Schmurby,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17to5hj/cmv_there_are_two_ways_to_end_the/,changemyview,"About a week ago [I made a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17o9tyn/cmv_there_is_no_good_side_in_the_israel_palestine/) about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict where I said that I could not find a “good side”.  It got quite a bit of attention, and I awarded a few deltas to people who pointed out that innocent civilians that want to live in peace are “the good side”.  That was a huge oversight on my part when I was making the post. 

  
But, I got a lot of replies from partisans of either belligerent party who did not change my mind at all.  These people are utterly convinced of their own righteousness and the necessity of violence in defense against an existential threat to their chosen side.  I will include a few particularly illustrative quotes below.  

  
Reading through these and hundreds of others like them led me to the following conclusion.  This conflict will end in one of two ways:  a bad way, where one of the sides totally annihilates the other, or a good way, where the two peoples live in peace in one state with equal rights for both.  I do not believe that a so-called “two state solution” will work.  If it was going to work, it would have by now and I think, we have reached a situation where each side sees the neighboring state as an intolerable threat to their future.  They both want the same land.  One will have to leave, or they both will learn to share.  There is no other way.  

  
I will now lay out the reasoning behind my point of view.   
  
The Bad Way:  
I’m convinced there are a lot of people who are using the perceived threat of genocide as a means to gear up for an actual genocide.  I would be happy to just dismiss these people as frustrated cranks but, unfortunately the facts on the ground for the past several decades would suggest that the views below actually hold sway with the political and military leaders of both Israel and Palestine.    
Here are a few of the most telling quotes I collected from people who support the Israeli side (Note: making some edits in spelling and punctuation for clarity):

  
“Until the Arabs in the Gaza Strip love their children more than they hate Israel, there will be no peace in the middle east.”

  
“Gazans celebrate death.  
Israelis celebrate life.”  
  
“the majority of the Arabs in Gaza are supportive of the destruction of Israel as a state and the Jews as a people.”

  
And here are the partisans of the Palestinians, using very similar language:

  
“The good side is the Palestinian people, in all forms. They are being wiped out to have their homeland stolen, and all forms of their resistance to that are self-defense and completely justified.” 

  
“No one in Israel is a civilian. They're entire way of life is based on the extermination of the Palestinian people and it was designed that way from the start. Israel has been consistently murdering, raping, and imprisoning innocent Palestinians for decades.”

  
“I have no doubt that there are many people in Israel that are not pro-Netanyahu but they are benefiting from the occupation of Palestine.  It is ridiculous to suggest that most of the population is innocent when this has been going on for 75 years.”  
  
Is it possible to take any of the statements above at face value and not think massacre is justified?  
I mean, if you were a Jew living in Israel and you earnestly believed that the majority of the population in Gaza supports the destruction of your state and your people, would you be comfortable with having them as your neighbors?  Would it occur to you that destroying the population of Gaza is reasonable given the extreme threat that they pose to your existence?

  
And if you were a Palestinian who accepts that the entire way of life of Israelis is predicated on the murder, rape and imprisonment of your brethren, would you be ready to acquiesce into any kind of agreement with the leaders of Israel?  Or would you be ready to commit acts of horrifying brutality in order to avenge the injustices of the past and to build a safer future for your people?

  
It’s worth pointing out that these are just the views of a few people on Reddit who likely have never been to Israel or Palestine.   So, can you imagine how much more convincing such arguments must be to people who have actually lost loved ones or who have been permanently injured or who have been unjustly imprisoned in the conflict?  Do you think that such people will be supportive of compromises with their adversaries to reach an equitable two state solution or do you think that they might be ready to commit a few war crimes?  
  
The Good Way  
Everything I wrote up there is super depressing.  And unfortunately, the likely future for the beleaguered region is even more terrorism and brutality.  But, I want to say that there is another way, however, unlikely it may be, and that way is to learn to live together in peace.  It’s not that hard when you think about it.  Two people want to occupy one land.  So just share, right? 

  
The blueprint for how this would work is South Africa which managed to transition from an apartheid scenario where the descendants of a settler population willingly gave up their status as a privileged minority and agreed to end the system where non-whites had less rights.  The black and colored population accepted this agreement without violence or retribution.  In order for this to work in the Holy Land, however, a few things would need to happen:

  
1.	Recognize the right of all parties to live on the land as they wish – This means equal votes for all with some kind of parliamentary system but also rights for all.  So, no legal oppression of LGTBQ or women allowed.  But also the right of religious conservatives, be they Muslim, Christian or Jewish, to preach tradition. 

  
2.	Shared control of police and military – Obviously there has to be buy in from both sides in the security organs if this is to work. 

  
3.	No more “What abouts?” – If there is one thing that I noticed from my earlier post, it is that partisans of either side are unwilling to recognize the feelings of the other.  So, if you bring up the October 7 attacks to Palestinian supporters they will say, “But what about the decades of apartheid?”, if you bring up the massive civilian deaths in Gaza to Israeli partisans you get, “What about October 7?”  This needs to stop.  Probably a national Truth and Reconciliation Commission should be created so that all parties can air their pain and suffering in a public forum attended by all. 

  
4.	No more revenge – This is the hardest part.  For this plan to work, it’s going to mean that people will have to say, “I know that I’m not going to get justice for the death of my father”.  This is extremely difficult and completely counter to human nature.  But I firmly believe that it is the only path forward. 

  
So, there we go.  Those are my two recipes for peace in the Middle East.  One is a path of brutality and murder, the other tolerance and understanding.  I wish I could say that I have hope for the latter, but I’m seeing a lot more popular support for the former.  

  
Change my view.

First of all, if high schools actually taught classes like taxes and personal financial literacy nobody would pay attention anyways. Second of all most people don't understand that subjects like math and science are like weightlifting for your brain. When do you ever see a football player ever do a squat on the field? Never, but doing squats builds up a level of strength in the legs that is vital to being a good football player. Same thing with school. You'll so often hear that ""ill never use algebra in the real world"" when the whole point is that you learn how to problem solve and also understand concepts and put them to work. English is an important subject because having good grammar and being a good writer is important no matter what. Thirdly you'll hear people say ""oh school is designed to made us into complacent workers who follow orders"" and this just isn't true. It's really not a crazy thing to expect kids to listen to their teachers and follow simple instructions (Which you have to do in the real world no matter what your job is)

My main gripe with the education system is that public schools in America do not pay the good teachers enough so any good teacher has no incentive to stay at a public school when they can go to a private school. The material we teach is 100% the right stuff."

In my opinion, a hit and run should be treated as worse than a DUI. People should have to face that their DUI caused an injury, and not try to wait it out elsewhere.

You crash a car without injuries and stay with no alcohol - No punishment.

You crash a car without injuries with a DUI - Short jail sentence

You crash a car without injuries and hit and run - Double that jail sentence.

You crash a car with injuries and stay with no alcohol - No Punishment.

You crash a car with injuries and a dui - Let's say a year in prison.

You flee an injured driver - 5 years in prison.

You kill someone without really being at serious fault - no legal punishment

You kill someone while DUI? - 15 years in prison.

You kill someone and flee?  - Life in prison.

It should be worse to flee because there needs to be a multiplier to outpace the game theory.

But if you born ugly and wealthy you still will encounter tons of rejection and humiliation. Your wealthy peers will judge you as much as if you all were poor.   


And you will never become good looking. People will always judge you first by your looks. Your romantic life will be on hardest mode possible. From being ugly kid to ugly adult you experience lifetime of rejection. From getting jobs to getting family your life will suck guaranteed. From being kid to being old person. It will worsen you mental health also. And most importantly you will never know how drastically different life of a good looking person is.

&#x200B;

Below is the event that motivated me to post this: 

&#x200B;

Over the weekend, my friend threw a party and I (**29M**) went with my new girlfriend, Lacie (**18F**). One of the other girls at the party, Jillian (**30F**), who I've known to be an outspoken feminist, freaked out when she found out my gf's age. Lacie and I were sitting in a room with several other people, and Lacie mentioned in passing that she was a freshman in college. Jillian jumped up and said ""Wait, you're a freshman in college?! How old are you?!"". Lacie responded ""...I'm 18... why do you ask?"". Jllian proceeded to go on a rant about how I was manipulating Lacie and taking advantage of her youth, and that no man my age should ever date a girl who is Lacie's age. She accused me of being a predator and a misogynist in front of Lacie, as well as all of our other friends. I almost got really angry, but I stopped myself because I know I don't need to justify anything to Jillian. Lacie started laughing and asked Jillian if she was okay. This made Jillian more angry and she started yelling at Lacie, telling her that she was foolish and immature for being involved with me and that she would one day regret it. Although I did not get very angry, I will admit I did say some immature things to Jillian, such as ""Jillian you're just upset that you missed your shot at finding a decent guy because no one wants a woman who spent her twenties having sex with random losers and then suddenly wants to settle down"". I believe there is definitely truth to this statement, but I could have worded it in a less demeaning manner and I shouldn't have stooped down to Jillian's level at all. Jillian ended up storming out of the room and leaving soon afterwards. Lacie and I had a good laugh about it after. 

&#x200B;

I truly believe the only reason Jillian and any other feminist would be so offended by a consensual relationship between two adults is due to envy. Lacie and I are very happy together and we have great chemistry. I believe Jillian realizes she has past her peak in terms of sexual attractiveness (even though shes only 30, she looks older) and is resentful towards us for that reason."

I'm talking about thinking about things as us and them.

And when I say eliminating capitalism, I mean communism.

I would like to say first that in my opinion, people suck. As a sucky human being, we cannot create a system designed and run by us that won't suck. But there is such a thing as a system that sucks the least. Capitalism may be a drill that sputters and sparks and makes a lot of noise and barely rotates at all. But that's better than a drill that just strsight up does nothing.

So, on to the main post. I believe communism fails for 2 main reasons. 1, it's impossible to implement at the government level because people will be corrupt and 2, it cannot work at the people's level because it is human nature to need motivation. To give no marginal benefit for harder work is against human nature.

Communism is the elimination of motivation. In a perfect world, we could work for the good of society and no direct benefit to ourselves. But this is not a perfect world and we are not a perfect peiple. Selfish motivation is in our genes. We cannot go against it. To try is a fool's errand.

In the same vein, tribalism is in our genes. We are wary of things that are ""other"". We have a sense of what we have built and what others want to piggy back off of. We had to suffer, and we want others to not reap the rewards for free by comparison. Unless it's our own kids. Unless it's our fellow tribesmen.

We as monkeys cannot consider everyone to be of our tribe. Maybe I can fight a war for everyone in my country. But if some out of towner wants to take advantage if my town's social policies, with the taxes that I paid, that makes me salty. So it's a scale.

At the extreme end of that scale is some random dude from the other side of the world. He is as other as it gets. How can the people here relate to him? We are told we have to be inclusive, but that is against our nature.

Going against nature is an uphill battle. Maybe we could have convinced everyone to share with an engine large enough to push up that hill. But we didn't have one, and I don't think we do now.

Humans are built to rally against a common enemy. Even if we successfully eliminate tribalism, then what? Everyone's a friend? What even is the purpose of life then? Of course that doesn't make sense. I'm not talking about logic here. I'm talking about human nature, and human nature is fiercely illogical. Yet, it's what we have."

While it can be argued that networking is true with any industry, I find that in the legal world, it's a whole other ballgame. In law, there is some personal connection rather than one just for ""networking"". It could easily be due to the nature of the profession itself which is more personal, the networking here is just so different. 

Maybe this is my fear, to enter the litigating world, but I have seen that those who are successful or get good clients always have parents/relatives/friends who are powerful.

Not just in the usual ""I don't like it so it's boring"" sense that people talk about studying different subjects. It seems like there's no depth to this subject at all, it's just pushing numbers around with a bunch of terminology. This makes it very difficult to ask any investigative questions like ""what if..."" that you can do with e.g. science.

With other subjects like science, engineering, software etc, the majority of the students are there because they genuinely enjoy the subject and have a curiosity about what they're studying. Not so with accounting. People only study it because they want to work at a finance company which they know (or at least think) will make them big money fast.

I think this also links back to a previous CMV where they were trying to teach personal finance to kids. People pointed out that finance is boring and getting kids to listen is impossible. I think my case demonstrates that it's boring to everyone, not just kids. I am of course not saying that accounting is a pointless subject, people do in fact need to know personal finance, and accounting is clearly a key component of any successful business.

I'm studying an engineering degree and am being forced to take an accounting class, so I am naturally filled to the brim with bias right now. The only interesting parts of the accounting course I'm taking now is when the prof occasionally goes on tangents about how various geopolitical events can influence accounting.

From 2001: A Space Odyssey we entered a new era of cinema, the next 12 years brought us: A clockwork orange, Jaws, Chinatown, Apocalypse Now, Taxi Driver, The Shining, One Flew Over the cuckoos nest, The Godfather, and even Rocky.

During this golden period the best  and most complex stories were given to the best directors, actors valued versatility and were being picked as great actors not just ass good fits for roles. The Star Wars happened.

Star Wars is a good movie, whether you're a superfan or not I think nearly everyone enjoys the original movie and did at the time, however it was something new. It was an intentional blockbuster the likes had never been created before. Yes, movies had been wildly successful before, but they were made to be good movies that gained popularity. Star Wars hacked the system, it had huge special effects, a plot anyone everyone can follow without losing nuance, action scenes, and romantic themes. It was a machine.

Following the success of Star Wars movie companies slowly stopped trying to make the best film possibly and started trying to make the next Star Wars. There were a few success stories (Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones) but there were a lot less great movies being made altogether. 

Fast forward through 40 years and we've hardly budged since. Great movies are still being made, but for every great movie there 5 marvel movies and 5 childrens films coming out.

Money was always a factor in filmmaking but Star Wars was the catalyst in making blockbuster films the framework for a major money maker.

Tl;dr good movies were more common until everyone wanted to recreate the success of Star Wars.


P.S. just to clarify I do like the original Star Wars"

I do want to say that from a worst case scenario standard, we are free in the sense that we are allowed to criticize our leaders without fear of being killed, I guess that’s a plus one for America there

However, in this day and age, whether it involves free speech or protesting or saying whatever comes on your mind, free speech doesn’t actually exist for a variety of reasons

1. You can get fired from your job for any reason. It doesn’t even matter what you say or do but you could be at a trump protest and a Co worker can see you there and report you to your job and they can fire you. Whether that’s fair or not is a different topic and post but your livelihood will be impacted even though we support “free speech

2. Your reputation can be ruined. Pretty simple in terms of topics that are sensitive, you can have good intentions but if you say the wrong thing that’s perceived by someone else then you’re fucked in your social life and potentially career 

3. In this day and age, you have a lot of people that are walking on eggshells and afraid to say what they want to say in fear of being punished one way or another


Now again I want to emphasize, the point of this post isn’t to argue whether it’s fair someone can get fired from their job for saying what they said, the point of this post is to just argue that the concept of free speech in America is extremely flawed and not accurate 

For example, I know in Saudi Arabia it’s illegal to protest. Now a lot of people can argue how backwards that is and all of that but I mean you have people in America who are protesting and still getting in legal trouble or job troubles one way or another so what’s the exact difference? It’s a lose lose at the end of the day, at least from my perspective so hopefully I can get my view changed. We shouldn’t be walking on eggshells and afraid of standing up for what we believe in, in a country like America that heavily emphasizes having rights and free speech"

Studies show that, to no surprise at all, the majority of truck drivers never go off-road, use the beds of their trucks, or haul anything ever with them, yet the truck drivers I know HAVE TO HAVE the largest, loudest thing known to man. Lifted trucks on knobby tires are frustrating for every single person on the roads, the lightbar blinding you is awful and should be illegal. Not to mention that the F-150 if I am not mistaken is the vehicle with the highest run-over death rate in the United States. They are the trashiest of trashy status symbols. Basically on paper, all signs point to ""truck drivers are assholes"".  


However, as I have matured, I have become a bit more relaxed about this philosophy (and many other judgemental ones as well). It all started when I got my first house. Making trips to Home Depot got more and more frustrating. *Where do I put all this mulch? I can't fit this 2x4 in my car. I bought a wheelbarrow, how in the hell do I get it home?*   


I started seeing the usefulness of having a truck bed to use for project-related things. I started seeing many Toyota Tacomas around town and finding myself saying... ""wow. I actually kind of like the idea of that"". Something small, practical, and not at all compensatory... if you know what I mean. And they kind of aesthetically look... appealing?   


Stereotyping, I know... but I just can't shake the feeling that the overwhelming majority of people who drive smaller non-domestic trucks, specifically trucks like Tacomas, are a much different ""genre"" of the person l than those who opt for the largest and most loud Ford, Chevy, or Ram. ""rednecks"" essentially vs. the probably financially well off person who just needs a practical vehicle that can accomplish some dirty tasks.  


Should I feel bad for hating on truck owners' full stop for so many years? I feel my opinion has changed because my needs have changed, and now I feel as if I have been lying to myself. I grew up in the rural mid-west and I just wanted far away from any kind of person from those small towns, and anyone with experience knows that the mid-west drives lifted trucks... to think ever in my life that I wanted to own a truck... it almost feels wrong.   


TL;DR: I feel that the dudes who drive Lifted Fords/Chevys/Rams are much more stereotyped than those who drive small Toyota Tacomas, and I can understand the need for owning a smaller truck for house/construction/yard projects. I no longer feel the need to categorize every single truck owner as  ""douche"", and it feels like there are many who are just regular people who needed a truck bed."

British Indians have a very different history and experience in the UK than British Chinese or British Arabs. Yet, we are all lumped together into one group as if we share as much in common as White people do. It's especially frustrating when people discuss racism in the UK because the apparent and relative success of British Chinese is often used to dismiss any claims of racism in the country. 

""Europe"" as a term does not just mean the geographical boundary of the European continent, it also refers to how the histories and cultures of different European states are intertwined with one another. But ""Asia"" as a term does not have any geographical cohesiveness apart from ""being east of Europe"". It is also incredibly reductive and dismissive of the cultural diversity you'd observe in all of Asia. Like, what commonalities can you find between Japan, Qatar and Sri Lanka apart from the fact they are all ""to the east of Europe""? Heck, I can easily split Asia into at least 4 separate groups, each as diverse and intertwined as Europe is. 

I don't know what the solution is because the word has become so ingrained in international politics, but I just want to raise how this designator is very unhelpful in describing what ""Asia"" is."

I think those concerns are very minimal or next to non existent for nationals of some countries visiting other countries. I think the visas process is more of a cash grab. 


I think it’s pointless for people from countries like Luxembourg, Switzerland, Caymans, Mauritius, Iceland, Fiji & similar nations (rich and or not known as trouble makers) to need and pay for visas for most countries.

I also think it’s *mostly* useless for citizens of countries like UK, US, Germany & Canada to need a visa and pay to go to *most* other countries. I know we don’t have to do a lot already but I needed to mail my passport in to get a visa for one of the poorest countries in the world. Why? I think if you have a valid passport & they know you’re there, that’s enough. The chances of a Western European or American entering a place like Surinam or DRC and looking to stay there illegally for years are next to none. If they are a fugitive, you know they entered your country (they would have lied on the rest of the application anyways). 

I can understand why China would want more info since there is a lot of espionage going on between the two countries. Same with Russia or other countries with strained relations. If you come from a countries that is a terrorist hot spot, I can understand some countries wanting more. 



So what other reasons would there besides money? Do you really think the threat of illegal immigration or other criminal activity is that high from travelers of certain nations? Why is more needed sometimes? Why isn’t a scanned passport on arrival enough?"

It’s a very intellectually lazy argument used by fans all the time. There are a litany of things that the “rings argument” doesn’t account for, such as quality of teammates, quality of coaches and front offices, injuries, eras and time periods, and, of course, the fact that said argument doesn’t account for individual accolades and accomplishments. 

There are countless examples out there, but for the sake of argument, does anyone out there really believe that Trent Dilfer is more accomplished than Dan Marino, Warren Moon, Fran Tarkenton, Dan Fouts, or Jim Kelly? Is Mario Chalmers better than John Stockton? Is Antti Niemi better than Henrik Lundqvist? 

Does anyone truly believe that Eli Manning is more accomplished than Aaron Rodgers, or just as accomplished as his brother? Is Matt Cullen better than Marcel Dionne? 

Naturally, those are all just a few examples, but I think it illustrates my point fairly well: it is extremely naive, lazy, and disingenuous to use the “rings argument”, especially as pervasively as it’s become. 

Now, I’m not saying that championships don’t matter at all; of course they do. But using that as a main argument when comparing players really just stifles any kind of productive discourse about the careers of athletes, and doesn’t make the point that fans think it does."

This hypothesis is the leading hypothesis to explain why human females are the only primates that have a hidden ovulation. Other primates have visible physical changes when they ovulate. Wikipedia writes: 'The paternal investment hypothesis is strongly supported by many evolutionary biologists'

In short, the theory states that, instead of being able to see when a female is ovulating and taking the chance to pass on his genes, the man has to actually stay around and provide the female with resources.

**Part 2: the shape of mens penises (the semen displacement theory)**

humans actually have a quite unique penis shape. But how cum? 

The accepted theory is the semen displacement theory. Basically, it says that the penis shape is made so it removes semen of competing men from the womans coochie.

**discussion**

Clearly, Bitches Aint Loyal™. Otherwise there wouldn't have been a massive evolutionary pressure that literally made all men of the entire world world have their penises evolve in a weird ass shape.

Now get this: Women want all the resources and loyality from men without even being loyal themselves? Doesn't that start to sound like a slithering snake that wants everything and more? Perhaps eve made that snake up entirely..

""b-but men cheat too! 🤓""

When women cheat, they do so in order to parasitize multiple men at one time and use their resources without giving anything back. If women complain about men cheating, they are throwing a tamper tantrum about no longer being their sole parasite.



It can't get worse, right? But oh boy, it can..

**Part 3: modern females**

modern females don't even provide children, the main value they provide for men. They instead abuse the mens evolutionary drives to get everything they want, and they make themselves look the victim doing so.

555,2023-11-13,CMV: The majority of people who think the economy is doing poorly dont understand inflation and the process of getting it under control and instead think they would be better off in a recession,u/lidlpainauchocolat,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17ugk46/cmv_the_majority_of_people_who_think_the_economy/,changemyview,"A large percentage of people currently believe that Biden is doing terrible on the economy, largely due to inflation and difficulty affording things. I think that is entirely because they do not have an understanding of what inflation actually is and dont realize that this is, in fact, the ideal scenario. 

When Biden was inaugurated, inflation was at 7.7% and is currently down to 3.7%. While still elevated, this is a remarkable improvement and the fact that we are slowly approaching the ideal rate of 2% without entering a recession and having people continued to be employed is remarkable. I think, what people dont understand, is that inflation is cumulative and the numbers will never go back down without major things happening and I would like to use the example of food to illustrate this. There are two things that will cause the price of food to largely return to where it was, either a technological breakthrough that doubles yields (not happening) or, the more likely scenario, a drastic decrease in demand because people are out of work and are no longer able to afford anything because the economy is in a recession. I think this later scenario is what many are naively arguing for! 

In addition, I dont think they really understood the 3 paths that we were facing at that time. The first path was runaway inflation, second path was slowly decreasing the inflation rate to 2%, and the third path was entering into a recession. I think we are currently on this middle path and seem to be doing it really well, but if you look at posts all over reddit, people will say, ""the economy isnt doing great, I can barely afford my rent and groceries when I used to be able to"". I am not saying that isnt true, but they dont realize that that is the goal. Would they rather we have entered into runaway inflation? Would they rather have lost their job and not be able to afford rent at all but at least the rent in their area hasnt increased? "

I don't think every American parent should have a massive gun safe stuffed full of a firearm for every conceivable situation, but I think that in America today, parents owe it to their children to give themselves every legal advantage over anyone who might wish to harm their child. Guns need to be properly secured, obviously, and kids need to be taught proper gun safety with a firearm in the house, but to me at least, that's common sense.

The world is dangerous. You can argue all you want that guns are bad or no one should have them, but at the end of the day, they're likely not going anywhere in America in the near future, and the first people affected by a gun ban are law-abiding citizens.

I personally feel that unless guns are completely outlawed in America, anyone who has a child in their home is being selfish by not allowing themselves the best possible chance to defend that child against a possibly armed predator. 

There's very little martial arts training that will put you on equal footing with a person armed with a gun. And it's been codified into US law by case precedent that police do not have to protect your life if doing so would put their own at risk. 

So as far as I'm concerned, safe, legal, and responsible gun ownership is the only way to ensure that my daughter has the best chance moving forward."
1,2023-11-13,"CMV: It’s Nazi-like for Trump to call his enemies “vermin”, but was just as Nazi-like for many people online to call the unvaccinated “vermin” and “plague rats”.",u/ApprenticeWrangler,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17uhi9u/cmv_its_nazilike_for_trump_to_call_his_enemies/,changemyview,"Now I will preface this by saying the gravity and impact of Trump making these comments is obviously much higher than some random redditors, but for anyone who was participating in online discourse during 2021 and 2022, you would’ve seen countless examples of commenters referring to the unvaccinated as “vermin” and “plague rats”.

Dehumanizing language and framing one group of society as “animals” or as being less than other humans is exactly the way the Nazis convinced the average German citizen to support the eradication of the Jews. The Nazis and their doctors convinced people that the Jew carried disease and even associating with them will make you sick. Dehumanizing people is what allows our consciences to be clear when they get exterminated.

It was terrifying to watch how average people acted when their fellow citizens for one reason or another didn’t feel like they should get the vaccine. They called for them to be rounded up, locked up or even killed. They laughed and cheered when they died and there was entire subreddits devoting to laughing at the death of people they deemed unworthy of compassion, or viewed as subhuman. They called for the “plague rats” to be excluded from society, lose their jobs, lose their healthcare and were viewed as a the enemy.

This is **exactly** the type of view that propaganda convinced the German people to hold about the Jews. The widespread propaganda spread during covid was similar to that used by the Nazis, and the effects were the same. We are just lucky that no politicians took the opportunity to call for the mass extermination of the unvaccinated because there would have been a large number of people who would have supported it.

Using dehumanizing language about people you have disagreements with or even your opponents should never been encouraged. This same language is being used in Israel to justify the mass murder of Palestinians because Israeli politicians are calling them “animals”, and when you view people as animals instead of humans, you don’t feel the same compassion or empathy when they get mass murdered.

Science around in-groups and out-groups show that in studies where someone is shown a hand being injured that has a label they associate with, the same part of their brain lights up as when their own hand is injured.

When the label is changed to one they don’t associate with it especially one they hate, there’s no response from the pain center of the brain. 

Propagandists know about this same effect which is why if you can convince the population to view a group as “the other” or view them as animals or vermin, you fundamentally lack the brain response that would lead to compassion for that group.

What Trump said was Nazi-like in the way it resembled language Hitler would have used, but the way people talked about the unvaccinated was Nazi-like in the way the Nazi supporting Germans were complicit in the holocaust."

I know just enough about economics to work myself up into a panic, but maybe not enough to actually know what's going on. 

It was announced, just yesterday, that the Fed is terrified that people have become complacent with inflation. Basically, companies jacked up the cost of everything due to all of the side effects of the pandemic, but then people never stopped paying the higher prices so companies keep jacking them up even further to maximize profits. The problem here is that wages will not necessarily increase evenly for everyone to afford the new prices, consumers will default on ever-worsening debt, and corporations will no longer have a steady consumer base for the high prices that everyone is used to. A recession with a varying degree of severity then hits the country, carrying all the normal effects. In the absolute worst case scenario, the recession is so severe that the US government needs to print money to make sure society doesn't collapse, and then the dollar becomes worthless. They don't want that to happen, so the failsafe in that will ultimately obliterate the middle class.

This kind of collapse is always a distant possibility, but it feels different now. 2008 was mostly a housing bubble that drove this kind of inflation, and the main cause of the panic was mortgages. This is an everything bubble. Not just houses: but cars, food, air travel, business to business services... everything! Inflation got higher last year than it's been in 40 years, and that is just with the CPI. It speaks nothing to the level of complancency Americans have with higher inflation. I think what makes this significantly worse than previous hyperinflation is: 1. Globalization is much higher than it was previous times. and 2. We are a stone's throw away from automation and AI taking up enough jobs for us to feel it.

Middle class America can more or less withstand certain things being out of their reach because wages are stagnant. It's pretty much happened with home ownership already. The wages of some fields have skyrocketed compared to others, but automation has already eaten up a chunk of higher-paying jobs. For the next recession, the number of jobs that will be able to afford the new prices of essentials will be lower than ever before. The global economy is even more intertwined than before, so the ripple effects will be worse for the whole world. The Fed will not print enough money to cover this, nor will the IRS raise taxes on the wealthy to help prevent this. Instead the vast majority of us will be left in either squalor, or some kind of worse communism."

Semi-earnest opinion mostly posted for thought experimentation. 

* - Due to the mechanical makeup of the human mind human beings will, regardless of any feasible circumstance, suffer far more pain than it will find pleasure. 

Births
———
1) It is immoral to create beings that will primarily suffer. 
2) Any newly created human will be a being that will primarily suffer. 
3) Human reproduction should be ceased. 

Existing Lives
———————-
1) It is illogical to continue an experience that is primarily suffering without payoff. 
2) Life as an experience that is primarily suffering, and absent death-denying magical metaphysics, is without payoff. 
3) Living beings should cease the experience of life. 

Combo
———-
1) New humans should not be created. 
2) Living humans should cease living. 
Ergo: Human consciousness should be eradicated."

But the reality is that, for most people, BMI is actually not a bad way to measure their overall health, if they're going to just use one metric. Regardless of precise it is, BMI has been shown to generally correlate with specific health outcomes. It's pretty reasonable to say ""if you have X BMI, you're more likely to get Y disease"" if you can cite scientific consensus, and all you know about their health is their height and weight. You'd be backed by decades of scientific literature.

Furthermore, for public health, there is no good alternative. We have tons of bulk data for height and weight. Widespread availability of data is the only way to have consistent and standardized comparisons across different populations. We don't have nearly as much body fat or A1C data etc. Furthermore, BMI is simple and almost completely standardized. A lot of other metrics are measured and reported in different ways; they're just not going to be as reliable as BMI for public health.

Of course, an athlete with a high BMI should not necessarily be considered obese, and someone who has high BMI due to underlying health conditions should prioritize treating the underlying condition. There are people who are ""skinny fat"" and face all the same health risks that obese people have. But that doesn't mean BMI is a bad metric. It just means people have misunderstood and/or misused it. It's a perfectly good metric that needs to be taken in context like anything else."

Now, they are supporting a country that, if “given freedom”, would be 100 times worse at least in all of these issues just like most of the other countries in that region, in fact it’s already pretty backwards as they stone lgbtq and ban abortions, I can’t imagine how much worse it would get if it was officially recognized. Why is there a different standard for Arab countries? Is it because the left, for some reason, loves their religion? 

I know a lot of people who are left-leaning don’t support palestine but this is to those that do, which I think is the majority.

Fast forward to 2020, I create another Reddit account, join a few groups and realise that people younger than I, do not provide valuable insight into anything! The rebellion nature of these young people is really disturbing.

Now, I'm apart of the r/quant thread, as I am a quant developer and have been for 10 years, theres so much valuable insight I know I can give, but will only do so from a bottom up approach.

But everytime I have posted in this forum (nothing bad btw), some smart mouth little prick who I know does not work professionally and probably never will in the industry makes a smug comment, which makes me think ""I now understand why nobody wants to help the younger generation""..

\----  
  
For instance, today a non-binary magistrate from the judicial power in my country (Mexico) was found dead, along with their partner, at home (presumably a murder). 

In the comments of the media posts that shared the news, there were countless people literally celebrating the tragic event, spreading hate speech (""one less f\*g,"" ""*he* deserved it,"" etc.). 

Others, instead of focusing on the gravity of the situation, were busy ""correcting"" the media that respected the magistrate's pronouns (in Spanish, they wrote ""magistrad*e*"" because it's non-binary, and many people commented things like ""that word doesn't exist"" and that kind of nonsense). 

I wonder, what the hell does a vowel matter when faced with the alleged murder of a government magistrate based on their gender identity? Are people's priorities really fixing spelling before empathizing and humanizing in the face of tragedies?

\----  
  
This issue was the last straw for me, but it's been several weeks of disappointment after disappointment on topics where I would think that, by common sense, basic humanity, and basic empathy, people would react in one way, and instead, they react in a very opposite way that saddens me. 

I won't mention the specific topic I'm referring to because it's not allowed in this subreddit (and I don't want the discussion to go off tracks), but I'll just say that there are people who justify and even applaud the killing of human lives just because those lives don't align with their political ideology.

\----  


Other issues I've come across that really sadden me lately include pro-Franco demonstrations (with a large number of attendees) in Spain, singing ""Cara al Sol"" (Francoist anthem) and making fascist salutes. I mean, you'd think that, by common sense, supporting dictatorships and washing them with nostalgia shouldn't be happening, and yet, here we are.

\----

I know ignorance, hatred, and the lack of critical thinking aren't new, but personally, I see it more and more each day, and it hurts a lot. Gradually, I'm starting to think that it's not worth living in a world with so much hatred.  
  
I don't know, I hope you guys can change my view 

(  I'm not asking to change my view on inclusive language, people getting murdered, or fascism. 

What I wanna figure out is: how do you deal with so much hate in the world? Cause I'm thinking I just can't. That's the view I want to change. Thank you  )"

Which if you want to lose the weight and keep it off you need to be able to stick to it forever otherwise you will just get fatter than you were before. It's so sad to see a bunch of  obese people counting thier calories, weighing thier food on a food scale and doing 2 hours of cardio everyday only for them to just get even more fatter than they were before. It's sad when I see obese people eating fat free foods because they think that eating fat makes them fat or going on keto because apparently the carbs are making them fat. Just

I’m a queer for Palestine. I acknowledge that Hamas and Palestinians generally hold pretty abhorrent views on gay people. And if I was openly gay over there, they would probably do awful things to me. I don’t want to discuss the actual conflict much, there’s plenty of that happening already, I just want to stick to the issue of LGBT people being pro-Palestine. If you want to talk about why being pro-Palestine generally is wrong, please take it to another thread. 

So why do I support a people who would want me dead if they knew who I was? It’s pretty simple really. The right to self-determination extends to all peoples, not just those who I agree with.  It’s not really my place to step in and say no, you people are too homophobic, you’re not allowed make your own decisions. To me, that’s a recipe for disaster and justification for a repeat of the colonialism of previous centuries. There are many sovereign countries today that are as homophobic as Palestine. That doesn’t make any other country justified in invading and occupying the people there. So that’s why I think it’s wrong to say that gay people should automatically be against self-determination for the Palestinian people just because they’re homophobic."

Im also an atheist, and I have absolutely no issue against Jews or Muslims, and I consider myself central on the political compass. This post is not politically, religiously or racially charged. This also has nothing to do with the actual countries of Palestine and Israel themselves, I’m referring to the people you see online who live in western countries, who spam every social media comment section with “Free Palestine”, have Palestinian flag profile pictures and March in the streets for a Ceasefire in Palestine. The ones who’ll comment “How can you focus on this when there’s genocide in Gaza right now!”.

My view is that ,generally speaking, these people don’t actually care all that much about raising awareness for armed conflict and the devastation it leaves for the civilians. I’m not saying all of them, just generally speaking. Atleast 50% anyway. I think that they are jumping on the bandwagon because showing support for Palestine is trendy right now, and it’s “the thing to do” right now to show that you’re a morally sound person, that you care for the little guy and what not.

I think this, because there are literally more armed Conflicts than I could count all across the planet, happening right now, with many of these armed conflicts (especially in Africa), having far higher death tolls, cruelty, destruction and impacted/displaced civilians, that have been going on longer than the current Israel vs Palestine war, and yet there has been absolutely ZERO mention or “awareness raisers” from anyone anywhere online about them. I mean, these “Free Palestine” people claim to care about the innocent children impacted by war, but seemingly they only care about the children when they’re Palestinian, because currently, Sudan is the biggest child displacement crisis in the world right now caused by war, with over 3 million children from Sudan fleeing their country because of the war. And yet, have you ever seen a “Free Sudan” comment? There are currently over 40 million forcibly displaced civilians from armed conflicts across the continent of Africa. 

To put it into perspective, currently the amount of armed conflicts all around the world sits at:

- Africa, 35+ Armed conflicts
-Asia, 21 Armed Conflicts 
-Europe, 7 Armed Conflicts
-Latin America, 6 Armed Conlficts

Now out of these 69 armed conflicts to chose from to raise awareness for, to spam it in comment sections to prove to the world that they are a morally sound person, they all happen to chose this one conflict that isn’t the biggest conflict, not the bloodiest conflict, not the cruelest conflict, not the most destructive conflict, not the highest death toll conflict, not the conflict with the most impacted civilians, not the most needless ill-founded conflict out there, not the conflict with the biggest impact to children, not the biggest humanitarian crisis. 

No, they for some reason, seem to only care about the conflict in Palestine, but they do this, whilst claiming their moral superiority over you for being more aware about wars and humanitarian crises. And mysteriously, a good amount of these people prior to the Israel vs Palestine conflict, never posted/commented/raised awareness about any of these other conflicts, so I can’t even pin this down to their attention just being solely preoccupied by this conflict and that they would’ve been doing the same for a different conflict if this wasn’t happening. 

I genuinely believe that, certainly not all, but a good amount, probably the vast majority of them, have only jumped on the Palestine bandwagon, because it’s the trendy thing to do right now and that they do it to feel good about themselves for establishing their moral superiority over people. My view is, a load of them are in it for the trend, not because they genuinely REALLY care about raising awareness for those impacted by war, because if they genuinely did care about that, then you’d see these people talking about other armed conflicts too, god forbid maybe even ones that aren’t viral on tik tok.

So that’s my view, is there something I’ve massively overlooked? I am open minded, and if someone comes along with a genuinely good counter view, maybe you’ll change my mind!

And again, this is NOT a politically, religiously or racially charged post and viewpoint. I do not support Israel or Hamas, and the war between the two is undoubtedly, a needless waste of life and a big humanitarian crisis. I don’t want to come across as a Zionist red pill freak, an accusation commonly thrown at anyone who doesn’t make their whole life about Palestine."

1,2023-11-13,"CMV: I dont think most people really get the ""All Eyes On Me"" Song in Bo Burnhams ""Inside""",u/Heyguysloveyou,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17uqqdy/cmv_i_dont_think_most_people_really_get_the_all/,changemyview,"From what I have largely seen online, be that comments or videos, most people think the song just stands for Bos own relationship with performing and panic attacks. And while I agree this is one layer to the song since a lot of the specail is Bo talking about that subject, people forget the other half of the song I feel like.

The song in my opinion is more so about Bo losing his faith and hope in humanity and our future, the rant in the middle of the song showing how Bo got to this dark place and how over the course of COVID he saw that there is no hope.

But what do I mean by that, lets look at the lyrics.

Bo sings in the song about having all the eyes on him and I think this is him singing about his and next generation having all eyes on them to fix the planet. To find cures for illnesses, fix wars, climate change and so on. He asks if we are nervous or having fun, says its almost over but it just began. This is obvious a referance to COVID, COVID being almost ""over"" but that our problems just starting as the world will continue to downward spiral, COVID being just one of the first major things hitting richer and luckier people. The water being fine is obviously a reference to oceans heating up and rising. 

He sings ""we are going to go, everybody knows"" which is him stating that everyone deep down knows that humanity is doomed and things will just get worse. Hell in the song before that he literally sang ""20 thousand years of this, 7 more to go""

Him saying to get your hands up/down and getting out of your seat is him demanding that people do something to help and stop where we are heading. He also demands to be prayed for which I go into more detail over in a second. Then we get the rant I already talked about. 

Then he puts his cards on the table with 

You say the ocean's rising like I give a shit  
You say the whole world's ending, honey, it already did  
You're not gonna slow it, Heaven knows you tried  
Got it? Good, now get inside

Its basically him admitting that he is completely empathetic at this point as the world is already over and humanity has lost, there is nothing to do but rest.

Then Bo has a little breakdown in which he takes the camera and screams at us. Showing that while he may act as if he doesnt care anymore, he truely is scared like all of us. Screaming at us to do something, to not just look at ""him"" but to do something yourself. We then he hear cheering which is the audiance not listening to him and clapping instead of praying. You could say that this Bo realizing that most people will consume the song, clap at it, not really think about it, not pray or work on improving anything, basically killing him and our planet by distracting themself with media. Which could tie back into the comedy song where Bo sings about how futile humor is to archive anything and questioning rather its really an art and movement or just a way to be pretentious and get money. The song then ends with Bo falling over and quiet showing how humanity will not go out with a bang but a whimper, quiet.

While I do think that the panic attacks on stage and so on are a part of the song, I heavily believe the main intend of the song is basically telling us (or the people who tried to make a difference but got either laughed at or ignored) that its okay, they did everything, if god exists he will be mercyful, but its enough. Just rest and watch how it all goes to flames within our lifetimes. Which also fits because look at how people trying to make a difference are often treated. Just look at vegans being insulted, shamed and made fun of for doing the scientifically and morally correct thing while those who do nothing or make it worse get praised. 

I think thats what the song was trying to say."

My role as parent is teacher, caregiver,healer etc. I can't even remember the names of any of my teachers. Why be sentimental?

And on our side, I'm ready to get my life and freedom back. The reality is raising a child is a massive commitment. It really is a fully time job. And like my paying job, I would like to retire. After retirement, I can't imagine wanting to think about the work I had to do. I can't imagine kids being any different."
1,2023-11-13,CMV: Entitled consumers are significantly at fault for high house prices.,u/No_Jackfruit7481,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17urani/cmv_entitled_consumers_are_significantly_at_fault/,changemyview,"My wife and I live in a 500 sq ft. house on a 1/2 lot. It was affordable with around median household income. If we have more than 1 kid, we could get a camper or build a small ADU. Maybe even go nuts and move to a 2 bedroom place. We also looked hard at new construction on a lot. It was also pretty affordable *if* done small and modestly. My wife and I have a superior living situation over the vast majority of people on the planet. Sounds great, unless you ask Americans. 

So, what *do* prospective buyers want (all from PEW research)?

2k square feet 
78% want 3+ bedrooms
83% want 2+ bathrooms
56% want 2 or 3 car garage
85% want open concept for kitchen and dining/ living room. 
21% want larger homes post COVID. 
The majority of all racial groups prefer suburbs, and that % majority is growing. 
Patio, front porch, and deck are deemed “essential” by 30%. 

I understand this is a complex subject. But part of the problem is that Americans simply want expensive, impractical things. Demand drives supply and now that supply is out of reach. Our collective entitlement over generations has heavily contributed to the affordability crisis we see today. Statistics show that Americans increasingly want bigger houses and more amenities in the face of economic hardship. They also show that we pay an increasingly high % of income for shelter. Something has to give. Why not the nature of consumer demand?"

The contradiction lies in the fact that those who resist representation and concurrently place blame on Black children for their perceived lack of effort in school seem to be, in essence, obstructing the very success they claim to endorse. It raises the question of whether their motives are genuinely rooted in supporting Black children's achievement or if there exists an underlying resistance to the idea of Black children thriving.

1,2023-11-13,CMV: Fantasizing about rape as a teenager is not in any way an accurate representation of your character,u/philiacat011,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17uu81a/cmv_fantasizing_about_rape_as_a_teenager_is_not/,changemyview,"So let me preface by saying by rape fantasizing, i mean by stopping time and having intercourse with girls which is a universal dream many (not all i don’t need anyone saying “..i never dreamt of that!”) teenage guys hold, specifically in school. 

If they are fantasizing about doing the actual thing not including time stopping but actually hurting a women then that’s where it real and they should 100% get help 

this post was inspired by a tiktok being posted on reddit and the comments were divided on women saying “what the fuck is wrong with you” and “your a rapist” while others saying that they were missing the point. And they were.

Stopping time to have sex with a girl is obviously extremely abusurd, but you have to recognize it’s an INTRUSIVE thought fueled by sexual emotions in which we all experience at that age. It’s a fantasy- far from reality it’s simply putting a taboo to give that sexual urge. 

if all of our intrusive thoughts were accurate representations of who we are, then none of us would be sane. it’s such a shallow thing to just slap the title of “oh that’s rape” instead of recognizing the nuance around it"

It's this idea of the internet being a ""source of information"". And so whatever you see is good enough to be true. Millennials and gen Z need to learn how to verify information on the internet, That was never a problem before, coz obviously publications did verify  information they published.
We laugh at boomers and our grandparents for falling for silly scams and yet here we are gobbling up bullshit with our tits out without even batting an eye. 

Like seriously? 
Things like the war in Israel, people just word vomiting right into other people's mouth and there you are swallowing someone's vomit and spewing it everywhere as truth. 

What happened to thinking for yourself? Or oh I don't know,  reading? Magazines and posts don't count 🙄.  Or even listening to people who have spent years educating themselves about a certain topic. (It is simple to know who is and who isn't) 

I'm so fed up of debating with people who have no idea what they are talking about.  A bunch of groupies doing information crack with zero knowledge.

This has become too much. Making educated people seem useless while incels get to be the infinite source.

PS. Just because someone says they know what they are talking about doesn't mean they actually do..... As a functional adult on the internet, you should have some kind of internet discernment."

1,2023-11-14,CMV: Marriage is for men who don't get laid,u/glitchjazzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17uygj4/cmv_marriage_is_for_men_who_dont_get_laid/,changemyview,"I am a guy in my mid 20s. I am 6'2, 85kgs, well built with 6 pack abs and I make good money while working from home. 

My dating life is absolutely amazing. I keep a rotation of 5 girlfriends and every other weekend go on a date with a new girl. There are women I am still seeing who I have been with for over 3-5 years and thus I have identified some of the women I will be having children with in my 30s. These women also have no problem with me having children with them and other women as long as I continue seeing them.

From my vantage point, I don't see a reason for me to marry any of the women I have been seeing as the concept of marriage has been capitalized in the modern society with only women benefiting from it. In case of a divorce, I'll be the one unfairly suffering the legal consequences as the guy.

The major reason men marry with these unfair legal conditions levied against them is because they don't get laid enough and they think that finally after marriage they'll be able to have regular sex. Some marry because they fear ostracization from the society. Some marry to produce kids. Some marry because their life is unorganized, and they think that after marriage their wife will finally fix them. The most delusion class of men find cope thinking that they are marrying the woman of their choice because they really love her and it's the right thing to do, but logically speaking even if you really love just 1 woman, there's no point in involving laws between the two of you as the guy(ofc the girl would love to involve the laws between you and her because it benefits her). In reality, these kind of men know deep down that their woman would leave them if they do not sign the legal papers with her but they refuse to admit it to themselves. 

So in my perspective, if you're a guy who is doing really well in life and you don't need a woman to fix you, there's literally no reason for you to marry her. The girlfriend experience is the best. Anytime she refuses to listen to you or crosses a line, you could simply walk away but with the legal papers signed, you lack this freedom."

744,2023-11-14,CMV: Trump’s odds of winning in 2024 are significantly overstated in betting markets (currently a 50/50 on predictit),u/Money_Whisperer,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17v10la/cmv_trumps_odds_of_winning_in_2024_are/,changemyview,"I feel that giving trump 50/50 odds of winning the 2024 presidential election is overly generous. 

Ever since Trump initially won in 2016, Republicans have failed to win at a national level. 2018 was considered a disappointment for them, trump lost in 2020, 2022 “red wave” never materialized, and now suddenly we’re supposed to believe that 2024 will turn things around. 

For Trump to win, he needs to pick up 3 of the 6 below states- 

- Georgia
- Wisconsin
- Arizona
- Pennsylvania
- Michigan
- Nevada

Georgia went blue because of the growth of Atlanta, which has only continued to grow. The population has gone up by 300,000 people since 2020. The whole j6 and Georgia lawsuits has only served to hurt Trump’s image in that state. I consider his odds of flipping that state very poor considering his position is weaker than the last time he lost.

I consider his odds to win in Pennsylvania incredibly poor, considering how his endorsement of Oz couldn’t beat a disabled candidate in the senate. PA is getting bluer. 

Michigan is a lost cause for the GOP considering how Tudor Dixon performed there. 

I almost didn’t include Nevada in this list because it has always felt like a stretch for the trump campaign. It’s a state that has very slowly started to shift red, but Trump needs to find 30,000 votes to flip there in 24 to win it and I don’t see where they will come from. 

Arizona is like 60/40 for Biden because of the continued growth of Phoenix and the unpopularity of trump there due to his arduous history with John McCain. 

And finally there’s Wisconsin, which was incredibly close and I guess he could win in 24. They had a winning gop race I recently. To be nice to him, let’s say that one is 60/40 for trump.

So that’s 1 state that he is 60/40 likely win (Wisconsin), 1 where he’s a 60/40 on the losing end (Arizona), and 4 where I consider his chance of victory to be very poor. I’ll assign them 25% chances of winning each. 

Plugging those odds into a calculator online, I see that his odds of winning would really be 11.27%, rather than 50/50. 

I believe that my estimates make sense given the current environment and issues like abortion making republicans have a very difficult uphill battle with voters. I’d be curious as to things I’m missing with my estimates that would require I shift my view.

51,2023-11-14,CMV: A ceasefire in Gaza is desperately needed,u/GoSouthCourt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17v26xk/cmv_a_ceasefire_in_gaza_is_desperately_needed/,changemyview,"As of a week ago, at least 10,000 have died, amongst which more than 4,000 are children. This figure would have been higher by now but hospitals are currently paralysed and they can't accurately report the death toll anymore. Even US officials [said](https://thehill.com/policy/international/4301551-gaza-deaths-likely-higher-than-cited-us-official/) that the real death toll ""is likely higher than reported"". This is what is at stake here, tens of thousands of lives, tens of thousands of children. A ceasefire is the only way to stop this bloodshed and [Hamas](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-armed-wing-discussed-releasing-70-hostages-return-5-day-truce-2023-11-13/) is open to a ceasefire by freeing hostages, so we need to pressure Israel to accept one.

For anyone who wants to see peace in the region, you must recognise that any peace process starts with a ceasefire. The question we need to ask is how will the peace process be different if we delay the ceasefire. To which I will say the longer we delay the ceasefire, the more bad blood there is between Israel and Palestine, and thus the tougher the road to peace will be. The only material advantage Israel gets by delaying a ceasefire is a militarily weaker Hamas, but in return, they will be dealing with a Palestine that is even more sceptical of peace.


*But what about the hostages?*

Israel should demand Hamas to release the hostages in exchange for a ceasefire. 

*But doesn't Israel need to eradicate Hamas?*

Barring killing all Palestinians, Hamas cannot be eradicated militarily. Their leaders are sitting in Qatar safely and soundly. In fact, the longer this ceasefire is delayed, the harder it is to eradicate Hamas (or any Islamic extremism) because many of the families of the victims of this bombing campaign will turn to extremism when the situation gets dire. Hamas or Islamic extremism can only be eliminated politically, by providing Gazans with a viable alternative to Hamas and stopping the [artificial propping up](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/) of Hamas.

*But Hamas won't honour the ceasefire!*

If Hamas violates the ceasefire, the fighting continues. I will point out though throughout this sensitive period after the ceasefire, Israel has to pull back on their aggression in the West Bank. Often rockets are launched by Hamas in response to Israel's violent aggression there.

*But Hamas will launch other Oct 7th attack, their leaders said so!*

It's generally agreed that the reason why Hamas was able to launch such an abhorrent attack on Oct 7th is because of the lack of IDF members towards the south. But now Southern Israel has been evacuated, IDF members are mobilised and stationed around Gaza, and the world's attention is on it. There's no chance any Gazan can step into Israel without Israel noticing. Another ground assault on Israeli civilians is impossible.

*But what about the rockets?*

Rockets don't kill Israeli civilians. And if Hamas fires rockets unprovoked, the fighting continues.

*But Hamas is a terrorist organisation, they can't be negotiated with!*

Israel has negotiated with Hamas plenty of times since they controlled Gaza in 2007. Plus, as I said, Hamas cannot be eradicated militarily, so whether there is a ceasefire today or in a year, Hamas is the organisation Israel will negotiate with whether they like it or not. 

*But Israel has a right to self-defence!*

Yes, but that doesn't stop a nation from engaging in a ceasefire. It also doesn't stop Israel from defending itself. They can continue to have a military presence around Gaza to protect Israeli civilians _and_ not constantly bombing Gaza."

Many women I know don't want anything to do with unattractive men even normal looking men despite good personality or wealth. Incels are CORRECTLY attributing their issues to their appearance. Please read the book ""Survival of the Prettiest"" which was written by a practicing psychologist from Harvard.

The book describes an even more alarming experiment: how mothers unconsciously better treat better looking babies; the difference of treatment between non-identical twins in poor families is most significant.

Genuine desire or true love can only ever dawn on the very-attractive. Most women enter relationships without truly committing romantically let alone sexually. They are as available to other men as when they were single. A men must become more attractive (keep working out, groom better) in a relationship, only then will their female partners feel the delight of ""as if having an affair."" See the following clip at 0:55. The sentiment is real, according to the people I interact with. https://youtu.be/WrZu__ubm_c?si=32bCy6felEVs4b0M"

There is zero chance that these people will be compensated for their lost homes & property. There is very little chance that they will be permitted to return to the rubble and rebuild. There is zero chance that the Israeli government will compensate the victims. 

All of this as collective punishment levied upon civilians for the acts of a few Hamas terrorists. This is evil, not as evil as Nazism, but certainly not good. 

How are people saying Israel has any moral, ethical, legal justification to collectively punish thousands by forcing them to evacuate their homes so Israelis can destroy their homes, without *any* just compensation? How is this not among similar evils perpetuated by other authoritarian regimes? Compliance with “international law” or not, how can these actions be defended?"

I believe that it is true that the Communist Party hid crucial information in the early stages of the virus outbreak in Wuhan, allowing it to spread worldwide via air travel across the world, especially during the Chinese New Year period in 2020.

After everywhere in the world was locked down and people were confined to their homes, some people (Chinese dissidents, Hongkongers, right-wing media, etc.) began to blame the Chinese government, saying it was responsible for the virus being able to spread.

Some people even said that the Chinese government should be held accountable for covering up the extent of the outbreak in Wuhan (i.e. via sanctions and lawsuits, etc.).

However, while I understand these points of view, I don’t believe that it’s logical to hold the Chinese government responsible for the pandemic.

I’m 31m, been single a few years til about 6 months ago, met 32f who is perfect on every metric.

Except. Shes very eager to have kids. Is the only child of her parents so is the only chance of them having grandkids, and her friends all have kids she’s a godmother 3 times already.

My view of kids has always been “if I have to”, and when I met my partner I said “I’ll imagine I’ll have them some day”. And I told her this as well, quoting every single person I know with children saying “it’s the best decision of your life, you’ll never know stronger love etc etc.”

So we’ve started visiting her friends with kids, and my nieces and nephews, and tbh Reddit I’m looking at my watch every minute. I’m seeing the destroyed houses and the dirty faces and the screaming and climbing and smells and tantrums and CONSTANT CHATTER and if anything I’m less enthused.
My reasoning:
1) the world is over populated, there doesn’t need to be more children.
2) I shouldn’t have kids just to have someone to look after me in my old age.
3) I’m loving the fact I can do whatever I want whenever I want within my work schedule/budget, I don’t want to give this up.
4) Financially it’s over 100k to raise a kid, money I could put towards my retirement/home.
5) I’m not even a pet person let alone a kid person.
6) My parents already have grandkids, I’m not obligated to provide more.
7) I just do not have the patience

Caveat though, if I were to have a kid, there’s no one I’d want to have a kid with more than my current partner. She’s wonderful, she’d make a great mum and I’d never be sick of her. Part of me will concede to the kid just so we don’t break up.

Soo it falls to you Reddit. Would love a response that counterpoints my view above.

Please don’t give me platitudes: “ it’ll be different when it’s your own” and for the love of the divine I don’t need “hey man if you don’t wanna have kids you don’t have to, tell your partner it’s unfair” I KNOW.
I’m looking to have my view changed. I WANT to want to have kids I just don’t.

But we end up ignoring all the failures or non-survivors, and thus bias our sample and draw incorrect conclusions.

My great grandfather smoked a pipe for decades and never got lung cancer. However, that doesn't mean smoking doesn't cause lung cancer. Statistically he just got lucky.

It's common in the fitness industry. For example, people might see a successful bodybuilder and assume he/she is knowledgeable about training or nutrition. But genetics (or drugs) can play a huge role in success and the person might be successful in spite of his/her training or nutrition. Likewise, we might not listen to someone isn't extremely muscular, even if the person is extremely knowledgeable but just doesn't have the genetics to be a ""survivor"".

You also see it in the ""hustle and grind"" business ""success"" culture. We see someone successful in business and we assume their hard work and hustle got the person there. But we don't hear about all the people who fail WHO DID THE EXACT SAME THINGS. We forget how much luck and timing can play a role.

Stock market trading is loaded with traders who seem to be always making money. But you're only seeing the survivors (and many traders don't post their losses). It can make trading seem like easy money when it's actually the opposite. Statistically most traders lose money. You also saw it in the recent crypto bubble. You'll hear about people who made money in crypto but you don't hear as much about the people who lost money. And given crypto is a negative sum game, the average crypto bro is mathematically guaranteed to lose money.

Always try to be aware of survivorship bias. We're all likely guilty of it at some point or another."

I want to stop and say right here this is NOT a woman bashing post. It is also NOT meant to say women do not have REAL and significant challenges and struggles.  If you take that from this post, you missed the point. 

All humans struggle and helping people is what is important. 

That said when you look at most key data points, it paints a bleak picture for men that for someone reason gets completely overlooked. 

Men:
* die 6 years early than women
* Are significantly more likely to die of suicide
* Are significantly more likely to be murdered
* Are significantly more likely to die in combat
* Are significantly more likely to be addicted to substances
* Are significantly more likely to be incarcerated 
* Are significantly more likely to commit violent crimes
* Are significantly more likely to be injured at the work place
* The majority of college graduates are women

These are hugely significant data points and it's bleak for men.  

Women have it worse in some ways such as they are unfortunately often the victims of men's violence, they sometimes are paid less and suffer from misogyny to name a few.

But given the above, why in current society is it the default to assume men have it better. 

I would argue that neither gender ""has it better"" and that we should be helping people bases on need, not gender."

I'm sure there are many Canadian Redditors here in this sub who can CMV on this one and show me what I'm getting wrong.)

The planet will gradually grow hotter and hotter, forcing people to migrate northwards for cooler climates. 

From a resource standpoint, Canada has nearly everything: fossil fuels (although, given that fossil fuels are the main culprit for global warming, it may fall into disfavor if things have already gone this bad,) a liberal democratic government that is stable and ranks highly in human rights, arable land in abundance, an enormous amount of living space, waterways, access to two oceans, an economy that is already well-developed and prosperous, etc. 

As such, by the year 2050 or later, we might see Canada have a massive boom in population and economic growth. Canada can afford to be as selective as it wants in terms of immigration, permitting only the talented or wealthy to immigrate, which would further bolster the nation. Right now, most of Nunavut or the Northwest remains under-populated and under-developed, but all that could change with more people moving in and their climates getting warmer as well. With enough tech, development, infrastructure and energy, there is no reason Canada could not support a population of 100-200 million or even more by, say, the year 2070.

The other nation in the world that is most similar to Canada would be Russia, geographically, and despite its poor governance and lack of human rights or democracy, we might see a lot of people in Asia (particularly China) move up north as well if the planet gets hot enough. 

I would also expect to see lots of people trying to emigrate to Norway, Sweden and Finland - countries that are sparsely populated but have good human-rights and governance and are currently cold but would be perfect as the planet gets hot."

Of course, if Israel values the lives of their soldiers more than the Palestinian civilian casualties, then this would make no sense.  But it seems like the pro-Israel side goes a step further by arguing that ground operations would cause more collateral damage, not less. 

 

This seems completely counter-intuitive to me.  How could a bomb that indiscriminately destroys an entire building kill fewer civilians than a group of people consciously aiming and firing guns?  To be clear, I’m not saying that there would be no collateral damage at all, especially given that Hamas and civilians can be indistinguishable, and Hamas is willing to use its own people as sacrificial pawns in their tactics.  But it still seems impossible to me that more civilians would be killed than literally blowing up an entire building.

 

I’m very open to changing my mind on this because I am relying on intuition and I don’t know a lot about military tactics.  That said, I’m probably not going to be convinced by your off-the-cuff explanation.  I’d like to see a source from some kind of authority on the matter.  CMV."

PROBLEM -
Virgin vs Chad memes  - literally there is different cult and community of this meme where virgin boys/girls are targeted.
Millions of followers across platforms.

1. You don't decide what other like or not . You can't judge others for their sexual preferences.
( Especially when their choice didn't have negative effects on society )

2.  People demonise groups who don't agree with their views. They try to justify there behaviour by criticising them

3.  I am very emotional person. I easily gets attached to friends and cry when I lose them .
That's why I decided to wait for loved partner so my heart don't get broken.
My friends ( best ) laugh on me for being virgin.  I didn't get it ?

4. There is nothing called emotionless sex because physical and mental states are interconnected. Example - Physically healthy  body  more likely to have healthy mind . 

I personally don't want that attachment to any random person.

5. In sexualize world , do you think virgin can't get hookers or prostitute ?  Considering, they have more experience and expertise in this field and can give virgin ultimate pleasure.

Surely, it is another problem rather than getting a girl/boy.

6. Even conservative society mock virgin males and liberal society laugh on their problems. 
Conservative do slut shaming of female but liberal are against it. 
 PARADOX 
note - liberal also mock female virgin 

7. Why my sexual freedom and choice is not respected ? 
In this case, sexual freedom is not to do sex just because everyone doing .

8. Conservative - wants to save virginity until married
Liberal - fuk off virginity 

My view - it's my right to choose , you both fuk each other.  Politics is Just have dumb position on this. Instead accepting everyone choice they just polarised it. 

9. Peace of mind -  Virgin realy just to live in peace. No hookup , no breakup, no heartbreak, no drug addiction, no mental trauma, 

10. Focus on goals - many famous people are so concentrated on their goals , they usually skip the lengthy process of fuking around.

11. Procreation - doesn't goal of having sex to have kids historically.  Contraceptive are invented just a century ago .  Your ape brain want kids not waste of energy and sperm. 

12. If body count matters then every prostitute won gold medal.  Because you pay to have sex but they get money to have sex . Tell me who is boss here ? 

13. Leave virgin alone if you feel cheated ,abuse and torture by your partner and jealous that virgin faced none .

14.  Sex is happiness?  You know who are happiest person ?  Kids . Literally, childhood of every person are the happiest moments of their life . There innocent behaviour is blessing to the world.

Conclusion - you go, your way and I go, my way . let's not demotivate and insult each other. 
There is many path to happiness and everyone had the right to choose their way .
 
Note -1 here liberal are modernised , non -religious people with less IQ

And  conservative are religious and old way of thinking  people with less IQ

if you have more IQ, you belong to human race."

First, civilian control is not taken lightly by the chain-of-command and is often not taken seriously by the US government.

 Any oversight of spending and military operations by Congress is vehemently disavowed by the Department of Defense and related agencies such as the DIA or State Department, which in turn creates distrust between the civilian authorities and military authorities.

 Internal investigations by Congress, by the way is not a great place to start, or other jurisdictions with the authority and oversight are met with legal constraints by US laws and will be buried by piles of paperwork. Correct me on this one.

 Revolutions; Tiananmen Square, for example; tend to be thwarted by the military in case of Democratic rule of said country, and backed by military juntas that want nothing more than power and wealth.

 Intelligence gathering is nothing more than spying on civilians who have nothing against the military or have any affiliation with the military. Coercion and control play a big part in controlling the narrative and brainwashing normal people into thinking they're the good guys, regardless of whether they politically lean left or right.

 Propaganda is meant to create a false impression about efforts by the military about how they conduct themselves abroad and at home.

 And lastly, they're mostly afraid of being dismantled and taken over by said ""Revolutionaries"" that advocate for free healthcare and equal access to education, employment and sporting events without triggering some hard-core army fanboy. :)

But obviously, this is not the case with pregnancies resulting from rape, since most people can agree that women who are pregnant from rape are not responsible for that outcome in any way. 

So in the case of rape, a pro-life individual who normally believes that a woman has an obligation to gestate her unborn children on the basis of parental responsibility, can consider abortion to be morally acceptable on the basis that no parental responsibility exists. This does not compromise on their core pro-life values. "

Indeed, some reports use the less ambiguous verb ""cut"".

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna119902

The origin of this story seems to be reports from IDF and Israeli first responders finding bodies of children with their heads separated from their bodies. It is possible that this was the result of grenade or rocket explosions.

https://themedialine.org/top-stories/evidence-on-display-at-israels-forensic-pathology-center-confirms-hamas-atrocities/

It is technically correct to call these children decapitated, and Hamas was the cause of it by their intentional actions. Thus, ""Hamas beheaded babies,"" is factually true, but misleading.

Why does it matter? It's indisputable that Hamas killed children. Does the method matter? I think it does make a difference whether the children were killed as collateral damage from indiscriminate attacks or were deliberately targeted. The IDF would like to paint Hamas as inhuman, and thus dehumanize Palestinian civilians by association.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/12/politics/joe-biden-photos-children-hamas-israel/index.html

They needed to do this because their next move was to also kill children in indiscriminate bombing, and in greater numbers. In order to keep the moral high ground, they needed to establish a qualitative distinction between what Hamas did and what they were about to do.

Hamas unquestionably committed war crimes such as killing and kidnapping civilians. The IDF is also committing war crimes like killing civilians (even if they are ""human shields"") and cutting off essential supplies like food and water. But I think it's important to keep the facts straight about which war crimes each side are committing.

You can change my view with reporting from unbiased and/or reputable sources with first-hand or close to first-hand knowledge of deliberate executions of children. You could also change my view with the same evidence for other cruel atrocities beyond killings and kidnappings."

These lessons are essential for their growth and development, shaping them into well-rounded individuals.

Developing Independence

Firstly, taking the school bus fosters independence in children. It’s often one of the first experiences where they are away from their parents’ direct supervision. This scenario encourages them to make decisions, such as choosing a seat, handling their belongings, and following the bus rules independently. It’s a safe environment where they can start to rely on their judgment and abilities, preparing them for more significant challenges and responsibilities in the future.

Being responsible for catching the bus on time also instills a sense of time management and punctuality. They learn the importance of being on time, as the bus won’t wait for latecomers. This routine helps in developing discipline and understanding the consequences of their actions, which is crucial for their future academic and professional life.

Learning Social Skills

Secondly, the school bus is a social microcosm where children interact with a diverse group of peers. Unlike the controlled environment of a classroom, the bus allows for more organic social interactions. Children learn to communicate, share spaces, and build friendships. These interactions are pivotal in developing empathy, understanding different perspectives, and learning to respect others, regardless of their background or beliefs.

Dealing with conflicts or disagreements on the bus also teaches important conflict-resolution skills. Without immediate adult intervention, children often learn to negotiate and solve problems amongst themselves. This experience is invaluable in helping them handle similar situations in school or other social settings.

Handling Boredom

Finally, the school bus journey can sometimes be monotonous, providing an excellent opportunity for children to learn how to deal with boredom. In an age where digital devices are constantly at hand to provide entertainment, the ability to sit quietly and be comfortable with one’s thoughts is becoming rare. The bus ride encourages children to find ways to entertain themselves, be it through looking out the window, daydreaming, or engaging in quiet, introspective activities.

This experience teaches them that it’s okay not to be constantly entertained and that boredom can be a space for creativity and reflection. Learning to be comfortable with boredom is essential for developing patience, a skill that’s increasingly valuable in our fast-paced world.

In conclusion, the school bus is more than just a mode of transportation; it’s a learning environment that plays a significant role in a child’s development. The independence gained from taking the school bus, coupled with the social skills developed and the ability to handle boredom, are invaluable lessons that prepare children for the challenges of the real world. Encouraging children to take the school bus not only eases the logistical burden on parents but more importantly, contributes significantly to the growth and development of the child."

1,2023-11-15,Cmv: Maybe nato is already dead,u/Goos_Blah_Blah,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17vmte3/cmv_maybe_nato_is_already_dead/,changemyview,"Article 5 of nato is what everyone pays attention to the most when it comes to the alliance, it means every member will treat an attack on one as an attack on all. So if Russia were to attack France, or China were to attack the United States. The treaty obligates every member to respond with everything they have , and the shadow of our collective force is supposed to keep enemies at bay. 

In my view nato is already dead or is dying and I do not say that in a positive light.  Many people like to cite Donald trump and his open, blatant and explicit attacks on nato when discussing the threats to the alliance but in many ways Emmanuel macron saying France would not help America in a China Taiwan war  signals the death of nato because it comes from a sane , sensible and credible foreign leader who has time to think before they open their mouth . Emmanuel macrons words are the most definitive way we can measure that nato is dead and article 5 is totally meaningless now 

Let's think about the French presdients words and what that means, because the French president did not leave any room for ambiguity. China has alot of hidden malware in the American military, its dumping massive amounts of u.s. debt holdings, general Jon hyten said that missile that went around the world is China preparing for a pre emotive nuclear strike. If we go with senator Lisa Murkowskis words, China and Russia briefly invaded the United States this last August.  What macron means is if China launched a pre emptive attack on the United states, like conducting the bear raid on Wall St, crippling the US military with a.i. powered malware, launched a pre emptive nuclear strike on Montana and invaded the state of Alaska France would not do anything . And we know they wouldn't do anything because Emmanuel macron said they wouldn't. France saying they wouldn't respond to a member being attacked is as lethal to nato, if not more lethal, than Donald trump saying he would pull out of nato . Because if sane people start attacking nato, then nato truly has no guardians left to protect its purpose . And it means China and Russia have succeeded in defeating the greatest militsry alliance in human history without even having to engage in a war with it 

Let's go by events so I can prove nato is dead

February - China flies crappy balloon over us nuclear missile silos at the same time it sends advanced aircraft like octagon ufos to make a mockery of the u.s. air defense zone . U.s. responds by sending its own ufo over china China also ""accidentally "" fires a laser over Hawaii. You know. Like the one conspiracy theorists claim started those fires in Hawaii in August .

August - The 2 senators from Alaska Lisa Murkowski and that other guy say the United States was briefly invaded. The said an incursion (a brief hostile invasion by another power) happened. They said we aren't being given the map route because it shows russia and Chinese ships entering u.s. waters. There was no collective nato response whatsoever. France didn't even pretend they gave a shit. If russis and China would have gone all the way and attacked Alaskans as a part of an effort to divert attention from Taiwan France would have stood by and did literally nothing. If it makes any difference. 7 days after the brief Russian Chinese invasion China revealed it can detect hidden u.s. nuclear submarines .and as a random throw in.

They give all sorts of reasons"" Voting is participating in a system that is inherently evil, and takes away political power from where people really should have it. The government is illegitimate, and the only way to fight back against that is to fully decolonize it, participating in it is recognizing and empowering it. And also, neither of the current candidates is a leftist, so we need to teach them that they are losing votes by not being leftists. I am not going to vote for someone who does bad things, we need to teach them that doing bad things makes you lose votes. If none of us vote, they will move left to match us"" Etc. I keep hearing more and more arguments from people trying to give reasons not to vote.  


And ignoring their other political views, I just don't think any of those are good reasons to not vote. On a basic level, voting is a method every citizen is given to affect the world they live in. There are other methods, but this is a really easy one, just do it. Your life will be better under one candidate than the other, vote for the one who your life will be less bad. If you don't vote, people aren't going to move towards you, they are going to move towards the people who vote. Just vote. Government isn't gaining more authority over you when you vote, it just makes the world every more slightly more aligned with your views. There are literally no downsides to voting,  Just do it.

Some of those felonies are punishable by death in certain states.

Currently, if I understand correctly, prisoners cannot consent for scientific experiments with medium to high levels of risk. I think this should change and right for consent should be given to those convicts, potentially in exchange for their punishment to be reduced, allowing such fields as pharmaceutical to test their research more efficiently.

Common points against this take:
* This is evil! — No, it's not. As I said, participation should be entirely voluntary, no one should even be subjected against their will. We had several instances of this happening involuntarily throughout the history, but sooner or later we'll need to address this topic rationally, without immediate calling everyone names

* This will be abused/victims will be manipulated — Considering the fact that the Police already manipulates suspects into giving false confessions, this is a valid point. This process should be rigorously inspected, and involve several steps to ensure that a person is not subjected against their will

* What if an experiment is a success? You will be letting a murderer walk free — Ironically, this is the most concerning argument, however, I think reduced sentence is justified in exchange for participation in medium/high risk experiments. Consider it giving back to the community they have stolen from

We already have experimental treatment for uncurable diseases such as sickle cell anemia, various hearth conditions, cancer predisposition, HIV and mental disorders. FDA is expected to approve some of it as early as this year's December. Allowing convicts to voluntary participate in trials will speed up research many times over, potentially allowing us to deliver cures for people who can only receive treatment right now in as early as a decade.

You're leaning for  ""NO"" maybe because your relationship is going bad, or you're single, or you don't know if you'll ever be willing to change your lifestyle, etc... my view is that you should do a checkup of your reproductive stuff (both males and females of course), because you may find yourself in the following scenario.

Let's say in one or two years later you decide ""YES"", maybe you found the love of your life or your other half is finally on board:

You start going at it, 5-6 months go by and nothing happens, you book an doc appointment, due to your age the doctor will likely tell you to get going for a bit more before worry (after all fertility naturally decreased with age).   
Another 3-4-5 months go by and still nothing happens, you back to the doc and this time you get referred for exams. You book them, wait for results, schedule a new appointment, etc... all this while probably being busy with work and other stuff, so, unless you're super efficient, weeks if not months will come and go.  
After a while you're back in your doc office and he/she tells you you need some take some hormones/pills let's try and see what happens, etc...  maybe you need further exams etc... 

You get the point, time goes fast and you don't really have much, and even if you're a man, you may have more time biologically but you may be thrilled about getting older and older once you decided you want to become a father.

I went through something similar, my other half had some health issue so she did a series of checks before we decided to have a baby, I did too, we were both fine, but when for a while nothing happened we knew already that ""if it doesn't happen there's no regrets about what we could have done earlier"".

I know several couple that are in this situation, still on the fence as they age, why not getting checked first, instead of getting stressed when you made a decision

To me, it seems like we’re just curating what stood the test of time from past decades. American culture was just as complex and varied back then as it is now.

Take three teenagers, one growing up in rural Missouri, one in suburban SoCal, and one in downtown Philly. Back in the 1975, they might all sit down with their parents to watch Walter Cronkite on the news, gone to see Jaws in theaters and listened to Queen. However, the Missouri kid might have been into country music, the California kid might have been into surfing and the Philly kid might have been a huge baseball fan. And they each respectively might not have known the first thing about the others interests.

I’m 24, and I bet a majority of Americans my age at some point in their lives pointed at someone’s shoes and said “Damn Daniel”, have seen at least one Avengers movie, listened to Drake and watched at least the first season of Stranger Things. We’re not as fractured culturally as we seem now. There have always been subcultures and we will always smooth things over in time to create a unified idea of what life was like during a certain era.

Just look at what the teens today are doing with Y2K stuff. They’re picking one aesthetic that was very prominent, albeit not all-encompassing, and having it stand for an entire 6-7 year period when a lot of shit was going on. Not everyone in 1999 had frosted tips and JNCO. Not everyone in 1984 owned leg warmers. Not everyone today has the broccoli hair or does TikTok dances, but that type of person will become a symbol of the 2020s and people in the 2050s will talk about it like everyone was doing it.

Also, how is COVID not the most monoculture thing to ever happen? We were all affected by the same global event, to varying degrees, but still.

Anyways, change my view. Were things really all that simple back then or is it just hindsight?"

The idea of communism isn't that bad if it could be implemented as it's designed, I would even say that communism works well at small scale like family level from anecdote and much more but it can't be thought of realistically, as it requires an anti-corrupt system which also won't be exploited by the few at the top and needing them to constantly work for people, humanity working on things mutually and synchronously and all those unrealistic things, which is ofcourse doomed to failure from a mile ago. 



But given that I don't like capitalism too, what exactly I hate in it is that money and raising money becomes above many people in many circumstances. Like for some examples, a company intentionally developing products which are bad or would not work well after some time, to maximize profit. Doing something which impacts a large quantity of people just so that a few can raise large sum is the other thing. Also poor employee treatment and wage. Nikola Tesla's discoveries were even hidden and there was a misinformation campaign tainting his originality and image by massive corporation, which relied on DC at the time. It's a shame Tesla died in bankruptcy despite giving us all so much. It's just a system that's designed to work on entities (companies, industries) whose purpose is to squeeze out as much money as they could. When you are working for a company, it's said that you are working to make the owner rich in a book called ""rich dad poor dad"" and some other sources. 



Now to the main point, is there literally no alternative beside existing capitalism? I think there certainly is, it's not communism or socialism and their likes though. It's something which didn't exist yet, perhaps even a reform of capitalism based system where you trade and raise money but the end goal is reached by doing and trying to achieve something which would help HUMANITY in the long run. Let me elaborate, companies don't need to be charity organisations, they need to feed themselves and pay wages too but what they could do is actively developing product or services from the perspective of how would it benefit humanity. Even be ready to get a bit lower profit in order for that. Also if someone is having a hard time, like sick or other thing, being a little compassionate and not just firing people (many companies already have the things like this). Again it would lower the profits a bit but I am not saying do it to the extreme mode. 



Now it's all companies should do this, they should do that and wishful thinking from my above paragraph, it's not me alone many people do say that but it doesn't cut the edge as companies should do that but they are not legally bounded to it. It's like you are a piece of shit if you do things that way but it won't affect you legally, so what's stopping people from doing it as long as it benefits them. Firstly we could try to increase pressure and legally bound some of the things, like someone watching over it and making sure workers are treated well or to watch over the product/service development and making sure it's made towards the end goal of benefiting humanity. This approach got a massive blunder though, like the said watching eye could just be corrupt or could sell secrets to the competition, which a company won't want at all costs. Also every action taken today are towards the en-mass people, not the few ones at the top. Why would the few controlling the whole system want power be taken away from them if they could just get whatever they want. Realistically even if we figure out actions which if implemented would benefit humanity much, won't be executed as the calling the shots in majority are the ones who are most benefitted by today's system and every company has a board of director it needs to answer to who only want large profit from their investment, whichever methods executed doesn't matter. 




****Break




My solution --- I was developing everything to this point. For practicality we don't even need to transform the system like in communism, we just need to make people believe about some things. Spread knowledge and awareness, related to capitalism and it needs to be taken seriously. Well knowledge like telling people about capitalism as what it is. It is the best system out today, but a better one could be enacted too. It's flaws should be mentioned and known to everyone away from propaganda, yes it's associated with a lot of propaganda and misinformation, showing others dream of owning assets and working the correct way/ investing rapidly to get rich over time which I must say isn't as easy as shown. It is also said that someone with talent shines and become rich and we can see many examples of such individuals but it's just another survival bias. A lot of talent gets buried under due to corporate greed or the anti-market practices. We can't know of them even given the large quantity as they aren't even well known.Just like how Tesla was suppressed, even though he wanted one thing, the betterment of humanity through his inventions. 



The most important part is that we need a perspective change. I firmly believe that in the end we achieve what we try to achieve or believe or atleast tend towards that direction. If our people from the young age just want to raise large money, they would do things which would help them do that and there are some things which do raise money but actually harm others as I have mentioned above. We need to make people to think about the betterment of humanity in everything and in their action. If their perspective just shift a bit, even if not 100% implemented, would help us. Like being exposed to compassion and be ready to help others. Again not doing it to the extreme but thinking in this perspective is the thing required. Later on when whole generation is mentally ready and constantly put their attention as to how their actions could help others, we would have achieved the perfect system. In that case, people could later in future even make changes to the current system given the other system is more beneficial to the humanity working together and there would be literally no opposition as today is as.



If anyone is reading, changing my view is mainly required on if such system is achieved, where things operate just as capitalism but people are constantly taught to view humanity above anything else, like even above thousands of pieces of paper, would our situation not change. Again achieving this would be hard too but not impossible like communism as it's just a perspective change and we need to do things creatively to get others onboard and expand slowly."

This subreddit might have gone through it before but I am bringing it back with a twist. So, when it comes to dating, **nobody is owed a date, even people from marginalized and disadvantaged groups**. Yes, it sucks, but this is part of reality. Dating, unlike employment, is a practice where its your prerogative to be discriminatory. Dating is often a precursor to marriage and a person wants to find a partner that is a good fit for them. For some people, things like race and ethnicity play a role in a person's appearance and again, I believe people are entitled to their preferences, and if some white guy doesn't want to date black women, he is not only allowed to be ""discriminatory"", but also does not owe anyone an explanation for his preferences. If he prefers to keep his lack of attraction or overall unwillingness to date black women to himself to avoid being canceled by the woke mob, that is his choice.

&#x200B;

When it comes to transgender people, many straight people want to have biological children and being with a partner who is infertile due to gender-affirming treatments can be a dealbreaker. Many people put importance on having biological children and that is a perfectly valid reason not to date a trans person. Also, while some straight and gay/lesbian people are fine dating someone with genitals they do not expect, there are other who do find certain genitals a turn-off in a partner. Many straight men and lesbian women do not like dicks and that's OK. The problem I am having is that some woke activists like *Riley J. Dennis* argue that genital preferences are somehow hurtful, exclusionary, and may be influenced by a transphobic society. First, if a pre-op transgender person is emotionally hurt because someone does not want to date them due to ""genital preferences"", then that person needs to grow a thick skin and get some therapy, second most people who date do not care what society thinks of their dating preferences or allow societal norms to influence how they should date.

&#x200B;

Also, religious beliefs are a perfectly valid reason for someone not to date a trans person. I know LGBTQ+ people hate hearing about ""religion being used as an excuse to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people"", but dating is personal and someone shouldn't feel pressured to violate their deeply held religious convictions.

&#x200B;

Lastly, lets get down to disability. Yes, while its true that people with disabilities come in various forms and walks of life (I consider mental health conditions like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia to be disabilities), having a disability or mental illness can be a burden on the other partner and some people do not want to deal with the impacts a disability or mental illness has on a romantic relationship. Again, nobody owes you an explanation on why they do not want to date you, and people shouldn't feel afraid of being canceled by the woke mob due to have dating preferences."

I was shocked and have since read that, among those who support Palestine, some are saying that Biden’s trip to Israel, his plan to send economic support for their army, and his speeches supporting them have cost him their vote in the 2024 presidential election.

Meanwhile, Trump is the one who recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, called for a ban of all Muslims immigrating to the United States and has recently suggested that we should ban anyone from Gaza from entering the United States. I read a quote from him stating that, if he were elected in 2024, “Israel would never have to be prepared” against future attacks, implying he would completely destroy Gaza to remove that threat. In short, Trump’s position is much more strongly pro-Israel and virulently anti-Palestine than Biden.

Additionally, although Biden has supported Israel, he has also reportedly urged caution about the scale of the invasion, voiced disagreement with Israel’s handling of the war, and insisted on humanitarian pauses and delivery of aid to the Gazan people. In short he seems to be a voice of reason and advocating for civilian safety.

Granted that some progressives in deep blue states abstaining from voting for Biden may not swing the election to Trump. However, if it does and Trump assumes power, I think many of the people who support Palestine will be sorry with their decision."

Indeed, some reports use the less ambiguous verb ""cut"".

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna119902

The origin of this story seems to be reports from IDF and Israeli first responders finding bodies of children with their heads separated from their bodies. It is possible that this was the result of grenade or rocket explosions.

https://themedialine.org/top-stories/evidence-on-display-at-israels-forensic-pathology-center-confirms-hamas-atrocities/

It is technically correct to call these children decapitated, and Hamas was the cause of it by their intentional actions. Thus, ""Hamas beheaded babies,"" is factually true, but misleading.

Why does it matter? It's indisputable that Hamas killed children. Does the method matter? I think it does make a difference whether the children were killed as collateral damage from indiscriminate attacks or were deliberately targeted. The IDF would like to paint Hamas as inhuman, and thus dehumanize Palestinian civilians by association.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/12/politics/joe-biden-photos-children-hamas-israel/index.html

They needed to do this because their next move was to also kill children in indiscriminate bombing, and in greater numbers. In order to keep the moral high ground, they needed to establish a qualitative distinction between what Hamas did and what they were about to do.

Hamas unquestionably committed war crimes such as killing and kidnapping civilians. The IDF is also committing war crimes like killing civilians (even if they are ""human shields"") and cutting off essential supplies like food and water. But I think it's important to keep the facts straight about which war crimes each side are committing.

You can change my view with reporting from unbiased and/or reputable sources with first-hand or close to first-hand knowledge of deliberate executions of children. You could also change my view with the same evidence for other cruel atrocities beyond killings and kidnappings.

I think all of the good ones have pretty decent skill gaps but after recently getting into online chess I realize the skill gap of a top chess player and a mediocre player is astronomical. The skill gap between an chess AI maxed out and a top player may be equally as large as the other. 

I think the fact that chess has such a potential gap in skills shows truly how deep the game goes.

If you’re unfamiliar ill give an example to elaborate: A decent chess ELO is 1000-1550 range , a high skilled player would be 1600+ imo. The difference between a 1650 and a 1250 in skill is probably around the same as a highschool basketball player vs a d2 college athlete. That’s only a 400ELO difference. Now the top GMs are 2500+ ELO. That’s roughly a 1000 point differential between them and the 1650. That’s like prime lebron james vs the same d2 athlete . The best AI are 3400+ ELO , that is another 1000 points roughly. There is no comparison for a top AI and any human player. It’s a different game at that point. I can’t think of any other game where itd be nearly impossible for an amateur or average player to beat a really good bit not pro player and for that same impossible challenge is replicated at each level."

Here's why:

The Toss: More than a simple coin flip, the toss involves deep strategic considerations. Captains must analyze factors like weather, pitch conditions, and opponent's strengths to decide whether to bat or field first.

Pitch Variation: Unique to cricket, pitches vary significantly in behavior worldwide. Teams must formulate strategies specific to each surface, whether it favors spin, seam, or pace.

Weather Impact: Weather plays a strategic role in cricket. Teams must adapt to conditions like humidity affecting swing or sunshine that makes batting easier.

Complex Rules (Recent Examples):

The 'Mankad' Dismissal: Recently highlighted and often misunderstood, this rule involves a bowler legally running out a non-striker before bowling if they leave the crease early. It requires deep knowledge of the laws and strategic implementation.

Ball-Tampering: The recent controversies around ball-tampering highlight the complexity and nuances of cricket's laws regarding the condition of the ball.

Field Placement: Strategic field placement is a critical element. Deciding where to position fielders based on the batsman's tendencies and game situation requires significant tactical acumen.

Innings Pacing: Balancing risk and reward while pacing an innings is strategically demanding. Teams must constantly adapt their approach based on the opposition's tactics and game conditions.

Psychological Warfare: Cricket involves substantial mental strategy. Captains might set aggressive fields or target a batsman's weakness, engaging in a psychological battle to gain an edge.

Strategic Depth Compared to Other Sports: 

Unlike many sports where strategies are more reactive and based on set plays, cricket requires proactive, adaptable strategies. The captain's role is akin to a chess player, needing to foresee and adapt to changing game scenarios continually.


Cricket, with its unique combination of physical skill and mental strategy, stands out as the most strategically demanding sport. Change my view!"

I, and many other people, know that I am more than capable of fulfilling the role of the position I am applying to but I consistently get denied by these institutions, and realized that my life cannot be more, or less than my institutional backing.

I cannot tolerate being outside of school, and feel like a lobster out of water – utterly useless and worthless as a human being. 

I do not consent to being treated like this, and living a life that I deem as pure misery.

The pain is knowing I can be on this career path, but having it actively denied through the abitrary arbitration of graduate comittees is an asymmetry that I simply cannot integrate in my life, and it infuriates me to no end when I think about this. There is no end in sight if I get rejected again. My will to cease existence is not one of emotional dysregulation, but pure conviction that living life like this is not one worth living at all.

If you want to be responsible, and want to have a plan B if you crash into someone or Vice versa, there is nothing wrong with insurance. If it’s your choice, fine. 

However, at the end of the day, it should be a choice not a requirement. If I choose to not to get insurance, then everything that happens should happen to me for not getting insurance. It should be a risk that person should make for themselves. 

For those that may argue, “so you’re going to total someone else’s property and not pay for it,” or “you badly hurt someone how will you pay for that?”

If you get hit hard enough for your car to get totaled, either the person who crashed into you can’t move the car and will be caught by law enforcement and will have to pay, even if they barely have it to pay which in a way is a punishment for not having insurance plus any other punishment they get for the accident or you get nicked which is a inconvenience but should not put you in debt to repair.

You’re essentially paying for the idea that something may happen, and if it doesn’t happen, a lot of wasted money. Enter the people that say “statically”, we’ll you’re statically at a higher risk for heart disease than getting into a car crash but the government, law, or whatever isn’t forcing you to buy heart disease insurance. 

“That’s not someone else causing this to happen to you!” Well, you’re more likely to get shot and killed by someone than a car crash. 

All this is to say, it should be a choice."

what was the final result of vote histories within Pa in regards to the 2020 election

\><

Joe Biden won Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes in the 2020 US presidential election.  
  
Biden received 3,458,229 (50.01%) votes to Trump's 3,377,674 (48.84%). This was a margin of 80,555 votes, or 1.17%.  
  
Biden's victory was a turnaround for Democrats, who had lost the state to Trump by a narrow margin of 0.72% in 2016. Biden won some of the state's most populous counties, including Philadelphia, Allegheny, and Montgomery. He also won the support of suburban voters and Black voters, who had turned out in large numbers.  
  
Trump's campaign filed several lawsuits challenging the results of the election in Pennsylvania, but none of the lawsuits were successful.  
  
The final result of the 2020 election in Pennsylvania was:  
  
Joe Biden: 3,458,229 (50.01%)

what happened to the ""troubling"" discrepancies found by republican lawmakers?

\><

  
In the aftermath of the 2020 US presidential election, a group of Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania alleged that they had found ""troubling discrepancies"" between the numbers of total votes counted and the total number of voters who voted. They argued that these discrepancies were evidence of widespread voter fraud and that the results of the election should be overturned.  
  
However, these allegations have been repeatedly debunked by election officials and experts. A comprehensive review of the election data by the Pennsylvania Department of State found no evidence of widespread voter fraud. The Department of State also concluded that the discrepancies cited by the Republican lawmakers were the result of normal data entry errors and did not affect the outcome of the election.  
  
Despite the lack of evidence, some Republican lawmakers continue to promote the false narrative that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump. These claims have been used to justify efforts to restrict voting rights and to undermine public trust in the electoral process.  
  
The allegations of voter fraud in Pennsylvania have been the subject of numerous legal challenges. All of these challenges have been unsuccessful. In fact, a federal judge in Pennsylvania ruled that the allegations of voter fraud were ""speculative"" and ""not supported by any evidence.""  
  
The ""troubling discrepancies"" cited by Republican lawmakers have never been substantiated. The allegations of widespread voter fraud in Pennsylvania have been repeatedly debunked by election officials and experts. These claims are baseless and harmful to democracy.

debunked by whom and how was it debunked

\><

  
The allegations of widespread voter fraud in Pennsylvania were debunked by a variety of sources, including:  
  
Election officials: The Pennsylvania Department of State conducted a comprehensive review of the election data and found no evidence of widespread voter fraud. Additionally, election officials in numerous counties across the state have certified the results of the election, confirming that there was no widespread voter fraud.  
  
Experts: Numerous experts in election law and statistics have reviewed the allegations of voter fraud in Pennsylvania and found them to be baseless. For example, a report by the Brennan Center for Justice concluded that the allegations were ""not credible"" and ""lacked any credible evidence.""  
  
Courts: Several lawsuits have been filed alleging voter fraud in Pennsylvania, but all of these lawsuits have been unsuccessful. In fact, a federal judge in Pennsylvania ruled that the allegations of voter fraud were ""speculative"" and ""not supported by any evidence.""  
  
Here are some specific examples of how the allegations of voter fraud were debunked:  
  
Claims of more votes than registered voters: This claim was based on a misunderstanding of how voter registration data is collected and maintained in Pennsylvania. The Department of State explained that the voter registration database is constantly being updated, and that there are a number of reasons why a voter might not be registered at the time they vote.  
  
Claims of dead people voting: This claim was based on a list of voters who had allegedly cast ballots in the name of deceased individuals. However, the Department of State found that the list was riddled with errors, and that none of the cases of alleged voter fraud were credible.  
  
Claims of ineligible voters casting ballots: This claim was based on a variety of allegations, including that non-citizens, felons, and underage voters had voted in the election. However, the Department of State found no evidence to support any of these allegations.  
  
The allegations of widespread voter fraud in Pennsylvania have been repeatedly debunked by election officials, experts, and courts. These claims are baseless and harmful to democracy.

what is the purpose of the SURE system  within Pennsylvania's electorial process?

\><

The Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors (SURE) is a statewide voter registration database in Pennsylvania. It was created in 2000 to improve the accuracy and efficiency of voter registration in the state. SURE is used by county voter registration offices to register voters, maintain voter registration records, and produce voter lists for elections.   
Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors (SURE) PennsylvaniaOpens in a new window  
www.legis.state.pa.us  
Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors (SURE) Pennsylvania  
  
The purpose of the SURE system is to:  
  
Centralize voter registration data: SURE centralizes voter registration data from all 67 counties in Pennsylvania. This makes it easier for county voter registration offices to access and update voter registration records.  
Improve the accuracy of voter registration data: SURE uses a variety of data sources to verify voter information, such as driver's license records and Social Security records. This helps to ensure that voter registration data is accurate and up-to-date.  
Make voter registration more efficient: SURE makes it easier for voters to register to vote and update their registration information. Voters can register to vote online, by mail, or in person at their county voter registration office. They can also update their registration information online or by mail.  
Produce voter lists for elections: SURE is used to produce voter lists for elections. Voter lists are used by polling places to verify that voters are eligible to vote.  
**SURE is an important tool for ensuring that elections in Pennsylvania are fair and accurate.** It helps to ensure that all eligible voters are able to register to vote and that voter registration records are accurate and up-to-date. SURE also makes it easier for county voter registration offices to produce voter lists for elections.

History has proven time and time again that communism does not and will never work on a large scale.  Why do so many people think it will actually work?  Communism constantly killed off its intellectuals (or most fled), LGTBQ+ and anyone not within their ideology…but still support.  Many aim to “kill” other opposing in the views; which happens on social media, and will happen to certain supporters.  I’m expecting a lot of down votes from the american communists, so there’s that.  God forbid anyone disagrees with them, or you’re *insert xyz*.  

So point:
Communists only support communists, and are already fascist when they think you’re not communist. You’re fascist before it started.

No, I'm not an anarchist. I'm simply a philosophy student saying that there is no objectivity with regards to determining whether a decision is ""good"" or ""bad"". There may be a strong consensus, yes, but objectivity refers to ""not influenced by feeling or opinion, being based in fact"" and I don't believe there is a moral decision that can be ""correct"" or ""incorrect""

Contrast this with mathematics. There is one right way to do maths. Only one. If an incorrect method of maths is magically implanted into everyones brain, our software will break, our buildings will collapse, and our planes will fall out of the sky. We were wrong, and we will suffer the consequences of not being correct.

However, If EVERYBODY  has a different set of morals that are implanted in our brain, guess what, that becomes our new set of morals, and we live by those ones now. Just like people across different cultures live by different morals. Just like people across different time periods live by different morals. Just like people across socioeconomic status live by different morals.

If you believe that a Euro-centric moral compass is ""right"", I would implore you to recognize that this is followed and believed in by approximately 2 billion people worldwide. What makes our one ""better"" than the moral standard of Islamic law, followed by a similar number of people worldwide? I believe We're not more important than them, life is intrinsically valuable, so to say that we are right and they are wrong is just intellectually disingenuous in my opinion.

1,2023-11-15,"CMV: All conscious life has the same “inherent value” independent of value considerations, and this equalizes humanity with the rest of the animal kingdom.",u/Superpeytonm022,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17wbypk/cmv_all_conscious_life_has_the_same_inherent/,changemyview,"I’ve always had somewhat controversial views about humanity’s placement in the world and our relationship to non-human animals. Chief among them is this distinction between “inherent value” and other forms of value, such as “utility.” 

I believe that, at the very least, all forms of conscious life have the same degree of “inherent value.” 

I am defining “inherent value” as it sounds, that is, value independent of any of the typical value judgments humans tend to make, chiefly “utility.” I am defining “conscious life” generally as Tom Regan defines it, that is, an organism that is a “subject of a life,” which has, among other things, an understanding of self, beliefs and desires, perception, memory, and a sense of the future. It is quite possible that life that is often considered unconscious—viruses, perhaps, or oysters—can have inherent value. But for the sake of simplicity, I will draw the line at organisms that are a “subject of a life.” 

So here is the basic argument: all “subjects of a life” have an equal degree of inherent value; because all inherent value is equal, any organism which has inherent value has an equal right to exist. Thus, because all life that has inherent value has an equal right to exist, I don’t consider human life to be “worth” more—strictly speaking in terms of inherent value—than, say, canine life. 

Now, assuredly, there are other factors to consider. The hypothetical my friend continually poses to me is that of a burning building. In this building is a puppy and a human baby. My friend will ask me which I should take. Speaking purely in the framework of inherent value, I don’t believe there is a moral qualm for either choice. 

With that said, I tend to be utilitarian, and for that reason, I consider the human to be the “correct” choice. But I find it fascinating how readily most people will fall back on choosing the human baby in this hypothetical, because I don’t believe that “utility” is as straightforward as it seems on the surface (how do we weigh, for example, the utility of organisms in their performance of functions essential to the wellbeing of their respective ecosystems?). Furthermore, I believe that “inherent value” and “utility” are two different frameworks. An organism having more “utility” does not negate the “inherent value” of another organism, and we should not, I believe, favor one framework without consideration of the other. 

I understand that this viewpoint is more than a bit impractical and idealistic, but I really hold it to pose to people—and myself—more consideration for the plight of non-human animals in our increasingly anthropogenic world. However, I’m always looking for new worldviews, and I am a bit unsure if separating “inherent value” and “utility” is the best route to take."

Basically doing the former really challenges you, you need good social skills and everything. But with marriage it’s easy, no social requirement you just need to find someone.

We see this in the numbers about 50% of new high school graduates have dated but 59% of people have been married. College is a bit easier with about the same rate, of people dating in college as have been married.

Any idiot can get married. Unlike dating in high school, getting married is not an achievement. One reflects your social worth and the other is just an arcane archaic institution that means nothing. Any incel can get married with zero personality change but they’d need a massive one to be able to date in high school."

An excess of meetings and such.

Basically there's a fiasco at work right now do to an ill conceived invitation because of doublespeak and veiled threats. 
During homecoming at the end of September, all the new teachers were *invited* to go to a teacher meet and greet dinner with the schoolboard. The turn-out was not satisfactory to the schoolboard because it was framed as optional. 
The board then put out a bunch of pressure to site principals to in-turn pressure all new teachers to attend an after-hours board-meeting for a meet and greet. 

One of my fellow new teachers asked the Union and the Union said verbatim that we cannot be compelled to go.

So instead of telling us we have to go, everyone in a supervisory position is saying ""You don't have to go... but you have to go."" or ""The board will remember if you don't go."" Which having worked in small orgs with boards my entire life is probably the biggest crock of dookie I've ever heard boards are mostly nosy people who won't actually remember your name.


Anyways, I think that it ought to be codified that if a request is going to be made it needs to be clear and overt or needs to remain optional. I think that any permutation of the above where there is a veiled threat should be strictly illegal especially in the presence of a Bargaining Unit Directive. This rises to the definition of Quid Pro Quo in terms of the principal of why  Quid Pro Quo is wrong. It's fine if a relationship is damaged over a lack of reciprocity, but it's not fine to continuously harass people to go do something with an underlying threat of ambiguous consequences from those in power. I think that if the board has to make a direct ask for teachers to attend which in turn will command pay, it will alleviate the issue by either allowing people to refuse or providing compensation for attending a government work function. 


To make sure there is clarity on my position:

1.)Veiled Threats and Double Speak skirt formal requests.

2.)There's a specific reason that a formal request *is not being made*

3.)The reason the request is informal *needs to be brought to light* 

4.)If the board won't make a formal request, then there shouldn't be *any* expectation to appear.

5.)Having supervisors apply pressure as a form of groveling is in-line with the unsavory philosophy behind Quid Pro Quo. Its a type of in-kind top down pressure that rises to the level of Quid Pro Quo. I don't think the type of harassment should really matter, the principal of the issue with sexual harassment in quod pro quo is that sexual harassment is unjustified, just like pressuring people to put in extra time at work for no pay is unjustified.

6.)If a request is formally made it brings transparency to the table which is historically good for everyone."

China war . And that France should maintain its strategic autonomy and not get involced in conflicts that are not its own. But that's a load of bull the United States has been single handedly pushing russia back in Ukraine and has spared France from the kind of ""special military operation"" russia wants to wage across Europe. It doesn't matter to me whether the media or politicians want to play games with the definition of a world War, we are in a world War, and we can consider russia and China one side of that war and the u.s. and Europe as the other. France is obligated to come to u.s. aid in the event of a china u.s. war over taiwan , and for Emmanuel macron to say otherwise is total nonsense . 

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/10/emmanuel-macron-sparks-anger-europe-vassal-us-china-clash



Article 5 of nato states an attack on one member will be treated as an attack on all, China and russias joint patrol if we were to look at it outside of state messaging was a practice attack on the state of Alaska. It looked like they were practicing a joint attack on Alaska to divert attention from an attack on taiwan. Emmanuel macron is saying in no uncertain terms if China and Russia launched a joint attack on America to prevent a taiwan intervention France and Europe should just sit back and watch the fireworks . All while the u.s. single handedly keeps Europe from being overrun by Russian military might.  Everyone can safely conclude a war in Ukraine would affect a war in taiwan, and we have some ways to see what that would look like if it were to unfold in the modern day and how France would just sit by and be French about all of it 

I know people hate conspiracies,  so let's go with the facts. On Sunday September 17th . U.s. national security advisor Jake Sullivan met with Chinese foreign minster Wang yi. Wang looked very pissed off, and the meeting did not appear to yield any immediate good results. China flew over 100 planes over taiwan a few hours later, at the same time they did this unprecedented show of air might over taiwan The f35 went missing . That very night, russia conducted a stealth night raid over Ukraine and also launched an unprecedented amount of aircraft while they did it . 2-3 months before the new york times reported the u.s. militsry is hunting hidden Chinese malware that appears to be designed to Saratoga any American effort to intervene over taiwan

One could call all of that not a coincidence. And if it were to unfold in a modern war, and France just stood by and did nothing while america was attacked like that. That would be a real bitch because the wars in Europe and Asia are interconnected and France shouldn't be allowed to have its cake and eat it too. Gain American security in Europe but fail to back America in Asia 

I also think China is dumping u.s. holdings so it can prepare for a financial ""bear raid"" attack on Wall St like Henry Paulson said in 2008

Naturei karta are a phenomenon that is known as self-hating Jews. In 2006 they went to a literal Holocaust-denial conference in tehran. every year they disrupt the Holocaust day in Israel and especially during the 2 minute siren.

Their reasoning for being antizionist isn't actually moral and they don't actually care about the Palestinians, they're only protesting for them because they hate Israel PURELY for a religious extremist reason. They believe in a rule in Judaism that says Jews are not entitled to a country until the messiah comes. So basically, they aren't against Israel's treatment of Palestine, They're against the Jewish right to self-determination, and they're using Palestinians as an excuse to show it.

They're hugely unpopular even among the ultra-Orthodox Jews around the world.

Don't bring up naturei karta. you can bring up Jewish voice for peace, but don't bring up naturei karta."

I (19f) have never wanted to have children, and i am still convinced that i will never want any. However, i fell in love with a man (19m) who wants to have children someday because ""It's a beautiful thing"" and ""it will change the routine once we're older and bored"" (oh, of course! Just the thing to do when you're bored- create human consciousness! And then give up all your hobbies, your whole life really, and spend the rest of your life worrying for someone who didn't even have to exist). I am very good at keeping myself entertained and happy, i dont think Ill ever be bored of life. I have hobbies and i enjoy my independance. 

To me, having children seems like a nightmare.. and for what? Just so you can make someone feel bad for not visiting you when you're old? 

I just sont see what people like about it. I dont hate children at all, but they sure aren't as good for conversation as adults, ahah. Oh, i do think babies are disgusting tho. I have never understood nor felt baby fever, but even if you do feel the biological need to reproduce, wouldn't the downsides discourage you? I didn't even mention the horror of pregnancy- my boyfriend only will consider adoption if i'm infertile (i really hope i am ... Does that make me a terrible person? It would break his heart if i was) (but.. why?? Seriously, why is it important that the child has my genes. Plus i do have pretty bad genes?? I wouldn't wanna give them to anybody, that would just be straight up evil. Imagine having the brain chemistry to be deppressed at 7, lol)

How does being a parent make you happy? 

I would honestly love to have my mind changed about this. I actually need to, to keep my relationship. I really love him. I'm just so afraid of making a decision I'll regret my whole life, or even just wasting his time when i could just tell him that i am certain i dont want kids.

But to truly be certain, i need to be able to see the positives.. and he says Ill be a great mother. i dont doubt that i will love and care for my kids, It's just that i dont think I'd ever have the time to do anything else than that. So i need to be convinced that doing that is fun, or else.. what's the point??

TL:DR: convince me that It's fun to be a mom. And that Ill have time for myself."

A few lovely people had genuine discussions, although they were cut short as I was banned from their community.

I was not inciting hate, instigating anger, etc. simply asked for some guidance in understanding.

I believe the online trans community is militant, aggressive and insistent that they are outright correct on all points of discussion.

Furthermore, they accept no possible fault in any of the common beliefs or community accepted facts.

The post credit scene of kang in ant man told me this story looked really bad from the get go. i personally think it would’ve looked really stupid to see several Jonathan majors fighting the avengers in the kang dynasty instead of several different actors fighting the avengers. I think majors was way too hard on delivering some lines, everything he said in quantumania for example took him 5 minutes to blurt out, i loved his portray of he who remains and thats about where i stopped loving him from there

the rumor keeps saying marvel wants to go with doctor doom. Why not just do that? they can just make him the kang variant thats related to reed richards, put another black guy In the role problem solved. throw in a scene in fantastic four of him destroying other timelines and it perfectly explains where Jonathon majors went. Everything is set up for a Loki redemption story in secret wars with Loki taking the throne of the multiverse at the end of season 2, he can be the facilitator of secret wars and no one would shed a tear about not ever seeing jonathon majors again. Him being dropped isn’t just a good thing, it’s a great thing. The fact we don’t hear any stories saying something like “majors protested kang being so easily beaten by ant man” shows that majors himself isn’t as worthy as marvels most pissant intellectual property. Sorry. It’s a win for marvel fans and not marvel fans alike. Gives marvel and Kevin feige the reset they need , and we can blame Jonathan majors for all our troubles instead of having to break down each movie one by one. We move forward and heal from this painful chapter in mcu history

1,2023-11-16,"CMV: Policies that involve the extra-territorialization (off-shoring) of asylum seekers, e.g. Sunak's Rwanda plan, are not necessarily, i.e., in principle, morally unjustified.",u/Virralla,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17wk1cc/cmv_policies_that_involve_the/,changemyview,"**Background**

  
British conservative prime minister Sunak has been wanting to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda for the processing and carrying out of their asylum. A few days ago, Sunak and his party suffered a major blow when the UK Supreme Court shot down the plan as being unlawful under the terms of the European convention on human rights. In reaching their decision, the judges partly relied on evidence from the UN Refugee Agency regarding a failed attempt by \[a certain Jewish state\] and Rwanda to form a similar pact in 2013.

  
According to the judges, Sunak's Rwanda plan involved an unacceptable risk of *refoulement*, meaning that deported refugees could have their claims wrongly assessed and therefore be returned to their country of origin, where they would be threatened with violence and persecution.

  
Some members of the conservative party are now proposing to leave the European convention on human rights. Sunak, however, is considering the less drastic route of upgrading the UK's 'memorandum of understanding' it signed with Rwanda into a *full-blown treaty*. This treaty is meant to guarantee minimum quality standards for the asylum process and the shape of the asylum regime.

  
**Argument**

  
Decisions such as this one by the UK Supreme Court are often taken by open-borders advocates and progressives of all sorts as pointing to the conclusion that the off-shoring of asylum seekers is morally wrong, full stop. I think this is, sorry for the jargon, a form of *non sequitur* reasoning. 

For, even if the UK Supreme Court may be correct that the *current version* of Sunak's Rwanda plan is morally unacceptable, this in no way makes it the case that a *future version* of the plan or any other off-shoring plan of another state is morally unacceptable.

  
I would argue that, in principle, it is not morally wrong for a state to choose to off-shore certain asylum seekers, for instance, those who try to illegally reach its borders.\* However, this comes with an important caveat: the country must not violate its moral duty to take in a proportional share of the global total of asylum seekers. Here is what the argument roughly looks like:

&#x200B;

* P1: States have a moral duty to take in their proportional share of the global total of asylum seekers.
* P2: The right to asylum does not entail the right to choose one's asylum location: neither for the asylum process, nor for the ensuing asylum regime.
* P3: If it is possible for a state to take in its share of the global total of asylum seekers, **whilst**, **at the same time**, deporting irregular asylum seekers to a third country that can plausibly promise minimum quality standards for the asylum process and asylum regime, **then** the off-shoring of asylum seekers is not necessarily morally unjustified.
* P4: It is possible for a state to do both of these things.
* Conclusion: Policies that involve off-shoring of asylum seekers are not morally unjustified in principle.

  
**Explanation**

  
One extra note regarding premises 3 & 4, a state could take in its share of the global total of asylum seekers by proactively selecting asylum seekers from conflict zones or neighbouring areas, for example, with the help of humanitarian and resettlement programs.

More positively, I would argue that the off-shoring of asylum seekers, in combination with proactive resettlement policies, is morally preferable to the current asylum system, for two reasons. 

First of all, unpredictable illegal immigration, with all its housing and integration problems and waste of human lives, would rapidly decrease, since would-be illegal migrants would no longer attempt the journey. 

Second, the current system is unfair, since able-bodied, young men who live geographically close to wealthy states, are much more likely to make a successful illegal journey and claim asylum, than women and children who live very far away.

  
All in all, if this argument is sound, then progressives should accept that — in theory — it is possible to design policies for the off-shoring of asylum seekers that, amongst other things, do not infringe on the non-refoulement principle, and are morally justifiable.

  
\* I am not saying it is morally wrong of an individual irregular migrant to do so. In fact, I think it is often highly understandable. If you nonetheless dislike the word 'illegal', you can replace it with the word 'irregular'."

Most believe in a personal relationship with one very important dude or at least otherwise communicating *personally* with some sort of powerful entity or force. 

It sets you up and apart from everyone else as “chosen” “elect” or otherwise “peculiar” using artificial and scripted means. “This is the only way, guys.” This is usually also visible through some sort of external presentation, be it clothing, accessories, hairstyle, diet, name tags, etc… because it’s the only way to “show off” your *station* without being obtuse or annoying.

It inherently disassociates you from reality and instead of looking at your conditions now on earth in this life as you are now inside of your body.

You’re either so focused on a dysphoric non-existent pain of “hell” (separated from loved ones, physical pain, torture, etc…), or a euphoric feeling of being plucked out as “one of the good ones,” (here’s your shiny mansion in the sky!) that you don’t even consider the reality and conditions of your surroundings and environment. You no longer care about the earth as it’s considered temporary so you can fuck about on earth for a bit before doing what again?

Relgion, especially christianity, is insidious in the inter-generational trauma it perpetuates.

Looking at climate change as anything other than *humanity fucked up hard on this one* is improper. We got right on destroying this planet because we viewed it as temporary, that some external force would fix it all if it gets out of hand and all because you asked it politely personally one evening."

96,2023-11-16,"CMV: In a politician, competence is at least as important as values. Voters tend to place way too little priority towards competence versus values, when it comes to choosing a candidate",u/BreakingBaIIs,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17wnczy/cmv_in_a_politician_competence_is_at_least_as/,changemyview,"I think that competence and values are two very important things a voter must take into consideration. 

Values are important because, if a policy maker gets elected, and their values differ strongly from yours, they are less likely to look for outcomes, when implementing policies, that are aligned with the outcomes that you value, than a politician whose values are more strongly aligned with yours

On the other hand, competence speaks to a politician's ability to find the right policies, and manage their office the right way, to generate those outcomes whose values are aligned with yours.

Therefore, you have two major considerations. You want a politician to seek outcomes whose values align with yours, and you want the politician to be able to effectively bring about those outcomes. That is, you want value alignment, and competence.

I think voters overestimate the degree to which their values are different from certain candidates, and underestimate the difference in candidates' ability to effect outcomes that they value.

When it comes to values of candidates, the differences usually manifest in the polarized issues. However, when it comes to office management and policy making, a minority of the effort that politicians strive towards are the partisan issues. Politicians spend a lot more time and effort trying to work towards the values on which most people agree-providing rewarding and meaningful work to the constituents, making sure nobody starves or is homeless, increasing the state's innovation and other states' desire to purchase from them, keeping the constituents safe and prosperous--than they spend on the values on which people are divided--handling people's level of privacy versus security, bodily autonomy, rights to dangerous or self-harming activities, or equity of outcome along certain demographic characteristics. This is an important thing that is obscured by the availability heuristic. The divisive subjects get the most press, because it's the one that causes candidates to vigorously debate against each other, rather than just circle jerk about how much they agree.

To be clear about a point above, I am separating between *values* that are shared among all candidates, versus those on which candidates are split. I'm not referring to *policies* that are consensus versus partisan. The difference is important. Policies on which candidates disagree may not reflect values on which they disagree, but rather, disagreement of the empirical fact of a policy's ability to effect outcomes on whose values the candidates both agree. For example, all candidates probably want their constituents to be prosperous and not fall into homelessness. However, they may disagree about a specific economic policy, such as raising minimum wage. The disagreement on minimum wage usually stems from disagreement about the fact of whether it will make the constituents more prosperous or less. Advocates would argue that it directly raises the pay employees gain, and makes it easier for them to live. Detractors would argue that it would exacerbate inflation, and reduce the viability, and thus supply, of hiring candidates, ultimately doing more indirect harm than the direct benefit. 

The distinction between value disagreement, and disagreement on a policy's ability to bring about a value, is an important one. This is because the latter is more of a reflection of competence than values of a candidate. If two candidates share the same value, but disagree on policies, the candidate who is more knowledgeable about the domain (e.g. economics) is more likely to pick the policies that more effectively bring those values.

In practice, it's hard to know how to weigh values and competence against each other. However, you can get certain easy cases. 

Suppose you have two candidates, both of whom are very well accomplished, show incredible ability to effect positive change from their career, and candidate A is slightly more competent than candidate B, but A's values are anathema to you, whereas B's values are strongly aligned with yours, then you should choose B. 

On the other hand, suppose candidate A is a failed drama teacher with no experience in politics, and is only around due to nepotism, but strongly aligns with your values, whereas candidate B is a Nobel Prize winning Economist with 15 years of experience in political office and a strong track record for implementing effective policies, but their values aren't quite as strongly aligned with you, and they disagree with you on many of the (fringe) partisan issues, I would argue that candidate B is still the stronger choice. Yet I find that, in this situation, almost everyone would choose candidate A because people put too much weight to value alignment over competence."

This got me thinking of my ex fiancé, and how I broke things off, I did pretty much the same thing and she claimed it was so pretty so I gave in and let her keep it, eventually I got it back but there was no reason for her to keep it in the first place as an engagement ring represents a promise, it’s usually expensive, and it basically turns into a trophy celebrating how I got this person to propose to me, it seems almost greedy or narcissistic to keep.

There is a large amount of vocal support from Americans, many younger (Gen Z) who are on TikTok and other social media platforms quoting the text and analyzing it, praising Bin Laden for the points he made and agreeing with him. 

I believe that the people doing this should be considered highly dangerous and treated as potential terrorists.

Not just because they're sharing information. I'm not against the book Mein Kampf existing, for example- but if Hitler's words were trending and being praised and parroted by Americans as being good and true, I'd want them placed on a watchlist, too. 

We know that Bin Laden's beliefs were dangerous, we know he's a terrorist and caused the 9/11 terror attacks. His words are more than words. They're a call to action, therefore anyone sharing and agreeing with those words are displaying that same beliefs and principles as a known terrorist- therefore they should be associated with that terrorist. 

And anyone associated with a terrorist should be monitored and considered a dangerous individual. Domestic terrorism is a huge concern, and people who loudly support the words of a terrorist should be convicted potential domestic terrorists.

Okay, specific thought here, but I lived in rural Missouri for years. There were many townie bars with the regulars every night. You could walk between the bars easily. The other bars in town were Applebees, Buffalo Wild Wings, etc. Not really bars you go to get drunk and play cards at.

We later moved to a suburb and the only places with bars are chain restaurants. There are zero - zero - townie or dive bars within a ten minute drive. You could drive downtown to more independant bars, but those bars are most music-orientated or clubs for younger people. There is no place for a a guy who want to sit, get hammered, and play cards or BS for a few hours.

I'm not saying drinking is good or bad. I'm not asking if what I've said is good or bad. What I am looking for are reasons why small towns aren't better for drunks than suburbs.

11,2023-11-16,CMV: The belief in determinism over free will does not logically lead to a doomer mindset,u/Affectionate-Sand838,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17wsuq3/cmv_the_belief_in_determinism_over_free_will_does/,changemyview,"So I recently started reading Robert Sapolsky's new book ""Determined"" (he is of the belief that there is no free will) and I read a few reddit posts about the topic at hand just to see what others are saying.

And wherever I look I see believers in free will arguing something along the lines of ""I have to believe in free will or else there is no way for us humans to change"". And on the other side of that I see people who have accepted their ""deterministic fate"" and they basically argue the same thing, which is that with determinism comes an inevitable fate to be miserable/not get better/have to accept your pathetic life (I'm not saying those two groups are describing ALL the people there are, but those are the ones I'm interested in talking about and hearing their opinions).

And I don't get this idea on either side. 

Yes, in theory determinism means that a supercomputer could calculate all variables in existence and perfectly predict your outcome and the outcome of everything else too. But WE (the individuals) aren't supercomputers. We cannot predict what will happen tomorrow. We have no clue which variables ""doom"" us and which ones aren't. That's where people go down the wrong route. They tell themselves (1) my life is already predicted and (2) therefore I know how it will turn out. But unless we invent the supercomputer at some point in the future we will never know where our life leads us.

Accepting determinism doesn't mean at all that one will never get rid of their mental illness or that they have to accept a shitty life due to an upbringing in a low socioeconomic status. Even more so, believing in determinism should give people hope. If we are nothing but deterministic machines then that means that just doing the work will more likely than not lead to success. And that idea is the same for the people who believe in free will. They think you can will yourself out of a situation and overcome it.

So in my mind, I don't see why believing in free will over determinism should be necessary to ""have a chance to get better"" or the other way around, why believing in determinism over free will would ""doom your life"" in any way.

I would appreciate believers in this mindset to explain why they think this way and how it logically make sense to them. I will award a delta if somebody presents a scenario to me that would disprove what I said."
110,2023-11-16,"CMV: ""You're not a parent, therefore you can't have a [correct] opinion on children or child-rearing"" is wrong and often used to deflect and absolve oneself from critical self-reflection or to fix moral failings in one's parenting.",u/Subcomfreak,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17wt1cw/cmv_youre_not_a_parent_therefore_you_cant_have_a/,changemyview,"Here again with the controversial hot-take that I actually believe, but probably shouldn't. The purpose help me change my mind on a controversial belief I hold and to spawn a discussion about a controversial topic of parenting which is often not discussed (in part due to the above parental arrogance).  

For those wondering:
I've been an adult for well over a decade. I don't have any kids (and I don't want $250k pieces of ""super special"" furniture [the view of children of the average parent in practice]). I've also worked with younger people on a daily basis and have first hand experience with the outcome of your parenting and have seen trends emerge over my decade of doing such (the trends are bad and parents produce worse and worse children every year in terms of academic ability and creativity... I work in education if you couldn't tell...).

General remark:

It is of utmost importance to note that my term ""parent"" here is meant to target the general, normative parent and does not apply to all cases. Here we simply target the average, American parent, as I am from there, and their claim to unique and privileged knowledge on the basis of the outcomes we can see and what the general parent believes.

I generally don't believe that one's standpoint prohibits one from knowledge or from having opinions about said knowledge. For example, one doesn't have to be of the dominant cultural group in order to have a correct opinion about that culture. One does not have to live in a country to have (correct) opinions about the country's policy. I can know Chinese surveillance state is bad and wrong even though I don't live under such (although, debatable given big tech, etc... you get the point). One doesn't have to be a female in order to have knowledge about uniquely female medical issues (A male or female OBGYN can have the same knowledge). I don't think parenting or claims about child-rearing are any different. 

This general argument ought carry my case, however, in the realm of parenting we do have some specific comments which bolster the case against the special standpoint knowledge crutch that most parents use to justify their false beliefs and sub-optimal (if not detrimental) parenting. If the current general parent's beliefs and associated actions lead to bad outcomes we can conclude that they don't have special knowledge or, perhaps, actually hold false beliefs. Ergo, if we find the normative parenting style to be flawed, we can also say that clearly the parents don't really have the special knowledge that they claim. And, if we find that a non-parent's arguments against the current way that children are parented are correct, then we realize that non-parents can also have knowledge. Thus, if my critiques of normative parenting hold, then my claim also holds true as the normative parent clearly holds false beliefs and shouldn't be trusted as experts on parenting.

Specific reasoning:

1) Kids don't come with instruction manuals, parents can be just as ignorant as anyone else. Just because you did the nasty doesn't make you an expert on parenting. Someone who has studied child psychology, but doesn't have any kids, is going to have more knowledge about children than the average parent. Likewise a person who has devoted their studies and life to teaching children, but does not have children of their own, knows more about teaching than Joe ""six pack"" or Karen ""my child is special"".

2) Parents have in our current society created environments for children and do actions which are clearly silly and worse for their children which should lead us to believe that the average parent knows less about children than they think or, at minimum, don't have special knowledge that non-parents don't have.

A) Children on leashes like animals as a prime example of silly things parents do that show that parents don't know how to raise children. A silly example, and quite specific, but should prepare the readers mind for other such actions that parents take that prove they know less or the same as people looking from the outside that don't have children. A parent who treats their child as a dog clearly doesn't know what they are parenting.

B) Helicopter parents who fully drink the stranger danger kool-aid and rob their children of developing independence through exploration clearly shows that the average parent lacks knowledge or holds false beliefs about child rearing. This typically involves banning children from exploring the environment that they live in on their own and with friends because, ""bad man might snatch the kid off the street"". In European countries (thinking of the Netherlands as a prime example) where children are allowed to cycle or walk from school to soccer practice, to the store, to the park, etc. are on average significantly more happy than American children under ~~communist~~ paranoid parental regime and also have better educational and health outcomes. One wonders why the children don't play outside in American cities and the answer is ignorant parents don't let them because of stranger danger and parental paranoia (banning after school pick up for middle school and up would be wonderful). Do we really think simply being a parent makes one's beliefs true when we see that the normative American parent is so clearly sub-optimal when compared to their European counterparts? I think not. Don't trust the American parent!

C) Parents spend less quality time with their children than the ~~communist~~ government education system. Think about it, most children live in duel income homes and with the exception of the weekend spend most of their quality time with non-parents. If being a parent is what makes one an expert, wouldn't we say that due to the fact that quality waking time of the child is spent mostly in day-care or at school that the parents are less knowledgeable than the teachers? Doesn't the teacher know your child better than you? And, even when the kid isn't at school, most children's lives are dominated by after school activities that are structured and don't involve the parent. You got the soccer practices, the dance and music classes, the mythical ""extra-curriculars"" and after school programs that parents decide to send their children to and results in less parental time with the children... by the premises of the statement about experience, we see practically defeated by the parents' own activity. [this is argument is strengthened dramatically when we are talking about co-parenting situation where each individual parent spends even less time with their kid!!!!! So, co-parents truly can't claim they know more than the teacher since the teacher spend more actual and quality time with the kid than them!]

D) ipad parenting and junk food bribery. Clearly, when parents are allowing their kids to spend an inordinate amount of time on the screen... see: https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000355.htm#:~:text=Most%20American%20children%20spend%20about,child%20to%20sleep%20at%20night  Combine this with the sheer fact of the childhood obesity rate: https://stateofchildhoodobesity.org/demographic-data/ages-10-17/#:~:text=Roughly%20one%20in%20six%20youth,10%20to%2017%20had%20obesity.  implies that most parents are actively making sub-optimal choices for their children's health and upbringing. Are we going to trust the group of people who, year over year, contribute to both negative health and mental effects on their children? I think we shouldn't, given their track record. 
[maaaaaa food desert, maaaaaaa expensive, maaaaaaa my kid likes the ipad, are excuses and at best belay a lack of knowledge of how to raise a child... people from an external perspective have no need to defend their own actions or parenting and are thus less biased and make no excuses like Joe ""six pack"" and Karen ""my child is special"".]

D) Your kid ain't special, stop acting like they are. Parents almost universally think that their kid is the best thing in the world since sliced bread and is mythical, greek god level, of importance and divinity. It must be some external problem and not my own parenting or my child who is at fault (which is also your fault, parent). This creates a huge bias and mars decision making. People without children are not emotionally biased in this way. When your kid can't do anything wrong, and you know best, this leads to a situation where you don't re-evaluate or reflect upon your decisions and double down on false beliefs... Do you want to trust the most biased group of people here? We don't in any other arena!

E) Stranger danger and the end of child development. It is a simple fact that a child is more likely to be sexually abused, killed, or harmed by someone the child already knows. So, Karen ""my Child is special"" letting Stacy ""helicopter pilot"" take their kid home from school is more dangerous for your child than letting them walk home. https://www.ojp.gov/library/publications/child-safety-more-slogan-stranger-danger-warnings-not-effective-keeping-kids#:~:text=Rather%2C%20the%20majority%20of%20missing,or%20not%20to%20be%20trusted. Making your child paranoid of strangers (as most parents seem to do) causes worse outcomes than letting a child gain their own independence with due guidance and teaching. Constantly pushing adulthood further and further into the future is a bad idea, but we must believe the parents, right? (no, no we don't!!!) Why do we think that the paranoids are to be trusted on child rearing when they raise children contrary to the optimal? It is a biased fear of loss and a desire for the safety of control that leads parents to hold false beliefs about what their kid should or should not be allowed to do and about what constitutes a good environment for a child. 

F) Helicopter parents and constant connective syndrome. Parents give their kids smartphones and access to the internet because they need to be connected to their child in case of emergency as an excuse (but, why do parents spend less quality time with child than ~~communist~~ government educators... worse for co-parents!). Thus, they bring distractions into the school, they bring dangers of the internet (where is the pedophile paranioa now? The obsessive connectivity to child at all times clearly more important!!!), they allow their kid to be cyber bullied, all because they don't understand that teachers and school officials have phones, and maybe it isn't a good idea to annoy your child constantly with texts and phone calls and to make the kid the object of obsession. It also doesn't allow a child to experience independence from parental authority which stunts development.  The bias of desire to be constantly connected shows that the paranoid parents are not the objective observers of truth that they make themselves out to be. Are we really to trust parents when their paranoia is so extreme that they actively harm their kids learning and development in order to satisfy their obsessive desires? I think not. Smartphones clearly cause children psychological detrement, and yet, every 12 year old has a smartphone now... so much for that parental knowledge. Likewise, even while at home a parent requires the kid to stay inside, to not be allowed to explore without the watchful eye of all knowing parent. One wonders why the children don't play outside, but that's because ""Special"" Sandy isn't allowed to because Joe ""six-pack"" is drinking his beer and Karen ""my kid is special"" won't let the kid play outside due to paranoia and instead must stay in room on ipad where Karen can feel safe. do we really want to trust these people? I think no. In fact, I think the non-parents probably knows better in these sorts of common, normative cases.

Again, if parents had such special knowledge, why is it that we are replete with examples of ways that their parenting is bad? If they had the knowledge they would raise their kid better. Kids aren't getting raised better, thus I'm quite skeptical of the knowledge these parents seem to claim. They are clearly biased observers and are interested actors which we wouldn't trust in any other domain. All these examples, I think, clearly prove this. Which leads to:

3) Proof is in the pudding:
Have outcomes for children increased or decreased in the era where we falsely believe that parents know best for their child (as opposed to institutions or spiritual truth authority)? The answer is no. We see increased suicide rates, we see increased mental and physical health problems, we see a lack of social and technological progress (See experiment: take person from 1880, transport to 1950... entire course of life has changed, nothing is the same... transport same to 2020 and the TV is in your pocket and the adults dress like children. no substantive change really when compared to airplanes, automobiles, radio and televisions, indoor plumbing, etc.). If the parents were right, we would expect to see such progress and such outcomes increase. However, by drinking the paranoid kool-aid of self-certainty the parents have made our situation worse. Why trust someone who snubs innovation and has decreased childhood wellbeing out of their own bias and paranoia? Wouldn't it be better to trust the person who isn't paranoid and emotionally invested and blinded by such? In other areas we value the objective observer, why not in parenting?

4) Analogously: parents are interested actors who desire their children to be of a certain idealized vision or which, at minimum, have a certain idea of the correct environment which is invested with their own ideals of the life that they want their kid to live. Being interested and subjective actors, parents are biased towards their own currently held beliefs. People who don't have children don't have these biases and aren't interested actors. Thus, they provide a more objective view of the situation that parents simply don't have access to.

5)Lastly, to repeat. The argument for parents being the highest position in terms of knowledge must be due to the fact that they spend more time with the kid and know the kid better? Given co-parenting, given two income households, given ipad parenting, given the ""requirement"" of extra-curricular activity... I don't think the average parent can really claim that they spend the majority of time the child is awake and alive with their child. So, the very crux of Karen ""my kid is special""'s argument is faulty because, in many cases, she doesn't spend even the plurality of time with her kid in a co-parenting situation, much less the majority of time even in a nuclear family. 


While some of my examples are pedantic, and some of them petty, they do serve to showcase the way that ""trust the parents and only the parents can have an opinion"" have led to bad outcomes and aren't necessarily true. Would you trust a dog owner who treats their dog like a human? no. Why would you trust a parent who puts their kid on a leash like a dog? You wouldn't and, that's the point. Why trust the people who are doing bad jobs and have consistently led to worse outcomes in terms of health and academic achievement of their children? Even proficiency in school has decreased over time (look at those stats at reading and math level! Recent article: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/24/us/math-reading-scores-pandemic.html)... Why trust the people who claim to be in control and know the most when they are doing a worse and worse job? You shouldn't! Don't trust the freaking parents, trust your own reason and the people who have an objective view of the situation. Don't trust Karen ""my kid is special"" or Joe ""six pack"". And, additionally, try your hardest to be objective if you are a parent, and don't fall prey to thinking your kid is the bestest and is to be protected like treasure, locked away in an insulated chest. It clouds your judgement.

What would change my mind:

1) Some kind of argument which shows that parents know more than psychologists that don't have children.

2) something which shows the participation trophy, my kid is special, stranger danger paranoia, helicopter constant connectivity parenting which is by and far away the norm has led to better outcomes than alternative parenting (the minority) styles would prove that current parents know more than non-parents or the non-normative, general parent which my statement targets. Again, we are talking about generalities, and the general parent is ignorant and has consistently led to worse outcomes for their children over time (again, those health and learning statistics don't show the average parent's choices in a good light... why trust them over others?). So showing the normative parenting style is better than what people outside the situation say would change my mind.

3) Some sort of knowledge that someone who has kids has that people who don't have kids can't understand or also hold as a belief. You need to show that there is something non-parents don't have access to that parents and only parents have access to (so, the child psychologist with no kids can't know it in principle). Note, if I, as a non-parent, can come to hold the belief you espouse without having a kid, that proves my point not yours."

- I don't think we should compare Harry's and Riddle's traumatizing childhood as it's impossible with all the variables as genetics etc in mind

- I have seen ""Oliver twist"" and although mrs. Cole seems to be compassionate about the children's physical wellbeing Dumbledore is an unreliable source. We don't actually know if the children recieved love and affection which is very important especially in the first year. Did they use corporal punishment? Were there food rationing?
- Riddle didn't cry a lot as infant. I call that emotional deprivation
- Overcrowded lack of resources. It was not uncommon for orphans to have to share a bed with several other children. Shoes was a luxury. Food was lacking. Orphans were often forced to eat the same watered down soup on weeks on ends. Diseases.
We don't know anything about circumstances before Dumbledore arrived.
-the Great depression 1931
- Thievery was very common among the children. Riddle had nothing to call his own
- World war II
- Riddle was forced to return every summer to the orphanage avoiding the most dangerous acts of war but London was destroyed. Did he fear the orphanage would be destroyed too? Leaving him without shelter?
- he came from a family known to have mental disorders so maybe he was already prone to it.
- I don't think Dumbledore was responsible for tom altogether but I think he could have cared more than just keep a close eye on him. Try to talk to him or get help. Although I think the worst damage was already made before tom came to Hogwarts and without thoroughly intervention nothing could've prevent him from becoming Voldemort.

1. Children's safety: I don't see how funny videos or dance videos are doing that. tik Tok already doesn't allow users under 13 to go viral or use private messages. Plus parents should always be aware of what their children are doing online.

2. Addictiveness: TV is addictive but there's no call to ban tv. 

3. Misinformation: everybody should do research on any claim you see in a random video.

4. Selling data: doesn't every app do this if you want to ban Tik Tok you should also call for the ban of every social media or app. 

There are other reasons these just seem the top ones. I think that Tik Tok isn't bad it's just like youtube where if you spend to much on it of course it's not good for you. It can also be a good learning aid with some of the videos I've seen."

For clarification, i do intellectually understand that animals can feel pain, and experince emotions, just like us.

I feel like i should be able to care for animals. I dont feel like i have a problem relating to other humans and their emotions, it is just animals. I want to have a broader understanding of this issue, and i would like to hear other peoples opinions on this topic.

This older demographic will put a strain on the pension system, possibly lead to economic decline, and also population  decline.

Currently lots of people around the world want to come and live in these countries, because of their safety, liberal values, strong democracy, strong economies and great welfare states. However these advantages might not always be there and if the demographic crisis comes to pass then less people would want to move to this countries.

European countries like Germany for example (where I immigrated to 1.5 years ago) is trying to transform itself from a country where mostly europeans immigrated into it to a country where people from different parts of the world immigrate into. 

The challenge however is that the people coming from other places around the world have the following characteristics:

* Some are of a different race e.g black Africans like me (I am from Kenya)
* Some are less educated.
* Some have a different religion e.g Islam
* Some are illiberal
* Some arrive illegally

This characteristics have led to a very vicious anti-immigrant sentiment among the population. Which in my view threatens to cause the election of illiberal, anti-democratic governments that will restrict immigration and roll back women's rights in the quest of reversing the predicted demographic challenges, possibly restrict freedom of religion and start stupid wars.

161,2023-11-16,CMV: banning literature of any kind is unethical/there is no moral purpose for it.,u/LowKeyBrit36,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17x09ee/cmv_banning_literature_of_any_kind_is/,changemyview,"The banning of texts/burning of texts has been prevalent throughout history, as seen in cases with Hitler’s burning of books by Jewish officers nearby the Reichstag, to the destruction of the Library of Alexandria, which had caused many texts to be forgotten permanently. Even today, many political groups and even governments ban books, often due to an ideological disagreement with the texts within the books. I believe there isn’t any ethical purpose for banning books due to:                                               

1. The unfair treatment of ideas and the trespass of human rights, such as the freedom of press (at least in the US, and equivalent laws that exist elsewhere protecting the freedoms of speech and expression).                                                                                                            

2. The degradation of history, and the inevitability that if history is forgotten, it cannot teach the future, and disastrous events could reoccur, causing harm and tyranny.                                                                                                                                                                                        

3. The bias that banning a book or series of books would inflict upon a populace, limiting their opinion to a constricted subset of derivations controlled by a central authority, which could inflict dangerous mentalities upon a populace.                                                                                            

There are no exceptions, in my mind, that come to the table about banning books, allowing morality within the banning. I have seen many argue books such as “Mein Kamph,”Hitler’s autobiography, deserving bans due to their contents. Despite this however, the book can serve as an example of harmful ideologies, and with proper explanation, the book gives insight into Hitler’s history, biases, and shortcomings, all of which aid historians in educating populaces about the atrocities of Hitler, and the evils these ideologies present. Today, we see many books being banned for similar reasons, and many claiming that those bans are ethical due to the nature of these banned books.                                                                                                                                                                                                                

To CMV, I would want sufficient evidence of a moral banning of books, or at least a reason that books can be banned ethically."

Prenatal depression. Natal depression. Postpartum depression. Why is that? A living organism growing inside your body, getting bigger, slowing you down, changing your body and brain chemistry, making you act like you're not yourself and then exiting in a painful and often traumatising way.

1,2023-11-16,CMV: the middle east situation is entirely fault of westerners,u/KoreyMDuffy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17x10tl/cmv_the_middle_east_situation_is_entirely_fault/,changemyview,"The west created the situation we see in the middle east. Prior to 1947, the middle east was largely secular and westernized government. Cairo rivaled Paris. Would you say that comes to your mind today? No today you probably think terrorism and violence.

The redrawing of borders in the aftermath of World War I by Western powers, exemplified by the Sykes-Picot Agreement, created artificial nation-states that often disregarded the region's cultural and ethnic complexities. This arbitrary division led to the suppression of local identities and the establishment of regimes that struggled to maintain stability in the face of diverse populations with historical grievances.

During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a competition for influence in the Middle East. The U.S., driven by its strategic interests, supported authoritarian regimes to counter Soviet expansion, prioritizing stability over democratic principles. This support for autocratic rulers not only stifled the development of democratic institutions but also fueled resentment among populations who felt betrayed by Western powers.

The direct intervention in countries like Iran, where the CIA-backed coup in 1953 ousted the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh, demonstrated the West's willingness to undermine democratic movements in favor of regimes that aligned with Western interests. This intervention set a precedent for subsequent actions, contributing to the skepticism of many in the Middle East towards Western intentions.

The invasion of Iraq in 2003, based on flawed intelligence and questionable motives, not only destabilized the region but also created a power vacuum that allowed extremist groups like ISIS to emerge. The aftermath of the invasion revealed the unintended consequences of Western military interventions and highlighted the challenges of nation-building in a culturally complex environment.

Furthermore, the West's support for authoritarian regimes, such as those in Egypt and Saudi Arabia, has perpetuated a cycle of repression and radicalization. The suppression of political dissent and the stifling of alternative voices have led frustrated populations to seek solace in radical ideologies, often viewing them as the only viable means of opposing Western-backed oppressive regimes.

In summary, Western actions, including interventions, geopolitical strategies, and support for authoritarian regimes, have played a pivotal role in shaping the current Middle Eastern environment. The consequences of these actions are evident in the region's political instability, the rise of radical ideologies, and the ongoing struggle for self-determination. Acknowledging the role of the West in these developments is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamics at play in the Middle East today."
1,2023-11-16,CMV: Both parties are wrong about abortion.,u/BatElectrical4711,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17x1e9t/cmv_both_parties_are_wrong_about_abortion/,changemyview,"Most of the discussions on the abortion debate are typically spent on “side bar” points that don’t matter, have easy logical answers, or don’t apply across the board. The three most common are below.

1) When does life begin?

The reason this even gets debated is because if we can consider life beginning later in pregnancy, anything prior to that point would be acceptable to abort.
Democrats are not unified on when life begins, so the debate changes based on who you’re talking to.
Republicans will say life begins at conception so that no timeline exceptions can be made.

2) Inevitably the subject of medical complications and pregnancy as a result of an assault come up. 

Typically this is a misdirection rather than a sub subject - people will use these cases as a justification for making all abortions legal. All available information indicates these categories of abortion make up for a respectively 6-7% and less than 1% of all terminations. Because these only make up a fraction of the terminations that take place, the rule for all cannot be based here.

Some Republicans have asked the question “If I concede and allow these types of abortions to take place, would you then be ok outlawing all the others?” 
A fair question, to which the answer is always no. That confirms misdirection rather than a sub subject.

3) Also semi frequently, the subject comes up of “men don’t get an opinion.” 

This is completely ridiculous - in America we’re all allowed an opinion, and we’re allowed to voice it, even on subjects that we’re only indirectly involved in. You don’t need to have a pet to know animal abuse is wrong. Plenty of women are pro life as well, just imagine it’s them making the same points. Or if you hold those beliefs and want to get really upset, assume the man making that point identifies as a woman that day.



What’s left to discuss after a consensus has been reached on those “side bar” points (or they’ve been discussed into oblivion and set aside for the time being) is the value of a pregnancy, vs the mothers rights.

Republicans view that life as valuable as a born human, which is completely preposterous. The embryo vs crying baby in a burning building paradox proves this.
Most Democrats in some fashion oppose 3rd trimester abortions, which indicates they agree some value exists, but not the same as an already born human.

This is where the debate needs to be had.

How much value does that life have? Does that value change as gestation progresses? If so why?Does that value ever rise above the mothers right to choose? Does a fetus have rights?(They don’t, but “should they?” would be the better question to ask - if they should, how does that get defined and written into law?).

These are the questions that actually need to be discussed, sorted, and really gotten to the bottom of. Unfortunately both sides spend time arguing about the “side bar” points and things get too heated to discuss the real heart of the issue."

I've always said that not voting is a vote for the Republican party, especially in the world we live in right now. Anyone who is against the right but is choosing to not vote in ""protest"" is genuinely ignorant and will not be happy when Trump is the president again.

  1. Lifting weights can help increase muscle size and strength. It also helps increase power the combination of speed and strength and can help the person training perform better in sports or other physical activities.

2. Lifting weights can help improve cardiovascular function by strengthening the heart and lungs, as the heart is a muscle that requires regular exercise to stay healthy and strong

3.  Lifting weights can increase bone density and decrease overall bone loss by helping to stimulate bone growth and increase the strength of existing bones.

4. Lifting weights can help increase the stability and strength of the joints, which can prevent injuries and improve overall function.

5. Lifting weights can help reduce body fat by increasing a person’s metabolic rate. Since muscular tissue is more metabolically active than fat tissue, people with more muscle tend to have a higher metabolic rate. This increase can affect body composition as well.

6. Lifting weights can increase feelings of self-confidence, improve mood and boost brainpower, 

7. can help improve sleep quality, too, which is essential for physical and mental well-being and may help reduce fatigue and increase energy levels throughout the day. Lifting weights can also help the body adjust to a regular sleeping pattern and improve stiffness and aches that can cause sleep disturbances."

This does NOT include families whom are living in a van out of necessity. If the family ended up there due to financial reasons and not by choice, this post is not about those families. 

This post is about parents who willingly choose to sell their house knowingly forcing their dependent child into a dysfunctional environment that isn't alligned with generational and proven successful rearing practices. 

Forcing nomadship onto a child or teen is deeply problematic for their mental health and ability to form an identity that isn't intermixed with the parent's nomadic life. 

Often, nomadic parents control the diets, information, and peers of their children. It often stems from an overbearing, likely delusional over reaction to the processing that happens with the food supply chain.

This is not societal. If you’re looking for that kind of post, look elsewhere. This is a discussion on humanity as a whole. 

Humans are an absolute disgrace to the 4 billion years of evolution that got us here. This realization hit me today, as I wrapped up a series on how life started, and how we got to where we are today.

Before civilization and society, there was just life. There were no groups. There were no cultural feuds. No wars. No politics. There was life. Now of course, animals had to eat other animals to survive, but that’s natural, and that’s how survival happened.

Throughout that time, there were 5 mass extinctions. Each different, but equally as disastrous. 5 out of 5 times, life found a way to grow back stronger than it was before. 

NEVER before humans, did animals of the same species actively seek to tear each other down. There was a biological instinct to survive, and nothing outweighed that. Bacteria, aquatic life, birds, mammals, you name it.  Survival as a species was paramount. For 4 billion years. 

And then we came along. Wars, political battles, genocides, HATRED OF OTHER HUMANS OVER MAN MADE ENTITIES.

4 billion years of life scratching and clawing, struggling to just survive. To push forward. And here we are tearing apart each other. Tearing apart our planet. The things we pretend are big deals? The problems humans have? Nothing. Zero. Not a drop in a bucket compared to literally facing extinction. 

4 billion years of evolution, for us to be destroying ourselves. It’s so disappointing, and truly disgusting. The entire time life has been around, there was an innate need to push your species forward. Not anymore. All we’re doing is standing still, and that’s being generous.

So I can’t help but think, all of our ancestors would be pretty disappointed in what we’ve become. Sorry earth. We’ve failed you."

Here are my personal reasons for not voting for either 

Biden
- the way he gives so much aid to Iserali despite not ever spending much money on Americans
- Refusing a ceasefire despite both sides having citizens getting killed (my view on the conflict itself is irrelevant to this cmv tho)
- the economy seems to just be getting worse and worse 

Trump 
- overtly racist / homophonic/ transphobic speeches and things i don’t stand for 
- probably will make it worse for Muslims in America 
- republicans and book bans in library 
- there’s probably more but I was still fairly young when he was president

Now I'm gonna list a few points on why I think the gang culture is a more fulfilling way of life, and why I think it's becoming increasingly popular:

&#x200B;

1. **need to belong in a group** \- I find this to be the most obvious one. The gang culture is all about loyalty, integrity and what's best for the group. This is something that has been almost totally removed from modern society, most people have only small social circle and even then the relationships are not as close and there is little to no integrity. This is a big difference from having people who are literally willing to die for you. I think this is a very basic tribal need. People nowadays are lacking groups to identify with, that's why you see young people trying to fit into archetypes such as goth, hippie, skater, whatever. The problem is these communities are only based on hobbies and aesthetics and don't really work long term, because of my next point.
2. **resource acquisition** \- Humans aren't machines and aren't supposed to work the same hours everyday with delayed reward after a MONTH of work. After that the government, people you don't even know take large chunk of what you earned. We are wired for much more frequent dopamine hits one would receive from their daily search for food with sharing being done only among people you personally know. Gang culture is largely based on drug trading which is morally questionable, but it's one of the only industries that is accessible for everyone, isn't taxed and offers daily payouts.
3. **violent struggle** \- Perhaps the most controversial point, but I believe this is something people are currently missing. On the surface it might seem that it's much better for your safety to be guaranteed everyday, but in reality all it does is that it takes the control out of people's hands. You are supposed to rely on cops for safety & courts for justice. This is much more apparent in majority of European countries, with total ban on guns. This is basically equivalent of removing fangs and claws of a predator, rendering them powerless and defenseless. Sure, life might be more dangerous when there is a chance for violence, but at least you value and fully enjoy every single day of life, knowing that it might be your last. "

Basically, a changed view for this post would be that my prediction is wrong and internet anonymity is here to stay.

First of all, governments and politicians (whether 'left' or 'right') frequently suggest that internet anonymity is a bad thing and should end. This suggests that there may be such efforts in the future.

Second of all is the mini-AI ""revolution"" and X's verification system that is likely to happen to other sites as well and is more of a *de facto*/silent de-anonymisation. Basically, since AI is getting so good at captcha solving even the most complex ones just won't be able to differentiate between bots or humans, and actually the bots are more likely to be able to solve them than humans are. That means that websites are increasingly going to go for Musk's idea of having a small charge to prove that you're a human by using a credit card for example. This will be more acceptable to the general public than actually requiring an ID but the effect will be the same: people won't be anonymous on internet because their credit card info contains their name/identity.

In relation to the second point some might be quick to point out that there's a distinction because you're still anonymous to the public and only the website knows your real identity (which it might anyway)  and the government (yes, it does anyway through IP but that's less straightforward). But I'd say that's still anonymity dying and it's just a step towards my first point that eventually there will be none left."

1,2023-11-17,CMV: “The Great Reset” is partially correct,u/Money_Whisperer,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17xdq2v/cmv_the_great_reset_is_partially_correct/,changemyview,"For those of you unfamiliar, “The Great Reset” is a conspiracy theory that specifically states the following- 

1. The World Economic Forum (WEF) seeks to disenfranchise the poor worldwide and consolidate all wealth and power to wealthy elites.

2. The WEF also seeks to destroy all democracies and replace them with CCP-style dictatorships, which will prevent the rest of the population from fighting back.

3. Their ultimate goal in the first 2 points is the destruction of the middle class, with most falling into poverty. Those in poverty will be killed off, leading a 95% reduction in the global human population from today's levels.

I believe that a ""soft"" version of this is correct, I don't think that poor people are gonna start being put in gas chambers, and I don't think its the WEF exclusively that's doing it, but I do believe the following bullets as my CMV- 

- Big corporations are fiduciarily obligated to grow their wealth as much as they possibly can. This means that not only do they need to consider taking from the poor and middle class, but they actually are legally obligated to do so if its advantageous. 

- Because of that first bullet, these same corporations are under no legal obligation to consider the long-term well being of those they've disenfranchised. 

- In fact, these same mega corporations would benefit from an increasingly restricted democracy, where their lobbying and bribery would have more sway over legislation, and the consequences of their actions on the broader population would not be punished or addressed. 

A good example of how bullet 1 is big investment firms and banks buying single family homes, to the point where 40% of said homes may be owned by Wall Street and rented out by 2030- https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/02/21/how-wall-street-bought-single-family-homes-and-put-them-up-for-rent.html

This exacerbates the housing crisis in the US, intentionally, and leads to scenarios where many must rent for the rest of their lives. If too many people are forced to rent, then rental prices will skyrocket to the point where many end up on the streets, and then they die.

Same thing with renewable energy, where states like California are banning gas cars at a time where their electric grid cannot handle even existing load, knowingly and intentionally creating an energy crisis that will result in mass deaths on the streets. 

There’s also the uncanny relationship between China and the banking elite, who have continually covered for China, advocated for increased trade with China since the 90’s, and continues to invest in that country, despite gross human rights violations and the horrific realities of that country.

In fact, Klaus Schwabb, head of the world economic forum, has called China a “model for much of the world”-

https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/china-will-be-a-role-model-in-the-systemic-transformation-of-the-world-says-klaus-schwab/amp/

I understand he was mostly talking about their economic success, but the audacity to call China a “model country” during the pandemic when they were putting people in cages arbitrarily “for Covid” at the very least indicates to me that economic success is prioritized over the advancement of democracy, and the former will be picked over the latter when push comes to shove. 

The WEF also played a key role in building the modern CCP in the 1980’s and 1990’s via consulting Chinese leadership directly in economic summits, for what its worth

So that’s my case I’m hoping to have changed today. I believe wealthy elites and corporations are predominantly interested in continuing to grow their wealth, which requires they take what little assets the rest of us have, and their disregard for our well being during this indicates that they attach no value to our lives. In fact, when push comes to shove, they prioritize their wealth over democracy and basic human freedoms. The result is essentially the great reset of society, where the majority of us will own nothing, have no power to fight back, and must die so as to not over encumber the elites with homeless riff raff on the streets."

But the Temple is a political organization, not a religious one. ""Satanism"" has proven to be a useful method of activism for those of us on the left, but it's only a tool. It's not a legitimate belief system.

Everytime satanism is mentioned on reddit, there's always some snarky redditor who comments ""well acktually satanists don't believe in Satan"" as if the Temple is the only satanist organization that exists. Obviously, actual theistic satanists exist. There are also many organizations which profess theistic satanism, such as the temple of set. Theistic satanism comes in all flavors, most of them don't believe the biblical origin story but they do believe in Satan. But that's not the point of this thread. Atheistic satanists have poisoned the well so to speak, and now everybody associates the word ""satanism"" with atheism when that is factually incorrect.

Look at the philosophy of LaVeyan Satanism, the view that Lucifer is a symbolic representation of rebellion against authority. The rest of the philosophy is basically just Ayn Rand-esque libertarianism. This makes a lot of sense, as a philosophy, but it's not a religion. To call yourself a Satanist, dress up and do fancy rituals for a god you don't actually believe in, and more is just weird. You're just trying to make Christians mad, and for what purpose"

You can undo a financial crime, but you cannot undo a violent crime because the victim suffered from physical and psychological issues. That is the reason why violent crimes are harshly punished.

However, financial crimes are not punished as harshly as violent crimes. Violent crimes do huge damage to a few people. Financial crimes can do mild damage to people, and the amount of people who are affected can vary. My view is that financial crimes should be punished at the same level as violent crimes because violent crimes target quality and financial crimes target quantity, which has the same damage when calculated.

Change my view about why violent crimes should get harsher punishments than financial crimes."

804,2023-11-17,CMV: Vegan “leather” is dumb,u/SennheiserHD6XX,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17xur4t/cmv_vegan_leather_is_dumb/,changemyview,"Alright first off I would like to make it clear that this is not an attack on veganism; its a noble cause to minimize the suffering of animals but vegan leather in particular is a terrible alternative. Although I am not vegan because meat tastes too good.

Firstly its simply lower quality that real leather.
Leather fibrous structure is much more durable than faux, leading it to last longer. Even if its for something that doesn't need to be resilient, leather patinas beautifully as it ages, while faux just breaks down and cracks. Because of this vegan leather is replaced more often than produced more waste.

Not only does faux create more waste but it also is much worse for the environment. Leather is biodegradable because it obviously comes from animals. 90% of vegan leather is made of plastic which cant say the same. There are some alternative vegan leathers made of cactus and other stuff but they are uncommon and still mixed with synthetic materials which also do not biodegrade.

So vegan leather produces more waste, and is more environmentally taxing but at least its free from animal suffering right? Well yes, but you can make an argument that leather is too. Almost all leather is a biproduct of the meat industry, meaning cows aren't being killed for their hides. If we all stopped buying leather it wouldn't have a major effect on the quantity of cows being slaughtered, we'd just use less of the cows. I view it like the Native Americans and the buffalo. To show respect for the buffalo they used everything. Nothing went to waste. Their hide is better as a pair of boots than rotting in a landfill.

Anyway if anyone feels I am misunderstanding why people prefer vegan leather, change my view. Thanks"

In a specific example, my girlfriend’s last sexual partner before me “raped” her. They had consensual sex, but he came inside and she didn’t know until later, albeit not wanting him to do so. Yet, a subpar text apology was all it took for her to accept him as a sexual partner again. 

Currently, if the conversation is related (if the convo is sexual perhaps) she’ll make jokes about being a victim. I don’t show it but it pisses me off because it feels like some weird wannabe victim mentality thing. Like there are actual rape victims who can’t stomach the thought of their rapist and/or have sexual trauma or other issues and here you are trying to clump yourself in that same category. When you (of free will) went back to him. 

I’m sure it’s also rooted in some insecurities for me, but the combination of everything just makes it so hard for me not to roll my eyes when she brings it up. Is there some alternative way to view this?"

I don't need to defend every racist and idiotic statement a minister makes (unfortunately there are a lot of them, i know), and I would even oppose some problematic policies such as the settlements. In fact I oppose this government, I think it is awful and i can't wait for the day it falls. But, with that out of the way, when it comes to the war, it is just and necessary. This is my stance, I don't need to defend everything.  
  
I am not going to argue over weather Hamas is a terrorist organization or not. If you don't think it is, for f\*cks sack just go and watch the atrocious videos that Hamas THEMSELVES have posted online in their sick way of bragging on October 7th. If you still deny it or justify it, seriously I don't think we can have a conversation. No I am here argue with the relatively more reasonable voices I hear against Israel. Those who agree that Hamas is unjustifiable but still oppose Israel's response, or those that think it will only worsen the situation. Here I think we can have a real discourse.  
  
So firstly, the war is necessary. And i am not referring here to vengeance. I am referring to preventing October 7th from ever happening again, because after the atrocities that happened letting Hamas continue ruling Gaza is simply not something that can be allowed to happen. It creates an appalling incentive structure, and it means certain future terror attacks.  
  
But moreover I truly believe that removing Hamas is the only way for a potential solution to this conflict. Because I do believe that peace is possible. But as long as Hamas rules the Palestinians it's just not going to happen. We've seen for example in 2005 how Israel is willing to give Gazans freedom, but then Hamas rose to power and ruined everything. When Hamas rules Gaza, controls its resources, uses it's facilities to maintain a terror state, controls the educational system there to pass the worst forms of hatred. As long as this is the case peace just can't happen. So even if in the short term it has a cost, this war is our only way for a solution in the long term. For the benefit of both Israeli and Palestinians.  
  
Secondly, regarding the fact that a lot of civilians die as a result Israel's response. It's true, and it's heartbreaking. but here we need to differentiate between an attack that deliberately targets civilians, and an attack that targets military targets and unfortunately also has civilians dying as a result of it. The former is a terrorist action, a war crime, a completely unjustifiable act under any circumstances. The later is a necessary and legitimate part of war. And in fact Israel does everything in its power to minimize the civilians casualties. I'm not saying this as a slogan, I am as frank as I can be. here are just some of the means Israel takes: evacuating the civilians from the north where the main battlefield takes place to the south, warning people before shooting down targets, literarily every air strike needs to be approved by a law person, an independent judicial court, an independent media, and so on and so on... saying that Israel disregards civilian lives is absurd. Civilians still die, of course, that is because Hamas makes sure of that. Hiding under civilians, using their facilities for themselves... Those deaths, as heartbreaking as they are, still do not affect the legitimacy of the war."

APA format is sufficient for all types of writing: science writing, literature reviews, writing about works of fiction, writing about theology, etc.
2. Any benefit gained from using different styles in different academic settings is far outweighed by the difficulty of keeping the styles straight.
3. American high school students would be set up for success in STEM fields if APA were taught rather than MLA. Also, science would develop more quickly (albeit not an incredible change) if academic writers were more familiar with APA format, having engaged with this for more time.
4. If one format were accepted completely, the time spent by multiple committees maintaining and updating the other styles/formats could be better utilized elsewhere.
5. One format would reduce the frustration that students feel and unify disciplines making knowledge-sharing easier.

Well, I'm open to a conversation about this. Of course I feel strongly, being impacted by this!"

So I did not have much knowledge on the conflicts between Israel-Palestine until recent conflicts, so after the events I tried to search for information (instead of just from TikTok videos).

So from what I understand (and please correct me if I am wrong about the facts), Palestine's territory was much larger back a century ago. But then the state of Israel was partitioned by the UN around the 1950s, and then they have been fighting for territory even since --- with Palestine's territory shrinking to almost less than 2% than what it was in 1930s.

If the above really is the case, I can somewhat understand the motivations. AGAIN I AM NOT SAYING I AGREE WITH THE EXTENT THAT HAMAS TOOK IT TO --- but that some degree of non-peaceful protest would definitely be solicited. As a racial person myself, I am influenced Malcolm X's ""By any means necessary"" idea --- imagine if someone comes to your house, beats you up, and leaves you with only a plot of mud in the garden while they get all the rest --- would you fight the person?

Of course, I think that there could be other means of unpeaceful protest --- but most sentiment Ive seen so far seems to be very hostile against the sentiment of palestine --- of which I dont understand where thats coming from --- and I really do want to know so I can update myself on the proper understanding of the picture.

1) Ukraine wants to join the western world (ie join EU/NATO etc). Whereas Palestine hates the west. Ukraine is becoming more socially progressive whereas in Palestine gays are pushed off buildings.

Now, IMO I feel like because of this cities should give the residents a voice in if these sorts of events take place in the city.

By having a vote, people could choose if they’d want their city to do something like this. 

If someone wants to argue that no city’s population would vote to have a race like this, then maybe F1 could consider how they could be better to their fans/ nicer to locals to make people want their races in their cities."

How would Jews in Israel be safe under a two state solution? If you ask almost any Palestinian in Palestine, they will say that all of the territory currently controlled by Israel is rightful Palestinian territory. Because of this they often classify all Israeli Jews as settlers (not just Jews in the West Bank). According to Arab and Palestinian media these ""Settlers"" are all participating in apartheid and are all legitimate targets. We saw this on October 7th when Palestinians celebrated the deaths of ""settlers"" despite the attacks taking place entirely on territory internationally recognized as Israel. Most Palestinians don't even like the idea of a two state solution which we can see with statements like ""from the river to the sea."" Also, this is backed up by many surveys, including one that was released just last week.  
  
So essentially my question is, if Israel agrees to a two state solution, what is preventing the West bank from becoming a new Gaza? What is preventing Hamas 2 from arising there? Israel already has very little strategic depth, but it would be giving away what little it has. The average Palestinian hates Israelis. Maybe that's justified. I don't know. But either way, that hate isn't going away over night. Can someone explain what exactly Israel gains from a two state solution because to me the whole thing just kinda seems like putting more Jews in danger for no gains. And all that, wouldn't even end the conflict, it would just increase the violence."

We often like to believe that with time, things get better – less racist, less prejudiced. But I can't shake the feeling that it's not quite the case. It fluctuates. Often times leading to irreversible damage. I’d like to believe that it’s just social media putting a spotlight on what has always existed. I don’t believe that’s the case. While racism and division have always existed, there's a different intensity now. And I think it’s due to several factors. 

I think it stems from this cultural push to embrace uniqueness, coupled with a dangerous level of pride in our identities. It's not just about where you come from or your skin color; it's escalated to this unsettling sense of superiority. I've pondered the role of pride in our society extensively. I once took pride in my country and other aspects that were merely happenstance at one point in my life. There was a phase when I swung to the opposite extreme, viewing all pride as negative. Now, I've landed on the belief that pride can lead to both positive and negative outcomes. While often illogical, it's not inherently good or bad. Unfortunately, there are instances where pride takes a destructive turn, especially when it fosters a sense of superiority in individuals. Or when it blinds people from truth. By any means necessary, they’ll fight for their identity against the “other”. 


Lately, I've witnessed an alarming surge in racism across the board. It's not confined to one group; it's everyone turning against everyone. No, I don’t believe that certain groups have immunity to being racist. It’s literally every group against another. Anti-Semitism, particularly in the context of conflicts like Palestine-Israel, is escalating, showcasing a disturbing trend of religious discrimination. And it’s really bad. Like for instance, calling for the genocide of certain groups. The praise of evil dictators that wouldn’t have been controversial to condemn in the past. And this might be coming from an Indonesian supporting Palestine solely based on religious commonality. To a lesser extent, I’ve also seen many Jews be islamaphobic. The hate is all around. My team vs yours. 

The internet, especially social media, seems to amplify these issues rather than just merely exposing what has already existed forever. 
Is it tapping into our primal instincts to be tribalistic? I've observed a concerning rise in division, prejudice, and racism lately and I’m convinced it’s a point of intensity that’s far greater than anything we have seen in the past 30 years. Possibly even longer. It's disheartening and frankly quite unsettling."

For example we can read this blog [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/29/the-killing-joke-batgirl-violence-against-women-men](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/29/the-killing-joke-batgirl-violence-against-women-men). 

The violence towards women is usually sexual, and violence in general is ""avoided"", on the other hand, men are rarely attacked sexually, but it is common to see excessive gore, among other things. It is very common for fights to involve mostly men.

Violence should not be treated differently according to gender. If my movie is a gore movie, then men and women alike will be shredded in unpleasant ways.

The same goes for the other genders, violence and therefore death should be the same for both.

I understand that rape has a very strong social weight in our societies, so a rapist fits very well as a villain. My problem is when these issues are monopolized and women, outside of rape, do not tend to suffer violence as unconscionable as men.

My point is not whether we should change the movies and make them more or less violent. My point is that violence should be equal for both.

As a feminist my self , I don't see why we should be treated differently in the movies, ignoring certain exceptions that seek to portray today's society.

Basically it’s fair use for a musician to incorporate those sounds in a creative way. It’s not fair use for a characters phone in a movie to use the same sound as my phone in real life.

For context I am a proud organ donor who is a young woman. I hope I don’t die young, but if I do I want to help others. I registered as an organ doner when I was 16 when I got my driver’s license.  In America you have to choose to be an organ doner and the default is to not be one. In my view this is wrong.

  
 According to the American Transplant Foundation, 18 people die every day in the United States for want of an organ transplant, and some 122,344 people are waiting for a donated organ. Changing U.S. policies so that people’s organs are automatically donated when they die—rather than requiring people to “opt in” to donating their organs while they are still alive—will lead to more organ donations and more lives saved.

  
In countries such as Austria, laws make organ donation the default option at the time of death, and so people must explicitly “opt out” of organ donation. In these so-called opt-out countries, more than 90% of people register to donate their organs. Yet in countries such as the U.S.A, people must explicitly “opt in” if they want to donate their organs when they die. In these opt-in countries, fewer than 15% of people register. I think far more then 15% of Americans would want to save a life with their organs after death.

  
Mandatory donation would largely increase the pool of donors. The lives of many people waiting for a transplant would be saved. Automatic organ donation after death would speed up the process of transplantation and contribute to save lives, as doctors would not need to verify the consent status of potential donors.

  
It should be mandatory to be an organ doner, unless you explicitly choose to not be one. Change my view.

I think it's likely that the Palestinians would have just been incorporated into another arab state, especially given the prestige of owning Jerusalem.

Why do I want my view changed?  I haven't looked incredibly deeply into the histriy of pan arab nationalism or the commitments the British made to certain Arab grounds about the Palestine territory and what would happen to it after ww1. Based on what I remember reading, it was supposed to go to some other Arab state. Based on the actions taken by Arab states like actions of countries like Egypt, Jordan and Syria it looks to me like the idea of some sort of independent Palestinian state wasn't it their plans and has only become an idea due to the creation of Israel."

While it's not lost on me that we were certainly seeing a disturbing trend over over-prescribing these medicines, scummy doctors, folks abusing the system, and the fact that opiod-based pain killers aren't the best way to deal with LONG-term chronic pain; it really seems to have gone too far. 

In addition to (for the most part) entirely ignoring the benefits of chronic pain management-focused physical therapy, healthcare providers are running scared to prescribe them in completely legitimate, short-term situations due to fear of being the next one in the headlines we see all the time: doctors being investigated, being found liable or even serving jail time; even even it's not a reasonable fear in that specific circumstance. 

It reminds me so much of the ""war on drugs."" Government either legislating or pressuring institutions in ways that just drive people into worse situations. I've personally lost 2 friends and nearly lost 2 others from this exact situation. Everything from:

- Ex-military buddy suffering from chronic pain that gets cut off and ultimately turned to fentanyl (since they could easily find it on the street) to 
- Friends with a basic, treatable pain - by using short term opioids layered with more long-term chronic pain treatment-focused physical therapy - that can't get meaningful relief who ends up discovering Kratom, getting hooked and eventually dying to a fatal seizure (from over-use) while driving.

I realize some of the issues lay with the users too but chronic pain is difficult and I don't really blame them for trying to find ways to deal with it on their own when they're struggling. 

I'm personally dealing with it (to a lesser degree) right now. Just had mouth surgery 2 days ago. Get out of the op and am in a ton of pain only to find out that my dentist is one of those that proudly prescribes nothing but 800mg ibuprofen. 

I've not slept in 2 days and it only seems to be getting worse. I complained about it at a gathering last night and one of my acquaintances pulls me aside and says he can get me something. I know myself, my weaknesses and tendencies so am not interested but he keeps going to say he can get fent but not normal pain killers because ""that shit is impossible to get nowadays."" I'm most likely not going to ever talk to this dude again if he's willing to push that crap to his acquaintances friends, but it was certainly a wake-up call. 

Sure seems to me that the current legal, political and policy direction in the US is creating (or at least exacerbating) the conditions necessary for a massive market and extremely lucrative business opportunity for these extremely dangerous drugs. 

Am I just flat-out wrong? Looking at it backwards? Happy to have a discussion, because - for now - I feel like I'm taking crazy pills! (Pun intended)"
1,2023-11-18,CMV: The best sexual achievement is taking a ton of virginities,u/their-holiness,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17yglic/cmv_the_best_sexual_achievement_is_taking_a_ton/,changemyview,"I believe the best sexual achievement and metric of your sexual worth is taking a bunch of virginities.

Some people think the best metric is body count or similar, but I don’t think it is.  

I’m interested in seeing another metric that might be better than this one as this view causes me personal distress. But I need a metric not some bullshit about metrics not mattering.

I think a potential rival metric is introducing people to new sexual acts over just sex itself. But I think that’s too easy to excel at among other problems I will explain later in a dedicated paragraph towards the end of the post.

I think it’s a good metric because it reflects being helpful and emotionally supportive to people.

This is reflected in the person I admire most who took 11 virginities.

The metric has a few quirks to it compared to body count as a metric

It biases towards early in your life, which is good because it properly represents how much harder it is early in life and rewards showing initiative. It is also zero sum where any increase in it your performance on the metric corresponds to a decrease for other people. The population is only so large so with it there’s a finite amount of virginities to take within your general age cohort. This means it is an effective measure of how much better you are than other people.

I say probably taking gay virginities counts too for people who have previously had only encounters with another sex.

I think with later sex partners it’s not as significant. You aren’t introducing people to stuff or helping them. It doesn’t represent being a supportive person or taking initiative or anything else good like that, it doesn’t represent meeting people irl nor does it represent other good things. Generally that just involves messaging people on dating apps and nothing more. I say you can easily have infinite sex partners without having any redeeming characteristics.

And theoretically just introducing people to new things sexually would count to this too, but I think you can cheat at this metric pretty easily because so many people are very vanilla. Like so many girls have never pegged anyone and so many boys have never done prostate play so I guess it’s kind of analogous. But I think it’s too easy to cheat at this metric and get 20 girls who have never pegged anyone before to peg you, and that’s a lot less impressive than just taking 20 or even 5 virginities. There’s also a non-finite number of sex acts so the metric is not zero-sum anymore and as a result it doesn’t intrinsically mean you are better than other people anymore.

Yes this view distresses me and I’m going to therapy for it next Thursday."

I think we should try to help the homeless however I think the way to do it is to donate or volunteer with pre-established charities. This is because they probably get better deals buying things in bulk and are more efficient in handing out the food. I’m sure there may be a few homeless people that aren’t reached by the main groups but it is definitely very inefficient to start your own rag tag team. I’m trying to change my view about this specific group not helping the homeless on your own in general.

4,2023-11-18,CMV: The past month’s events has been a “mask off” moment for many colleges and universities.,u/nowlan101,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17yi25l/cmv_the_past_months_events_has_been_a_mask_off/,changemyview,"(I’m speaking more about the US but I think it applies broadly as well.) 

To me it shows that despite their claims to impartiality, colleges and universities aren’t willing to have tough conversations about race and religion when it’s not about white folks being the “bad guys”. I don’t consider myself to be a particularly reactionary or conservative person. I’m probably more center right then anything. I thought there was a fair bit of liberal bias in colleges but it was nowhere near as bad or as dramatic as the Right made it out to be. But the past 2 years has really changed that for me.

It's been building up over time but the reaction on many campuses to the largest massacre of jews outside the holocaust really crystallized the problem. Many of the protesters were students but the same environment that allows such things to happen without even a moment of self reflection on the part of the protesters ties into my larger point. Most professors in almost every subject besides maybe economics and the sciences are on the far left and it follows that they’d be very uncomfortable going against the grain and talking about the history of arab antisemitism, the pogroms in Iraq that drove out its 100,000+ Jewish population, the deep rooted connection between Nazi ideology and Arab nationalism, the ongoing persecutions of Coptic Christian communities in countries Islamic nations etc.  

Because Islamophobia, antiblack racism and antisemitism (when it comes from the political Right) are the holy trinity of college liberals. The taboos you don’t violate by going against groupthink lest you be expelled from the community as a heretic.

They’re more then happy to criticize all branches of American Christianity for its failings when it comes to issues such as sexism or LGBTQ peoples. But when it comes time to talk about Islam and the Middle East? Suddenly these men and women who were thundering from the pulpit turn quiet as a church mouse, start shuffling their feet, looking down at their shoes, mumbling something about “well it’s a very complicated topic and really it’s not as bad as people think it is”. The same liberals that will denounce how “Christian” America forces itself on a secular nation, how we need stricter laws to separate church and state will denounce you as a neocolonialist and a racist if you criticize a countries in the middle east whose constitutions explicitly frame it as an **Islamic** and the extremely blurry boundaries between politicians and religious leaders.

Go to google scholar and you’ll see the vast chasm between topics. Even niche topics where you’d figure “this has to be unequivocally condemned”. For example, take the 2015\2016 sexual assault attacks in Cologne Germany by migrants from the middle east. You’ll find more papers talking around it, disputing the events, criticizing anyone who brought it up as being islamophobic or saying “BUTWHATABOUTGERMANMEN??” rather than sincerely explore the reasons why those migrants did it. Does anyone honestly think that the situation would be the same if a bunch of white frat bros visiting a Muslim country went on a rampage during Ramadan?

I know that’s outside the US but within it there aren’t that many papers on antisemitism on the Left. And those that do exist aren’t particularly well read or come with a bunch of throat clearing and equivocations. 

Go to any of the academic subreddits here. There’s very few threads or posts discussing the protests and the ones that are usually turn hostile and contentious. With most liberal non-jews sneering derisively at the idea of a few bad eggs being used as a cudgel for “Israeli propaganda”. The same people who would have likely said when Donald Trump was in office “ONE NAZI AT YOUR RALLY MAKES IT A NAZI RALLY”"

This is more of a peeve for me, but could be an unpopular opinion. Ben Shapiro and Rachel Zegler are the two famous examples that come to mind. The former utters certain key words in weird tone for emphasis that makes my skin crawl, and the latter's infamous ""Weird, weird"" is a prime example of this phenomenon that I see people bring into conversations everyday.

I disagree with this assertion however, I think that there is a double standard being shown towards Israel. You don’t see major news outlets calling criticism of Saudi Arabia and Iran “Islamophobic”, even though they are both majority Muslim and are under Sharia Law. This is pretty much common sense because we know how to separate a governing body from a religion, even if one is primary composed of the other.

I think the main reason for this conflation between criticism of Israel and anti-semitism is, at the end of the day, primarily for political reasons. The people most adamantly pushing this belief that criticizing Israel is anti-Semitic are, more often than not, from nations that turn a blind eye to Israel’s colorful track record of crimes against humanity. This false depiction of Israeli criticism and anti-semitism as synonymous ultimately only benefits the institutions (Israeli government, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, the Biden Administration, etc) profiting off the current bombardment and expulsion of Palestinians in Gaza.

1,2023-11-19,CMV: The Western countries' support of the indiscriminate bombing campaign of Israel in Gaza is making me reconsider my heretofore uncritical support for Ukraine.,u/manilaspring,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17ypmky/cmv_the_western_countries_support_of_the/,changemyview,"When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 I was one of those who ardently supported Ukraine and followed the stories of heroic Ukrainian resistance. I was one of those who argued for all countries to support Ukraine in its righteous defense of its own territory and national patrimony. I viewed Russia, and still do, as an imperialist Mafia-like state bent on recreating the Soviet Union through genocidal means. 

I cheered the West for supporting Ukraine unreservedly, both morally and materially. I was glad that my own country (the Philippines) spoke out against Russia's aggression and cut off the helicopter deal with the Russians that was done under Rodrigo Duterte's term. I was ready to suffer the high inflation that came about because of the war, because I would rather that Russia not have the upper hand in this conflict. (Even a small inflation rate increase hits Philippine citizens hard.) I followed several Ukrainian content creators and commiserated with their plight. After all, the Philippines experienced such a genocidal invasion by Japan in World War II. 

Fast-forward to Oct. 7, 2023, the day when Hamas attacked Israel. Like many people, I also spoke out against Hamas' actions and condemned their genocidal attack. I also expressed my support for Israel's  desire to secure each hostage taken by Hamas, even though I do not respect Netanyahu and his Duterte-like government. I, however, disagreed that Israel needed to bomb Gaza from the air. I hoped that the Israeli government and the IDF would decide on combined-arms operations that did not include aerial bombings as well as espionage inside Gaza.

I was taken aback by many Ukrainians uncritically supporting Israel. The same people who I believed were heroic in defending their country from imperial aggression, who were victimized by Russian bombings of residential areas in cities such as Kharkiv and Kyiv, were now lending support to the bombing of residential areas in Gaza. And they would give some justification for it, like Hamas emplacing rocket launchers in residential areas and similar talking points employed by Israeli right-wingers. 

Also, I was shocked to see many Westerners who have Ukraine flags on their bios and socials applauding the bombings and supporting Israel's collective punishment operation uncritically. These people would gaslight critics of Israel and ask if they ""supported Hamas"" when any support of Hamas was obviously off the table, for moral reasons. 

At this point, I feel betrayed and duped into thinking that the vast majority of Ukraine supporters online and in tri-media support Ukraine on moral grounds, when they offer uncritical support for the Israeli bombing campaign (and not just the imperative of rescuing the hostages). People saying ""It's unfortunate collateral damage"" and leaving it at that, without calling for a less murderous option. It's clear to me that there is a kind of moral hypocrisy they employ here, just because Israel is geopolitically aligned with the West and Hamas (not Palestine) is an Iran stooge, Iran having participated indirectly in the invasion of Ukraine (i.e. on the Russian side).

Therefore, I've decided to stop actively voicing my support for Ukraine's counteroffensives. I still believe that Ukraine is right to defend its territory and people from Russian aggression, but I'm throwing my hands up and becoming a noncommittal spectator. My actual position is that Ukrainians and Palestinians both deserve freedom from imperial aggression by Russia and Israel respectively, they certainly don't deserve to be bombed from the air just because the aggressor thinks they have the power to exact collective punishment. There's definitely some room left for elaboration there, so you may help me to clarify it in the comments. Thanks!          "

This is an undoubtedly an despicable practice, to be expected from a terrorist group like Hamas. However, I don’t think that this justifies killing those “shields”. Because they are not actually shields, which are inanimate objects, they are people with lives and loved ones and they don’t want to die. 

My reasoning is quite simple, if a terrorist hid in your family’s home and dared the authorities to burn the house which would incinerate your parents, spouse, siblings and children, you would oppose it. And in actual fact if Hamas were using Israeli or American communities as shields, people and governments would not acquiesce to bomb their homes. We only see Gazans as “shields” eligible for destruction because their not “our people”. I’m proposing that we treat every family as though it were precious, because it is. 

Of course, someone will say, “Hamas started this and they must be brought to justice!” And I agree wholeheartedly with that sentiment. But this is not the way. Killing children and innocents is always unjust and, it actually gives Hamas what it wants as illustrated by this [quote below](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2023/1115/War-in-Gaza-Has-Hamas-achieved-its-aims-against-Israel):

It is based on the presumption that history is a combination of ""his"" and ""story"" and paints a picture of a society dominated by MEN and THE PATRIARCHY. I am no expert of etymology by any means, but it is so FUCKING obvious that this is not the origin of the word history. I am somewhat fluent in French and in French, the word for history is ""histoire."" The word for his in French is ""son,"" ""sa,"" or ""ses"" depending on the gender of the object in question. So in French ""histoire"" has nothing to do with their words for ""his."" English was heavily influenced by French, and I'm assuming the similarities between ""history"" and ""histoire"" are a product of this. The word has nothing to do with ""his."" It is merely a coincidence. Using ""herstory"" is based on ignorance and stupidity and false presumptions about etymology that could easily be reversed by a Google search (I just googled the etymology of history and guess what, I'm right.) Anyways, if a feminist thinks a word is inherently linked to the male gender, why flip it around and link it back to the female gender? How is that less sexist? Makes no sense.

Breaking the law should always have consequences because even though revolutionaries believe their crimes will bring a better society, if everyone thought like that we would live an very dangerous society.

Nonetheless, several important figures in world history commited several crimes to instigate change and are still wildy celebrated. This leads to some modern day activists denying their criminal activity just because ""it's for the good of society"" and I do believe that weakens the cause.

Thinking about it, I believe whenever you commit a crime, even a in a revolution context you should do willing accepting the consequences (that can be lighter in a the new setting if you've succeeded) but still by subject to trial after the revolution happens.

I am therefore not saying crimes like public disobedience, for example, shouldn't be glorified. I see value in anyone willing to face the consequences for their actions while instigating change, in my opinion it means they really believe in it. Denying that civil disobedience is not a crime because is for the good of society, for example, is what tickles my nerve."

> no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.

https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-5/

So, the founders put two un-repealable clauses in the Constitution: an un-repealable temporary clause allowing for the slave trade up to 1808, and an un-repealable and permanent clause allowing for representation in the Senate.

I believe they should have made more of the Constitution un-repealable. For this thread, I would like to focus on our First Amendment rights, including the rights of freedom of speech, the press, religion, assembly, and petition. I think these rights should have been made un-repealable, particularly if the right to representation in the Senate was made un-repealable.

To be clear, I am offering a thesis with two aspects, here: 

1. The first aspect of the thesis is that, given their premises and assumptions, the founders should have made these rights un-repealable. 

2. The second aspect is that in itself, it is desirable and good for a Constitution to state that these rights may not be repealed.

You can challenge either of these, and to be frank, I'm probably more likely to change my view on the first aspect than the second.

Now that in itself is certainly nothing surprising to me. I love eating ass, but...but on this night...it was different - nothing was able to stop me. I became something entirely different. I was an abomination, void of any human decency and filled only with lust. Buttlicking lust...

...You see, on this particular night, my soul wove a web - a bond if you will - between her shitpipe and my taste buds.

For the sake of imagery, my female companion is a married, early 30s, thicc, latina/pacific islander, mother of two. Not a glammed-up club tramp type of thicc, but a nature-in-its-purest-form thicc. Large breasts, stretchmarked from the days of nursing her young, and riddled with blue, vascular, battle scars from the War on Time. Thick, gelatinous, thighs...decorated with cellulite and fat - a waterbed for my face, as I would soon find out. Her stomach - chubby, slightly drooping, a monument to 2 pregnancies-worth of baby fat. Lots of tattoos on her back, thighs, and arms. Silky brown hair. She was a goddess. My goddess. Made perfect through imperfection. A mother. A human being...

I was fascinated with her physicality and sexuality. Her husband permitted me to penetrate and soil the interior of his soulmate. This wasn't a cheating woman. Her man liked seeing her be sexually appreciated as he lulled off to sleep, right next to us, in the same bed, and alas I was chosen by the gods to provide said appreciation. If she was a regular diner at the Cock Cum Cafe, then I was her on-call maître d', ready at a moment's notice to satiate her gooey, genetic cravings.

My point is, the sex between us was - and still is - otherworldly. By this point in time, we'd been hooking up for almost 2 years already. I explored and traversed every possible inch of all the dark, moist, warm, crevices to be found on this woman's body. Her throat, cunt, and butthole, were all well-acquainted with my lengthy, girthy, meat cylinder. I thought I had seen it all, and done it all, with this lovely feminine specimen...I would soon discover how wrong my assumption was.

On the night of the 2017 Mudmouth Incident, I was fucking m'lady in her shit-shaper, and it got to the inevitable point where eventually my cumbat-hardened, helmeted private was invading deep into enema territory after launching a fullscale ass-ault on Asscrackistan, with the intent to neutralize any weapons of ass destruction...

...Eventually, I noticed there were bits and traces of shit seeping out of her ruined turd-birther, and dripping down into my scrotosphere. Nothing I haven't seen before. Usually, we'd continue our genital collisions until I sprayed her innards with the contents of my balls, and then we would head off to the shower, where our tongues would embrace lovingly as the hot tapwater rinsed away our sins, and her fecal remnants. That's...""usually"" how the sequence of events would go, in that situation.

But there was nothing usual about this night.

As I extracted my pooper trooper from her stench trench - whom, I must add, had honorably served his cuntry long enough for the night - I was hit with a sense of curiosity. I...I needed just one quick taste. A post-coitus assessment, if you will. But with my mouth. I always eat that tight, musky, anus like it's the last supper BEFORE I rod-throttle it, why should I neglect that very same anus after-the-fact?

Without further contemplation, I dove in tongue-first. I figured the small flakes of fecal fallout would pose virtually zero-risk of being detected by my taste-radar.

It took all of 0.2 seconds for my tongue to introduce me to the fullblown flavor of human shit. But I didn't immediately retract my tongue. I was so infatuated by the sexual prowess of my booty-goddess that I just...wasn't fazed. I'm tasting shit, and I'm sitting there unfazed. Because it was her shit.

And that realization suddenly enhanced my enjoyment of the earthy-flavored doo doo crumbs I had lapped up from her puckered, muddy starfish. She tried to shy away and suggested a shower, in the hopes that I hadn't noticed what her digestive tract just told her. I pulled her hips back towards my face. This meal was just getting started.

I plunged my tongue into her shit-shaft, and was greeted with warm, ripe liquids - a fresh mudpie had been baking in her bowels, and my small sample serving from earlier had only further heightened my desire to consume the gastrointestinal essence of this beautiful goddess.

I continued dipping my tongue into the deeper, inner rings of her stink-knot, and lapping up her pre-shit juices, like a hummingbird to the nectar of a flower. Her intestinal water was rancid and foul, yet arousing and delicious. These juices were just her body's way of utilizing the day's fluid intake for the purpose of lubricating her lava-launcher, so that she can deliver her butt-baby with greater ease. It could only be a matter of seconds until...

SHPLERRRP!

A dirty torpedo had been launched from her dookie cruiser and into my mouth, with such trenendous force that my jaws were wedged open by her tangy, mahogany mass. I tightly gripped one end of the nasty nugget to give myself better leverage as I chomped down on the steaming, anal churro, and savored the succulent sauces that gushed from within. This was once food. But now it's this. Chowdery, lumpy, stringy fibrous poop, processed through the intestines of this woman, and left to cook in her juices for a week, before finally being ejected from her turd-tunnel at top speed.

SHGLUG

I swallowed my bite of mudpie. The aroma of excrement floods my nasal passages. I can feel a hot, slippery, mass avalanching down my gullet. This flavor....it's culinary perfection!

SHWEEEEEYURRRSHPLALSHLERP SHLPERRRP!!!

I firmly affix my lips around her potty-pipe, and eagerly catch my warm, dripping, rewards.

SHGULP!

I swallow another butt brownie from my shit shiva, licking the sap off of my lips, and tongue-polishing her mud-shutter as I eagerly await the next batch of nutty nutrition logs to burst forth from her poop piñata.

SHFLERRRRB SHP SPLOP

A chocolate rocket receives clearance to launch from NASSA, as her next payload is unleashed directly down my throat, barely even grazing my teeth as it slithers down towards the beginnings of my intestinal tract, loaded with nutrients and microorganisms that my body can't wait to absorb. I'm greeted with occasional hints of familiar flavors, as I notice pieces of corn, some nuts, bits of tortilla chips, and globs of undigested guac, lodged in various quantities throughout her mud mounds. I hungrily devour her excrement with delight, fortunate to be a part of her fecal fiesta.

SHGL SHGLICK!

Straight down the hatch. I peel apart her big, jiggling ass-cheeks, which had gotten stuck together from all the leftover poop sauce, and I deeply inhale a big whiff of hot, stinky, mom-ass. I press my open mouth harder up against her taint-hole, creating an airtight seal with my lips...

...I pull out a blowtorch and proceed to seal my fate. I begin grafting her sphincter meat to the perimeter of my mouth. The pain is searing. She suddenly breaks down in tears and says this is going too far. I look into her eyes lovingly as I finish perma-welding her poop-pipe to the outskirts of my oral cavity. She suddenly smiles. She's happy again. She looks back into my eyes, affirming she senses my love for her. This was never just a NSA FWB type of thing...I can tell we were meant for so much more. We belong together. Forever.

""Baby,"" she whimpers through tears of joy, ""will you eat my shit forever?""

""Okay,"" I muffled into her cavernous bowels.

SHKLURRRGLE!

She shblarted into my throat, unaware of the internal bleeding her fecal friction was causing her lower intestine. The result was a triple dipper of hot farts, runny doo-doo, and intestinal gore, all surging down my throat with such tremendous volume, resulting in some of the booty-batter going down my windpipe. I'm going to die.

No sense in prolonging the inevitable.

I pull out my trusty 9mm pistol with silencer attachment and red dot sight, and I throw it in the garbage where it belongs.

Then I pull out my silverballers because I'm agent 47 and this is my legacy.

I’m not Hitman. I’m Shitman.

I turn my silverballers towards my face. My lover looks confused. Distraught. Completely shocked and desperate for answers.

There's no time......I squeeze both triggers and blow my brains and skull fragments inwards, towards my throat, and down my windpipe. Miraculously I survive both headshots. Fuck. There goes my easy way out.

I succumb to my fate, and slowly drown on a mixture of ass-blood, anal methane gas, wet doo-doo, and pieces of my own cerebral cortex. My last memory is the crying face of my lover, who will spend the rest of her days with a corpse attached to her shitter. Her farts will never be at full-volume, as they echo down my throat, into the depths of my shitblood-flooded lungs.

I'm a spirit now. I'm floating up and I see my body below me, getting smaller and smaller as I grow distant from it.

I'm ascending towards heaven.

I look above me and see God and Jesus Christ looking back down at me, both of them furiously pounding their pud. We lock eyes, they cum into my soul, and I am granted passage into heaven.

I have lived a fulfilled life."

Apart from the family aspects, when it comes to friendship, women always try to make me feel bad about myself. Let me give you one example. Recently I did a wrong thing to my two other girl friends. I said long before that I will join them in this ""event"", but at a not-so-late moment I told them I cannot make it because I have to go to work at the same time of the so-called event. I don't know when they read my text messages, but then they accused me of notifying it late and that they are surprisingly sad about the fact. One of the girls said she understood the requirements of my work and believed what I said is true (wtf?). After that, the other girl said that because of me, she has to go to another place and that she could not come together with the first girl to the event. I don't know if it's true or not, but I feel like she tried to gaslight me into thinking that I am the culprit of this mess.

Up to this point no one could make me feel bad about myself, but they truly make me sad of how they treated me. I understand that these situations like this are in no ways telling if women is manipulative or not, but the fact that they did happen several times that add up to my ugly feeling about the friendship with women. I too doubt that maybe I am being paranoid or so, but in the end I am conservative to my point of view."

In my personal opinion, routinely and almost ritualistically exposing yourself to extreme levels of violence most likely reduces how jarring it is for you, and over time you'll become desensitized to it.

It seems strange that we don't react anymore to news of horrific violence, and I think that violent video games and TV are to blame."

The real culprit being unknown, the judge sees himself as able to prevent the bloodshed only by framing some innocent person and having him executed. Beside this example is placed another in which a pilot whose airplane is about to crash is deciding whether to steer from a more to a less inhabited area. To make the parallel as close as possible, it may rather be supposed that he is the driver of a runaway tram, which he can only steer from one narrow track on to another; five men are working on one track and one man on the other; anyone on the track he enters is bound to be killed. In the case of the riots, the mob have five hostages, so that in both examples, the exchange is supposed to be one man's life for the lives of five.^[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem#cite_note-Philippa_Foot_1978-1),[2](https://www2.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ362/hallam/Readings/FootDoubleEffect.pdf)

That we know nothing of the five people or the one person makes it abundantly clear that one must not do anything and let the five people die. Had one not been in this situation in the first place, five people would have died anyway.

It also makes one complicit in murder as one had a choice to save 5 people there and then but actively chose not to do so.

86,2023-11-19,CMV: Anti-vaping campaigns would be more effective if they took a more neutral stance,u/Drillix08,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17z1mjk/cmv_antivaping_campaigns_would_be_more_effective/,changemyview,"First off to preface, I think vaping is bad and we should try to get teens to stop vaping. What I am proposing here is what I believe would be a more effective strategy at reducing vaping use compared to what has been done in the past.

The big dilemma when it comes to getting teens to stop vaping is that we want to educate them on the risks and what the best course of action is, but at the same time they also want to be independent and don’t want to be told what to do. So when they’re told that vaping is bad it can often cause them to vape more as an act of rebellion.

What I believe would be a more effective campaign strategy would be one that’s not necessarily anti-vaping but instead takes a more neutral standpoint by being purely informational. Simply show the data and what the science has found, and tell them that it is up to them to decide on whether or not they should vape. Don’t explicitly say that vaping is bad, let them come to that conclusion on their own.

If they are no longer interested in vaping, good. If they don’t care and still want to do it anyway, then that’s ok too. Because what I believe will create better results is the decision coming from them as opposed to it being something someone told them to do. That way they have the opportunity to make the most reasonable decision while still feeling a sense of independence.

I will acknowledge that in practice there likely would be some challenges when it comes to implementing this idea, such as convincing the general public that this would work as it’s a bit of a counterintuitive idea. Not to mention the possibility of vape companies taking action to shut it down if it actually was effective. 

So to change my view you need to convince me that if this type of strategy were implemented (assuming it doesn’t get prevented or shut down by any third parties), would not be a more effective way of reducing vaping usage among teens."

Usually family talk look like there always discussions about ""what should you do"", ""what if you would have done this""... In short, we always talk about the possibility of ""how you would have lived your life"".  
When I hear these discussions, 2 hypotheses always come to mind:  
1) Stay home and make a family: in my hometown, while I'm working as an employee, create my own company and become independent.  
Many friends who live like this are happy and married and enjoy the sociality of the family. The level of education is lower. The net income of the company 100k/1M.  
2) Go abroad and make a career: Gain experience outside your hometown, whether in the same country or abroad.  
Friends with higher education, degree or master's degree, with careers as employees at home or abroad, who, having reached the age of 35, struggle to start a real family, because they had to focus on ""career"", have a very wide social circle, but they are all ""friends"" or ""colleagues"" in a superficial way. Net employee income 30k/50k or <100k.  
Having seen my grampa, who just worked his entire life as a simple employee, but managed to make a beatiful family, mantaning social circles, and just have a super happy life, my goal is to start a family and have children, build a social circle, discover the world. I have always oriented myself towards the first, as the second, although I could meet people, have experiences, it all seems too ""at the mercy of companies"" , ""looking for company promotion""... You just are in this new world that change, but you can't just build a family?

1,2023-11-19,CMV: K-pop and K-drama are problematic,u/Andsoitbegins0,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17z1zdz/cmv_kpop_and_kdrama_are_problematic/,changemyview,"K-pop and Korean shows are overrated and the government of South Korea should stop being obsessed with promoting them, the South Korean president is going too far with promoting K-pop and K-dramas he even promoted K-pop and K-dramas in the US during his Congress speech and because of him a lot of K-dramas that failed in South Korea are flooding Netflix.  
  
1- Xenophobia : It is a xenophobic industry that do not give main roles to actors of mixed descent a senior told a half Chinese aspiring actress that as she was half-Korean, if she pursued an acting career then the best she could hope for was a supporting role on a TV show, also K-dramas have a lot of singers turned actors and as we know most singers are bad actors.  
  
2- Forced soft power: The South Korean government takes advantage of the popularity of K-dramas and K-pop to heighten economic interest and improve the national image rather than to support the development of culture itself, The South Korean government spent millions on promoting K-dramas and K-pop for a lot of years probably for 15 years and the reason more K-dramas are flooding Netflix is because of the South Korean president met the CEO of Netflix Ted Sarandos. Japanese TV shows, films and anime....etc were made for the Japanese market that gained popularity outside of Japan, while South Korean music and television are supported by the South Korean government to promote tourism, products and improve national image, Japanese government do not want to invade all streaming services and foreign television channels  with j-pop and Japanese drama.  
  
4 - The cultural appropriation of African American culture and fashion of Black people: , K-pop music is mostly Afro-American music (Hip hop, R&B, Soul, Jazz, trap....etc) yet they call it Korean culture and most of the fashion of K-pop idols is like the fashion of Afro-American musicians and rappers yet they call it Korean fashion and most of K-pop dance is choreographed by Americans based on hip hop dance despite stealing Black culture and calling it Korean culture South Korea is one of the most racist countries in East Asia against dark skinned people,  
  
5- Most K-pop songs are rewritten Korean versions of unreleased Scandinavian songs sung by unknown European demo singers, a lot of kpop songs were originally demos written for American singers, if these demos were released by Scandinavian singers, lyrics would be better and original and instrumentals closer to the demo and more catchy.

6- The treatment of K-pop idols such as exploitation of teens, homophobia."
1,2023-11-19,CMV: There are more distinct sounds than there are distinct colors,u/qwert7661,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17z23y9/cmv_there_are_more_distinct_sounds_than_there_are/,changemyview,"I'll assume some basic knowledge about color & sound theory as well as mathematics.

Firstly, there are obviously infinitely many distinct colors and sounds (theoretically, anyway: there may be physical constraints that render finite the number of possible distinct colors and sounds, and if there are, they aren't material to the view at hand). I argue that the quantity of distinct sounds is some order of infinity greater than the quantity of distinct colors, for a reason akin to the reason that there are more real numbers than natural numbers, though I don't claim specifically that colors are ""countably infinite"" and sounds are ""uncountably infinite.""

The argument is this:

Colors range across three spectra: hue, saturation, and value. Every distinct color can defined in terms of these three coordinates, as though assigning it a point along three axes. Thus colors are composed of ""three infinities"" - three real number lines.

Sounds range across *at least* three spectra analogous to those across which color ranges. These are timbre, pitch, and volume, respectively corresponding to hue, saturation, and value. Whether these spectra are properly analogous is not crucial. What the analogy shows is that sounds are composed of at least ""three infinities"".

However, this model of sonic distinction is overly simplified. In particular, *timbre* is not appropriately modeled as a single spectrum. Timbre is the concatenation of overtones - sounds of different pitches heard simultaneously to produce a unique timbre. These overtones are what give humans and instruments unique voices, such that a saxophone can be distinguished from a piano, despite playing the same note at the same volume. It is inappropriate to characterize timbre as a single spectrum because distinctions in timbre are not orderly. One cannot quantify timbre in the same way one can quantify hue, saturation, value, pitch, or volume. Hence, sounds can be distinguished by at least one order of infinity more than colors can be, and so there are more sounds than colors.

I anticipate the following counterargument: in my analysis of timbre I have illicitly conflated what really are many *different* sounds occuring simultaneously, and I thereby cheat by counting many sounds as though they are one. If I randomly splattered many colors of paint on a canvas and called the whole thing ""one color"", I'd be equally wrong.

I disagree. We perceive amalgamations of colors as just that - amalgamations of separate colors. We do not perceive timbre as an amalgamation of separate sounds, but as a unity, perhaps entirely because sound is given temporally, whereas color stands atemporally. While it may be possible to analyze timber as the concatenation of separate sounds, this does not describe the way we *perceive* sound. And, because sound and color alike exist only as perceptions (being objectively ""nothing more than"" physical waves), to discard the perception of timbre as a unity is to discard sound altogether. In truth, a single note from a piano is *one* sound, albeit a sound that has its distinct nature by virtue of a contatenation of many sounds. From the many, one. And because sound, and *not* color, yields ""from the many, one"", there is at least one order of infinity more sounds than colors."

This is just a tendency I've noted listening to people stories about their experience with mental health field and my own. There are literally people who deem themselves human people, but could not show you even a bit of remorse and understanding and communicate with you. In my case there were few people who would just ask me questions like ""Do you sleep well? Do you eat well?"". One of them didn't say anything to me when I cried right in front of him. The other one was just asking polite questions and writing something about me while I was patiently looking at the wall.

Its been a debate in my mind ever since I've first visited psychiatrist. Although I've discovered that there was a lot more to the world than just going to school, playing video games and looking at politics, that there are fields who is researching human soul and help understand feelings of each, I could never accept the fact that there are professional taught by official institutions that could just sit there and listen to you without responding anything, ""analyzing"" you and making you explore your own problems, coldly giving you an opinion from the side, could be of any good to people who seek it.

The one thing that finally pushed me to create this post is Carl Rogers quote: ""Objectifying people is detrimental to the cause of psychotherapy. Psychiatry could treat biological illnesses, but it has no power against psychological ones""

The thing is, I have no issue them treating biologically ill people. These disorders could be classified and understood within a statistical dimension. But what about people? Do you think it is okay to just give out drugs and diagnosing somebody, coldly writing something in your notebook or using knowledge you gained from descriptive psychiatry books? Is it okay to treat people as objects, thinking you may describe them like they are something for sure you have seen alrwady in those books? Should there be a strictly cold, medical approach in a field that's concerned with people's mental health?"

The side effects are 

1. a masculine face

3. A deeper voice 

4. Hair loss

142,2023-11-19,CMV: Telling students that something is difficult to learn is a much better encouragement to them than telling them that that thing is easy.,u/SteadfastEnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17z3czu/cmv_telling_students_that_something_is_difficult/,changemyview,"(Disclaimer: The only subject I've taught in school is English, as a teacher for refugee students in Buffalo, NY. I can't claim any expertise in teaching math or anything else.)

In the past few decades, there has been a big ""\_\_\_\_ is easy!"" movement. *Calculus is easy, anyone can learn it! Physics is easy! Quantum mechanics is easy! Arabic is easy!* etc.

IMHO, this has good intention, but in fact does students a great disservice. The intention behind this movement may be to encourage students and make them think that something isn't as daunting as they fear, but it often backfires and leads to exactly the opposite effect.

The reason is this: When you tell students that something that is difficult is ""easy,"" you're setting them up for even more humiliation, frustration and inferiority when they find, inevitably, that that subject is not easy. Linear algebra is not easy. Mandarin Chinese is not easy. When these students run into difficulties, they now feel even more like a dummy because they were told by the teacher that it was easy and they think, ""I'm so stupid that I can't even do this easy thing.""

On the other hand, if you tell students that those subjects are difficult, you not only brace them for the challenges that will come, but give them even more of a sense of pride and accomplishment if or when they scale the mountain. Now, when they run into difficulty and frustration, it's par for the course, so they can accept it much better without their self-esteem taking a hit. (""This is brutally hard, but the teacher told me it would be brutally hard, so I'm not inferior for struggling. Struggling is expected!"")

Now, of course, there are ways that a tough subject - be it complex math, Farsi, organic chemistry - can be simplified and taught in an easier-to-comprehend way. But that's not the same as the subject being easy. We should never tell students that something difficult is not difficult, because we set them up for a huge self-esteem blow when they find that it is in fact difficult."

&#x200B;

Things like:

*  political beliefs (democracies ,republics, and dictatorships); or
* economic ideals (capitalism, socialism, communism); or
* religious beliefs

they should all be put on the back burner of our collective attention until the world we live in, the world we CURRENTY need to survive on, is in perfect health and is suitable for us to HAVE these different concerns. I am talking about we disregard our history of conflicts and work together to come with objectively good solutions that will fix the world even if those solutions would be detrimental for human societies for one generation, two generations, or even three generations. if the solutions (done right) would create a world that would benefit human societies for ten generations.

im talking we devote our time energy and resources to clean energy like nuclear fission and HOPEFULLY soon Fusion power, 

we rework our food industry so that we don't produce millions of methane farting livestock every year.

we steer away from plastics and other non-biodegradable materials. 

heck maybe even put some time and energy into learning how to control the weather better. we have cloud seeding (which i know has a lot of problems) but I'm saying it might be productive in the future to develop better technology for controlling the weather.

here is an example of how i currently see the world and how we are behaving:

Three men are trapped in a room and none of them can escape, three men are arguing about where to put the flatscreen tv, suddenly the trashcan is set on fire and while it is small now, if nothing is done it would get bigger and destroy the room and kill everybody inside. 1 guy wants to put out the fire now BEFORE it gets too big but the other two guys say they arent going to deal with the fire UNTIL they figure out where to put the flatscreen T.V.  obviously the thing that is in EVERYONES best interest is to put out the fire but these two guys couldnt care less about the fire because they REALLY want  the T.V. to be in the spot in the room. to me this feels like insanity to me.

In this sense, students should be educated on how to deal with AI and use/manipulate it as chances are their future careers are gonna be heavily impacted by the tool of AI. AI is a tool, not an enemy used for cheating. I honestly don't care if a student uses AI to help write their English essay or whatever, it's their loss for not honing their creative skills.

As long as both parties are consensual and have a written contract, the duel only affects the consensual parties, a lawyer explains their risks and rights, and both have the opportunity to back off until the duel starts, then why the hell should the government interfere between the grievances of individuals, that stays between individuals? Have some common sense legislation, of course: no minors, both must be 100% sober, both parties must have a registered lawyer to explain the rights and risks involved, no obligation to accept, any duel that could have a fatal result must have wills written by both sides and waivers written by family stating that they will not sue the other party or retaliate in any way except with another duel, waiving the right to any publicly-funded healthcare, etc etc. I also specified the United States, which does not have a universal healthcare system that has to deal with injuries incurred by duellists. 

I genuinely think this is a good idea. First of all, the process is long and pretty annoying, which means most people won't bother with it anyway. Secondly, it will not meaningfully affect the everyday life of Americans. You are under no obligation to accept a duel, but if you do choose to accept, you must hire a lawyer, who could probably talk you out of it. Third, it might reduce collateral damage from the rampant violence today. Some gangsters have a problem with each other, they duel it out in a controlled space and nobody else gets hurt. A man finds his wife with another dude, they duel it out to get rid of the hurt feelings. Finally, this won't incur any more cost to the government. All of this will be paid by the duellists: hiring their lawyers, getting government certification that their place is safe to duel in, etc etc.

And i have observed that the higher the ratio of females and the lower the ratio of males in a group the more peaceful the group is.  
The more males you have and the less females you have the worse. Fighting will ensue.  
This is also observable before and after wars, when after a long conflict that kills mostly males. Society becomes relatively peaceful, until the numbers of males are restored back and tensions start again.  
So i debated with my friends this issue. And they told me that ""Oh but females and males are the same ratio 50/50"". ""What do you mean there are more males than females.""  
I didnt say that. I said that that despite the 50/50 ratio, nature purposefully spawns more males than we need so to create competition between males.  
I have concluded that the best proportion of males to females for overall happiness is 10/20% males to 80% females.  
In this ratio we will barely see any conflicts or tension. But the problem is nature and biology doesnt want that. Biology wants males to compete, and destroy each other, so that only the strongest survive.  
Things seem balanced on a surface level when we mention the 50/50 ratio. But when you look deeper into it. Even sperm cells are millions, and the egg is only one, so all those other sperm cells will die, and only one sperm cell gets to reach the egg. Even there, there is an obvious and deliberate imbalance. Males start competiting before they even are born (before they reach the egg).  
Did anyone else noticed this? I welcome debate too, if you have good arguments coming from an unbiased and rational position... I dont particularly appreciate what im saying here, and i wish reality was different than this, just like you, so pls dont blame for reaching these conclusions."

Political Science:
Like it or not politics influence everything. Having a basic understanding of the process let’s you be more engaged and understand how certain events might impact you directly.

History:
Knowing how things got to be where they are helps you make informed decisions about the future. Everything didn’t magically come into existence overnight. Things that happened centuries ago are still directly impacting today’s society, so it’s crucial to have a basic understanding of this. Also helps with understanding ongoing problems that could have a major impact on humanity(cough climate change cough).

Science:
Teaches research skills and gives a basic understanding of how the universe works. It teaches you how to document and keep track of your findings and peice together information to understand how things work.

Philosophy:
Teaches you how to think. Everything isn’t black and white, and having reasoning skills to work through tough problems can be useful in literally any aspect of life. It also exposes you to ideas you aren’t comfortable with which is something too many people nowadays aren’t equipped to deal with.

Art/Music:
Imagine for a second where we would be without these things. The world would be a dark, dreary place. It’s easy to dismiss the impact of the arts which is why it’s vital that we expose as many people to them, at least on a basic level, as we can.

Obviously when I say mandatory, I mean mandatory after death. I also think opt-out is okay.   
  
For context I am a proud organ donor who is a young woman. I hope I don’t die young, but if I do I want to help others rather then have my organs go to waste. I registered as an organ doner when I was 16 when I got my driver’s license. In America you have to choose to be an organ doner and the default is to not be one. In my view this is wrong.  
  
According to the American Transplant Foundation, 18 people die every day in the United States for want of an organ transplant, and some 122,344 people are waiting for a donated organ. Changing U.S. policies so that people’s organs are automatically donated when they die—rather than requiring people to “opt in” to donating their organs while they are still alive—will lead to more organ donations and more lives saved.  
  
In countries such as Austria, laws make organ donation the default option at the time of death, and so people must explicitly “opt out” of organ donation. In these so-called opt-out countries, more than 90% of people register to donate their organs. Yet in countries such as the U.S.A, people must explicitly “opt in” if they want to donate their organs when they die. In these opt-in countries, fewer than 15% of people register. I think far more then 15% of Americans would want to save a life with their organs after death.  
  
Mandatory donation would largely increase the pool of donors. The lives of many people waiting for a transplant would be saved. Automatic organ donation after death would speed up the process of transplantation and contribute to save lives, as doctors would not need to verify the consent status of potential donors.  
  
It should be mandatory to be an organ doner, unless you explicitly choose to not be one. Change my view."

My 2 main examples are fast food and alcohol, fast food is horrible for you and food addiction is a very real thing. Obesity has been increasing in developed countries for years and especially in the United States. You can’t go through a commercial break without seeing a fast food advertisement and it’s next to impossible to live in any city without having quick access to a plethora of fast food options all of which are bad for you. I’ve seen Uber eats, DoorDash, grubhub and even SkipTheDishes advertised. It’s even hit the kids as damn near every child I know treats McDonald’s like crack for kids. 

The same goes for alcohol it’s advertised all over the place and even accessible in millions of households with kids present, it is addictive as well and has ruined many lives. What makes gambling so much worse than all the other things we have being advertised? At least with gambling there is usually a barrier to entry like age and actual casinos not being readily available at every corner. Gambling just like alcohol or fast food won’t hurt you in moderation but there is a lot of people who are against it being advertised."

335,2023-11-19,CMV: There is no reasonable justification for the incredibly high civilian death toll in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war,u/Dense-Kangaroo8696,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17zdr3r/cmv_there_is_no_reasonable_justification_for_the/,changemyview,"I’ve been watching the conflict unfold, as many of us have, with horror at what seems to be a conflict that either primarily hurts, or primarily targets, Gazan civilians. Civilian deaths primarily seem to come from the direct targeting of civilian infrastructure, including refugee camps, apartment buildings, hospitals, schools, mosques, and even evacuation convoys. 

Each time a civilian target is hit, the general IDF justification seems to be that Hamas was using civilians as human shields. However, frequently the IDF will either claim they were targeting only a single Hamas fighter in an attack that was obviously bound to kill scores of civilians (the first attack on the Jabalia Refugee Camp, for instance), and/or there are no Hamas casualties substantiated after the attack, either by the IDF or by human rights orgs (Amnesty International lists a number of prominent attacks that seemed to have no discernable political targets: https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/10/damning-evidence-of-war-crimes-as-israeli-attacks-wipe-out-entire-families-in-gaza/#:~:text=As%20Israeli%20forces%20continue%20to,be%20investigated%20as%20war%20crimes).

Seeing this, I’ve generally come to the conclusion that:

1. Israel is either willing to accept extreme, easily avoidable or unnecessary civilian casualties to kill individual Hamas fighters or 
2. Targeting civilians is actually an intentional part of Israeli military strategy in this conflict 

I will also note that these casualties dont exactly seem to be producing successful mission outcomes: the command center in Al Shifa seems to be nonexistent, and  the number of Hamas fighters killed seems to be quite low for the carnage so far (I think the IDF claimed around 1000 last time I checked?). The hostages are also, mostly, still without a safe guarantee of coming home.

In the end, none of this seems justifiable to me. 

However, I realize that there are many people out there who feel strongly that the war is necessary, justified, and even good. I want to challenge myself and try to see things from a side that, right now, seems very difficult for me to understand. Please give me a run for my money, give me your best arguments, and show me what I have missed."

1,2023-11-20,CMV: Paid maternity and paternity leave is not fair for people who don't want and can't have children,u/ibanker-stoner,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17zhm3m/cmv_paid_maternity_and_paternity_leave_is_not/,changemyview,"Being in a corporate job for the past 10yrs I have observed many new parents and most often ultra-religious parents take 2-4 paid months off at a time year after year for their newly born children. When they come back ive observed some say, mostly from the dads, that it was challenging but a nice mental break from work. I just observed two Mormon dads at my company, who I know don't take on any of the household labor at home, take 4 paternity leaves within a period of 4yrs and come back fully recharged and ready to work while the people without children never got that chance to recharge. I don't have a problem with parential leave but I do have a problem with American corporation's not offering the same paid leave opportunities to child free parents. 

I understand being a parent is hard work and not an easy task but that was their choice go become parents so why should they be the only ones allowed to take months off fully paid forcing the rest of the workforce forced to pick up their responsibilities and increase their workload while they are out on leave? Why should workers who ethically wont or physically can't have children not be afforded the same mental breaks and rest from corporate wage slaving?  These policies end up putting more stress on the remaining employees while allowing the parent (mostly fathers) some time to detach and recharge mentally from work while the rest of the employees burn out. I just don't understand as a woman why this allowed and why people who don't want kids are never allowed to take months off to recharge? I'm selectively leaving woman out of the argument above because as a woman I also understand woman need time to recover physically and end up doing the majority of the parenting so its more understandable they need time off medically and to provide child care for the baby. That being said it's still not fair if a woman who decides not to have kids is paid the same as a woman who decides to have a multiple babies year after year with months off at a time. 

I want to be more empathetic but I'm burning out whenever someone on my 4 person team goes out for paternity/maternity leave multiple times within a short time period and the rest of the team is forced to pick up their responsibilities. I know some of this frustration should be placed on the corporations and I would like to bring it up as a complaint but after speaking with some trusted family members they highly advise me to stay quiet and let it continue. Does anyone else feel this way or want to attempt to change my mind?

Edit: this is not an attack or frustration with new parents, this is a frustration with American corporation's accepted beliefs and work standards unfairness to childfree workers. I don't think we should take away parental leave but I do believe everyone should be given the same amount of time for paid leave if offered for parents regardless of if they want children or not."
3,2023-11-20,CMV: A fully independent Palestinian state will never exist.,u/ThadtheYankee159,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17zhujm/cmv_a_fully_independent_palestinian_state_will/,changemyview,"This is not to say that I oppose the existence of such a state, rather, I simply believe that with the current trajectory of events, it will not be possible. Due to shifting demographics in Israel, it’s likely that more nationalistic and pro-expansion elements will steadily gain more and more power. At the same time, with continued Western Support, Israel will feel more and more confident in fully removing Palestine as an entity. The settlements will grow in size, and eventually the West Bank will be annexed. This rise in expansion will pressure more and more Palestinians to support more radical actors like Hamas, and these attacks will justify further Israeli actions. Eventually, the last of the Palestinians in the region will be forced to accept Israeli citizenship or be expelled. And the goal of having a state from “The River to the Sea” will occur, but not one most advocates of it would want. 

I can see the counterarguments, mainly being that the Palestinian regions of Gaza and West Bank could be organized into a state. The problem is that such a state would be an impoverished place with little economy and likely unstable government. Even if this state had the backing of the West, the previous demographic pressures in Israel would still push destabilization and settlement in the area, thus encouraging support for radicals, and thus generating the cycle again and again."

Let's say someone wanted to take over Nauru, a tiny island country in the pacific. Seems highly easy, no? You could take it a notch further to the US or Israel. Have teams already positioned in critical cities to swarm it after a Beirut-sized blast disorients it, then encircle the capital. Perhaps if you anticipate combat, hundreds of ""pods"" (taking cues from the hunger games here yes I just ready mockingjay) could be put in critical areas ranging from a blast a third the size of the Beirut Blast to a gas release of deadly chemicals that casts a wide net - helps to avoid stalemates, I spose. Now I don't mean you have an army in LA and you are moving slowly to Washington, that's bound to lose. I mean more if you had your army everywhere at once and launched a surprise attack on the capital where everything was let loose and you swarm the whole thing in less than a minute. 

Sure, not enough to invade superpowers like the US or China, but smaller countries? Hmm. Perhaps.

Then I will say extremely vile things about West --- some of which stems from my bias as someone who lives in Iran and has grown up hating them, so content warning.

Iran is inherently mixed genetically. My mom's family has a Thracian root so --- and I have 4 aunts, 5 with my mom, and these five:  
1- brown hair, white skin  
2 and 3- blond hair, white skin  
4- black hair, brown skin  
5- brown hair, black skin  
That's just 5 of my aunts. I have 3 uncles, one ha white skin, one has brown skin, one ha daaaark skin --- but he works outside but the dude's black as tar in my mom's wedding photos so I posit he's been always a tarboy.

  
[Here's](https://imgur.com/a/0gfFvWk) a picture of me when I was 1. Notice that I'm like a well-done bread. I am not a ghost-faced white person, and not a rye-faced brown person. I am 'just right'.  
So, Westerners, are you shocked enough yet? This is casual speech in my country but ever since I have came to Western forums back in 2008 when I registered on GTAF (I was RIPER, anyone here remembers me? It was large, remember the culture clash we had?) I realized that Westerners, the idiots that they are, actually associate color of skin with a crude concept such as 'race'. I mentioned GTAF. Back then I did not know the word 'race', I looked it up on a reverse dictionary and I chose the word 'descent' when someone posited that Iranians are Arab --- which is only true if the 2% Arab population of Iran are the only ones left when we nuke out el juden and Pussymerica strikes back (then I swear, the remaining 2% Arabs will end Pussymerica, because we're all Iranian first, then our ethnic groups, I will explain later) --- and back then  REALLY hated Arabs, like I truly hated Arabs because I believed they forced us to convert to Islam. But the truth is more complex than what a 13 yo thinks it is, it's more akin to ""it was a good soap that cleaned my skin until it gave me cancer"" than ""it was a soap that was forced on me by Bedouins"". I now only hate Gulf Arabs but who the hell doesn't.  
The way a mature society like Iran (bring your best insults here, I revel on Westoid rage, it's not a day for me until I make at least one Westoid mad!) treats vague concepts like 'race' compared to a young, immature society like West who were fucking Barbarians until Ceaser fucked them in the butt --- 600 years after we had established our first empire, is this: we differentiate different racial groups based on ethnicity. And what is ethnicity? It's history. It's being one with the land. Like take Kurds as an example. Kurds are certainly shafted, I believe Iran should do away with all this Western nation-state bullshit and come up with a system of itself --- like the 'Shatarbani' system of Achamenids, or why go back that long, the 'velayat' system of Qajarids is better than following Western plans and rules. I really believe Iranians should start hating West they way I do. I don't know why I am wasting my time here instead of preaching to my people to hate Westerners. Anyways. Western societies are extremely recent. They were not civilized fully until the early 1000s. So the little history they had, was wiped out during WWII (and no Holocaust did certainly NOT happen, full me once, Roosevelt, can't fool me twice)

This gets worst in America when a bunch of these Wild Westoids were mixed together in a fondue pot and melted together. I honestly cannot believe that America, this supposedly 'perfect society' (which s actually not perfect, all Western progress is because you raped the niggers and injuns for 400 years, please KYS together, murder-suicide style --- I think you will even fail to do that because you are an inherently low-trust society who hate each other, you will fight over who gets to get killed first until we have to wipe your ass out and rid the world of you scum) still views race in terms of 'skin color'. 

Some are born to sweet delight, some are born to endless night I guess. Westerners were born in darkness, they came into being during the dark ages, and they are still there, doesn't matter what bullshit they have invented, they only managed to do that because they are heartless, materialistic barbarians who plundered the world for centures look for Eldorado. Let me tell you my little westoid, Eldorado is a land where people won't be treated differently because they are tanner than their neighbors. 

Now that you are butthurt go ahead and list all of Islamic Republic's crime for me, I don't care. If someone stands in front of Nathan Wynn the troon and insults Republicans in front of him, it won't make his troon ass anymore aware of the scum that he is. I know I'm scum already and I know Iranian government is far from perfect, and no, it's not your fault, it's ours. It's our fault for buying into your bullsht. We're not fucking niggers and we acted like them --- although thankfully, you failed to colonize us because of how stupid you are, and how smart we are.

But my views on West are not set int stone. Prove me that Westerners, aka you, because  doubt Hashimodo is browsing this cesspit at this moment, are not in fact, scum of the earth.

Thanks. btw I'm on Ritalin that's why I'm so verbal."

1,2023-11-20,cmv: this is the truth.,u/TomTobelerone,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17zkzfb/cmv_this_is_the_truth/,changemyview,"The genesis of our understanding begins in childhood, where interactions outside the family forge a complex web of consequences. Imagine this intricate scenario as a fish tank, with each action akin to a bubbling machine introducing oxygen into the water. The fish, representing individuals, respond to these changes, and this response, whether positive or negative, becomes an irreversible element in the fabric of time.

This ripple effect transcends the immediate, altering the course of the future. It’s a dance of atoms, perpetually changing and rearranging, much like the natural processes of decomposition and subsequent fertilization in a garden. At its essence, this is the constant observation of the transformation of atoms, each change a result of the influence of more atoms.

Delving into the core question of control, we ponder the forces shaping our existence. Is it the government, the minds behind NASA, or perhaps the mysterious entities at Area 51? This inquiry leads to a profound realization – an organization or group molds our thoughts, actions, and development. They dictate our dietary choices, beverage preferences, and even the activities deemed perilous or harmless. In this intricate web of influence, discerning truth from falsehood becomes a labyrinthine task.

The establishment of governments, originally conceived to refine societal norms, now extends its reach to regulate money flow. The Federal Reserve, acting through the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), is a linchpin in steering monetary policy. In this symbiotic relationship, our lives are intricately controlled by a system where money wields unparalleled influence, acting as the equilibrium in the economic cosmos.

Zooming out, we witness the orchestration of the economy, a symphony of households, businesses, governments, financial institutions, labor markets, markets, capital, technology, natural resources, trade, institutions, and economic policies. Money, the maestro, directs this complex ensemble, influencing the very fabric of society.

However, a nuanced perspective on control emerges. As I posited the notion of being ‘controlled by the government,’ a paradox surfaces – would the allure of money not diminish once one amasses enough? This prompts a contemplation of the manipulation of numbers, social content, and perceptions to shape reality. The intricate dance of human psychology enters the stage, where stimuli at specific times can manipulate responses. Those holding the purse strings can sway the influencers of social media and the arbiters of rules and regulations in social enterprises.

This manipulation, however, clashes with the principles of the First Amendment, specifically freedom of the press. Media, ads, and the very structure of society become mere marionettes in the hands of those wielding economic power. The overarching conclusion is clear – the government holds the reins, orchestrating the symphony of our lives.

The concept of free will is thrust into the spotlight, its veracity challenged. A lie, we are told, masked by attributing this illusion of freedom to divine blessing. The orchestration of events, such as virus scares and mask mandates, begins to appear as subtle economic shifts rather than simple health precautions.

Society, a tapestry woven by the government’s hands, molds individuals who, in turn, shape society. Lies, manipulations, and hidden truths conspire to craft specific economic conditions, a grand game to alter the population repeatedly. The idea of true autonomy becomes a distant mirage; we are conditioned and programmed from birth.

Delving deeper into the atomic structure, one wonders if it’s designed for this perpetual flux, engineered to shift and change the world and its constituents. Atoms and DNA, like intricate lines of code, dictate our existence. Originating from the ‘Big Bang nucleosynthesis,’ atoms are the fundamental building blocks in this cosmic dance.

Yet, the concept of ‘when’ becomes elusive when time, a dimension, ceases to be a linear construct. Dimension, quantified in spacetime, necessitates the study of items made up of atoms to comprehend their intricate behavior. Scientists, composed of atoms, delve into this cosmic puzzle, studying the essence of matter to decipher the universe’s nature.

Quantum mechanics, a realm of intricate laws, unfolds. The Schrödinger Equation, electromagnetic interactions, Pauli Exclusion Principle, conservation laws, Bohr Model, and Statistical Mechanics are the intricate instruments in this scientific orchestra.

Zooming into the very components of atoms, we encounter protons, neutrons, and electrons – each playing a distinct role in defining the atom’s identity and behavior. These particles, forming the backbone of matter, pose a paradoxical question – where did they come from?

The ‘Big Bang’ looms large as the origin, an expansion of heat that raises a fundamental inquiry about the energy’s source. My theory takes a philosophical turn – perhaps, after death, we transition from one form of energy to another. The destiny of our consciousness in this transition remains a tantalizing mystery.

As our atoms disband, they transform into chemical energy, dispersing across the universe. The fate of the remaining atoms becomes a cosmic enigma. Yet, one certainty prevails – they dissolve into the vastness of the cosmos, becoming an integral part of the celestial tapestry.

In essence, we are held together by chemical bonds, intricate connections representing potential energy within molecular arrangements. The term ‘chemical potential energy’ or ‘bond energy’ encapsulates this phenomenon, highlighting the delicate equilibrium in these atomic relationships.

Death, in this profound narrative, becomes the unraveling of these chemical bonds that tether us to the mortal coil. It’s a transition, a metamorphosis of energy forms, rather than an endpoint. As our atoms scatter into the cosmic expanse, the universe becomes a canvas where the remnants of our existence paint a story that transcends the boundaries of time and space."

I was quite shocked at how many replies were against it, some people talked about ""tricking"" people, I'm not sure why, informative campaign could be done, is not some complex concept that the average person in the street can't understand. Also I'm not going into the debate on why people would rather have their organs rot in the ground instead of helping a fellow human being, but here's a proposal that I think would reconcile these views:

We keep the system as it is, but if you don't opt-in as an organ donor you go to the bottom of the list if you ever need one. Here are some points that got me to this idea:

* We already give priorities to organ recipients: age, medical history, etc (basically chances of survival) are already taken into consideration when lists are compiled, it's not just first come first served.
* It totally respects individual freedom
* It incentivize much needed organs donation  
* it's fair to people that opted in 

Just to reiterate: I'm not saying that people that are not organ donors DON'T get an organ ever, only that they get a lower score compared to people that opted-in, that's only fair, if you think your organs are too precious to donate even when you're dead, surely you can't expect others to do any differently. Otherwise you're just an HYPOCRITE. It's all about FAIRNESS. 

Now, I'm bias to the argument, my other half has received a kidney and is one of those things that people that haven't been through can't understand what it means to see a loved one getting sick, going through dialysis, going through the long process of getting into a recipient list and finally the long wait. 

Final couple of points: 

I'm sure there're super rare occasions where my POV may create some contradictions, we can discuss them and (as a society) find a solution, I don't believe in discarding good ideas just because they are not so good in the 0.1% of cases.   
Different countries have different protocols for organ donation/transplant. So pointing why it wouldn't work due to a specific law/regulation is a bit of a weak argument. I believe in principle every modern democratic country could implement this idea.

So, *eighty-six percent* of “peaceful” Palestinians either openly or tacitly support massacring, kidnapping, torturing, raping, mutilating, burning, sacrificing, and cannibalizing innocents. So much for peace. Hell, “peace” might as well not be a word in their language. Their very identity revolves around their belief that Jews are evil colonizers that must be slaughtered for the good of the world. They’re no different from Nazis.

The only solution at this point could be a destruction of the concept of an Arab state. So long as Israel and Arab nationalism exist, Palestinians will keep murdering Jews. Occupy them. Annex them. Re-educate them. If that doesn’t work, expel them. It might sound awful, but if that is the only way peace can be achieved, then so be it."

For example, society expects rape victims to have a particular reaction to being raped like they should cry, be numb, be scared, or be embarrassed, which makes it harder for rape victims to process their rape because they will feel like they are an exception to rape victims.

My conclusion is that rape victims would have an easier time processing their rape if society explicitly tells them to feel whatever they want to feel like. Change my view about why society does not necessarily make it harder for rape victims to process their rape."

The abolition of the form of racism manifested on slavery and segregation naturally leads to the fight against systemic racism and anti racism.  
The women's suffragette movement that challenged the sexist structures and attitudes in society naturally leads to the fight against the patriarchal systems and attitudes that dominate society even today.  
The American ideal of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness necessarily leads to a complete freedom of self-determination of the individual which among many things includes a person's freedom to identify with the sex/gender they most feel they align with regardless of what the past systems with their patriarchal and sexist stereotypes might consider.  
Things like these need society to undergo a process of ""decolonization"" by which the structures (and even heroes) of the past that belonged to and propagated oppressive racist and sexist structures are ""dismantled"" and structures that better reflect the melting pot style demographic of the USA and that seek to build a more diverse, equitable and inclusive society should be put in their place.  
So yes, wokeness is not some radical new idea but just the next evolution of the American ideal. "

And there may be ADHD meds but I know people who have ADHD who meds don’t work for. It does not mean that ADHD defines them, at least not in my view. Or a “cancerous person” even if they had incurable cancer. I just wish people saw me as more than a diagnosis because i’m so much more than that. I wish they’d treat it like any other mental diagnosis where they’re like “it’s not who you are”. It shouldn’t be seen as someone’s identity but just a thing they deal with.

Since I first finished it near release, I didn't enjoy the game. I even went back and played it two more times to see if my opinions changed. Some of my opinions did change slightly, but I still found that the story was weak **and** a large step down from Part I's story telling. 

To keep this civil, I want to clarify: 

* I had no expectations for Part II 
* I am not upset that Joel died (Or was killed by a woman) 
* I **do** empathize with Abby 
* I **do not** have an issue that Abby is muscular 
* I **do not** support attacking the VA's, writers or devs who worked on this game. 

To further explain my view, I had issues with the storytelling, the pacing/structure, characters and overall design plan for this sequel. 

The game is clearly designed to begin the player at a very frustrating spot. It **wants** you to hate Abby, hate her friends and convivence you this revenge mission is justified. I'm fine with this as an idea. Love it, actually. The execution with TLOUII is where it failed to deliver. 

Abby *literally* stumbles on Joel the day her group expresses doubt and wants to turn back. 

To continue, Abby is quite a bland character. Her story is designed to be similar to Joel's, but that's the problem. I already have a Joel. Abby needed to offer something I hadn't already experienced with Joel and Ellie. To be perfectly clear, I am referring to her relationship to Yara and Lev. 

The structure is a trainwreck. Time after time, you are pulled from the moment to relive a flashback for context. At the height of tension, the game hard pauses and takes you back three whole days before you continue the story. Obviously, these flashbacks make sense for the context of the current day, but there way too many of them and way they interrupt the story is quite a hurdle. 

I can keep going about the short-comings I had with this game, but I feel this is a good starting point. Feel free to change my view to why this game has a strong story.

Once that is set in, the ball is set rolling and children can go into specific areas of learning based on what they want do in life.

The parents can take them to a library or other area of research and guide them as to what books they can borrow, what projects they can start, etc. 

When they start doing their projects, they'll learn that there's way more they need to learn and they will start learning that because they need it to progress in the project.

So project based learning (Do and learn every day) VERSUS sitting in a chair every day and hearing a teacher go off on some topic while you try to keep focus and just learn whatever you need to pass the exams. 

Is this a better way of doing things? I feel like with this system, people will be more motivated and engaged with what they're learning because the motivation is coming from within (wanting to make progress on their projects). 

On the other hand I feel like most kids will just devolve to playing video games all day or watching TV if you give them this much freedom..........but I also feel like that's more to do with how dangerous media is (it's propensity to immerse people and offer an escape from boredom). If that media was not there, then kids would pursue their projects instead. "

1,2023-11-20,CMV: The Christian God does not exist,u/ChamplainLesser,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17zt75p/cmv_the_christian_god_does_not_exist/,changemyview,"Hello, I am an atheist interested in philosophy. I would like to present my argument for why the Christian God does not exist upon honest analysis of the world we exist within.

I'd first like to talk about Divine Hiddenness. God in the NSRV is given a title, the ""Inescapable God."" In the best sense God is present in all moments, in all times. Happily inescapable. My first argument contend that this omnipresence is demonstrably not offered universally. Specifically I'm making the claim that while not perfectly dispositive of the existence of God, the argument holds little weight when against the explanation provided by naturalism. That argument being of the construction of religion and shifts in cultural beliefs over time as demonstrated via archaeological and historical evidence. It would seem immensely more plausible given the explicit empirical evidence that religion as a whole is a human construct and that different cultures being influenced by various selective pressures in their region and having different cultural values, created different gods and religions. Thus leading to a diversity of beliefs that are predominantly decided by geographic location.

This geographical predictability of religious belief is, in my mind, dispositive--if not of a god's existence--of the all-loving nature of the Christian God. Stephen Matheson has pointed Saudia Arabia is 95% Muslim and therefore 95% theistic but the population of Thailand is 95% Buddhist and therefore at best 5% theistic. This incredible difference in the theistic populations is something that should logically be impossible given the Bible's conception of the Inescapable God. Are the people of Thailand simply 20x more resistant to theism? Are they 20x more stubborn? These claims seem nonsensical with no empirical basis. It would seem troubling if Christianity were true that the geographical location of your birth is heavily predictive of whether or not you will be saved. Some may argue that ""God has a plan for them, they will be saved if they truly have not heard of the Lord..."" etc etc etc, the only issue with this argument is that ""all who come to the Father, do so through me"" - Jesus of Nazareth, circa 27 AD. It would seem that while their claim that God has a plan to save these unwitting nonbelievers appeals to his loving nature, it is directly contested by scriptural evidence.

Likewise, the Inescapable God is a Loving God who desires a relationship with all who wish to know him *and* is specifically present in all moments, in all times to those who wish it. Therefore, why does he not reveal himself to the nonresistant nonbeliever? Those who, if given simply sufficient evidence would believe in and worship him? Surely if God is all knowing and truly loving he would not withhold such evidence from the nonresistant nonbeliever. Similarly, it makes even less sense to claim that God has a plan to save the nonresistant nonbeliever who has heard of, and actively searches for, the Lord so they may know him and never finds him.

Lastly, I contend that the Christian God fails theodicy. To discuss this we must first define what a successful theodicy necessitates. First is the existence of natural evil. Any theodicy posed must adequately account for the natural evils of this world. The typhoons, the earthquakes, the floods, the childhood cancer, Covid, stillbirths, and the list goes on. Secondly it must account for gratuitous suffering. This means accounting for the menial and trivial natural evils that cannot build moral character, are not resultant of a choice made, are effectively meaningless trivialities in the human experience. Lastly is the existence of great moral evils. These are moments like the holocaust, the Palestinian genocide, Rwanda, WW1 repeated with WW2, the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Great, intense evil of a wholly unjustified and saddening proportion as to negatively weigh on the souls of all humanity.  
The Christian God fails this theodicy for having the capacity, explicitly so, to eliminate all natural evils and the unwillingness to intervene to prevent great moral evils. Furthermore, not only did God lack the desire to prevent these atrocities when even his flawed creation recognized the abject horror and evil of these events, he created the conditions allowing them to spawn in the first place with Adam and Eve. The first sin, the fault of God. God being all loving and all powerful and all knowing allowed Adam and Eve to choose evil despite having the explicit capacity to create the universe in which they chose not to eat the fruit through their own free will. An act they were punished for leading to the creation of evil, the greatest of all immoral acts and one who's blame lies squarely on the being who created these conditions when he had the choice not to."
1,2023-11-20,CMV: A Ceasefire between Israel and Hamas would set a dangerous precedent that would lead to even more civilian casualties in the future.,u/Shoddy-Definition-10,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17ztx4x/cmv_a_ceasefire_between_israel_and_hamas_would/,changemyview,"I realize that emotions are running hot, and that it is very easy to become emotionally charged when taking a stance on this topic, but I prefer to take a more logical approach. I would like to state some assumptions I am working with;

1) Hamas are terrorists

2) Israeli settlers are terrorists (and Netanyahu needs to be removed from office and tried in criminal court)

3) NO civilians **deserve** to die in any conflict

&#x200B;

It has been pretty well detailed at this point that Hamas does use civilians and civilian infrastructure to stage their military actions. There are a lot of articles about it from like 2014 if you all really don't believe that, and many of them are released by independent sources. Knowing this, Israel is still forced to act and unfortunately to take the lives of innocent civilians in the process. If they stop their airstrikes now or fold under international pressure and call for a ceasefire, I feel like it sends a very disturbing message to literally every terrorist organization that will ever exist in the future, one that states they can use civilians as shields and expect impunity. A message that tells future terrorists that they should only stage themselves out of hospitals and schools, as any attack against them can be twisted in their favor. I am honestly so worried that over terrorists are already thinking of taking a page or two out of Hamas' handbook (especially their extremely well-oiled PR campaign), and I think Israel agreeing on a ceasefire would bolster the efficacy of their strategies tremendously. 

&#x200B;

Is there a fault in my logic here? I'm really looking for some actual arguments here, please don't just say ""killing civilian bad, israel need stop"". I can't argue with virtue signaling."

I only wanna talk about the 12 hour clock.

The way people currently use the 12 hour clock makes no sense: At midnight, the day ends and a new day begins. So... what is the time of this new day? Its 12AM. An hour later its 1AM, meaning we've just traveled back 11 hours into the past, apparently.

""But 12 is the same as 0"" Okay, if you see it that way. But to me it makes no sense to display 12 on a digital clock when it actually means 0. It would be better to just display 0 instead of 12

""But 12AM is 12 because an hour earlier it was 11"" this makes no sense because the 11 was PM, not AM. So 12 would only work if it was also PM. 11pm, 12pm, perfectly fine. 11pm, 12am, makes no sense.

I suggest 2 possible alternatives:

1. Starting at 1 minute before midnight: 11:59PM, then 0AM until 11:59AM, then 0PM until 11:59PM.
2. Starting at 1 minute before midnight: 11:59PM, then 12:00PM, then 12:59PM, then 1AM until 12:59PM.

I wonder if anyone can change my view that: the current 12 hour system makes no sense and it should be one of the two alternatives that I just provided.

Love and hate are two sides of the same coin: passion.

By removing communication, players will try to find new ways of expressing themselves. That's the reason sabotaging games and spam pinging exists. I think all chat and ping privileges should be restored and the players themselves should decide if they want the chat and pings muted or not. If anything, Riot could have chat and pings turned off by default and let players unmute their team mates either every game or add it as a setting.

I myself don't play league anymore but I used to enjoy the trash talking and pinging in the game. Even when slurs were used, I didn't take it seriously. If anything, it's hilarious to see someone finally lose their shit.

Another point expands on the argument that players find ways of expressing themselves. Instead of flaming, people will report you out of pettiness which leaves to a disproportionate amount of reports for Riot to handle and people being banned for the wrong reason not receiving justice. I have been banned for explaining to someone else how I was insulted while the insulter received no punishment. I was also banned for joking around with another player, saying that his champ looked like a particular category of criminal in a specific show.

So conclusively, I think the player should decide what they are willing to expose themselves to rather than Riot gagging everyone.  "
9,2023-11-20,CMV: Certain kinks are inherently exploitative/encourage prejudice if taken as a lifestyle,u/ThiccCookie,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17zx74m/cmv_certain_kinks_are_inherently/,changemyview,"Disclaimer:

First, I mostly wrote this for fun, even if I do hold this view, it's to me more an exercise in how to exchange a good debate rather than proving me right/wrong.  
Second, I've seen this topic being lobbed around but unfortunately usually from Nazis or other weirdos who come here seeking validation of their clear prejudice/ideology.

With cuckolding it'll boil down to two fundamental lifestyle issues:

reference regarding a person's immutable characteristics (such as skin color).

However, despite this I believe there is an important conversation to be had about that not all kinks are equal or harmless.

In essence, my view is that kinks that utilize power dynamics should or must follow some basic rules:  
1. A kink shall never make any participant forfeit, give away, remove, or alter any of their ownership of their belongings.  
2. A kink shall never dictate or make any alteration of any participant's body, social grouping/status, or family.  
3. A kink shall never change any person's social/relationship dynamic in their life or lifestyle.  
4. A kink shall never enforce or encourage any change of political, religious, or social opinion of anyone participating.  
5. A kink shall never fetishize prejudice against any person's immutable characteristic.  


The reason I believe these rules must apply is that otherwise, the power dynamic makes it very easy for the ""dom"" to manipulate/exploit the ""sub"" in ways that a non-participant would instant recognize as manipulation but due to the fact that it's a ""kink"" it can be easily brushed aside as just part of the ""kink play"".

In essence, you can easily masquerade exploitation/manipulation as part of the kink and as such take advantage of a sub's submissive nature to get what you want as a dom, even if outsiders could clearly see this as exploitation/manipulation.

To be fair however, I believe most kinks indirectly follow the rules stated above, due to the fact that they are usually held as a ""one-time-thing"" or as a ""session"".

In other words, once the agreed word is uttered or time runs out, it's over and everything returns to normal.

This like the rules ensure there's a clear separation between the role-play/act and reality, very much akin to the separation between an actor and it's character they play.

This however I believe starts to break down once you start making this kink into a lifestyle.

Now all of a sudden, what is and what is not part of the kink becomes a blur, if you get spanked harshly for not delivering the groceries on time, is that abuse or is that part of the kink?

What about body alternations? Rejection/acceptance of certain people? Preferences/disdain for certain people with immutable characteristics?

There are a few kinks that when taken as a lifestyle I believe fit this:

* Cuckolding
* Raceplay
* BDSM

With cuckolding it'll be boiling down to two fundamental lifestyle issues:

1. It makes it easy to masquerade any decision made by the dom and their fuckbuddy to be part of the kink instead of them taking advantage of the sub.
2. If the sub wants to settle down or at least not make it a lifestyle anymore, it's highly unlikely the dom and their partner will adjust accordingly.

On point one it can go so far as to fetishize pregnancy & even raising someone else child not out of necessity/altruism but out of a sexual kink.  
In fact on reddit there exists subreddit(s) that encourage this.

With raceplay, which is already quite controversial the issue I believe is actually less BDSM with racial characteristics but instead the ""message"" these communities can encourage.  
I believe the hidden issue/danger with encouraging raceplay is the very overt ethnic supremacy that fetishization of race has slowly developed.

In essence, instead of interracial being just interracial, there are slow-growing views that ethnicities   
ought to be stereotyped based on sexual stereotypes and the fantasy as such pushes out some very wild ""fantasies"".

One example of this is males of x race are sexually superior to males of y race and how y race in general needs to be exterminated/subjugated.

Again there are subreddits that encourage this form of view and it gets swept mostly under the rug as ""role-play"" or ""kink"".

Some rebuttal of the common rebuttals: ""It's just a kink"" or ""If everyone consents then it's fine"", it's not hard to find kinks or consent that almost everyone agrees is abhorrent.

Such as pedophilia, castration, or abuse (with the intent to deliberately cause grievous harm) - these can all be seen as kinks however most of us I believe would consider these to be unacceptable even if they are kinks.

The same thing is the case with consent, if there's a bias against you saying no, then it's not clear consent.

TL;DR:  
Certain forms of kinks taken as a lifestyle (where the kink is inherently about power dynamics) will at best be highly problematic because of it's inherent messaging to at worst enable manipulation/abuse/exploitation without the submissive partner being fully aware of said intention."

1,2023-11-20,CMV: We shouldn't have scales for body weight at home,u/palmtree42069,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17zye5u/cmv_we_shouldnt_have_scales_for_body_weight_at/,changemyview,"Of course this doesn't include people that need a scale for health reasons, I'm talking about the average household.


Why I hold that opinion: I grew up in a household without a scale. I only got to know my weight sporadically when I went to the doctor. When I went to puberty, I did struggle with my weight, as almost every teenage girl, but never as much as my friends. They got anxious over what was maybe one or two pounds, a normal fluctuation, that you can't even notice without a scale. To this day, I feel like I have a more relaxed way of how I look at weight than the people around me that grew up with constantly weighing themselves. I only worry when I visibly look underweight and unhealthy, but I don't worry about the weight itself (the numbers).


Again, I did worry about my weight when I was a teenager, so it didn't save me entirely from that, but I feel like it would've been much worse if I had known my actual weight in numbers.


So yeah, my point is that most people would be a lot happier if we didn't have scales at home where we could see even the smallest difference in weight."
288,2023-11-20,CMV: The combination of the pandemic and social media has irreversibly killed any rational nuanced discourse.,u/dullaveragejoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17zyne6/cmv_the_combination_of_the_pandemic_and_social/,changemyview,"I'm a person who has always enjoyed thoughtful conversation. I have strong political opinions, but I enjoy hearing opposing arguments. I like having my ideas challenged, strengthening my arguments, and reconsidering my position. Participating in a thought-provoking philosophical or political conversation is incredibly rewarding. 

I entered college in early 2000s and made friends with people from a variety of backgrounds. We had many interesting conversations both in formal debate club and informal chitchat. I also started visiting the internet and had conversations in various chat rooms/message boards. Did the US have the right to invade the Middle East to prevent another terrorist attack? Are civilian casualties ever acceptable? My own opinion on gay marriage slowly changed because people respectfully pointed out things I hadn't considered. The political parties were a lot closer in terms of policy and people often switched parties.

I discovered reddit about 15 years ago and enjoyed the chance to discuss a wide variety of things with a wide variety of individuals. Sure, there were trolls, toxic subs, and echo chambers. But for the most part, most people were willing to have respectful conversations. We talked about how to find high-quality media from opposing sources, and logical fallacies. And most people online and IRL seemed ok.

Then the pandemic hit. And my view is everyone went insane. And now **we can't trust anyone who doesn't pledge loyalty to our ""team"".**

2021, the vaccines came out after a year of too much collective social media. It seemed either you were adament vaccines were a plot by Jewish Space Lizards to give everyone cancer, or that everyone needs to stay locked in their basement for a few years and then once every last person is vaccinated covid will magically disappear. I got a new downvote record for pointing out that vaccines while still effective, don't stop spread. 

Since then, I've noticed it is a lot harder to discuss anything. No one talks about the Middle East situation with any nuance- and if you try you're either branded an antisemitic or an Islamaphobe and cancelled.

On reddit, the subs have gotten more inclusive. I don't want to encourage brigading, so I don't want to name names. But this seems to be the only sub left where you can have a differing opinion. Either you agree completely with every tiny detail of the community or you're banned/grossly downvoted. Even on the so called ""debate an x"" subs. Even here, I've noticed more casual posts and more disclaimers (""I don't really think this way but in the spirit of cmv..."") 

IRL I've noticed we're all walking on eggshells too. I had a few adult friends I used to have thoughtful conversations with. I met with them both this year. One as soon as I brought up current events said ""Litter boxes are going into schools now, it's child abuse."" The other said ""You can't be racist to white people and anyone who thinks otherwise has Nazi sympathies."" And then both shut down. Strangers don't make small talk and people almost seem scared to talk to each other. New acquaintances seem to be probing for information on which political ""side"" I'm on before being willing to become friendly. Politics has become extremely divided with no room for nuance.

Now obviously this is all anecdotal and a depressing way to view the world so CMV.
1) Are there any other good subs/websites where different political or social opinions can be freely discussed?
2) Any teenage or 20-somethings here who anecdotally have a politically varied friendgroup who can comfortably talk politics?"

The damn broke in 2008 when large financial institutions violently awoke the nation from her American dream of homeownership. There has been a wealth “crisis” developing since the turn of the 19th century where individual wealth has depleted while corporately owned wealth has skyrocketed. Even the richest billionaire is but a worthless pauper compared to average multinational corporations. These two crises are related. The monumental wealth of large enterprises and the increasing poverty of the bourgeoisie has caused the prospect of owning a parcel of the planet earth ever more illusory each decade. 

We almost forget that *American* society exists to protect the citizen against the collective. This is *not* a socialist state, the rights of the individual are paramount against the rights of the group or the state. The citizen serves themselves, the citizen does not serve the state nor the corporation. To paraphrase, the Declaration of Independence holds that once a government no longer permits the citizen to live and die according to their means and abilities, the government must be dissolved by any means necessary. 

I am not saying that the US ought to collapse because of modern social inequalities like many radicals on the far left/right. Instead, I think a sensible solution to the dual problems of inequality and the lack of owned real properties is a simple change in national policy. It should be law across every jurisdiction that areas zoned for “single-family” homes can only be sold to individuals born of woman. No entities may own real property zoned like this, unless such an entity exposes their owners to unlimited liability. 

I mention all the stuff about American culture/law to undermine the argument that prohibiting corporations from purchasing would violate the “freedom” of a corporation to engage in the market. Individuals have freedoms under the Constitution, and individuals may associate freely. But such associations should not have the same claim to rights/freedoms that individuals have. This argument is unavailing because society serves the individual, not the collective. 

Another counterargument I can imagine is that the economy might suffer because (1) housing prices are inflated; (2) the only entities that can reliably pay inflated prices with ready cash (or favorable financing) are corporate entities; and (3) if the wealthiest entities in the market are banned from buying, housing prices would dramatically collapse. Last time housing prices collapsed, Obama had to give billions to banking executives lest their feelings got hurt. /s (kinda). To this argument, I say the ends would justify the means. Billions in home equity would evaporate so that future generations could have a justifiable hope in affordable home ownership. 

TL;DR: Perpetuating the American dream for current and future generations of homebuyers is more important than big business profit and the retirement plans of current homeowners. Therefore business should be unilaterally banned from owning single-family owned property, any business currently owning such property should divest ASAP."
1,2023-11-20,CMV: Canada should become a part of the United States,u/human_in_the_mist,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17zzu7l/cmv_canada_should_become_a_part_of_the_united/,changemyview,"I realize that there will be some overlap but I present my argument as follows:

1. Canada's historical alignment with the British Empire is less relevant in today's world. By becoming part of the United States, Canada can align itself with a more geographically and culturally connected partner. This would lead to enhanced cooperation and integration, benefiting both nations in terms of security, trade, and global influence. Moreover, Canada's transition from a former British colony to an independent nation suggests that its current geopolitical position can evolve further through integration with the United States.  

2. The concentration of the population along the American border showcases the natural affinity and cultural similarities shared between Canada and the United States. This geographical advantage would make the integration process smoother and create opportunities for economic growth, improved transportation infrastructure, and shared resources. Additionally, it would foster closer social connections, an exchange of ideas, and strengthen bilateral relationships in areas like education, healthcare, and research and development.  

3. Canada's already heavy economic reliance on the United States presents an opportunity for deeper integration. By becoming part of the United States, Canada would gain even greater access to the world's largest economy, resulting in increased trade benefits, reduced barriers, and improved market access for Canadian businesses. This would facilitate economic diversification, attract foreign investments, and result in higher GDP growth rates and job creation, benefiting both nations.  

4. Integrating with the more robust and dynamic American economy would bring significant benefits to Canada. By aligning policies and reducing bureaucratic hurdles, Canada can leverage the United States' business-friendly environment and technological advancements. This integration would fuel innovation, encourage entrepreneurship, attract top talent, and accelerate productivity. Moreover, Canada's unique economic strengths, like its natural resources and skilled workforce, would complement the United States' strengths, leading to mutually beneficial economic growth.  

5. While Canada's public healthcare system has historically been an advantage, recent challenges indicate the need for improvements. By joining the United States, Canada can learn from its healthcare model, which has a strong focus on innovation, research, and private sector collaboration. Leveraging the best practices of both systems would lead to overall healthcare improvements, better access to specialized care, shorter wait times, and enhanced healthcare infrastructure investment. I realize that this is likely my weakest point, since I admit that I've never had any difficulty with the public health care system up here but I acknowledge that others have.

While I think the latter is definitely pretty shitty, I don't see many people bring up how he caused Andy to have a literal mental breakdown by hiding his phone which I think is definitely the worst of Jim (Pam cheating I think is on Pam, since I don't think he was actually friends with Ryan).
 
At this point, Andy was just annoying, but he went out of his way to be overly (and annoyingly) friendly and nice, but that doesn't really make him a bad person I think, at least enough to warrant actually stealing his personal cell phone, hiding it, and actually gaslighting him about not hearing the ringer which he calls. Then, when Andy is publicly and embarrassingly called out by Michael for being overly friendly (which isn't really a moral failing I think and I think this calling out should have been done in a more professional manner), Jim then gaslights Andy again at his lowest point by calling his phone, and when Andy has a mental breakdown where he doesn't hurt anybody, Jim just looks to the camera with a 😐. He doesn't even come clean when Andy immediately apologizes for his breakdown largely caused by Jim's theft and gaslighting, and it's never indicated that Jim did something shitty. I mean, from Andy's perspective, the people he thought were his friends now hate him, and besides Jim literally stealing a pretty significant personal belonging of Andy, from Andy's perspective the prank indicated to him that the people around him who he thought were his friends actually hated him to the point where they'd steal his personal belongings and gaslight him.

Idk, I know it's a sitcom, and I don't watch the office a ton so maybe it's addressed, but I think Jim's behavior here was actually super shitty, and instead of addressing this the show seemed to play it off as harmless mischievous behavior."

I fundamentally disagree with this notion because if we are to believe that art is anything, than art ceases to be a concept altogether. It becomes a term devoid of meaning that might as well just be considered a synonym for everything. 

I believe that in order for something to be art, there has to be some sort of deliberate craft to its creation in order to express an idea. It cannot be something completely random, like a toddler's scribbles or a recording of random noises on the street, because there is no intent. If I just splash paint on a canvas with no rhyme or reason, it can't be considered the expression of an idea or emotion because I had nothing in mind I wanted to express in the first place. At that point, the only way you could consider it art is by the (what I feel would be inaccurate) notion that since it's technically a painting, than that automatically makes it art.

But what if someone looks at my randomly splashed canvas and believes there is an intent? Does that suddenly make it art regardless of the method behind it? No, because by that logic, we would be forced to assume that inanimate objects by themselves are art simply because one person in the world may find meaning in it. The Sun, for example, cannot be considered art as it was not even made by a human, yet there are people who will view sunsets as an artform simply because of their beauty.  This is a gross misinterpretation of what art is. Art is not just anything that makes you feel something, it is something made with the purpose of making people feel something.

To summarize, if everything is art, than nothing is. The term holds no value, and the concept is rendered nonexistent."

However maybe I'm just having some sort of confirmation bias and only see the weak arguments and thus create some sort of strawman argument.


Arguments which are against Moral Relativism all amount to something along the lines of this:

1) With Moral Relativism, things like slavery and Nazism can be justified, which is a horrible thing and thus MR can't be true.

2) With Moral Relativism, one can never come to a conclusion whether something is moral or not, because everybody can simply claim relativity.


The first point is weak, because it already implies that those things are somehow universally wrong. The formula is always this ""a thing which in our current moral framework is considered extremely taboo could be justified"". A Nazi would tell you otherwise, a slave holder would also tell you otherwise. Thus we are again at relativism. Having strong emotional belief that one's moral reality is universal or obvious is not an argument against Moral Relativism.

The second point is also weak because this is not the problem of Moral Relativism. So what if everybody can have differing moralities? That is like arguing that something can't be correct because it is inconvenient to us and thus we have to create a fairy tale. Just because everybody can have their own moralities it does not mean that on a societal level everything must be accepted. In the end, some sort of consensus will be reached and people who have moralities which do not match well enough will be socially ostracized, punished or killed.

___

Of course there are more arguments against it, but it always seems like those are the main pillars. I think my main view that Moral Relativism is correct is unlikely to change. Maybe you could argue that my position is more Moral Nihilism, but I find them to be very similar. Moral Nihilism states that there is nothing like intrinsic morality in general, while Moral Relativism basically states that societal norms more or less decide what is considered ""moral"". However I regard my view to be changed if you can show strong arguments against Moral Relativism, which can't be answered from a Moral Relativism point of view."

I wouldn't call them expendable per say - but they were pretty damn close. They were used to swarm large enemy warships using superior numbers, and destroy them with volleys of torpedo fire in the attack, while destroying smaller warships with their guns when acting as escorts. Now, tactics change, and I understand that instead of guns, it may be missiles instead of guns but...am I still missing something here? Why is it that destroyers made post WW2 have become massive flagship grade strategic assets capable of operation all on their own? That's not a destroyer, that's a cruiser!

For reference, a cruiser is a multirole warship capable of long range independent action, acting either as an escort (something destroyers are also capable of, I'll admit), independent scouts, commerce protection/raiding, or as mini-capital ships of smaller flotillas. They were strategic assets, expensive warships not easily thrown into the naval meat grinder, only being beaten out by larger warships such as battleships/battlecruisers and aircraft carriers in terms of value, and were capable of patrolling and independently acting all on their own. Sound familiar? Yep, because that's everything a destroyer does in the modern era!

The only real things modern destroyers have in common with the destroyers of old are that a. they are capable of acting as escorts (something that, by definition, cruisers are also capable of), and b. that they carry torpedoes (though many cruisers, and even battleships and battlecruisers have carried torpedoes at some point). The modern line between ""cruiser"" and ""destroyer"" on the other hand, have gotten so murky, I don't think it's unfair to say that we should simply reclassify the naval behemoths we call ""destroyers"" into the cruisers they are. It'll clear up a lot of confusion and get rid of useless terminology. For those still concerned, we can call existing cruisers as heavy cruisers and current destroyers as light cruisers. It's not like the ""guided missile"" part of the classification is necessary in the 21st century anymore, ALL ocean-going warships meant for battle are going to be armed with guided missiles, and thus is a redundant phrase.

Note: Before anyone says, I do know that words evolve over time, and I do acknowledge that that is a valid point. However, due to the fact that the word ""cruiser"" still exists and is in active use across world navies, I'm not so sure. Unlike the term ""frigate,"" which went out of use after the age of sail ended and was readopted by the navies of WW2 (with sailing frigates being more akin to cruisers and modern frigates being warships smaller than destroyers), the terms ""destroyers"" and ""cruisers"" have remained in consistent use. It's similar to a word I know in Korean, the ""jeoncha,"" which means both ""tank"" and ""chariot"" (though mostly the latter, your average South Korean will just say tank as it is an English loanword at this point). However, the existence of events such as the 1975 US Navy ship reclassification seem to indicate that the modern terminology has a lot less power than it actually may seem to have. (For context, the reclassification was done in order to block the ""cruiser gap"" by the Soviet Union. Unlike the US, the USSR had a different way of classifying ships, and thus had ""more cruisers."" Even though the Soviet cruisers were roughly on par with American destroyers, this caused a political controversy which resulted in everything being bumped up.)"

Their defense is that a like is out in the open, but come on, Instagram is built on likes. You can't expect a girl with thousands of likes to investigate who's liking her stuff.

I get it if your guy's throwing a fit about your bikini pics or going crazy with the likes. Follows every IG model, hearts OF girls, and pornstars – okay, that's a different story.

I read about the theory and it's helpful and makes you understand yourself more . I lurked in different subreddits about different attachment styles like avoidants folks because i can relate more to them 


I see people fight each other "" avoidants are evil"" . "" Anxious are needy high maintenance people"" . And other versions of that . People label each other and psychologize each other and painting each other with black and white without even knowing about the full story . Reading for a week like myself won't make you expert in people.. humans are way complicated than that 


Even avoidants are different we aren't the same that applies on all other attachment styles and frankly how you are so sure about the theory everything can be proved wrong. We are different and we don't think in the same way. we are from different countries ,culture background ,  Different philosophical approach , different mental illnesses, different wounds and childhood traumas and etc...


I believe when someone says I'm anxious that also  mean he or she can be avoidant or even secure it's just the dominant side of your attachment behavior.. 


We all fall in this trap coming here for prospectives which is nice actually but at the end of the day your story is specific and only you would take the decision to stick or leave


People seems to forget that anyone can be toxic and manipulative we are humans mortal creatures that fuck up always and do mistakes and after all we are phases in each other lives and people should learn how to let go and not taking everything personal


should we excuse each other ? ! Idk tbh .. maybe because what you been through is difficult even i won't feel it in same way . But why should i tolerate the pain you cause ? 
but apparently no one does so yeah everyone should choose themselves your scarfices and efforts won't mean anything to the other parties if they are assholes or misunderstood you or even for the universe no one cares and move on but until you find your folks who have same frequencies as you 


Ofc it hurts like a motherfucker and  love is addiction so it's normal that you withdraw


So people coming here on reddit to find excuses to shitty behavior and trying to figure out other complicated humans forgetting themselves and facing there own problems. Because tbh no can fix anyone's else problem they have to choose and heal but most of people don't because it's not easy it's fuckin hurtful so breakup happens and friendships broke. Guilt, shame, what ifs exist and before i forget you should set your boundaries before other people set them for you 


You tell yourself i don't want to hurt anyone but you meet someone and you tell yourself i have to try the feeling they talk about but shit happens always and you gotta learn and I think you did learn


You see posts one sided and biased and you become one sided and biased so you fell in the trap because no matter label you are emotions can control you


So i think most of us try to justify our own deed with sprinkles of ego , self entitlement, protest behavior and even anger. No one wants to face there problems and go to therapy and in this age of social media it's easier to avoid, ghost , hurt and cheat without being accountable and admitting our own mistakes"
1,2023-11-21,CMV: Spiteful protest voting may be justified even if threatens democracy,u/WanabeInflatable,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/180fsk1/cmv_spiteful_protest_voting_may_be_justified_even/,changemyview,"\> Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others 

Even the most dictatorial/oligarchic ruling elites pretend to be democratic. Elections are necessity, but often there is a favorite or a group of established parties that may ignore concerns of the voters. I.e fail to represent them.

So elites game the system. Elections become a choice without a choice, except one ""correct"" candidate there are obviously bad alternatives. There are people genuinely attracted to bigots, alt-right populists, political freaks and would-be-dictators that may destroy democracy if they come to power democratical way. But some people vote for ""bad guys"" not because they really want them in power, but because they are angry at the main-stream.

Of course, there is a risk, that a political freak would actually win ellection and cause lasting damage. Voters who casted their votes toward him bear responsibility for that outcome. But:

Democracy without political competition is not really a democracy.

Sometimes reckless and harmful actions are the only choice.

Ruling elites should be afraid of such outcome, otherwise picking a political bogeyman as a convenient opponent will be abused even more.

\---

Some examples.

**US Trump Elections in 2016.**

I'm not from US, but I have friends there. One of my friends hated Trump very much, but voted for him anyway. It was very clear, that Trump is dangerous, but Hillary played dirty. Last but not least, democratic establishment clearly played race and gender card to score more votes from minorities, no surprise they alienated whites and men - pushing them towards conservatives as the only alternative. Yeah, my friend is not conservative, not religious, not anti abortion. I'm discussing this topics often with ppl online and see this same sentiment: ""there is no more center, only conservative freaks and woke freaks"" - people want neither and vote out of spite and protest. Which is of course dangerous and reckless, but I can't blame them.

**Germany AfD**

I moved to Germany this year. For political reasons as form of ""voting with my legs"". Here I saw concerns about far right populists scoring record high. I don't know anyone voting for them, it might be a bit hard to confess, just like in US people often don't brag about voting for Trump. Yet Alternative fur Deutschland grew this year from marginal freak party to a big threat to mainstream.

People see that main-stream parties ignore painful problems of migration, stagnating economy, jump on the green bandwagon... Hopefully threat of AfD will force normal parties to stop ignoring concerns of people.

**Russia and Communist party**

I'm originally from Russia. And it is a lost cause, we have full fledged dictatorship now, last decorative elements of democracy to be dismantled soon. Putin is a president for life after changing constitution. There is no political competition at all. But it wasn't always like that.

10-20 years ago there was a party who challenged him and his pocket party - Communists. Dinosaur party of the old and nostalgic, anti-western, with no agenda except primitive populism. Of course young liberals hated the commies. Nevertheless we had to vote for them, because it was limited to Putin (and cronies) vs Commies vs Clown party vs a bunch of losers never scoring above threshold.

But of course people were reluctant to vote for communists and the time to stop Putin democratic way was lost.

\---

Bottom line: if the ruling elites give you only phoney alternative - vote for that alternative. Even if the alternative is also horrible."

 But it's seems like these thoughts are more ""reachable""and ""realistic"" when it comes to occurrence rather than the long term goals that'll take years and years worth of sacrifice and perseverance in order to achieve

I know the amount of time that things take doesn't matter, but what you do within that time that counts.

 And I should be willing to take years upon years if to achieve the same results that someone else has within so little time. 

There's nothing wrong with being a late bloomer after all

But at the same time my intrusive thoughts, overthinking, and procrastination have made me think of the worst scenarios based on what think is gonna ""realistically"" gonna happen instead of what I should ""make"" happen.


Sometimes I don't think I might recover from whatever worse case scenario coming to actual fruition. But I remind myself that I've felt hopeless before because my goal wasn't achieved. 

So if I'm able to recover from that, but then I'm able to recover from other things as well


But life shouldn't always have to be this question of whether or not we can recover or build resilience from pain and disappointment. I just want to win, to achieve.

 Unfortunately those things aren't the end all be all. So I'll have no choice but to build coping mechanisms or self-motivation

197,2023-11-21,"CMV: ""Blair Witch Project"" is one of the most effective horror films made because of how ambiguous it is.",u/drygnfyre,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/180gprj/cmv_blair_witch_project_is_one_of_the_most/,changemyview,"I think the film really captures one of the scariest scenarios any human being can be in: not knowing. 

I was thinking about how much I love ""The Shining,"" but that it was always ruined for me when you learn towards the end there really is a haunting happening in the hotel. I remember one of my favorite things about the film was how you were never clear if the hotel was haunted, or if it was just people slowly going insane from being isolated in a hotel. I think the film really lost a lot of its intrigue when you find out without ambiguity that it's a hunted hotel.

To me, ""Blair Witch Project"" takes this concept and improves upon it. It has the same primal fear of being lost, alone, isolated, except at no point in time does the audience learn anything. We have no idea if there is truly a haunting in the woods, we have no idea if the Blair Witch and Rustin Parr are the same person. For all we know, three college kids simply got lost in the woods because of their inexperience, and as they ran low on food and water, slowly went insane. Everything seen and heard in the film can be explained rationally. Those sounds they hear at night when inside their tents? Could be animals, could be other people walking around, could be mechanical noises. Those stick figures they find when walking around? Well, supposedly the legend of the witch is well known to the local residents, couldn't it just be some other kids who made them earlier and just forgot about them?

To me, the film would have been much weaker if any concrete explanation was given. Whether the answer ended up being an actual witch, or kids who just got lost, it would have taken away the impact the film had. By leaving it completely unexplained, it's a much scarier scenario. Because any possible interpretation is as right or wrong as the other.

As someone who has personally been lost while hiking before, I can attest to how scary the film is. Your mind does absolutely crazy things once it decides you're lost. You start walking in circles. You hallucinate. You don't behave like normal.

CMV on this. Convince me the film would have been better if a concrete explanation for the events were explained at the end."

This is not a comment on the moral rightness or wrongness of the action, but a utilitarian perspective on the overall Israeli goal of safety and security for the Israeli people.  Military force has two goals: 1) To deter the enemy from making war; 2) To destroy the enemy's capability to make war.

1) A priori, Hamas and its sympathizers will never be deterred from making war.  They know what the Israeli response will be, they count on it.

2) Any reduction in the capability of Hamas to make war will be fleeting and temporary at best.  Israel's operation will lead to inevitable collateral damage in the form of civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure.  Whether Hamas is responsible for bringing about the collateral damage by using civilian facilities for operations is immaterial.  What matters is only what the people of Gaza believe, and Hamas is more than capable of controlling the narrative sufficiently to advance their agenda of expanding sympathy for themselves and antipathy for Israel.  Every casualty creates a fallout in the form of radicalization of friends, family, and spectators of the event, and that fallout is what Hamas counts on to generate new support.

In summary, the Israeli military operation, regardless of whether it is justified or moral, will do very little in the long term to hamper Hamas' ability to stage attacks, but it will create droves of radicalized residents of Gaza which will ultimately strengthen Hamas and decrease Israeli security.

The last good thing was when the US was forced into ww2 anything past that is hard to see what good was accomplished. If anything overthrowing dictators and invading countries has been good for certain businesses but bad as a whole for those countries and the world. 

The US has helped build up and arm terrorist groups and dictators that we have ended up fighting at later dates. Ex. Bin laden, noriega, Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi. These are the more recent ones. Not to mention the countless coups and regime changes that the US has helped which ended up putting those countries in a worst spot. This goes all the way back to the banana wars in early 1900s. 

For the recent wars and interventions countries like Libya and Iraq were more stable and the people living there had a better quality of life than after those wars. Even the argument that involvement was needed because it helped American interest most of the time it doesn't even do that. It causes chaos and infighting and makes those countries unreliable assets or outright enemies to the US. 

Now after saying all this I am not saying that the US should stay out of all wars. Clearly the US involvement in justified wars like the world wars was needed. If we are attacked then that is justified, some of it can be handled better but still justified."

I would be heartbroken if a story I'd poured blood, sweat, and tears into was shunned by so many people and, going by any metric, the Marvels has failed to attract audiences. 

Nia DaCosta herself did an interview in which she said ""There are pockets that are really virulent and violent and racist — and sexist and homophobic and all those awful things. And I choose the side of the light. That’s the part of fandom I’m most attracted to."" I don't think it's fair to interpret that as her saying superhero fans in general are these things or the movie failed because of these things as some people are. 

But there are others who are convinced bigotry is responsible for the failure of ""The Marvels"" or at least primarily responsible. Based on the data I've seen, I don't think this is the case. It's true that white people and men didn't turn out in large numbers which could suggest bigotry was a major factor. But nobody else did either. 

So why did the Marvels perform poorly? In my view...

The Marvels itself does not score particularly well with critics. This is probably the biggest factor. A movie can have legs if it gets good word of mouth from viewers and critics. Elemental is a great example. Bombed initially, but came roaring back. The A cinema score no doubt helped it. And elemental touched on racism and discrimination too. 

Due to the strikes there was limited press

There's a lot of superhero fatigue. I personally couldn't make it through more than 15 minutes of part 1 of avengers endgame.

The Washington Redskins had to change their team name because of the term 'redskin' being considered racist and offensive. It is widely recognized that calling someone ""brown"" or ""yellow"" is offensive, with regards to skin color. In other words, we generally frown upon the use of a color to refer to someone's skin or race.

Yet ""white"" is perfectly fine to label Caucasians with, and ""black"" is also considered fine as well, even though African-Americans are a racial minority and are perhaps the minority that has suffered the *most* racism of all.

One argument I've heard in favor of ""white/black"" is, ""We've used those terms for so long that they've become non-offensive."" But that sounds like a circular argument. By that logic, if we consistently and frequently used the terms ""brown/yellow/red"" **more** often to refer to the skin color of Hispanics, Arabs, Asians or native Americans, then those terms would hence become *less* offensive.

I would suggest replacing 'white' and 'black' with the respective terms that would be closest to what we call Hispanic, Asian-American, native American, etc. these days."

I view myself as quite progressive, and many of my ideals line up with typical left wing politics. The one issue I struggle with is the gender spectrum. 

I have a hard time understanding how gender is a social construct, and yet a spectrum at the same time? Clothing or items, or anything else we use to express ourselves has no gender, right? Skirts doesn’t equal female, sports don’t equal male, etc.

If this is the case, however, then what is the gender spectrum? A man can like nail polish and makeup, and still be called a man, right? A woman can love short hair and sports, and still be called a woman? 

This is why I fail to understand the concept of non-binary, because gender itself doesn’t have two binary compartments labelled male and female, so what does it mean when you say you don’t fit into said non existent compartments? I have a hard time seeing it as anything else than another attempt to be “different” and unique, or even to claim some form of oppression.

There are less hot doctors than pudgy office workers, so we can easily recognize a person as being unreasonable if they want that but don't have as much going for them.

What I consider emotional standards is the somewhat broad range of factors about a person's personality. Motivation levels, sensitivity to criticism, how they handle emotional baggage, confidence, sense of humor, even intelligence. It's very rare to find someone that checks all those boxes. People who have visible flaws outnumber people who are perfect, as do people who have emotional flaws. 

I feel like every single woman I know ""can't find a good man"", and it really isn't for the incel reasoning that they only want Navy Seals. The problem is that they all want men who aren't messy, who are assertive, smart, and funny. Conversely, they themselves are prone to outbursts or bouts of depression that they wouldn't tolerate from a potential partner. It's extremely unlikely that a very smart and funny person would have a high level of emotional stability without spending a lot of time on self-improvement towards their mental health. Like if you burst into tears if your partner gets a little angry at you, it's not really fair to say that your partner is an angry person. If your partner is ambitious with a demanding career but messy around the house, you don't really have a leg to stand on if you're the world's cleanest person that can't hold a job and needs financial support. 

It's the same thing with men, though a little different. ""Why are all the hot ones crazy?"" Well, because all of the hot, stable ones are in relationships with guys that are better than you. Those guys got sick of the hot, crazy ones. I've met lots of guys with money and gym time that haven't really developed their maturity. They end up getting shallow, but attractive dates.

This goes for lots of things that are too numerous to list out. I just  think a lot of people think they're entitled to have partners that are more mature than themselves without putting in any work themselves. 

I guess the CMV here is I'd love to hear an explanation why it's OK for someone to have a double standard for emotional maturity but not physical attributes. Moreover, that there are situations where those kinds of standards are unreasonable if you don't bring a lot to the table."

 And

Communism: ""A theoretical economic system characterized by the collective ownership of property and by the organization of labor for the common advantage of all members.""

Are about dealing with the failures and contradictions within the system of capitalism:


1. **Inequality**: Capitalism can lead to significant economic inequalities. Wealth tends to become concentrated in the hands of a few, leading to a disparity in income and quality of life.

2. **Exploitation**: Workers in capitalist systems may be exploited, as businesses prioritize profit over fair wages and working conditions. This can result in a workforce that struggles to live off their earnings.

3. **Environmental Impact**: The drive for profit in capitalism often overrides environmental concerns, leading to overuse of natural resources and environmental degradation.

4. **Consumerism**: Capitalism can foster a culture of consumerism, where the value of goods and services is determined by their marketability rather than their intrinsic value or contribution to well-being.

5. **Boom and Bust Cycles**: Capitalist economies are prone to cycles of boom and bust, leading to periods of economic growth followed by recessions or depressions, which can cause widespread financial and social distress.

6. **Short-termism**: The focus on short-term profits can undermine long-term planning and investment, potentially leading to unstable or unsustainable business practices.

7. **Monopolies and Oligopolies**: Capitalism can lead to the formation of monopolies and oligopolies, where a few large companies dominate a market, stifling competition and innovation.

8. **Neglect of Social Goods**: Capitalism may underprovide public goods like education, health, and infrastructure, as these are not always profitable ventures for private entities.

9. **Cultural Homogenization**: The spread of capitalist markets can lead to cultural homogenization, where local customs and practices are overshadowed by a dominant, often Western, culture.

10. **Ethical Concerns**: Profit-driven motives can sometimes lead to ethical lapses, as businesses prioritize profits over considerations like fairness, justice, and the welfare of employees and communities.

Capitalism natural drift are to these problems and the results for capitalistic societies are either Fascism or Communism. Which one depends on how tribalistic and diverse the society is. I can see America becoming more fascist, with its list of potential ethic scapegoats, than a homogeneous Nordic country."

Doesn’t that seem a bit messed up? Basically saying a woman can’t even play a woman anymore? A man gets cast to play a woman?

I don’t care what anyone says.. Someone born male can never be a woman. No matter how much surgery you get to change your appearance you can’t change from male to female.

What’s the difference between that and say someone complaining white people get roles over black people?🧐

Is this not taking away a job away from an actual woman? You’re literally hiring a man to play a woman..?

Imagine Jack black comes out and says he’s a woman. He gets surgery and changes his appearance to resemble a woman.. He now gets cast in the lead role of almost every major movie as a woman. Would there be outrage?"

TLDR: The U.S. Customary Units work fine for what we use it for and switching to metric isn't worth the hassle for us.

First off, I want to point out that Americans are perfectly aware of the metric system. We know that it makes conversion easy and use it in applications where it offers clear advantages. Most Americans are comfortable enough using the metric system that if you put us in another country we'll understand the units of measurement we see. We are not ignorant of the metric system's benefits and do not have some strange aversion to it.

The simple fact of the matter is that America industrialized with U.S. Customary Units, which we call the standard system. Our infrastructure was built using the standard system and it has long been industry standard in many industries. The standard system is deeply embedded in American society and culture and switching entirely to the metric system would be an enormous and expensive pain in the ass with little benefit.

The ease of conversion in the metric system is nice but it's not a big deal in daily life and the standard system is perfectly serviceable. Anyone of reasonably sound mind can remember how to convert between common Imperial units and doing so is not a cause of any significant problems."

For context, I'm an American living in the southern US.

Let me limit what I mean to the following: Many people claim to be agnostic because they simply cannot say whether or not any god or higher power exists. They'll say something like, I can't prove that there isn't any god, so I won't say that there isn't at all, but I am not going to participate in any religion, it's just not for me. This is often followed up with them saying that while they don't want to be religious, they see it works for some people, and that's fine for them. I'll call these folks casual agnostics. 

I want to pressure casual agnostics to take a stronger stance against Abrahamic religions for two reasons. First to directly respond to the contradiction their own view has between not knowing if there is a God and thinking it's fine (logically) that some people believe in the Abrahamic God. Second, to show that their lack of a stance is evading moral responsibility. 

1. Contradictory Beliefs

If the casual agnostic is committed to the view that they cannot know if *a god* exists, then they are not fully committing to atheism because they believe it is wrong to claim that *any god* doesn't exist. While some religions throughout history and in the modern era may allow for a practitioner to believe in any god, Abrahamic religions are very clear on the point that you must believe in their god. So, followers of Abrahamic religions are doing what casual agnostics don't want to do, they're saying that some gods (all gods but their Abrahamic one) don't exist, and they *know* this. The only type of theism a casual agnostic should accept is one where any god may exist. 

2. Moral Responsibility 

By essentially ""opting out"" of the discourse on religion, casual agnostics are failing to examine their own beliefs about morality and are  simply going along with the Abrahamic ethic they've inherited from their culture, without participating in the rituals. (I admit this is a very American perspective)

 I'll admit that I am anti-religion, but even if I wasn't, I would still believe this is a failure for many to examine what they actually believe. They just don't want to think about it, and it will limit their ability to develop their own morals. In cases where a casual agnostic faces hardship (an example is a death of a loved one) they may go right back to believing that they're in heaven, rather than having a well thought out foundation about such matters. 

Just to add an anecdote, I had a conversation with a coworker once who said her son came home asking if he could attend church because he had a friend who did and thought it was interesting, but the mother was worried he would like it and want to go. They are not a religious family, but she is a casual agnostic, so she was unsure if discouraging her son going to church would make her a bad person. Had she investigated her beliefs prior to that moment, she may have had a better approach to the situation.

I think mental illness/disability awareness and increased social acceptability surrounding their discussion accounts for some amount of the increase, but I’m convinced a lot of (if not the majority) of these new diagnoses are due to overstimulation and constant hits of dopamine, particularly during developmental years. ADHD diagnoses began noticeably climbing in the 2000s, presumably due to some combination of increased recognition socially, as well as increased computer use and gaming among youth. I’m honestly not sure how much of each accounts for what, if at all. I suspect the latter is relevant though.

As of now, I feel that a lot of people recently being diagnosed with and treated for ADHD don’t necessarily have brains inherently predisposed to it, but rather had it emerge as a result of their lifestyle as children/teens. I suppose it’s possible that they’re predisposed to it on some level, but maybe it wouldn’t manifest without this overstimulation, or maybe some people are just more susceptible to the long term effects of overstimulation, I’m not sure. I do suspect, though, that even if someone began using a lot of technology like this as an adult, it’d still have a strong impact on their attention span and executive function.

I am not basing this off data or studies, but rather a simple hunch from personal observations; I am an ignoramus looking to either be affirmed or corrected here by people who actually know what they’re talking about. If folks have theories or data/studies to the contrary I would be very interested in seeing them and potentially adjusting my view on this. Thanks!"

People say things like ""coffee is addictive"" or ""shopping is addictive"", without understanding that addiction is actually a very complex mental health disorder. If tomorrow we discovered that coffee caused cancer, I'm sure most people would not have a problem abandoning the habit, however if you were living in the 50s and just found out that smoking caused cancer, you'd have a hard time doing the same. Why? Because cigarettes are actually addictive, they were engineered to keep you 'hooked' and the habit of lighting the cigarette combined with that fast hit of nicotine that stimulates your brain, makes kicking the habit torturous. You've got withdrawals, cravings and the social implications of having to give up those late night smokes with your mates. Whilst you may be able to develop a dependence to caffeine, that is far from an 'addiction' and I think that we should collectively recognise this as a society. Because what alcohol, cigarettes, heroin and gambling don't have in common with people who drink coffee, is the willingness to suffer from life altering consequences.  
I hope I didn't come across as cocky or anything but I just thought that this is something relevant to a lot of people."

Perhaps we are. We are all aware of the wars, famine, climate change, and injustices in many parts of the world. 

But it's much more likely that the awareness puts us in the hopeless mindset, not the number of terrible occurrences or the likelihood of them occuring. In fact, credible estimates make clear that by sheer volume, violent crimes have declined dramatically in the last three thousand years, in terms of count and probability per person on average. That decline is estimated to be steeper at times, but the rationale is rather straightforward. A confluence of factors, many based on mutual self-interest and technological/communicative/social developments, encourage us to work together more harmoniously than ever before. 

Our awareness of trauma and tragedy en masee, however, is much much more developed than ever before as well; we hear about it constantly. I also believe it's fair to aay that our empathy for one another likely contributes to how painful the awareness has become, which then contributes to us overestimating how 'bad the world is'."

I get it, some people wait until they’re in a more financially secure position until they have children. Sometimes people aren’t in a stable relationship until they’re older. Sometimes mistakes happen. 

But it’s never in the best interests for the child for that to happen. 

Think about it. A couple in their early 40s have a child. By the time that child is a legal adult (18 in some countries, 21 in the US), their parent will be in their 60s. If that child then follows suit and has kids in their 40s, then at birth the grandchild will have grandparents in their 80s and by the time they’re a teenager; their grandparents will either be in a nursing home or deceased. 

It’s even worse when the father has a child at 50, 60 or heaven forbid, 70. The poor child won’t have many opportunities to bond with their paternal father. Imagine turning 21 and having to navigate life without a father figure because he had you too late in life.

Then there’s the health issues the child could face- the older the parents, [the higher likelihood the child will have autism, Down syndrome or schizophrenia.](https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2022/07/having-kids-later-life#:~text=The%20age%2Drelated%20decline%20in,and%2040s%20have%20healthy%20babies)


Ideally I’d believe that late 20s is probably the sweet spot for having children, the parents are in a more stable financial situation while not being too old to cause the problems listed above."

The Civil War era was marked by a tragic collision of conflicting ideologies, each side marred by actions that stained their causes. Both the Union and the Confederacy bear the burden of glorifying individuals whose legacies are tarnished by egregious deeds. On the Union side, figures like General William Tecumseh Sherman, while celebrated for his military strategy, implemented devastating campaigns that caused civilian suffering, epitomized by the destructive March to the Sea. Likewise, the Confederacy revered General Nathan Bedford Forrest, notorious for his involvement in the massacre at Fort Pillow and his leadership in the Ku Klux Klan post-war. The glorification of such figures perpetuates a skewed narrative, blurring the lines of accountability for their reprehensible actions. The blind allegiance and refusal to acknowledge the faults of these figures by certain elitist factions on both sides only compound the problem, hindering progress and perpetuating a cycle of glorification without critical examination. Controversial orders and decisions further highlight the complexity of this dark period in American history, showcasing how both sides were tainted by morally dubious actions and leaders. Something else, Lincoln was a huge piece of shit too. ""I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races."" What a fucking piece of shit.

But here are a few things that I have seen people (in my real life or online) claim, with complete seriousness, makes them ""neurodivergent"". Keep in mind that a ""diagnosis"" for these essentially only means that the person actually struggles with that thing, not that the brain functions fundamentally differently on a genetic level:

* Being a night owl (""Delayed sleep phase disorder""). 
* Anxiety
* Breakups (PTSD from heartbreak, such as being cheated on)
* ADHD

And so on and so forth. By the criteria I have seen, I am pretty sure anyone can consider themselves ""neurodivergent"". Do you have trouble getting up early in the morning? Neurodivergent. Bad breakup? Neurodivergent. Anxious about climate change? Neurodivergent.

So to parrot the words of Syndrome: ""When everyone´s neurodivergent...no one will be"". It has become a useless word.

1,2023-11-22,CMV: The US has no democracy,u/Lucky-Property4272,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18150hm/cmv_the_us_has_no_democracy/,changemyview,"I want to start by saying, I don't want to argue over the 'true' definition of a democracy. I think it's safe to say that the western idea of democracy is 'Rule by the people'. Or atleast that was the intent/how it is marketed. On Websters it does say 'government by the people' especially: rule of the majority. I think these conditions fail. The US's government/election system has alot of flaws, which prevent it from being a democracy.

Here are a few reasons:
1. Voting power is very limited, especially for the president. Every 4 years you have 2 people to vote on. Voters don't have much/equal  say in who these 2 people are.   
2. While independent parties CAN run, in practice this is impossible. The 2 parties are way too powerful. I like to think of this as similar to the 'Human Condition' argument against communism. While yes everyone CAN work, in reality it won't be like that.
3. Once elected, it is irrelevant who's in office. Let me break this down into some examples:

- Currently Biden is president, I think it's safe to say most of his voters who voted for his party are 'left' facing. I also think it's safe to say most of his voters are 'pro-choice'. Yet under his presidency rode v wade gets overturned. 
- A more recent example is Israel vs Palestine. Based on currently polls (while I know these numbers can be flawed) most Americans want to stop funding the IDF, or atleast call for cease-fire. The main issue here is, even if this was 100% true and the majority of Americans wanted action taken in anyway against Israel, not much can be done from the people. Also again, biden -> left -> pro-palestine -> government acting against.
- A clearer example is 2017's? Net Neutrality issue. A bill was coming forth to end Net Neutrality in the US, the majority of americans were against this bill, I think some votes where regular people would partake occured. Yet, again, against the majority.
4. The Senate, alot of power, stay in office forever, we don't vote for them.

My point here is America works under the illusion of choice and democracy. In reality it is an oligarchy, owned by two political parties and big companies funding them. 

Even if 90% of Americans wanted something against the benefit of this oligrachy, the oligrachy would prevent it from happening.

A true democracy allow more involvement in decisions, if the majority of americans want something there should be a clear path there. Such as voting directly on an issue like such as the ones that make news: ie. net neutrality, who we help in wars, health care, etc. Instead of being able to do nothing about it, (other than 'vote' and hope the oligarchy decides to do it)."

There is not a shortage of workers for any job in a free market. For example, there are plenty of COBOL programmers, even though the average age of COBOL programmers is over 50. If there was truly a worker shortage of COBOL programmers, the companies would have made an effort to train young people and offered tempting starting salaries until there was no longer a shortage of workers.

The beautiful thing about the free market system is that any business, if it cannot find workers, can always choose to increase salaries and attract more workers.

Any business that is truly unable or unwilling to pay enough to attract more workers will fail, as it ought to. A business unable or unwilling to pay workers a reasonable wage is a drain on society and does not deserve to exist."

- A lot of people lack basic cultural knowledge outside of the US, like history of Europe, even knowing that Spain is in Europe, not in South America. 

- Most people just speak one language (in Europe most people speak 2-3 languages, I speak 4 languages). And when they travel they REQUIRE you speak their language and almost never learn the local language even when living permanently in that country (in this regard British are similar - the entitlement!!!! )
- Racism and social issues. Fashist police force.

I once had a US boyfriend from Arizona who said I was not caucasian because I am from Spain 🤣🤣🤣🤣 So, lityle knowledge of other cultures...

- It seems like education is pretty poor. Is education free in the US? It is in Spain, at least compulsory education, so it's free up until uni, and uni is quite affordable.

-  Some people have guns in their houses? Youngsters use guns and are trained to use riffles? People go hunting with their kids??? WTF!!!! OMG!

- Consumerism as a way of life, like out of control capitalism. People are enslaved by their consuming lives. Americans come up with stupid celebrations in order to consume even more (sweet 16, baby showers, house warming, present for the wedding, anniversaries, there are many more but cannot remember now).

- The US massacres poor people in other countries for oil, but americans think is for their freedom (freedom to keep consuming the planet, I guess).

I feel the standard of living is pretty poor compared to countries in Europe. 

I am not comparing the US to Spain, of couse just by size the US has like 350 million people and Spain has 45 million, but I would never want to live in the US to be honest."

The ick thing was funny when it first started because it was poking a little bit of fun at things that are embarrassing and moments where you look silly. It somehow turned into a thing where people will identify any small flaw in another person and say “I have the ick” and use it as a reason not to date them/see them again(if it’s in the early stages of a relationship). If you can’t look past small flaws (let me emphasis SMALL) within people you won’t ever be able to be happy in a relationship, you’re way too immature. It’s fine if you don’t want to settle with someone or just weren’t feeling it, but just say that.  Everyone has flaws. This post is coming from something someone said to me the other day, they’ve been screwed over by the same person for the last X amount of years. They met someone really nice and went on a date, the person was such a gentleman (I know them) and they later went to look at their social media and saw they had very little followers. They said “that gives me the ick” and that was the end of it. I’m still furious with them because it’s honestly so petty and immature, if you don’t want a relationship just say it, stop trying to pick others apart."

Do I expect any sort of gain from this? No. I just have to say this. Everywhere I go in the internet I see the just the most vile shit imaginable women go through. Murder here, catcalling there, sexualization everywhere. Always by men. And in the comment sections, you bet there are men that deny, victim blame or both. And that stupid “not all men” shit. I think women know people. Constantly spamming it everywhere  doesn’t help anybody. It infact hurts the cause. And out of pure shame, I say “welp, thats enough of that for today” and close social media. 

Enough ranting, let’s actually speak facts here. Men and Women go through different problems, some are mutual, some are specific. Let’s take a look, shall we. 

Men: Loneliness, worse at school, wars.

 
Women: Sexualization, objectification, purity culture, catcalling, rape, getting murdered for rejecting someone, married women are the least happy demographic, marital rape, divorces can be frowned upon, income inequality, abortion rights are being taken away, just rights in general are being taken away, being taken less seriously by health services, not being allowed to go to school in some countries and a lot more I could mention. 

Are you sure women have it better than men nowadays? Of course not. Get your head out if your ass and stop saying it in every comment section imaginable. There are deep divisions and trust issues in modern society because of all the things women go through at the hands of men. Many gender issues shouldn’t just be “gotten over with”, they need to be fixed, so we as a society can begin functioning again, and start focusing on the true enemies; The Russians."

I actually saw a meme wherein a man is addressing a mystic Sadhguru. 

The man asks Sadhguru, “What is the secret to eternal happiness?” Sadhguru answers, “Do not argue with fools.” The man quickly refutes this, saying, “I disagree!” Sadhguru simply nods, then smiles, then softly says, “Yes, you are right.”

It brought a smile on my face, but more than that, it hit home for me, especially in today's world scenario, when I can see divisiveness at different levels.

Don’t get me wrong, if you see injustice on a large scale or someone is in danger, speak up. But I am talking about the everyday discussions that crop up. While some arguments are necessary and justified, most are not worth wasting our energy on a lost cause. 

But being silent or walking away, is  easier said than done. A quote from Lao Tzu says it best ""Silence is a source of great strength."" It does take a lot of self-discipline and restraint to remain silent, especially when you are being provoked or are in a conversation disagreeing with someone.

One strategy I use is not to focus on 'winning'  the argument by convincing the person of my rightness but instead focusing on silence is really golden or agreeing tp disagree. So save your priceless energy and use it where the soil is fertile and grow something good. A fight filled with empty words is not worth forfeiting your peace and happiness."

I'm mainly speaking culturally, in America. I understand other things have accelerated at tremendous speed, geopolitics, technology and such and they definitely impacted the change. But what happened?  
When I think of that era I remember it being edgy, kind of dangerous and extremely aggressive. Ill break down what I mean.   
Music - It was aggressive and violent. Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, Korn, Metallica, RaTM, DMX, Jay Z, gangster Rap, etc. Look at Woodstock '99 and the lineup. It was the era summed up. Also just look at what happened (the violence). These were mainstream and very popular artists/groups. Music back then was maybe less ""spread out"" than it is today. The internet you can find so many different artists and styles of music, however back then you were kinda limited to what was on MTV or what was on CD's. Before LimeWire for sure. FYE was the best place to find new music. It wasn't a click away and where you can find anything anyone wants to put online in any genre. It was limited to what labels would produce and market. I look through my older brother's CD's and I see the Nu Metal, Wu-Tang, Jay Z, DMX, Mobb Deep, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Dr. Dre, Nas, OutKast, Bush, Warren G, Green Day (Dookie), Stuff like that. Today, my Spotify playlists are all over the place, but those CD's and bands are what was bumping everywhere back then. The culture and the defining influences were clearer I would say. You can point to a smaller pool of influence and see what's most popular. So, what were the differences? To me that era of music was louder, and a bit more vulgar and explicit. Take Eminem for example, he was morbid and dark for the time (some songs/ not every song). The Slim Shady LP? C'mon now! It was cool to be edgy and ""tough"". Those groups all had that sound or had lyrics that promoted being Angry, Tough, Edgy, Violent. I remember being 4 years old singing Ruff Ryders Anthem and doing the DX ""Suck it"" in front of my brother's HS friends.  I see that as the background noise of that time that always just humming in the background. Also, Slow Jams! The level of r&B and slow jams was unmatched. People were getting down to that shit on the regular. No Diggity?   
Entertainment - What was on TV back then? I remember Jerry Springer which had fights and shit every show. South Park, the most cussing I've ever heard in my life lol. Also, Wrestling was extremely popular. The Attitude Era, w/ Stone Cold and The Rock. I saw that on everywhere, everyone knew the Stone Cold Stunner and the Rock Bottom. Wrestling wasn't an obscure lame thing like it is today. Also, Extreme Sports? Skating, BMX, Motocross was mainstream, and we know the culture of those sports. Its rebellious, and anti-authority. Going to the skate park and seeing a fight wasn't out of the ordinary. I definitely think being violent and getting into fights was more popular and more accepted and promoted back then. I mean, if youre somewhere and you were with your boys and other people started talking shit or causing trouble, fighting was an acceptable thing to do. There were no cell phones or anything. You could fight and it would be over right there, no one's going to film it and send it around, which inevitably makes it way to the parents and then Law Enforcement, thus a lawsuit or criminal proceedings. There was a ton more plausible deniability and ability to get away afterwards. I hear my brothers friend group tell stories to this day about yeah we were at this party or this thing and that one dude was mouthing off and Scotty punched him in the mouth and everyone got into it, cops came and we all ran down (insert random street).   
Consider today vs then - Today people can hide behind a screen and have all kind of interaction digitally. ""Cyber Bullying"" was not a thing in 2000. If you wanted to bully someone you had to physically bully them. If you wanted to talk to a girl you had to actually talk to her. You wanted to socialize? You have to make real friends in real life and hangout. There was no safety behind a screen, you had to be physically present in uncomfortable situations AND you very well may not have the means to get out of it. You might not be able to call anyone or call for a ride or whatever. Situations were more immersive.   
Back then at least for dudes there was a lot of promoting of masculinity and being soft or a bitch or a pussy was a bigger deal socially. This brings me to my next point and something to keep in mind. It WAS this generation of dudes that went to Afghanistan and Iraq to fight. Dudes who were roughly 15 to 25 in 1999. I feel dudes back then had experienced a fair share or witnessed a fair amount of fighting or physical altercation. Thats the type we had in the military during the Middle East conflicts.   
The Military Culture at the time, I can absolutely 100% hands down, without a speck of doubt in my mind, ASSURE you, was entirely different. Vets of the time, PLEASE chime in, I want to hear from you.  
A few reasons, back then you could be physical with people and it was ok. Recruits in Boot Camp, other members, it was more rugged and physical. Fighting at the time was more focused on Armed Combat. It was run less like a politically correct corporation and more like a gang with actual killers. Leadership was on board with this. Nowadays you will be sent to Mast/Chaptered faster than fuck for pulling 1/10th of the shit they did back then. Fighting in berthings/ barracks was normal. Today holy shit Youd be burned at the stake for trying to encourage that.  Today we have shifted to a new form of warfare less focused on actual combat, also the political landscape has shifted dramatically. The military culture has changed to reflect that, because old heads who know the old ways will get out/retire and new recruits join who are schooled not to act that way and know in their hearts the penalties. Back then we were in a war, so we needed that type of culture, however that time is gone and now we have people join up for the benefits who know they will never see combat. Also they didn't grow up during the era I'm speaking on, there's a good chance they have no memory of 9/11 or were born after 9/11. Think about that!  
9/11 - I wont get in the weeds but I'm sure to the people who can remember pre 9/11 from post 9/11 things were just different. After that day it's like we went down a timeline that just hasn't been good. Things took a turn on that day.   
Some of you may be too young to remember but the response from the country immediately after was lets just say ""noticeable"". It may be hard to believe, but people were United, we felt like were in this together. WE were attacked and WE would come together to do something about it. American pride and patriotism was a fervor! American Flags everywhere! ""proud to be an America"" on the radio non stop, Toby Fucking Keith had so many songs that played day and night about were gonna fuck you up. I remember seeing wanted posters of Bin Laden saying ""Wanted: Dead or Alive"". (does anyone else remember those?). Bin Laden was the most hated man in America bar none.   
If something similar happened today, I highly doubt we would see that same united response. I believe things have devolved and were simply too divided (see: diametrically opposed). Back then we can point and agree ""there's the enemy!"" (Except for when we were told were invading Iraq but that's another story!). Today were told each other are the enemy and your next door neighbor might be the enemy. Its turned internal vs external. The tools we used to spy on other nations and invade other countries were sent home and turned inward. Look at he militarization of police forces and how Spying is conducted on Americans. I digress.   
Idk, i just look back at the people and the times and wonder how are we so far removed from that today. Its crazy to exist in a time were culture can shift at an unrecognizable pace.   
I am very eager to hear your thoughts on this. TIA. "

I want to preface this by saying that i am a woman and i do want to try to change my view but i cant. So please dont get mad at this post. 

But i hate when people say that women are stronger than men cuz we go through periods and child birth. 

I dont think that either or any gender or sex is superior or inferior to the other, but i do think that there are some things that the different genders are better at. In terms of strength, men win that by a long shot. That’s not to say that all women are weak (and that would ofc be wrong to say) but women are just not stronger than men and im tired of people pretending that we are. 

Like we have “no choice” but to go through periods and birth. (Ofc you can choose not to birth a child to avoid that and you can try to stop periods, though a bit difficult, with BC or surgeries). But assuming you dont stop you period and that you want to have kids/ get pregnant, then you really have no choice/ way around it. 

These are both very hard things to do but we have to put up with them. And while some people may thrive in these situations, others Litterally can not function on their periods, throw up, cry, etc (which are all valid things and im not trying to shame anyone cuz im like this too) but it’s just not proof that we are stronger 🤷‍♀️"
1,2023-11-22,CMV: SSSniperwolf Bingo was a Bad Idea,u/00PT,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/181cwqv/cmv_sssniperwolf_bingo_was_a_bad_idea/,changemyview,"# Disclaimer

Before I get further into this, I want to clarify that *yes*, I am aware that there has been an [incident](https://youtu.be/aeMHMnOWkw4?si=S-ax21KmYIEj9xlC) around this topic that involves potentially criminal, but definitely immoral behavior on the part of SSSniperwolf. And *no*, this post does not aim to justify or express any opinions about this aspect. Otherwise, I likely would have made this post sooner, as I have been afraid that my take would be interpreted like that in the past.

The true point of this post is to argue that the actions of Jacksfilms toward SSSniperwolf are not as inherently harmless as the general public seems to believe. Note that this is **not** a claim that Jack's behavior is morally wrong.

# Context

For most of the past year (and possibly since before that), the YouTuber Jacksfilms has been running a series that is (or at least began as) a parody of the videos created by SSSniperwolf called [JJJacksfilms](https://www.youtube.com/@jjjacksfilms). This series initially focused on imitating her style in a satirical form similar to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrCE1aRP38Q). It then shifted to a format that is more transparently intended for criticism where Jacksfilms would ""grade"" her, similar to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHb6F-87A-8&t). Shortly following that, the channel shifted again to [Bingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvfpI2FiERo), an idea originally developed by a [Twitter User](https://twitter.com/Pieosaurus3/status/1684781240405151744).

The series, as Jack claims, serves to criticize the general behavior of reaction content on YouTube, specifically through the criticism of SSSniperwolf due to her large presence and support on YouTube (from both her audience and the company itself). Particularly, it attacks the conduct of using other creator's content without permission, hiding usernames, and commentary without substance (that is also perceived as not ""transformative"" in a legal sense, as the term is applied to [fair use law](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/what-is-fair-use/)). [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMjWaPsGY80) explains that.

Since that last video was posted, the JJJacksfilms channel has been far more active than the main Jacksfilms channel. In addition, there have been videos documenting and ""celebrating"" the progress made in ""The War on Stolen Content,"" such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4sJVqzTWOU) and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI0VD3Hut0Y).

Due to the [incident](https://youtu.be/aeMHMnOWkw4?si=S-ax21KmYIEj9xlC) mentioned in my disclaimer where SSSniperwolf and her sister visited and posted a picture of Jack's house, this series has once again been replaced with a format that still uses Bingo, but applied to content in general and is more focused on positive feedback than previous iterations. SSSniperwolf is no longer inherently a part of the content. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPUVa967GHE) is a good explanation, and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VUFLZnpbNw) is a good example of the new format.

# Overview

While Jack and his audience on r/jacksfilms and other spaces have been very adamant that he did nothing wrong, I think they are missing the clear issues with what he did due to it being dwarfed by the perceived negative behavior of SSniperwolf. **I believe that SSSniperwolf was correct to interpret his movement as a targeted attack toward her, even if that wasn't Jack's intention. Thus, I think the Bingo game should have been either heavily modified or discontinued earlier than it was, and not out of fear or necessity, but willingly.**

Here are the general points that I believe support this:

1. The overwhelming majority of recent content in this style has been focused specifically on SSSniperwolf, which inherently makes it targeted, no matter the reason.
2. The Bingo format does not criticize exclusively the behaviors related to freebooting. In fact, it goes quite far into things very particular to SSSniperwolf's content and not inherently wrong.
3. In his videos, Jack has directly called for and expressed explicit approval of behavior that objectively harms SSSniperwolf's channel.

These points will be expanded upon in the following sections. Then, I will contrast with a similar series made by Jarvis Johnson that has also been discontinued for unrelated reasons, [Dhar Mann Bingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03zRuwGHz74&list=PL86KsQz6tVx7d1PJXNLrZCqzCJEzeXOPW&pp=iAQB), stating why I think that one was done better.

# Targeting

[The first SSSniperwolf Bingo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvfpI2FiERo) was posted on August 3rd, 2023. Since then, there have only been 3 Jacksfilms videos on the main channel before the incident happened. One of these videos is unrelated to the SSSniperwolf drama, but the other two are directly related - one is an update on the SSSniperwolf situation, and the other talks more about other content theft channels. In contrast, JJJacksfilms has posted 33 other videos between posting the first Bingo and the rebranding, all of which have been explicitly about reacting to SSSniperwolf. These are each cut from live streams that were done on a different platform. So, the proportion of SSSniperwolf videos to non-SSSniperwolf videos is 34 to 2, or 17 to 1 in a simplified form.

This is a clear indicator of the movement being targeted - SSSniperwolf has become the face of the opposition, whether that was intentional or not. While it was said that the focus would be on her due to her being one of the most prominent examples, I find this to be excessive, especially considering the next point that a large chunk of the criticism cannot be generalized to other channels.

# Unrelated Criticism

The ""Bingo"" format only works if the content being commented on is repetitive in a number of diverse ways. However, the category of ""stealing content"" is neither of those. It is a very specific thing that is bad in a very specific way. Thus, in order to make the format work, the Bingo board was configured to include criticism of SSSniperwolf's editing style, speech pattern, the way she presents herself in the videos, the way she laughs, and even her *accent*. There's nothing inherently wrong with a shaky camera effect, Mr. Beast-style captions, using ""Bro"" as a general-use pronoun, referencing other works, or having catchphrases in general. These are all things that people might be annoyed by, but that is subjective and unrelated to content theft.

This doesn't help the case that Jack's behavior is not harmful, but this point actually has worse effects because it undermines the point that Jack is attempting to make. It actually reminds me of what people sometimes say about CinemaSins. It's common to say that this channel makes no differentiation between jokes and legitimate criticism, making the channel as a whole harder to take seriously. Similarly, Jack doesn't meaningfully differentiate between the criticism that applies to his larger point and his own pet peeves of SSSniperwolf's content, modifying the perceived identity of his series. As previously stated, the format doesn't really work without the varied ""tropes"" that her content provides, so I don't think it was ever a good idea to use it for his purposes.

# Attacks

It is often said in this type of discussion that criticism from a channel with a large audience often causes that audience to harass the target or worse, and the channel owner is somewhat responsible for that. I do not subscribe to the idea that a channel owner is responsible for their audience's behavior, especially if they take steps to discourage it. In the case of Jack's criticism of SSSniperwolf, I think he did well in this sense.

Even though there may not have been harassment involved, Jack *did* encourage and endorse behavior that attacked SSSniperwolf's channel. In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4sJVqzTWOU), he celebrates the fact that someone from his audience was able to get her to delete clips and even entire videos. While it is easy to justify this, as it was done in support of someone perceived to be a victim of content theft, I think it is imperative to understand that this is still an *attack*, based on general definitions found [here](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/attack), particularly the one that says ""to begin to affect or to act on injuriously."" While this does not directly harm SSSniperwolf, it hurts her channel's reputation and, more importantly, her ability to monetize the content found on that channel.

Claiming that your movement is wholly innocent and peaceful is much harder when it can be objectively demonstrated that your behavior causes real and tangible harm to the target. You also can't really say that said target is unjustified in interpreting the behavior that way.

# A Better Way

Now that I have detailed my problems with what Jack has been doing, I will outline a better way to criticize a content creator and make your point. I will be using Jarvis' [Dhar Mann Bingo series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03zRuwGHz74&list=PL86KsQz6tVx7d1PJXNLrZCqzCJEzeXOPW&pp=iAQB) as a concrete example of this better approach.

The first thing I want to point out is that Jarvis' purpose with this series is not to criticize a general movement like content theft - He makes it explicit that the criticism is for Dhar Mann specifically. This means that the identity of the series does not suffer from the inconsistency of Jack's Bingo Board. Anyone can take the criticism precisely as intended because the entirety of the Bingo Board works towards that intent.

The second thing is that Jarvis makes it a point to criticize only the content, not any aspect of the person. There are no spaces like ""Fake Accent"" or ""Looks Down at keyboard,"" which clearly attack mannerisms and presentation.

Thirdly, this content was produced in tandem with other content on other topics, both live and otherwise. Anyone should be able to see that Jarvis' other channels like [Jarvis Johnson](https://www.youtube.com/@jarvis) and [Jarvis Johnson! GOLD](https://www.youtube.com/@JarvisJohnsonGOLD) was active for the entire time that the Dhar Mann criticism was going on.

Finally, I want to point out that Jarvis did not do anything against Dhar Mann or his channel. In fact, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCeNZAq02Mg) (just the beginning) shows that Dhar was aware of some of the criticism that Jarvis had done and even appreciated it. It's clear that nobody was being harmed with Dhar man Bingo, while the SSSniperwolf situation involved action against her channel, and SSSniperwolf herself felt that it was harmful, given the drama."

140,2023-11-22,CMV: The ice hockey player who accidentally killed Adam Johnson during a game shouldn't be charged with manslaughter.,u/profheg_II,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/181e2jt/cmv_the_ice_hockey_player_who_accidentally_killed/,changemyview,"For anyone not aware, during a professional ice hockey game in the UK last month player Adam Johnson was killed after a collision with another player in which [his neck was cut by the other player's skate](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/ice-hockey/67253892). More recently, [the other player was arrested by police for questioning](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-67419951). He's been bailed since and nothing has been yet charged so the rest of this gets speculative, but the arrest was on suspicion on manslaughter meaning there's a chance he's going to be put on trial for this. 

The accident was filmed and there is video of it. I'll be completely upfront and say I've not watched it and don't want to, but I understand from seeing discussion around it that the other player may have deliberately fouled Johnson in a dangerous tackle. Obviously this will be debatable and opinion will differ from person to person about how out of order what the offended player did was. An intentional dirty tackle is basically the worst case scenario and the ""best"" reasoning to consider manslaughter, so that assumption is what I'm going to be arguing against. 

So let's say that the offending player knew that they shouldn't be doing what they were doing when they deliberately collided with Johnson. They didn't for a moment think he'd die as a result, but it's not mad to consider that an errant ice skate blade can do real damage. Morally culpable? Maybe. This obviously gets into a grey area around how risky a behaviour needs to be for us to say it's blameworthy if something goes wrong.  You could compare it to something like football (soccer) - deliberate dirty tackles happen frequently and if we're real about it every time it happens we know there's that as a player is pulled to the ground they may fall in just the wrong way and break their neck. This isn't hypothetical. [Wikipedia has a list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_association_football_players_who_died_during_their_careers) with well over 100 entries detailing football players who've died during a match, many of them from a sustained injury. I don't believe that other players involved in these situations typically get charged with manslaughter. Maybe there is even more at stake with skate blades flying around the place in a hockey game and there's more responsibility on the players to not behave badly. But ice hockey has a fair reputation for being aggressive and physical, and as a society we seem to normalise this. 

Maybe the moral line is just somewhere in a grey area around applying common sense, rising above whatever is normalised, and appreciating how dangerous something really is or isn't. I'm open minded to the offending ice hockey player having crossed this and being somewhat blame-worthy in principle. 

But thinking practically about him actually being prosecuted for manslaughter I still feel very uneasy, and I've realised why and I think it's because the law is being unfair within itself by considering it. Because if the core risky behaviour isn't seen as criminal when it doesn't happen to kill anyone, I don't think it should be prosecutable as manslaughter when it accidentally does. Otherwise the only variable that's being identified as criminally irresponsible is bad luck. Unless the law wants to make all ice hockey fouls criminal offenses on account of the potential danger, I don't think the justice system can claim moral coherence within itself in pursuing manslaughter when one goes wrong."

1,2023-11-22,CMV: Groups like the ADL are fighting Anti-semitism the wrong way.,u/Key-Minimum6772,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/181eu74/cmv_groups_like_the_adl_are_fighting_antisemitism/,changemyview,"Honestly, 

&#x200B;

I find the ADL's approach to fighting Anti-semitism incredible ineffective, and quite possibly be creating more anti-semitism than it would if it did not exist. I do not believe that acting like some kind of bully for businesses to remove advertisement, and demand censorship of free speech of people leads to anything else but resentment that builds in the shadows, and just keeps seeping through the cracks in society.

I believe a way better approach to fighting Anti-semitism would be to take some of the concerns the people who are spouting toxicity online, and tackle them sensible with open debates.

&#x200B;

I'll give you one example, the right wing in the U.S right now feels betrayed by Jews, after large Jewish groups removed their funding from Woke Universities since the left has turned against Israel. Yet, they never felt it appropiate to remove their funding 20 years prior when these same Universities where teaching White Hatred with curriculums like ''Critical Race Theory''. A lot of Republicans in the U.S are scratching their head wondering.. ''Wait, you could have removed this all along? Why didn't you do it when they were teaching to hate white people. Why only now that it affects Jews?''

The question in a lot of young men in the right now is.. ''Well, if Jews didn't care to help me when Universities were teaching to hate me, why should I help them now?''

&#x200B;

So I reached the conclusion, wouldn't a more effective way to combat anti-semitism, be to give a platform to Rabbis, CEOs and prominent Jewish figures to raise up and defend the interests of White people? Wouldn't that lead to a lot more appreciation towards World Jewry in Europe and U.S.A rather than just silencing everyone for anti-semitism?

Preservatives are also the only effective protection for sexually transmitted diseases AND are easy to use on the moment. I don’t get why we are looking for something that we already have.

Hamas's goal is to kill all Jews. It's right there in their charter.  
The Day of Judgment will not 

come about until Moslems fight Jews and kill them. Then, the Jews will hide behind rocks and trees, and the rocks and trees will cry out: 'O Moslem, there is a Jew hiding behind me, come and kill him."" (Article 7)  
Compromise with Hamas is impossible. The only way to resolve the conflict is to kill every member of Hamas. If the IDF can't eliminate Hamas militarily using conventional weapons, then they would be justified in using WMDs to resolve the conflict. In WW2, the war with Japan was resolved by using atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Things which could potentially change my view: 

1) Evidence Hamas and PIJ are already close to surrendering.

2) Evidence Hamas and PIJ can be degraded through conventional operations to the point where they will never again be capable of attacking Israel."
5,2023-11-22,"CMV: Hamas is significantly less trustworthy than Israel and, dare I say it, perhaps even responsible for the death of Gazan civilians.",u/Distinct-Grocery-784,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/181j9r0/cmv_hamas_is_significantly_less_trustworthy_than/,changemyview,"Hey all, I'm curious to hear what people have to say on this topic. It's so controversial that apparently, it's hard to have any civil conversation about it. But I'm genuinely curious. It appears to me that a fundamental question in the Israel-Hamas conflict is, ""Who do you trust?"" Because whoever is more trustworthy is the one likely to be in the right here. If Hamas and their evidence of ""Israeli Occupation"" is more trustworthy, then their campaign against Israel is justified. However, the opposite is also true. If Israel and their evidence of ""Hamas Atrocities"" is more trustworthy then Israel's campaign against Hamas is justified.

I'm genuinely curious because it appears almost obvious to me that the dishonest, untrustworthy one here is Hamas. It appears to me that Hamas is known for lying about civilian casualties based on at least the following accounts:

1. They deny killing civilians on October 7th despite clear video evidence otherwise from Go-Pros that have been independently verified, on their own soldiers.
2. There is independently verified evidence of them operating out of, and building tunnels in, civilian areas which they also deny.
3. A significant percentage (between 10%-30% depending on the source) of the rockets fired at Israel fail to leave Gaza, thus making it additionally difficult to identify the source of civilian deaths but I haven't seen them take responsibility for this at all. In fact I've seen people rush to blame Israel.
4. There is significant evidence of them operating while wearing civilian clothing which again makes it difficult to identify whether a death is actually a civilian or a Hamas soldier.
5. The number reported by the Hamas run Health Ministry never distinguishes between Gazan civilians and Hamas soldiers.

Israel, on the other hand, appears to be honest in its admission of firing rockets into civilian areas even though they claim to be targeting Hamas soldiers. But, especially considering the above, I'd find it difficult for people to claim they are actually targeting civilians (ethnic cleansing, is the term I hear) for the following reasons:

1. All the above (it's hard to believe they're targeting civilians when the evidence of civilians being killed in the first place is so filled with lies)
2. Israeli war technology is more focused on defense (Iron Dome, Iron Beam, etc) certainly compared to Hamas, and in general has been more reactive than offensive. Hamas leadership has even stated that they are not responsible for protecting the people of Gaza.
3. The Hamas charter has the clearly stated goal of wiping Israel off the map, while there is no comparative legal document that exists in Israel saying the same about Gaza, any of the neighboring countries, or Muslims in general.
4. Israel has done more than any other country at war ever to protect civilian casualties by dropping leaflets, giving warnings, knocking on roofs, and even creating pathways for evacuation in the very country they are at war with.
5. The Israeli educational curriculum does not include incitement of violence towards the Palestinians (or Muslims in general) as compared to the Gazan educational curriculum (see comparison below):
   1. The Gazan educational system does not mention and specifically removes all mentions of peace being an option in the region.
   2. They describe ALL of Israel as being ""occupied"", not just Gaza
   3. They encourage students to sacrifice their lives in the name of religion. Textbooks for children and early teens provide dramatic stories of martyrdom followed by an implicit call to die for the cause.
      1. The only mitigating factor here is that the Israeli educational systems also describe them as enemies but they're still specific to certain ""terrorist groups"" not ethnic cleansing.
6. 20% of Israel is Muslim and can vote in free elections while 0% of Gaza is Jewish and there are no free elections.

All the above appears to make a very strong case that Hamas is not trustworthy and would, dare I say it, even be largely responsible for civilian deaths. Hamas has recruited children (under 18) as soldiers in the past, further muddying the ""civilian death"" waters. So I'm genuinely curious to hear what people would say in response. Hopefully, I'll get a reply that objectively analyses my points rather than attacking me personally.

The general problem with war is that it's extremely difficult to develop appropriately nuanced positions. There is a conflict between the realistic, practical needs of war and the deep nuances of responsibility for every individual involved. An army can't be so nuanced that they look at every instance in the utmost depth and weigh all the evidence to determine if someone is guilty or not (whoever did that would die from the amount of time it would take to make decisions). But at the same time, they can't be so vague that they paint the entire conflict in broad strokes because then you end up killing people who are not responsible. (As an example, international law doesn't allow for the killing of civilians but isn't nuanced enough to explain what to do when enemies are entrenched in civilian areas.)

Points will be given to those providing significant qualitative differences. Everyone lies, misdirects, and makes mistakes. So what I'm looking for is strong qualitative evidence that either:

1. my points are incorrect (I don't want to get into the, ""he said she said"" arguments so please try to find independent sources unless you're quoting a reputable Israeli source that is pro-Hamas or vice versa) 
2. or that there exists evidence of the same qualitative proportion (Very important. I'm looking for an attempt to recognize the nuances), of Israel being equally untrustworthy."

First, manufacturing electric cars is very bad for the environment. Just in terms of carbon emissions it takes on average 3-5 years for an electric vehicle to be cleaner. For vehicles that last 10-15 years that’s not great.

Second electric vehicles are much more expensive. The worst polluting cars are not drive by people who can afford a new electric vehicle. People will cling to their gas guzzlers because they won’t be able to afford anything else. 

Finally, the bottlenecks in material supply mean that the production of ecstasy won’t increase but rather the states without these bans won’t have access to electric vehicles.

While this decision has historically been met with criticism and accusations of selfishness, there is no single ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ answer when it comes to the question of parenting.  However, there are various reasons why people may choose not to have children, and this should not be labeled as 'selfish' or otherwise. Not having children is not a selfish decision, but a personal one that can be the result of a range of considerations.  
Firstly, there are many couples who are physically or medically unable to have children. This could be due to infertility issues or another related medical condition. In these situations, it may not be advisable or even possible for the couple to physically have children. For such couples, it is likely they have already gone through a lot of physical and emotional difficulty, and so it would be inappropriate to label them as 'selfish' for not having children.  
It could also be the case that an individual or couple decide against having children due to deeply held personal values or beliefs. For some, the concept of parenthood entails too great of a responsibility that they are unwilling to commit to. With distinction is made between immaturity and an honest evaluation of your inner capacity, it is up to an individual to decide what is best for them. If such an assessment leads an individual or couple to the conclusion that they are not ready for children, then there is nothing wrong or selfish about that.

Problem is, nobody could ever specify how it was any different than what one expects to see happen through random chance or natural cause and effect.

When a sports team defeats another, for instance, that's simply the result of how plays unfolded, some referee calls, maybe one team was more disciplined than the other, maybe one team was simply faster and stronger, or game-planned better, maybe the ball bounced luckily. This is true even if the underdog won. None of that was ""God's plan.""

When the Allies (the 'good guys') won World War II by defeating the Axis (the 'bad guys,') that wasn't because God was favoring the right side and letting good defeat evil; it was simply because the Allies had more men, resources, weapons and advantages. If the evil, genocidal, racist, fascist Axis had had the advantages instead, then they would have won. God had nothing to do with it (nor did virtue or goodness either.) It was simply a case of a powerful side defeating a weaker side.

When one particular party or candidate wins an election, that's not God putting ""His preferred man (or woman) in office,"" that's simply the outcome of many somewhat-chaotic factors. Race, gender, events, economy, bias, news media, age, the system, grievances, looks, etc. all play a role in determining whether an Obama, Trump, Biden, Trudeau, Merkel, Netanyahu, Thatcher, Reagan or Clinton gets elected. God had nothing to do with it.

I could go on and on and give thousands of examples, but I think it's unnecessary. **Everything religious people claim that is ""God's plan"" or ""God's will"" is simply nothing but random chance, natural cause-and-effect probability.**

There is a clear, nearly evident difference in the discourse on Reddit as compared to other apps, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. The language used by the users is strikingly different.

Its as if the the masses are incapable of nuanced conversation on other platforms. 
Even the content itself is of a higher quality on Reddit. 
For example, Reddit's quality of ""short form"" entertainment often includes snips from Tik Tok, but of the original content that is similar, the quality is more... Appreciative and thought out, or observant. 
Where as tik tok has a pride on chaotically edited videos for the sake of being chaotically edited. Someone else may have to chime in and explain their perspective on the chaotic editing for the sake of chaotic editing. 
Almost as if those incapable of expressing nuanced driven conversation don't have any interest in an app like Reddit. 
So, am I a smug arrogant condescending elitist? Or is there some truth to my argument. Can you change my view?"

No different than a schizophrenic making up their own god.

If someone were to believe strongly in something else without support, but it couldn’t technically be proven wrong, such as their being a small green alien at the center of the sun, they’d be crazy.

I'm not totally convinced this is *all* positive.

TIMES.

Allow me to explain: people operate based on a hierarchy of importance that they have developed over time either consciously or sub-consciously. If you are doing something right now (like reading a reddit post), it is because you want to be doing that. Nobody is forcing you to read it. That is level 1…lets go a little deeper: “No way man, I work 60 hours a week to provide for my
Family and I HATE my job, but I sacrifice personal enjoyment for the sake of my family having a roof over our heads.” Right, in this case, the person working the job that they hate is choosing to do so because their hierarchy of importance that they’ve developed is telling them that providing for their family/ their family not needing to need for anything financially is what will bring them the most overall satisfaction. After all, they made the choice to start a family (or at least to stick around if they had a whoops baby), nobody forced them to do so, and millions of people are actively choosing to not do so. At any time, if they so desired they could: #1 abandon their family and start a new life of some kind #2 choose to start a business/ new job that they are much more passionate about but may make them far less money #3 quit working entirely and choose to live some sort of homeless/ nomadic lifestyle, or honestly just an endless array of other options.

There is no, “I need to”. I need to is entirely based on whatever you have decided is most important to you..based on whatever it is that you WANT to be doing. Maybe at the tippy top of your hierarchy is a desire to please others..maybe its a desire to stay safe/ out of harms way..maybe its to be seen as a leader in your community..who knows!

“I dont have time” does not exist. “I want to but i cant” doesnt exist. You create your own value system, and essentially, end up doing exactly what it is that you want to be doing in life.

1,2023-11-22,CMV: Ghosting is a normal and acceptable form of conflict resolution between any two parties,u/sir_aken,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/181qipn/cmv_ghosting_is_a_normal_and_acceptable_form_of/,changemyview,"I guess this might be an aggressive take, but I was recently listening a discussion on the topic in which everyone in the conversation saw ghosting as immature, petty, and downright morally disgusting.

I strongly disagree.

I think ghosting (the act of breaking off communication unexpectedly with another person — going no contact for a long time), is a perfectly fine way to end a relationship because fundamentally, you don’t really have any social obligations to anyone _unless_ you’ve signed some type of contractual relationship with them.

For example, you _shouldn’t_ ghost an employer, or your husband/wife, or your business partner because in these cases, there are likely specific contractual arrangements between you and the other person. Note, the contract doesn’t have to be _written_, it just has to be explicit, as in properly discussed at some point in time.

On the other hand, a long time friendship, a relationship/situation ship or just an acquaintance is completely fair play. I don’t owe you anything in any of these relationships and you don’t owe me anything either. Anything that we do with each other is out of the grace of our hearts and it’s not morally disgusting to _not_ extend any grace. Any other expectation is a covert contract and in my opinion, manipulative. 

For a more concrete example, I used to have a friend and I made a joke that offended her. She called me out on it and strongly disapproved of those types of jokes. I profusely apologized and mentally noted to never hang out with her again. I simply found other people who I could make my jokes with.

That being said, I’m open to any flaws in the way I’m thinking and whether I’m being a bit harsh."

The root of it is that I, a spanish person(slightly white skin tone but southern european, if you know you know) share a home with 2 indian guys, and I told my mate I think one of them may be on the racist side towards me

Her argument is that indian people as people of color cant be racist against me because I lean ""white"" and I think its the most stupid thing ive ever seen. 

She works in university and has this academic definition of racism as ""prejudice+power"", which I think its just an excuse to allow for certan racism. First of all, I live in Canada so both me and my roommates are foreigners and not part of the ""power"" racial group in the country(I would never identify myself as white)at least at first glance. Even then, in Canada there is a huge indian population, hundred fold the population of my fellow southern european people. And in the house, there are 2 of them, and 1 of me, so both outside and inside the house you could say they do hold more power

Also, would taking that definition mean that the same person can be racist or not depending on where they are? If me and my roommates were in India and not in Canada, they would instantly turn racist the second we pass the border?

I dont even want to touch the topic of racism between black people and white people, but redditis very america-centric so when discussing racism I see people tend to only talk about whige people and black people in America. Nevertheless, the same stated above would apply. How could a black person only be racist if they happen to be in an south saharan African country where their racial group is majority?

My main argument is pretty simple and I think leaves no holes, literally everybody can be racist to everybody, theres a thousand races in this world and any discrimination because of race is racism.

The reason men dating teenage girls is wrong is because of the power imbalance they have over them, being older as well as men. That does not apply to women because we live in a patriarchy and the power imbalance older women have over younger men is balanced by their maleness, which gives them more power over the older women, both socially and due to their physical strength. Therefore, it's not the same thing and there's nothing wrong with women dating male teens, even minors if they're not too young although that's more of a grey area."

Is it even possible to criticise Israel without being labelled antisemite. Am I allowed to ask any question or make any constructive criticism of an individual Jewish person without it meeting the terms of the definition?

I'll be honest: It's much easier to criticize Arabs. I've lived in Kuwait and Dubai and I've had very heated discussion with Egyptians, Palestinians and Lebanese about how they have been lead by idiots and how PLO/Hamas don't have their best interests at heart. No matter how heated it gets, I have found them to be largely educated, eloquent people that don't hold grudges at the end of a discussion. 

With the latest flare up of this perpetual conflict, I have questions about the conduct of the State of Israel and the interactions between Jews and their neighbors in the region but I am scared to ask questions without being labelled an anti-Semite, as per the definition in the link above.

Questions, for example, about the necessity of spitting on Christians, the ever expanding settlements and whether there is any Palestinian grievance that the average Jew/Israeli is willing to concede as legitimate?

But I feel everyone of these could be labelled anti-Semitic and I want to know if there is an sub/avenue/platform where I can ask Jews such questions without causing offence?"

I'm obsessed with having an early join date. For example: Steam first came out September 12, 2003. Which means there are some people out there now with a ""20 Years of Service"" badge. This is a huge flex. You are the real OG. I didn't join Steam until I built my first PC in 2013. So that's an entire decade after Steam was a thing. So I've got a measly 10 year badge.

I actually bought and paid for a Steam account from a random guy online for $20 US dollars. I had about 90 games on it, but the real reason I bought it from him was the fact that it had an earlier join date. (2006) I used it for a few years, bought a bunch of games on the account, and sure enough - he took it back. Since the account was his originally, there's nothing I can do. 

I also, for some reason, didn't join Discord until 2019. Don't know why. But now that's bugging me too. I want to buy a discord account from someone made before 2017, but I just know the same thing is going to happen again - Someone will just take it back."

To give you a quick overview of my life, I'm mildly autistic (diagnosed at 14) and was bullied relentlessly from grades 4-8 and more passively in high school, and I'm not even gonna count all the other passive aggressive shit that I encountered in my undergrad years. My parents also withheld my autism diagnosis for 5 years until a crisis nurse told me at an ER, at which point it was too little too late as it seemed like I had already passed the point of no return mentally. I say this as someone who's currently on his 12th therapist after being in therapy for 9 years.

Fast forward to today in my final year of my master's and hoping to do a PhD. As for the location, I'm probably going to try my luck with Europe not only because I feel like I need to justify my failures of not being an MD or a lawyer (or some other rich profession) in North America, but also for another reason.

You see, when I was looking at potential supervisors in Canada and the States (I'm from Toronto btw) something that kept running rampant in my mind was this. Obviously, there will be people that are considerably better looking than others (which I get also is a largely subjective matter) just like every area of life. But the thing that I felt like I needed to express that honestly can apply to most contexts outside of the academic world is this. 

When I, for example, see the profile pics of attractive professors (especially married ones), some of the biggest thoughts that instantly come to my mind are ""oh they were most likely some kind of popular/cliquey/basic jerk that would have bullied me/treat me like crap or never bother to connect with me if we grew up together"", or ""their kids are/will be just as vile and cruel as them"" or ""they don't know the definition of true pain and suffering like I do"" which makes me avoid reaching out to them and focus primarily on reaching out to those that I find to be less attractive, even if one of the attractive ones share research interests with me.

Now I'm using academics as examples here, but I feel like I experience these feelings with most other good looking adults (especially news reporters, sports analysts, finance people, or healthcare workers etc.). I have held on to these thoughts for the longest time ever since I emerged a completely different person from the hell that was high school and felt the need to really express them, and I thought this was the best place to do so. 

I also would like to make another thing clear: if I see an attractive adult, but they, for instance, are of some kind of minority (race, LGBTQ+, neurodivergent etc.) then these thoughts immediately disappear, probably because my mind jumps to the idea that they at least know what it's like to be discriminated against and bullied like me."

Poutine is extremely overrated

As a culinary enthusiast, I can't help but express my reservations about the widespread acclaim for poutine. While this Canadian dish has gained international popularity, it falls short when compared to the sophisticated street food offerings from vibrant culinary traditions like India and Thailand.

Poutine, with its seemingly simple combination of fries, cheese curds, and gravy, has been elevated to a status that overshadows the rich and diverse world of street food found in other parts of the globe. Take a stroll through the bustling streets of India, and you'll encounter an explosion of flavors and textures that far surpass the limited palette of poutine.

From the aromatic and spicy chaats to the delectable variety of dosas, India's street food scene is a celebration of culinary complexity. Thai street food, with its bold use of herbs and spices, offers a symphony of taste that leaves poutine in the shadows of gastronomic innovation.

While poutine may have its charm, its simplicity pales in comparison to the intricate blends of flavors found in the street food of India, Thailand, and beyond. Let's not get swept away by the poutine hype and instead explore the diverse and sophisticated world of global street cuisine."

Formatting as bullet points to  (try to be) be quick. Will use some examples mentioning dogs, as often times people default to how much better dogs are. I know there are equal cat and dog lovers and this post is not directed towards them. (Or anyone with allergies/conditions/intense phobia, etc.; that’s different)

1. You can’t deny cats are fucking adorable. 

Anyone who says otherwise is an idiot. Don’t be pulling out ugly pictures of cats when there are equally ugly pictures of other animals and probably more of the type of person who would say this.

2. “Cats are a mess; I don’t want to live with tons of hair and scoop up their shit or have them destroy my furniture”- this came from a dog owner at my work! 

If you’re a dog owner, you have no business saying anything even close

No one’s saying to have a pet cat; if you’re using this as a random excuse- you better be a robot who doesn’t eat/shit/pee/sleep. 

3. “All the cats I’ve met are vicious”

Just google “dog attack on child” and tell me “not all dogs are the same! It’s the owner!” - nothing else to say, but:

If a cat attacks you, you probably provoked it. If they didn’t; well, how would you feel if a dog bit you unprovoked due to fear? This is not a reason to hate cats. I understand phobias and am not saying you need to cuddle with Garfield or even be around cats. Do you hate all humans cause someone punched you? You got problems if you say “yes”. 

4. “Cats carry weird diseases- cat scratch fever, bites etc”. 

Google “animal bite (pet) infection”. Dogs also carry a huge risk; people also have reptiles as pets which carry a wealth of microbes. This is not unique to cats 

5. “Cats are boring and not as fun as dogs”

I disagree, but I can see why people would want a more active, social pet (generally speaking). I challenge these people to spend a day with a sweet cat and see how they feel after. Still bored? Cool- but don’t hate cats. 


Other benefits of cats:

- no need to take outside 
- live longer than most pets; many years of love 
- can be left alone with food for a couple of days 
- extremely clean 
- they are HILARIOUS
- adopting a cat means they are often litter trained already 
- do well in pairs (generally)
- if you’re nice, they will make biscuits for you 

Not saying you have to LOVE or even LIKE cats. But if you’re seriously going to be a dick and say you hate them, well…. I question how you treat other fellow humans

There was jews also under ottoman rule though a small percentage,  however they aren't consider Palestinians even though some were referred to as Palestinian jews.The usage of the label Palestinians today usually denotes arabs in the west bank and Gaza even though there's technically jewish Palestinians, Palestinians in Jordan, syria , Lebanon and almost 2 million Palestinians living in israel. There is no distinct people nor has there ever been a sovereign state called Palestine. There has only been territories ceded to arabs that don't control their air , can't build a military , limited on resources provided to them by Israel etc.

According to even Arabs themselves 

""The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct 'Palestinian people' to oppose Zionism. ""For tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa. While as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan."" - (PLO executive committee member Zahir Muhsein, in a 1977 interview with the Dutch newspaper Trouw.)  
  
“There is no such country as Palestine. ‘Palestine’ is a term the Zionists invented. There is no Palestine in the Bible. Our country was for centuries part of Syria. ‘Palestine’ is alien to us.

A lot of people, including political commentators, make the argument that due to the massive number and percentage of civilian casualties, we must support Gaza over Israel. They make the argument that Israel is indiscriminate in their bombings and purposefully target civilian infrastructure. However, these people are most likely the same ones as to support the atomic bombs US used on Japan, along with the burning of Tokyo. Technically, that was also indiscriminate killings of civilians, but that was seen as justified, and I agree. Even if the killing of civilians especially children is regrettable, it's also natural for a country to value the lives of their own citizens over those of the enemy country. I am still pro palestine, but I think the ""Israel killed so many gazans"" argument, is not a good one. Rather, we should be concentrating on the occupation, the blockade, the displacement of Palestinians and then stealing their lands."

This would be a democrat win overall. The major fear is that the poor and marginalized would be less inclined to get voter ID. This might be true, but Democrats are also really good at voter outreach. How hard could it be to pivot the voter outreach machine to help get people ID cards *and* out to the polls? Plus, when someone has an actual voter ID, as opposed to merely registering, they’re likely more inclined to actually vote because they have that sunk cost. 

Republicans love to support voter ID laws because they think minorities are either too poor, illegal, or stupid to file the paperwork necessary to get voter ID. But I sincerely doubt that the right-wing has a monopoly on the degenerative. Rather, I think democratic supporters would be more inclined to comply with voter ID laws over republican supporters. 

Also, I think it’s a good idea because then republicans could never after cry foul after every election. Trump tried to use a classic 3rd world country strategy and claim the election was fraudulent. This is easy for a despot to do because it’s easy and not falsifiable. 

You can call your opponent a cheater at any time during an election and it immediately shifts the conversation away from the policies & issues, and it puts the accused on the defensive. Very easy. 

It’s also impossible to disprove, at least to the believers. Every court ruling, every investigation, every inquiry, every price of proof to the contrary is just another element of the fraud. Retroactive fraud is hard to discredit. The election already happened, there *werent* widespread voter ID laws, and fishy things happens with mail-ins. Strong Voter ID laws would dispel the myth of the fake, fraud election *before* the election happens. 

Or at least it would be one less reason to believe election fraud conspiracies. How could republicans still cry foul if they *still* lose even after everyone has an ID?

Finally, unrelated to politics, Americans need voter ID because the social security number is insanely insecure. I know the SSN isn’t technically the national citizen ID number, but come on, it totally is. Americans need a different citizen ID number, one that is harder to steal in the digital age. Just 9 numbers, to be fair it was the 30s when the system was developed but…it’s almost the 30s again?!? This is Insanely poor security in our digital age, this nation *needs* a better citizen ID number and what is more important than voting in a democracy? Just tie the citizen ID number to the Voter ID number and make them both far more encrypted than the 9 digit SSN."

I believe cats are evil creatures.  


&#x200B;

I see them as four-legged furry demons that have found an evolutionary niche, a parasitic relationship via which they manipulate parts of the human brain. We, ourselves, evolved to heed the call of infants and be concerned for their safety. They shift their pitches when meowing to elicit this response in you as a way to abuse your empathy and feed off your resources and attention while providing nothing of value in return.

  
So, while I have gone out of my way to create a shelter on my land, and leave spare left-overs for stray cats, I never respect or attend their calls (Unless they are actually in some serious danger). I only leave food whenever I feel like it. I don't look at them; I don't allow my attention to wander away from my daily routine for their own amusement or satisfaction. 

I find it to be a betrayal of my own spirit, to let them abuse my limited time on this Earth. I refuse to allow my attention be seaped away by lesser cretures, keeping me away from what I believe, I must do. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Convince me cats are not inherently evil, and that I should pay attention when they demand it just because they feel like it.

Israel after 3 weeks failed to take over north of gaza, could not have rescued but one hostage (who BTW hamas denies it ever held and suspiciously happens to be a lone soldier and not a civilian as what Israel claims most hostages are). Israel only  managed to genocide 5000 children and storm a hospital while  failing to provide concrete evidence of it being a hamas base to justify such barbaric violation of Geneva conventions. 

All the while Israel claimed to suffer 70 causalities which BTW means they exceed idf casualties in the in the 6 weeks 2014 gaza war. Videos from hamas mowing down Israeli soldiers and damaging tanks place doubts on such number.

Israel failed all of its objectives: could not destroy hams, could not rescue hostages, Israel public lost faith with their government and had to change its stance from ""no negotiations with terrorists and you must release hostages unconditionally"" while hamas achieved its goals by still being an organized fighting force and managed to force Israel to sit in negotiation table release palestinian hostages and form a ceasefire. 

 The fact Israel changed its stance drastically proves they are also lying about their casualties which should atleast exceed the hundreds to justify such actions. Israel could be simply be hiding true number of deaths from media even if they told their families. 

If Israel decides to continue the war untill hamas is completely, it will be their Vietnam war."

The sheer hypocrisy and double standards have been eye opening. 

Perhaps I just spend too much time on social media and not all leftists are the way they present themselves on said platforms, but recent weeks have told me that maybe it’s not limited to some loud, viral voices on Tik Tok, especially when they start glorifying the man who committed 9/11, or excusing the murder of thousands of civilians.

1,2023-11-23,CMV: Israel is not committing genocide.,u/Dean-Advocate665,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/182bvwj/cmv_israel_is_not_committing_genocide/,changemyview,"Now let me preface this, are they committing war crimes? Yes, there is very little doubt over that. Crimes against humanity? Also likely yes. But genocide? No. 

This has frustrated me in recent days where people online just throw around the word genocide like it means nothing. Genocide has a very particular meaning, and it isn’t just people dying in a war. It is the deliberate killing of a large number of people from an ethnicity or nation with the *intent* of *destroying* that race or nation. 

Genocide has happened, according to the UN, three times before. Once during WW2, once in Rwanda and once during the Balkan wars of the late 90s. There are debates over whether the Turkish committed a genocide against the Armenians in the early 1910s, but that’s another point all together.

My point is, actual genocide, in the history of humanity has happened only a handful of times. And labelling every single war as having one nation committing a genocide against the other greatly diminishes the gravity of this word.

The word genocide literally did not exist until 1944, being the combination of the Greek words genos and cide. 

Are Israel committing a genocide against the Palestinians? Well if they are they are certainly doing a poor job of it. If they wanted the Palestinian state destroyed then why have they not invaded the west bank as well as Gaza? Why have they, previously to October 7th, allowed a Palestinian state to exist at all? 

They are brutal with their methods, yes. They displace thousands, yes. All the things you will claim in the comments, I most likely agree with you. But genocide, no, they are not doing that. They are fighting a war, that is how war is fought. 

I believe this is in part due to many people my age (16-30) have generally seen not much war. The Iraq war is in recent memory, but that was not during the time of social media. This war is unique in that every single act is documented, leading people to believe Israel are being especially harsh when that is simply how war is. Do I think it should be that way? No. But no good arises from labelling their actions as being causes of genocide.

The term genocide needs to retain its importance in being used for the worst humanity has ever gotten. It is the extermination of whole races on scales hardly seen. It is 800,000 killed in a hundred days (Rwanda). It is soldiers killing thousands of boys of a certain race (Serbia). It is the construction of camps for the sole purpose of killing people.

Genocide is not indiscriminate air strikes, genocide is not a siege. Genocide is not even killing women and children. Genocide is doing all of that on a nationwide level with the goal of seeing a race gone.

If someone can explain to me how Israel are committing a genocide I will gladly agree. And again, I must reiterate, this is not defending their actions in any way. I think what they’re doing is wrong, I simply hate seeing such an important word be misused on such a wide scale."

The offer should stand until Gaza is no longer a war zone.

Until then, Gaza is incredibly unsafe, and it is immoral not to offer civilians in Gaza a way to survive the war.

Any ‘offer’ to let Palestinians leave Israel-Palestine, as an alternative, is understandably very unappealing. There is only one place Gazans can temporarily shelter without fear that Israel won’t let them return: Israel itself.

Afghans and Iraqis living in the U.S. can confirm that it is not unprecedented for a country to welcome in civilians from places where it wages war. Different situations, but still a sort of precedent.

The temporary housing would be in transit camps, somewhat like those Israel set up to accommodate waves of Jewish immigrants in the past (not a glorious history, but better than being bombed), and well secured. People living there would not be allowed to bring weapons with them, and they would not be allowed to travel around Israel. Israelis know that some Gazan civilians participated in the October 7 attack and understandably will not welcome people from Gaza into Israeli cities.

UNRWA and Israel would provide food, water, shelter, and medical care for the residents of this temporary housing. With Palestinians sheltering on its soil, partly at its expense, Israel would have an incentive to help people return to Gaza (once that is safe) in a way it simply wouldn’t if they were staying in another country.

Symbolically, Gazans accepting this option would be ‘returning’ to Israel, even if temporarily, and even if not to the towns in Israel where their grandparents and great-grandparents once lived. The opposite of the ‘second nakba’ that so many Palestinians fear, it would be a symbolic kind of ‘reverse nakba’.

While I think Egypt also has an obligation to open its doors to anyone who wants to find safety there, I’m not arguing for that here because a) it’s a proposal that is already in the public discourse, b) Egypt has no control over when the violence in Gaza will end, and c) Palestinians would be right to fear that Israel might never let them return to Gaza from Egypt. Egypt is Gaza’s neighbor (and a huge country with 50 times Gaza’s population), has previously occupied Gaza, and has blockaded Gaza for the last 16 years. I don’t think any country should turn away anyone fleeing violence, and I think Egypt’s refusal to help Palestinians is deeply immoral. And practically speaking, because Egypt is an order of magnitude larger than Israel, Egypt can probably take in far more Palestinians, far faster than Israel can. But what I am focused on here is what Israel can do to help civilians survive the war it’s waging, given its intent to keep fighting, and given Palestinians’ fear of being locked out forever if they leave."

I often hear the idea that certain groups of people have the inherent right to any group of land because ""they were there first"", and I hear this regarding many groups like native Americans, the Jewish state, or others.

But the reality is that nobody has any inherent right to a piece of land. Maps are drawn through war, and territory belongs to whichever group can conquer it. Some people may be forgetting that because the borders of western nations haven't been redrawn for a while.

Just as the Comanche conquered land in America's southern territory and took it from the Apache, the American government conducted a series of wars against the native Americans and took land from them.

Japan used to be numerous states but a man by the name of Oda Nobunaga led a series of conquests in order to unite Japan into a single nation. He died, but his goal was fulfilled by some other individuals.

We see the same thing happening right now in Ukraine. If Russia can take it then it's their territory. But Ukraine seems to be quite capable in defending themselves, so they get to keep ownership of the territory. And the same thing is happening in Gaza right now. If Hamas can defend the territory then they can keep it, but otherwise they might lose it.

This might sound insensitive but this is just the way the world works and is how it has always worked. Your right to a piece of property is upheld by the laws of your country.

As if me not victimizing myself and trying to cause a problem on something that is completely harmless such as someone’s own personal “hair” is me being stupid or “succumbing to white people stealing what “we created”,  which isn’t true. I just feel a lot of Us blacks victimize a situation that utterly has none of our concern. I think it’s cool non blacks are fascinated with bits of black culture I don’t see the problem in people expressing that . Am I wrong for thinking that? Why the hell are we so worried about what another person does to their hair. Let them be happy and stop turning everything into a history lesson when it doesn’t even need to be. The more we focus on bullshit the longer we will stay in it. I understand when things actually NEED concern though but claiming and getting upset and calling a white person the word “gross” and saying it’s cultural appropriation over a hairstyle??

Support group sub starts with good intentions, it starts out ok, a lot of people with a shared problem gather in one place and realize they have shared behaviors that are often contributing to said problem. The people who are capable of recognizing and changing their behavior do and move on from the sub; the people who don't stick around and poison the well by sharing bad attitudes and behaviors without realizing it. These behaviors then become normalized within the group and slowly the subreddit becomes a group where these behaviors are cheered on and going against them is mass downvoted.

I caught myself using a lot of these but realized that most of them were just enabling me and were FULL of crazy people incapable of changing and deleted the burner i used to post on them. 

Not gonna name any specific subs but I already know a few are coming to mind for you if you're reading this. I really want to think theres a sub out here this doesnt apply to excluding support groups for things that are out of one's control (illness, loss of loved ones, assault etc)."

Then it hit me. This is kind of pathetic. I’m not talking about men who travel or work overseas and meets their wife in the process. I’m talking about people who specifically hunt for wives overseas.

It appears to me that men who specifically seek out “foreign women” on foreign lands to marry largely proclaim that they are tired of women with “western values” (?), or overweight women, or western divorce laws, or women with inflated sense of well being through social media, etc. Some specifically say that they have a lot of money and have no trouble finding women in the west but prefer “traditional values.” At the same time, they do not want “gold diggers” from out of state. But to me, desirable foreign women who are not gold diggers would have little trouble attracting their counterparts in their home country. Why would these attractive, desirable foreign women marry someone who share absolutely nothing in common with them and have language barriers with? Those women with “traditional values” that these passportbros seek will adhere to their traditional values and marry their own kind. If what they mean by “traditional values” is simply being obedient, then that’s just gross. Western divorce laws are not unfair either. The alimony/child support law goes both ways, and rewards non-income producing partner who made sacrifices for the other for a prolonged period of time.

Men who are desirable, either with decent personality, looks, or money, should have little trouble attracting their counterparts in their own country one way or another.

I'm tired of feeling bad for elderly people who fall victim to call center scammers.,u/MissPeach77,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/182kslx/cmv_but_hear_me_out_im_tired_of_feeling_bad_for/,changemyview,"I am currently in school for IT/Computer Science, eventually wanting to go towards cyber security certifications. I’m sure you have seen these YouTube scambaiters who are computer pros, confront these (mostly Indian) call centers/scammers, and try and stop scammers from robbing people (mainly elderly) of thousands of dollars.  
  
Now, if someone is elderly and is suffering mental and cognitive decline such as Alzheimer’s, Senility, Dementia, etc., that is completely different and not who I’m referring to here. But if an elderly person still has their wits about them and falls for these scams, I’m losing any type of sympathy.  
  
I will give two major benefits of a doubt before I get to my feeling on this. #1, perhaps someone older might not know that companies like Amazon, Microsoft, PayPal, etc. will not call you. I have NEVER been called by any of these types of large companies unless I reached out to their official numbers or websites and requested a call regarding an issue. #2, perhaps the first part of these typical scams can fool someone who didn’t grow up in the computer era. So when these scammers tell them that there was a fraudulent charge to their account and they want to refund the “victim,” but need remote access to their computer, have the person login to their online banking, have the person type themselves the amount of the refund (but behind the scenes quickly change the page script to make it appear that the victim typed too much money, and now they must pay back the “company,” for the extra amount.  
  
This right here is where I stop feeling sympathy. I don’t care how old you are, if you are mentally all there, then from this point on, you don’t need technological or computer skills (your life experience from being wise with age) should let you know that not only would a large company like Amazon, Microsoft or PayPal not be able to just fix the mistake on their system end (plus they wouldn’t have needed access to your computer for that, or have you type the refund amount yourself), but they wouldn’t have you pay the money back by going to Target and either send them gift cards, or go to the bank, specifically telling the “victim” to lie to the teller if they ask why they are withdrawing a large sum of money, but then also tell them once they have the cash, to wrap it in tinfoil, stick it in a book, and then mail it to some random address.  
  
A large company like Amazon wouldn't do that, but neither would a dry cleaner you owed money to down the road, ask you to pay money that way. Amazon can handle refunds through their system. They don’t accept payments by you sending them gift cards or cash wrapped in tinfoil."

Note: I explain the following in an Asian perspective.

1. Studygrams are a waste of time: Some studygrams are decorated beautifully, they put a lot of effort on creating his/her Instagram page and try their best to gain followers. If your ultimate purpose of studygram is to get better results, why don't put those time on study/relax?

2. Studygrams cause involution: Some studygrams share their study content, timetable and daily study time. As one purpose of PUBLIC studygrams is to let other studygrams owner see your effort, this cause competition and finally every studygram daily study time increases.

3. Most importantly, studygrams are one of the hidden reason why teenager's suicide rate in Asia is so high IN MY OPINION. Teenagers in Asia love scrolling Instagram. However, due to promotions and/or Instagram algorithm, teenagers may read studygram's contents. Some teenager (the 'lazy' ones or even studygrams owners) feel hopeless and they may commit suicide (RIP)

I appreciate their effort on academics, however they just cause harm to themselves and they are a reason of high suicide rate. I hope studygrams should not be seen PUBLICLY.

61,2023-11-24,CMV: The Ukrainian Army should consider launching a ground offensive north into Russia with the goal of seizing border towns and Russian land to trade for Ukrainian land.,u/Litwa1918,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/182laya/cmv_the_ukrainian_army_should_consider_launching/,changemyview,"It's no secret that Russia and Ukraine are in a type of stalemate, with no side able to decisively win over the other power, and the war has turned into a 21st century version of WWI.  The way stalemates are broken usually come down to a revolutionary change in tactics, or technology.  It's clear the US West's support for Ukraine has its limits, and unless we want to seriously arm them with long range missiles, aircraft, and mass produce artillery, this conflict isn't going to change.  

One option which has not been considered is a full scale attack on Russia itself.  The ""West"" has largely discouraged attacks inside Russia over fears of Russia escalating the conflict, however, Russia has proven itself over and over that it has no means to do so.  

1. The Russian/Ukrainian border is lightly defended.  Russia has over 95% of its total military inside Ukraine, it has had to leave its borders lightly defended as a result.  Ukraine has proved this time and time again by launching several raids into Russian border towns over the summer, one of which lasted over 3 days before being pushed back into Ukraine.  The Wagner group proved internal Russian security is lacking during Prighozin's coup.  
2. Because the border is lightly defended, and a ground invasion unlikely, Ukraine would have the element of surprise against a lightly armed Russian defense force.  This would allow Ukraine to hopefully make rapid gains and dig in before Russia could organize a counter attack.  Russia would be forced to pull resources from occupied Ukrainian territory to defend itself, weakening its defenses against the Ukrainian army inside Ukraine.  
3. It would better protect Ukrainian border cities such as Kharkiv from constant Russian shelling.  While Russia has not been able to directly threaten Kharkiv after Ukraine successfully defended the city and later pushed East, it still lobs random missiles and artillery at the city.  
4. Any ground invasion would not have the goal of regime change or Russian capitulation, more so leverage in negotiations.  It's simply unrealistic to think Ukraine would be able to advance on Moscow or significantly deep inside Russia, any land invasion would be limited to border towns, and possibly Belgorod.  
5. The US has more than indicated it would join the conflict on Ukraine's side if Russia is to use nuclear weapons.  While invading Russia itself would be an escalation on Ukraine's part, it is far from the level of using nuclear weapons, and nothing the Russian military would not be able to conventionally manage.  Russia has also not escalated the conflict despite numerous shipments of high tech Western weapons, German and American main battle tanks, and the US preparing to send F16s.  Ukraine has also launched numerous attacks inside of Russia with no change in Russian tactics either.  I don't see why this would change the status quo.  
6. It would have a destabilizing effect on Russia, possibly forcing Putin to announce full mobilization, which would lead to another wave of young Russian men emigrating.  The conflict would still be far away from most Russian cities where daily life would not change much, therefore I believe the ""rally around the flag"" effect would be limited.  To back this up, Ukraine in the past few months conducted a series of drone attacks on Moscow, and the population remained apathetic to the war.  If Ukraine attacking your city with drones was not enough to get you to join the military, I doubt a few villages on the Ukrainian border being occupied by Ukraine will change your mind.  
7. If both sides are too dug in, this would give Ukraine the chance to strengthen its position when negotiations occur.  Russia will want its land back, as does Ukraine, sounds like a fair trade to me.  "

Then and now, Christians swear other religions are trying to convert people, but from what I've seen it's a projection. Christians think their way is the best way and their God is the most accurate one. Jehovah's witnesses, too.

I've heard other religions say ""I will pray for you"" or ""God be with you"", etc. But from my experience, people who believe in God/Jesus just go on and on. Whether it be about repenting, how they got saved, or how you should pray to be free from sin, etc. They almost always start preaching to you. 

I live in a heavily populated Muslim area, almost always do they discuss their relationship with Allah, only if the conversation calls for it. It seems the structure of the religions are different as well. With Islam it's about your direct relationship with Allah. I've never had a Muslim start campaigning Allah to me, mid-convo.

I feel the structure of Christianity lacks integrity, and subsequently the practicer seeks validation. Christians have a heavy sense of entitlement and judgment, too. They love to compare to other religions while they're not perfect at all, but because they believe in God, it's their jail free card.

1,2023-11-24,"cmv: time travel is nonsense because time is a measurement, not a plane of existence",u/IronSmithFE,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/182mpza/cmv_time_travel_is_nonsense_because_time_is_a/,changemyview,"i do not protest these two points: 

1) when an atom is moving it experiences fewer oscillations compared to atoms that aren't moving.

2) when atoms are in the midst of a dense mass of other atoms, all the atoms in the mass slow when compared to atoms in less dense groupings.

neither of these phenomena leads me to believe that time is a thing, nor property of a thing, nor a plane of existence within which anything can traverse. 

my conception of time is a standard of the movement and progress/decay of one thing relative to another, if either thing in any specific compared relationship were manipulated so that the expected relative outcome was altered, that would not be time travel.

if i use a standardized weight to measure a mass i must specify under what circumstances i make the comparison. if i alter those circumstances for future measurements i have to do some math to compensate. i cannot say i am creating or destroying mass/gravity by altering the circumstances of the measurement.

if i say that a fredmeasure (fm) is the distance defined by how far fred can run before fred needs to rest, then i proceed to measure various distances by how many times fred needs to rest between objects, you might see how it would be only marginally useful. if i add lead weights to fred's shoes that would cause fm distances to increase but it would be obviously foolish of me to extrapolate that lead weight therefore expands space instead of exhausting fred. it isn't that the distance changed, but that my method of measurement was at best only approximating distance and only then while under static conditions. likewise, if you use the oscillations of cesium-133 as your standard unit and then proceed to alter its conditions so that its oscillations are relatively slower or faster, it might be incorrect to conclude the relative change in oscillations means that time has been locally altered, as if time (fundamentally a measurement, not a driving force or plane of existence) were somehow driving the change in oscillations instead of the circumstances affecting the medium being measured.

when we say ""time travel"" we imagine jumping to previous configurations of matter and energy as they once were, or jumping to configurations of matter as they will someday be. slowing or speeding the movement of atoms doesn't come close to approximating what we mean by ""time travel"". we don't care about how cesium-133 has oscillated directly only as a means to some other ends. if oscillating the atoms in reverse were feasible it would be ridiculous to call that time traveling into the past just as speeding them up is not traveling to the future. it is nonsense because it doesn't get close to what we seek, and because, just like the fm unit, it is only a flawed yardstick by which we measure the things we care about.

to find a building on a map you can give latitude and longitude. the latitude and longitude are only useful if the budding is still there; it isn't the latitude and longitude you want but the building. the same is true of events and time. you might say that you want to travel in time to october 4, 1957. those are coordinates in time, what you really want to do is be present during the launch of sputnik1 just as it happened. you don't care about the coordinates just about the configuration of matter and energy as it was. likewise, you don't care about traveling to the future, you care to see what things will be like as matter and energy progress to some fantastical configuration. it is the movement, decay, and evolution that happened or will happen that interests you. time isn't any more than a standardized measurement of motion and change of matter as a means to some other ends. as such, traveling on/in it is nonsense.

tangentially, i've repeatedly heard that time isn't the same in a black hole as it is in a vacuum far from matter. i've heard that there can't be a standard clock. i say there can be, i say that we can pick any arbitrary frequency and set it as a standard. it would only work as a sufficient standard if we keep its circumstances static and if its frequency is reliable under static circumstances. using any such standard has only marginal utility compared to some as yet unknown thing that isn't affected by matter and movement. then again, in many cases, it might be more useful to have a yardstick that changes proportionally to our circumstances such as it is with the oscillations of cesium-133. having such a standardized time is what we have already done and it is as useful as we need it to be especially because we know how to compensate for conditional speeding and slowing."
1,2023-11-24,CMV:I don’t believe in psychology.,u/UdontneedtoknowwhoIm,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/182mrja/cmvi_dont_believe_in_psychology/,changemyview,"Im talking about both the “scientific” field and the medical field, and while I see the value of the medical one it’s still iffy 

 1. It’s not that undeniably factual. The whole basis of science is based on undeniable evidence used to construct deniable theories and conclusions which are acceptable until proven otherwise. However, the process of gathering data itself in psychology often relies on personal forms fillout which are extremely biasable. This only makes sense based on the hypothesis that said bias is random but it’s rarely so. For example, though this example itself is also iffy bc you can’t gather human data in general, many buisinessmen do face heavy stress from the heavy risk involved with doing buisiness, even with a lot of return for some. However, many also have a personality of presenting themselves well to others or trying to tell themselves they are fine thinking they don’t need help or directly suppress their emotion to control them, not applying to all ofc but some do and those score artificially higher on happiness scale bc it reflects internal bias. Or how many countries have different standards of what it means to be satisfied with said living conditions and thus happiness scales between nations are extremely biased. Sure there might not be better ways but you can’t claim these tests make undeniable results. 

2. Psychology is extremely inconsistent. History had shown its changes wildly within the scale of months or years, and within just a few decades we went from gay being a disease to the gender spectrum. Not adding my political opinions here but things only change like this with dramatic change of input or new proposed theories like Einstein proposing space-time changing physics model. And what changes exactly between those decades that change the perception on gay people other than politics? Or how today you still get racist papers pushing out IQ-race relationship (which needs its own explaination that wouldn’t fit here), mostly according to the genetically comical American race theory. I won’t get too much into these political points but you get my point. Sure researchers in all fields have been biased but usually the results are not as wildly damaging to the human psyche as psychology, and not often directly involved with biased, ofc apart from some privately funded company research. 

3. Ironically, it can be extremely inhumane. This isn’t as much a critique of the scientific part but more the medical and ethical. Im shocked when I’ve heard of a paper on depression which involves sleep depriving and stressing out a mouse until it becomes depressed just to observe it. Ofc this is a bioethics question which exist in all fields of biology, but also with psychology you often see a combination of this and very biased authority opinions. The experience which should be personalizable is anything but. They just listen, ask questions, tell you the name of the “disorder” and give medication, which btw can in some cases be extremely bad for the individual. I know people who had their depression significantly worsen by medication which turns them extremly nihilistic, in which they are still recovering from it. Therapists exist but quality control is very difficult in such fields and thus it’s not uncommon to hear stories of terrible ones. I’m not even gonna start about how inhumane it is when they deal with kids, for example giving antidepressants to abused children and send them back to their abuser instead of actually calling for intervention. I have asked a psychologist I know “before you go to study psychology, do you already understand your patients and does the class help you with it? “ and she admit that it only tells her how to answer in pre-planned patterns. humans are meant to be treated like a human, and the systemization of said aspect kills the humanity.  People are treated as datasets who are asked,  answered and pushed in and out to generate money. 

My solution? Empathy exist for a reason. Humans are mentally already capable of understanding others, even if not fully, and helping them. First, everyone should be trained ti give basic advice. You know best who is good for you, and thus teach everyone to be empathetic and help their friends and family instead of having everyone’s mental health be tied to the medical buisiness. Also, when you are creating professional helpers, everyone need something different so treat them as such. Some people become happy by going on a hike, some want to talk, some want to party, and some might meditate. Help them with that. Pay for temporary coach  instead of someone in a boxy hospital. Listen to their problems while sunbathing together at the beach. People need company annd someone who feels like a friend,so become their friends. Also, stop using the word “disorder” and “abnormality”. It’s abnormal to be normal. Everyone is different. It’s all about helping them live the best life they can, not becoming this idealized idea of “normal”. Also, stop trying to cure healthy differences, but this is a topic for a whole nother posts."

The morals imposed on society is just a majority consensus, based on that current societies opinion on what is good and evil, right and wrong. 

We all have different values of good and evil, and these values cannot be justified by any objective measure. For there to be objective value, there has to be an objective valuer. One that imposes non changing rules.

Most people’s morals are fluid and changes with their experiences and knowledge about the world, if they are ever changing that means they weren’t perfect to begin with. 

Without God, one could also make the argument that humans are no objectively superior to any other animal on earth. How can a person say that murdering an animal is less evil than murdering a person? Most people’s morals are ever changing and hypocritical to its core. 

This is an established belief known as moral nihilism. I would love for anyone to actually provide an intellectual argument against this, as the only people I’ve seen object to this, either doesn’t fully understand it, or have an emotionally charged argument designed to try and manipulate the other person into feeling bad for having this belief, that’s not gonna work on me though."

My View is that its bad due to mostly the same reasons.

I assume most people know the [definitions](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/596353934285602827/1177562009328418917/image.png?ex=6572f515&is=65608015&hm=12c72c9367defeb45e5afd787bc50e440c98b93257fddf4dcf53036b60203273&=&width=800&height=429). However, something important to point out about the ""White N-word"" is that it is not bad simply due to its relation with the N-word, but due to it perpetuating stereotypes and otherwise demeaning African American Culture.

When a white person is perceived as appropriating or even just partaking in stereotypically African American culture, some (racist) people will call them the word as an insult. The implication being that it is bad to partake in those things; essentially saying that African American culture is ""beneath"" white people and thus worthy of insult.

That is the reason Weeb/Weaboo is bad, it is doing the exact same thing but with Japanese culture instead of African American.

Furthermore, I dont think many people actually know the [origin of the word Weaboo](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/weeaboo#about).

It was first used in a [semi-viral comic strip](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/029/097/PBF071-Weeaboo.gif) where the joke was that the word had no definition.

Soon after, 4chan implemented word filters for a bunch of slurs. You would type a slur and another word would appear in its place.

Weaboo was the word filter for the slur ""[White Japanese](http://www.rsdb.org/slur/wapanese)"". So instead of calling people that slur, they simply started calling them Weaboos. Which became shortened to Weeb and popularized across most of the internet as a 'funny insult'.

The way the two words are used is similar, chat GPT defines them almost the exact same, and even the design of the word replaced by ""Weaboo"" is clearly based on the word for ""White Nword"". Is there something Im totally missing that makes a clear distinction between these two words for you?

Every time I bring this up people just call me a weeb and never address any of the points Im making. So please convince me wrong 🙏"

""Hate speech"" laws are rather unique among speech restrictions in that they discriminate on the basis of viewpoint, and generally target speech that is related to political/social issues. Regardless of your opinions on the merits of ""hate speech"", I think it quite clear that is often political in nature. 

A free, legitimate, democracy must allow it's citizens to freely discuss political and social issues. ""Free"" in this context is not used to refer to individual freedom per se, but rather the freedom of society as a whole to decide its governance. Expression on social/political issues is a core part of that process. 

Real and hypothetical legal prohibitions/restrictions on ideologies such as socialism, capitalism, feminism, etc., have been, and would be, widely be labelled as undemocratic. If so, then why not laws restricting ""hate speech"" as well?

The right to express support or opposition to certain ideas and policies is widely regarded as fundamental to democracy, I have seen no convincing argument for why an exception should be carved out for speech that is intolerant/hateful towards certain types of groups. Everyone is intolerant of some things and people,

1,2023-11-24,CMV: Someone cannot be both a ‘grower’ and a ‘shower’,u/Crash927,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/182qn8j/cmv_someone_cannot_be_both_a_grower_and_a_shower/,changemyview,"Yes. This is about penises.

Pretty much anyone who spends time scrolling through pictures of penises will come across variations of the phrase, “I’m a grower *and* a shower!”

I think this is not possible (ie people should not be describing themselves in this way), and there are only three options (with some overlap on the edges):

* Grower — grows by more than 55-60%
* Shower — grows by less than 20-30%
* Average —  falls between the above ends of the spectrum

This is essentially a spectrum with grower on one end, shower on the other and a large gap between. We can quibble over who is a grower and who is a shower, but one firmly cannot be both.

Essentially, my view is that “shower” is not interchangeable with “large flaccid;” nor is “grower” with “large erection.” Which is how these terms often seem to be used. It’s the change in dimension that matters because otherwise, the distinction of grower vs shower loses its essential meaning, becoming just another way to talk about raw size numbers.

I believe that most often when people call themselves a shower & grower, they have some other meaning in mind: I have a large erect penis; I’m insecure about my flaccid size; I think you’ll enjoy what I have to share; a dig at someone who says “I’m a grower not shower,” etc.

Some [Spanish scientists looked into difference between the two](https://eaucongress.uroweb.org/press-release-difference-between-growers-and-showers-revealed/):

> They found that men whose penis increases in size by more than 56% when erect compared to a flaccid state could be considered “growers”. Those who saw an increase in size of less than 31% were “showers”.

> Most men in the study, however, fell into a “grey zone” in between the two categories. Only 24% of the men were growers while 25% were classified as showers.

I argue that since 50-ish% of men aren’t calling themselves both, it is strong evidence that the “grey zone” = neither or simply the average.

For a second datapoint, a [group from the US did a similar study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41443-018-0053-3) with different definitions:

> The median change in penile length from flaccid to erect state was 4.0  cm (1.0–7.0), and was used as a cut-off value defining a grower(≥4.0 cm) or a shower (4.0 cm). A total of 73 men (26%) fit the definition of a grower(mean change in length of 5.3 cm [SD 0.5]) and 205 (74%) were showers (mean change in length of 3.1 cm [SD 0.9]).

I would be shocked to hear that 75% of men (the group studied) would self-identify as “showers,” and so I struggle to accept this definition. Clearly, there is at least some colloquial separation between the two, and these terms are colloquial in nature.

I use the above academics as one lens to apply, but I don’t really believe academics get to ultimately decide here. This isn’t really the domain of academia.

So CMV: someone can not be both a “grower” and a “shower.”"

They believe that our existence is a mistake of nature, because we evolved the biology to suffer in a universe filled with suffering, that the ""good"" things in life are few and far in between, never enough to justify the price we pay for life. They seek a voluntary and painless way to erase life from this universe, whatever that means. 

They also argue that most animals suffer and have no way to improve their conditions, due to instinct.

Their strongest argument is of moral consent, arguing that since nobody (or animals) can actually agree to their own creation, then by default we are immoral for creating them, because the moral ""default"" of consent is to do nothing when we cant obtain explicit consent from a subject.

I think this is a very pessimistic and fatalistic view of life, it failed to mention that despite all the ""bad"" things they have listed, there are obviously enough ""good"" things left to incentivize and motivate most people to live. If life is truly hellish and most people are suffering without any hope of improvement, ever, till end of time, then sure, they may have an argument, but this is obviously not the case, right? Pretty sure we would know if earth is hell, right? lol

As for the animals, they live by their instinct, but not truly enslaved by it, because they too have preferences to live and if their environment is truly hell, they would either go extinct or stop reproducing, as evident by captive animals that refuse to eat and breed, they seem to prefer the wild, regardless of how ""brutal"" the wild is.

Lastly, for moral consent, how can you apply consent to people before birth? Is there a floating void entity before birth for consent to attach itself and this consent is violated when you yank this entity into a baby? How can consent be applied to both non entity and eventual entity at the same time, as if they are the same subject? This makes no sense.

Ok, maybe ALE subscribers can change my mind with better arguments, convince me that life is indeed not worth it and we should seek its erasure from this universe. lol

Thus, it should not be surprising to any of them to have cheap, flimsy doors, windows that don't hold in heat well, dollar store light bulbs in cheap fixtures, etc.  ""You get what you pay for"" is true in housing just as it is in many other industries, and so trying to find the cheapest place possible to rent in your area is almost a guarantee that the place will have some things that are not up to typical standards.

An easy caveat (and thus something that will receive no deltas) is that rentals have to be up to certain building codes in order to be rented out legally, which differ from place to place.  My view is that as long as rentals meet those codes (seen as the bare minimum) renters who are paying the bare minimum of rent in their particular area shouldn't expect much more than the bare minimum that the codes guarantee them.

One way to change my view would be to demonstrate that there are a significant portion of high-rent, ""luxury"" rentals that are using cheap materials as well, which would discredit the ""you get what you pay for"" notion my life experience has left me with."

Pinyin is more commonly used in China and Chinese teaching around the globe, while Wade-Giles is more commonly used in Taiwan.

 In Wade-Giles, the consonants are so messy I can't get over it. Take the ""ts"" sound as in example, Tsai Ing-Wen's ""Ts"" and Su Tseng-chang's ""Ts"" are pronounced quite differently. One is unaspirated and the other is aspirated. In Pinyin, on the other hand, they are differentiated with ""C"" and ""Z"" respectively. Take another politician's name as an example, ""Chen Chien-jen"". The ""Ch"" in ""Chen"" and ""Chien"" are pronounced very differently, the former has your tongue between your teeth and the latter has your tongue behind. I don't know the technical term for it but I'm sure there is. In Pinyin, they are denoted with ""Ch"" and ""J"" respectively. You may then ask _what about ""jen""?_. To which I will say the character's consonant is much closer to ""r"" in ""rice"", so it should be denoted with ""R"", as Pinyin does! I know the letter j is pronounced many different ways around the world, but I'm not sure if there are any other languages that use ""j"" to denote the English sound ""r"".

The only advantage Wade-Giles has over Pinyin is the vowel system. In Pinyin, ""Ri"" and ""Ji"" don't have the same vowel sound, whereas they are differentiated with ""Jih"" and ""Chi"" in Wade-Giles. But these advantages are few and far between while the advantages Pinyin has are much more important for non-Chinese speakers to pick up the language."

A person in my life feels precisely the opposite. It doesn’t matter if even POTUS is using the incorrect form of a word. If it’s incorrect, you correct whomever it is so that they can improve themselves, and you do it right there on the spot no matter the audience. This person has done this multiple times in front of me, embarrassing other folks, and I want to believe this person is kind, not rude. So, please CMV!

Editing to add context since a lot of people seem interested: at family thanksgiving, my super shy, quiet family member A was talking to B’s extended family that they see about once every 10 years. A is clearly uncomfortable hosting already, but doing his best to make conversation with his distant in-laws. He said something about “the fishes” in his pond. Merriam Webster dictionary claims that “fish” AND “fishes” are acceptable plurals. B proceeded to interrupt A’s quiet conversation to loudly tell everyone that “fishes” is incorrect, and the plural of fish is just “fish”. A turned red and stopped talking. I felt bad for the guy and almost corrected B, but decided it would just embarrass A more for the conversation to not be dropped. Now A CHOSE B as a spouse knowing her personality was opposite of his, so my empathy only goes so far. But he didn’t choose to be embarrassed in front of extended family, so I still feel bad for the guy.

* Regarding the news story about young Americans agreeing with Bin Laden, this goes to show that even within capitalist liberal democracies, this model is being undermined inconvenient truths, which are further spread by social media and influencers.
   * There is a lot of dirt to be dug up about capitalist liberal democracies (e.g. regime change operations, war crimes, atrocities against indigenous peoples). With the advent of the internet, these inconvenient truths are easier to find and therefore further weaken our nations through distrust, while more authoritarian countries can keep their dirt under wraps.
   * I'm not against truth and freedom of information, I'm just pointing out that the model that Fukuyama believed would triumph is actually quite fragile and easy to undermine.
* [Democratic backsliding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_backsliding) is occurring in many countries across the world, vastly overshadowing any progress in democratisation:
   * See [this report from 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20210914030243/https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/74/8c/748c68ad-f224-4cd7-87f9-8794add5c60f/dr_2021_updated.pdf) or [this report from 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20230314164628/https://bti-project.org/en/reports/global-dashboard?&cb=00000).
   * There seems to be a perverse incentive to democratic backsliding, as increasing autocracy appears to be advantageous to leaders who intend to govern like a Paradox Interactive grand strategy game (i.e. to make their country even more powerful on the world stage).
   * Additionally, [multiple countries are experiencing a double whammy of democratic backsliding and political polarisation](https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/01/18/what-happens-when-democracies-become-perniciously-polarized-pub-86190), [which is also growing around the world](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/11/16/most-across-19-countries-see-strong-partisan-conflicts-in-their-society-especially-in-south-korea-and-the-u-s/).
* Living standards in capitalist liberal democracies are decreasing, which sows doubt on the promises of capitalism and liberal democracy:
   * See ""[Living standards tumbling in Australia despite booming national wealth](https://independentaustralia.net/politics/politics-display/living-standards-tumbling-in-australia-despite-booming-national-wealth,15747)"" and ""[Britons ‘need to accept’ they’re poorer, says Bank of England economist](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/25/britons-need-to-accept-theyre-poorer-says-bank-of-england-economist)"".
   * Even if you blame external factors for these problems, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or the Russian invasion of Ukraine, these events prove to us the resilience of authoritarian systems in the PRC and Russia in contrast to liberal democracies, as declining living standards don't destabilise them as much.
   * The large-scale international resurgence of the far-right is [partially fed by legitimate concerns of economic insecurity](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/31/across-europe-the-far-right-is-rising-that-it-seems-normal-is-all-the-more-terrifying).

To conclude, while I believe that Fukuyama's concepts have been debunked by recent history, I can also understand why Fukuyama made such claims in the 1990s. Back then, he wouldn't have been able to foresee the problems that we're facing now."

I have been arguing with a med student aiming to go into psychiatry about the difference of these 2. We weren't able to discern why,  if all things were equal about:

* Employment/ abundance of professionals

*Cost/insurance

*Geographic distance to patients 

And assuming ALL patients full well knew psychiatrists had medical degrees and can prescribe medications while psychologists don't, then I'd argue there is no need for psychologists in a world of psychiatrists. 

Especially since where psychologists employ talk therapy as a primary tool, and psychiatrist employ both talk therapy and pathology."

So a rich white man would be considered highly privileged while a poor black woman would be the opposite. (It’s also used for a number of other attributes but I think the point is clear)

When using the term privilege, people tend to imply that the life of the rich white man must be much easier and happier than that of the poor black woman.

My issue with this is that there are so many factors to how “easy” someone’s life is that looking at a few attributes to determine their “privilege” might work for entire demographic groups but doesn’t work at all for individual people.

Using myself as an example: I‘m a rich, white guy living in a rich, safe country. I’m not disabled, my parents financially support me, I’m reasonably intelligent and, according to people around me, somewhat good looking. Sounds like my life is easy, I have nothing to complain about and should enjoy my privilege, right? Well I’ve been suicidal for the last few years and even before that I don’t remember ever being even close to feeling actually happy.  I highly doubt 99% of people reading this would voluntarily swap places with me.

If I am privileged, the word is meaningless. If I am not privileged, the way people use the word makes it meaningless."

9,2023-11-25,CMV: You being lazy is just you being a bad liar to yourself,u/nowfrostmourne,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/183jdbj/cmv_you_being_lazy_is_just_you_being_a_bad_liar/,changemyview,"I often describe myself as being ""lazy"", like a lot of people. Now, let's do a thought experiment together:  
  
Say you're an average person, and someone tells you that you have to walk 1 mile. At the end, you get $1M (100% guaranteed). Not a bad deal, right? I'll take it.  
What about 50 miles? That's 3 hours/day for 5 days. Still an amazing deal.  
What about 1000 miles? That's 3 hours/day for 100 days or \~50min for a year. Easy!  
  
Alright, now let's say you have to walk the same 1000 miles over a year to stay healthier.  
The problem with that is that it's too vague - you can't get a feel for it as easily as the $1M.  
You can go around looking for all kinds of stories and stats, but you will find a list of ""the probability of *<bad thing>* happening goes down by a bit"". That may be not good enough (especially if you're young, in decent shape, etc - the probability might be even lower for your circumstances).  
And if not walking doesn't make you particularly afraid, but it does feel like a real chore, it's pretty hard to sell the good habit to yourself.   
This is exactly the same walking I was ready to do 1000 miles of a few seconds ago! The only thing that changed is I took away some real, tangible, quantifiable motivation ($1M).

  
My sense is that this is at the root of laziness for most people (I'm sure there are exceptions - e.g. people with brain chemistry differences):  
  
1. You're attempting to just tell yourself that you ""need"" to do something and expect it to be enough for you to do it - it's not.  
2. Deep down you ask yourself:   
	what's realistically going to happen if I don't do it?   
	will I lose a limb?   
	will I suffer endless pain?   
	will I see your family tortured before your eyes?   
3. If yes, you will overcome your laziness.  
   If not, why would you put in the effort if you get nothing (or smth very vague) in return except lost time and energy? and this will manifest as being lazy, procrastinating, etc.  
  
  
One more thing to add: The higher the probability of success, the more motivating it is (and it doesn't have to be very high as long as the reward is high enough)!

  
If I have to walk 1000 miles for 50% chance of success, I'll still do it, especially if I can do it multiple years in a row so that I can really force my luck. And if not, hey, at least I'm a bit more healthy.  
Speaking like a statistician, this is esentially the expected value of a decision, where value = how good you think you will feel when you get the reward. This expected value is what drives your motivation / makes your laziness go away.

Some people who think AI is taking over by next year while others think no jobs will replaced until 2040. I like to see myself as in the middle and I don't think that many jobs will be replaced soon.

I hesitated posting as I've had different thoughts about this. The main argument translators make for why they won't be replaced is that they don't translate things literally but that translation itself is an ""art"" and the like. I think those arguments can be defeated by an AI that has thousands of translated books so that all expressions and the like are incorporated. 

But even if I'm wrong in the best case books would still be translated by humans while official documents and technical things that don't require that much creativity will simply be translated by AI. 

Even now, Google Translate (maybe less so) and DeepL (especially) do a great job at translating things for me and I very rarely find myself having to replace tiny mistakes. So if free tools can do that it's not a stretch to imagine there's already way better paid tools. So I don't see why a company or even government would want to retain translators for most things.

Regarding interpreters, they'll probably stick around for longer until AI transcription and voices are really indistinguishable.  "

Also while this applies to a lot, medicine is the most obvious case and easiest to fix compared to the others ,even if still hard. 

This argument is based on the idea that children of all age can’t consent. I’ll go into that later. 

1. Parents are at the end, nobodies.  No children choose their parents. And while most parents are good, not all are and many are abusive or self-centered. This means often times they can’t make any better decisions than random people. The only two things parents have over other humans are more information and familiarity, and sometimes more biological care. This however could blind them. This is what give rise to the infamously common case of parents refusing important medications like vaccines out of baseless claims while denying others and letting their children dies. Parents can’t compared to health authorities who would know better about health than them. The whole point of allowing this is patient autonomy, but patient autonomy must be by the patient not some other random people. While most parents aren’t like this, there should be a safety mechanism agaisnt it. 

2. Children aren’t incapable of making any choices at all ages. Adolescents are often no different from people just a bit older. Thus, they should be able to make some basic choices and maybe have passive-choices available (autonomy and refusing things, but not yet doing transactions). What these include remains ti be defined.this again goes back also to medication.  

Maybe, though this is imperfect, the state or otehr authorities should be able to decide on some important health issues like mandating some vaccines. Yes, this would be denying autonomy but so is parents choosing stuff for children. Then, if they are older, they can refuse or not do so as they please. In other cases the opinion of professionals wouldn’t be just a suggestion but also a factor of decision along with the parent. This isn’t a super well crafted system but “there is no better way” doesn’t mean the current system is good, only the best we have."
1,2023-11-25,CMV: young people born into rich families who squander their wealth are inherently bad.,u/Ok-Story-9319,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/183kk7d/cmv_young_people_born_into_rich_families_who/,changemyview,"This post is about capitalism. You have been warned. You wont change my view by explaining how Marx was right. I’ve loosely skimmed Das Kapital and I remain unconvinced. Please don’t try to convince me that capitalism is some evil system, unless you’re some kind of genius. 

Anyways, we live in a capitalist society and that’s a good thing. That’s my initial premise. To survive in such a society you need capital and intelligence. The former is used to invest and generate more capital. The latter is used to invest properly. Most people lack sufficient capital when they’re young to invest. However, the children of rich people are fortunate to have potential access to such ready capital. 

Yet, many wealthy people who go to good schools squander this opportunity. These people are inherently bad people *solely* because of what position they occupy in a capitalist society. These people have an increased duty to invest their familial wealth into increasing their capital and overall wealth. 

I drafted this post after having a conversation with a poor person who went to a prestigious school on a scholarship. He remarked that many of the wealthier students simply spend a lot of their time partying and doing drugs with their parents’ money. My argument is that these individuals, despite their youth, are inherently bad people because they both occupy a significant class of capitalist society, and squander their wealth despite it. 

Even if a trust fund kid doesn’t make good investments, as long as they try is what’s important. I’m not saying every rich kid needs to grow up and become a billionaire with a small loan of a million dollars. But they need to recognize their role in our society and be willing to *attempt* to grow their ready capital instead of wasting the money on their own consumption. 

TL;DR: rich offspring have a greater duty to not squander their familial wealth because we live in a capitalist society. Rich kids who waste their capital and opportunities by partying are inherently worse people as opposed to impoverished people who do the same thing because they’re wasting substantial capital."

1,2023-11-25,CMV: Kyle Rittenhouse is not a murderer.,u/ChampionOfBaiting,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/183nwze/cmv_kyle_rittenhouse_is_not_a_murderer/,changemyview,"I made this CMV before, but I've seen a recent large resurgence in Rittenhouse discourse on twitter, so I think it's worth doing this again.

To begin, I will not use ""the jury already decided"" as an argument, because that's a bad argument. Juries can be wrong.  
  
My full view is: Self-defense is a right, and that includes self-defense with deadly force if you have reason to believe someone is an immediate threat to your or someone else's life or limb. Using necessary deadly force in the act of defending one's life definitionally precludes it from being called murder.  
  
Rittenhouse was chased and attacked by Joseph Rosenbaum, who earlier that day threatened to kill any of a group of people that Rittenhouse was in if he'd caught them alone, and though Rittenhouse did his best to escape, he was eventually cornered in a parking lot and had no better recourse than to use deadly force and shoot Rosenbaum. Huber and Grosskreutz, probably under the misapprehension that Rittenhouse was mass shooter, chose to chase and assault Rittenhouse. Rittenhouse again tried to escape by running towards some police cruisers, but tripped and was bashed in the head by Huber with a skateboard and by an unknown person (jump-kick man), followed by Grosskreutz pointing his own firearm at Rittenhouse. Given that Huber and Grosskreutz both presented deadly threats to Rittenhouse, he shot them both. I believe that given these details, Rittenhouse only acted in self defense and is therefore not a murderer.  
  
I've compiled a list of common arguments against Rittenhouse and my responses to them. Be aware that this is not me taking these arguments off the table, this is just to get my initial responses to them out of the way to save us all some time.  
  
1.""He crossed state lines with a gun""  
  
No he didn't. This was confirmed in the trial by both the defense and the prosecution.  
  
2.""He traveled a long distance to be in Kenosha""  
  
He lived 20 minutes away and worked in that city before the pandemic hit.  
  
3.""It's illegal for a 17 year-old to carry a rifle in Wisconsin""  
  
No it isn't; not even the prosecution tried to argue this. 17 year-olds are allowed to open carry long-barreled rifles in Wisconsin.  
  
4.""He wasn't supposed to be there""  
  
Every US citizen is allowed to be in any public area in the US, barring specific legal restrictions on individuals (prison, restraining orders, etc). There was a curfew that night, however given that everyone involved was breaking the same curfew, I find that's a null point. Lastly, breaking curfew obviously doesn't remove one's right to defend their life with deadly force if it's necessary.  
  
5.""No one asked him to be there""  
  
See the prior response.  
  
6.""It was premeditated, he once said on video that he would shoot someone for looting.""

The video doesn't show premeditation since he didn't shoot anyone for looting.  
  
Also, I don't think it's likely that someone who intended to kill people would first run away from everyone he ended up killing until he was either cornered or on the ground and being hit in the head. Someone with premeditation to commit murder would probably just shoot people without much hesitation.  
  
7.""Self defense can't be used as a excuse if you provoked the altercation with illegal actions""  
  
The only crime Rittenhouse unquestionably committed was breaking curfew. But because every person in the riot was committing the same crime, it's not reasonable to claim that was what provoked the attack on Rittenhouse. And to whether Huber and Grosskreutz had reason to believe Rittenhouse was a murderer and therefore that was their provocation, well, whether Rittenhouse committed illegal homicide is the subject of this post to begin with.  
  
8.""He shouldn't have used deadly force to fight off his assailants""  
  
I don't believe the tools you use to defend your life should depend on whether you think you can beat your attacker in a fistfight. It's not reasonable to have expected Rittenhouse to do a tale-of-the-tape in his head while being chased by a violent belligerent. And I hope we can all agree that most people couldn't fend off a group of three with their hands and feet.  
  
9.""He should have aimed for their legs/arms/hands""  
  
Aiming for extremities with a gun is an unwise prospect, as any firearms expert will tell you. While Rittenhouse did miraculously manage to hit one of his assailants in the arm without killing him, it's not reasonable to expect that kind of precision when someone is lunging at you from 2 feet away or when you're on the ground and just got hit twice in the head.  
  
10.""Having a firearm proves an intent to use it""  
  
Merely having a gun does not, nor has it ever, been considered intent to commit murder. And if it were, Grosskreutz, one of the men he shot, would be charged with a crime as well.  
  
11.""Going into a riot armed with a gun means he was a willing combatant""  
  
A person being in a town during a riot while armed is not, nor has it ever been, an excuse to assault that person, nor has it ever meant they aren't allowed to use deadly force to defend themself. Further, many people were open-carrying AR-15s or similar rifles that night, including many of the BLM protesters. None of them were singled out and assaulted, as far as anyone knows.  
  
12.""Only one of the men he shot had a gun""  
  
Being unarmed doesn't mean you don't have the ability to kill or injure. And a skateboard is a heavy blunt object, and blunt objects are used in more murders per year than long-barreled rifles are.  
  
13.""Huber and Grosskreutz were just trying to subdue a person they thought was dangerous""  
  
I don't know of any judge, lawyer, or police officer who would encourage a civilian to be a vigilante and pursue a person they believed was dangerous, much less while they were running away from the civilian and towards the police. What they would encourage you to do is to escape from the dangerous person and contact the police, and then only fight if other options were impossible, which is exactly what Rittenhouse had done. Though their intentions may have been good, they went about it in the entirely wrong way.  
  
14.""He should have turned himself in to the police""  
  
He did; immediately after the incident he went to a police cruiser with his hands raised and they brushed him off, and later he turned himself in at a police station.  
  
15.""He once hit a girl""  
  
If Rittenhouse once hitting a girl who was fighting another girl means his life is essentially forfeit from then on, then so does threatening one's grandmother with a knife and raping minors, crimes that Huber and Rosenbaum committed, respectively.  
  
16.""He should have stayed to stabilize the people he shot""  
  
It's not really possible to provide medical assistance when you have a mob chasing you. Also, I doubt he had the tools necessary to treat gunshot wounds in that Amazon first-aid kit he had. The wisest course of action in that case was to inform the nearest police officer, which is what Rittenhouse did.  
  
17.""He should have stayed home""  
  
Thanks, Captain Hindsight. Though this advice would probably be better-suited to the men who assaulted him.  
  
18.""He should have just let the mob attack him, since he didn't know for sure they'd kill or seriously injure him""  
  
If you're not willing to use this same logic for anyone who's ever used deadly force to stop an assailant, then I don't believe it applies here either. We should not expect people to just hope that assailants will just rough them up a bit instead of killing or seriously injuring them. And given that everyone he shot used deadly force against him, it's not reasonable to assume they wouldn't have killed him.  
  
19.""He was a racist kid who wanted to play Rambo""  
  
Even if all of that were true, it still doesn't mean he's not allowed to defend himself.  
  
20.""Even though he's not a murderer, he still did dumb things.""  
  
This is not an argument against my view."

They behave negatively towards their spouse and those around them, they engage in behaviors they would have avoided before. So many people are quick to support them, saying things like they can't control their hormones, you don't know what it's like, you should be supportive no matter what, etc. I don't see why we should allow negative behavior as a result of hormones.

Men are genetically more aggressive due to the higher amounts of testosterone in our system. We have a genetic proclivity to anger and impulsiveness due to the chemicals our brain sends us. That was never acceptable, anger can be a very negative trait and people are very quick to villainize aggressive men. They almost never try to sympathize. I had to work on my emotions, I had to learn to control my anger, learn to control how I react *in spite* of what I feel. It feels like men are held to a higher standard, and I don't understand why. 

Whenever I see someone trying to explain a man's behavior based on their circumstances, no one cares. They feel we should have complete control over ourselves, they feel we should fight our inner desires that they themselves don't have to deal with or experience. I agree with that sentiment. Acting on your emotions can be very dangerous, and we should be able to use our emotions as a guide for how to act, not simply act everytime we feel an emotion. Women should be held to the same standards. If there's no excuses for men, then there's no excuses for women. CMV"
3,2023-11-25,CMV: Pragmatism is the best response to presuppositionalist.,u/Chatterbunny123,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/183pk6t/cmv_pragmatism_is_the_best_response_to/,changemyview,"I do a lot of debating on religious subs because I like the exercise of it. One particular group of people that are difficult to engage with though are presups. The main thing about them is the dialogue tree they take you through and at any point you stray from it you are labeled irrational either for seemingly not caring or not having a ""grounding"" for your own beliefs. This I think is absurd for a number of reasons. Mostly because I do think there are rational and even power arguments against presups. My favorite is pragmatism.

I know that the founder of pragmatism was religious himself but I do think he was onto something. The way I would summarize pragmatism as an answer to presuppositionalist is as follows. ""We do not need Absolute truths. Only pragmatic truths. Truths insofar as they get us from one satisfactory conclusion to the next satisfactory conclusion."" 

I do not think Absolute truths are obtainable in that they would require omniscient to be absolutely certain. Rather I think working on degrees of certainty is enough while allowing for the possibility of new information to change your conclusion. But everytime I explain this to a presup I am called irrational. Is there something wrong in my approach? Do I need to clarify something? Is there just a whole different philosophy I should adopt?

The main reason I've stuck to this one is that it has allowed me to make conclusions while allowing for the standard answer to religious questions ""I don't know"". Personally I don't like making conclusions about something without it being tied to some amount of evidence that I could provide to someone else like showing my homework. Making an argument by itself without any verifiable evidence to me doesn't prove the claim or make for a good argument.

Hoping you guys might have some answers."

All the places I listed usually have armed security/police or aren’t very populated at any given time. However if you own a grocery store or a regular business that is constantly crowded and you have a gun free zone sign and some deranged individual comes in and shoots a bunch of people I think the business should partially be responsible for those deaths too.

 If you tell me I can’t bring my gun inside that’s totally fine but I’m gonna assume that means you’re responsible for my security as long as I am on your property. If a business doesn’t have armed security but is a gun free zone I think they should be partially liable and charged not more than $250,000 per death on the premises due to negligence, and possible a temporary suspension of their business license.  Wholefoods is a great example of this, multibillion dollar business yet no armed security in sight and very clearly a gun free zone."

I honestly feel like a lot of them are jealous/mysogynitic and are putting people down for making a living while also having a healthy work life balance. They say “try waking up at 4am and driving an hour to work” but like why would they do that when they can make MORE money doing less? Why is it always a competition in the comment section of how much harder their lives are?

I’ve worked shitty jobs before so I get that.

I know I’ll regret posting this 

1. They have autonomy. They are recognized as fully consenting people in many countries (in the case of adults) and even if they aren’t in some, they still have the ability to think and at least make some decisions for themselves , regarding at least autonomy. It’s a right to have the rights to your own body, thus, they should be able to use it. No one can force anything on them. 

2. There is no “cure” currently, adhd medication only change behaviors and other aspects, life experience or side effects will be the one changing long term mental state and even so, side effects are often more negative. That means pushing for these things that won’t cure anyway is pointless curewise. 

3. It is perfec possible for them to live a happy life with their mind. Are there some challenges, including internal succeptibility to stress? Yes, but it’s not for all and it’s sometimes manageable. There are also multiple positives that they could enjoy about their mind. People should instead just make a healthy environment for them just like how people does for NT, and try to help them like a fellow human. If they have other problems they will be the one seeking their own help. 

4. There is nothing morally wrong about having adhd or autism, and if yiu believe there is, well I haven’t yet hear a convincing argument as to why. Also don’t say it’s ur culture, human rights should transcend culture and people should have their rights protected regardless. 

basically, just treat humans like humans and try to support and understand each other. If people have problems let they make their own decisions. If they need help they will seek it. If the individual themselves seek a “cure” (in case such things exist), they can take it or at least get other forms of help and talk to professionals before deciding to do so. Anyhow, it’s not an outsider’s job to force someone’s life choices and they shouldn’t have to stop being themselves if they aren’t bothering you. 

Also yeah I’m ND myself, but I used they so it’s more neutral. This sentence is Not part of the point."

1. Israel’s government has fascist attributes

The Israeli legislature (Knesset) is controlled by the Likud/Netanyahu-lead coalition government. Likud in particular, originated from Herut. Herut was widely condemned by Jewish people around the world, even Albert Einstein and Hannah Arendt, for being ""akin to Nazi and fascist parties.""

Although Israeli settlement in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip had already been occuring, in 1977 with the newly formed and elected Likud government, led by Menachem Begin, support for Israeli settlement increased significantly. Also Menachem was a commander of Irgun, a Zionist paramilitary body that was designated by the United Nations as a terrorist organization, and also commonly described as fascist.

Anyways, Likud's statement on the settlements was that ""the entire historic Land of Israel is the inalienable heritage of the Jewish people and that no part of the West Bank should be handed over to foreign rule.” The settlement of Palestinian land became completely state-sponsored by this point.

The exact definition of fascism is still discussed, but there are two words that characterize it in the examples seen in WWII. Palingenetic ultranationalism. As the name suggests, it’s an ultranationalist ideology centered around a national rebirth to revive a perceived mythic golden age. Generally, in Nazi Germany, this was with the (German) Holy Roman Empire. In Fascist Italy, this was with the Roman Empire. With Israel’s Likud and other far-right parties, this is with the Kingdom of Israel.

Back to the Likud history, eventually in 1992 the Israeli Labor Party briefly took control, resulting in the Oslo Peace Accord between Israel and the PLO, which Likud and other allied parties were furious about. This resulted in the assassination of the Labor Party PM, Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, shortly followed by the election of Likud member Benjamin Netanyahu, the current PM of Israel. Also, Israel is currently apartheid. Doesn’t help its case. https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2022/02/israels-system-of-apartheid/

https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/03/israels-55-year-occupation-palestinian-territory-apartheid-un-human-rights



2. Hamas has fascist attributes

I shouldn’t need to explain this too much but they have executive authority within the Gaza strip and have held this authority since 2006. They’re religious fundamentalists and if they had more military resources and combat power than the IDF they would without a doubt establish an ethnostate just like Israelis with far-right sentiments.



3. Why it’s Israel’s responsibility to change

However, Hamas doesn’t have that much military power. They don’t have anywhere near that much power. Israel has iron dome defense systems. Gaza has piles of infrastructure turned to rubble. Yes, innocent Israeli citizens are victims too. Hamas shouldn't be doing what they’re doing to them. No kidnapping, torture, or civilian targeting, etc. However, Israel’s mass killings and war crimes DRASTICALLY exceed anything Hamas has done in number and magnitude. Not to mention half of the population of the Gaza Strip is under 18, and the ongoing blockade on Gaza.

And some of these children and some of their parents when they were children were/are being raised into Hamas and this far-right ideology because of social and economic conditions created by Israel. The Muslim Brotherhood, which Hamas later became an offshoot of, was funded, armed, and trained by Israel to serve as counterweight to the PLO/Fatah party.

The only way to end the conflict is for Israeli citizens to put an end to Likud (and other similarly aligned parties’) political dominance through reform. End the blockade, end Israeli settlement, end Israeli’s apartheid state, and help the Palestinians rebuild. Reform Israel away from being a Jewish nation to a multicultural secular state, perhaps with the eventual goal of a shared structured split in equal governance between Israeli and Palestinian lawmakers. Two Ministers of Agriculture, two Co-Prime Ministers, two separately elected legislatures, etc.



4. Also,

Having a Jewish majority population over 1,000 years ago or “being there first” (inaccurate anyways) never gave Zionists the excuse to barge into Palestinian land and demand an ethnostate. Also, don't forget the Muslim Palestinians had been the majority demographic for over 1,000 years (76% in 1914) and only became a huge minority (something like 46% in the region today) in a less than 70-year span because of mass European Jewish immigration.

Hungarians’ ancestors lived in the southern Urals as late as the 8th century CE. That doesn’t give them the right to immigrate on mass to Bashkortostan, engage in terroristic acts, steal their land, and establish a religious ethnostate.

However, it’s also completely unreasonable to just kick out Israelis who live there now. It’s their home now. Did it become their home ethically? Absolutely not, but the fact of the matter is in the present the Palestinian region (Israel + West Bank + Gaza Strip) is roughly half Palestinian and half Israeli, and both groups deserve the right to self-determination, neither their own religious ethnostate."

I always get discriminated against by other parents because of my age yet my daughter behaves better than theirs but they are so judgemental they think I can't raise my kid right.

 But I can do it she has a breakfast lunch dinner and is always cleaned every single day I try my best money can be tight but I try my best I might not be able to afford everything but my daughter gets what she needs at least to live and she does have enough toys to play with so she is never bored.

I also disagree with the children ""need a father"" argument as it is rather stupid because there is nothing a father does that a mother can't do except leave because he doesn't want to raise his daughter men are good at doing that it."
365,2023-11-25,"CMV: Female superheroes are ‘failing’ because they have no character arc, not because of PC culture",u/Moonlight-gospel,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/183wtc2/cmv_female_superheroes_are_failing_because_they/,changemyview,"Seen a few posts on this topic recently, and I disagree with all of them. 

The reason female superhero movies are doing less successfully is primarily because their character arcs deviate from that of the standard superhero. The standard superhero starts off as weak person with low status in society (or a rich playboy with pain on the inside), acquires powers in a freak accident, goes through formative trials that test their abilities and their values, and then hones both of these just in time to fight the main villain. Female superheroes don’t have this same character arc: they start off every movie all powerful, like a literal invincible god. Their character arc tends to be, really, I don’t know, nothing… In essence, every single female superhero is Superman, except without kryptonite or Lois Lane. 

Take Wonder Woman for example. She starts off as a literal Amazon Goddess. Her only character arc is that she has to be taught by a man how to function in human society (sarcasm to point out that it was actually kind of a sexist movie). 

Take Captain Marvel for example. The most powerful Avenger who literally couldn’t be involved in all the movies or she’d break the story. She started off her first movie all powerful, just minus her memory… I’ll leave out for spoilers. Needless to say, she doesn’t really have significant personal growth, or growth in her powers. Wonder why her second movie bombed so hard.

Why can’t they just treat a female superhero like the first Spider-Man? Nerdy person gets superpowers, gets confidence, gets love interest and fights bad people? Is it maybe because the directors themselves are sexist and think people won’t take a female superhero seriously unless they make them incredibly powerful?

It’s not the fact that people don’t want to see a woman beat up men. People love superhero movies. Just stop treating women completely differently than men when you make them into heroes, it’s not hard."

That's not the point of this post. However, in the past year, I had a massive epizode of health anxiety/hypochondria that I've only recently managed to get out of. And during my googling escapades, I've learned so much about these things, but also noticed how little is actually known about some seemingly very fundamental topics.

ALS is 3rd most common neurodegenerative disease. Nobody knows what causes it and why it starts. The only certainly known risk factor is smoking, but other than that (aside from a small number of hereditary cases), cause is unknown. It could be something in the air we breathe. It could be some seemingly benign food ingredient. Maybe there is a certain level of physical activity a person is allowed to do during lifetime, and when limit is crossed ALS happens. Perhaps accumulated damage from viral infections cause it? There are some observations though. Anyone who served in any military, doesn't matter whether during peace or war, has 2 times bigger chances of getting ALS. Also, some professinal sport players have significantly increased risk - especially Italian football (soccer) players. What is it about army and Italy and football that causes it? Nobody has any clue. We don't know if ALS is even a disease or a set of many diseases with different causes, but same symptoms.

All these little pains that sometimes happen in various body parts... what causes it? Basically everyone gets them sometimes and they are considered normal. If you went to the doctor and mentioned it, in 99% od the cases tests will say everything is normal. Except it isn't. If your arm hurts for a second, something is definitely going on. Your nerve sent a paon signal for some reason. Did it do it by itself? Did some minor damage actually happen to cause it? Why did it happen? There are diagnoses like fibromyalgia, but even then it just describes a set of symptoms and doesn't actually tell anything about the cause.

When I look at the bright surface and blink rapidly, I'll start seeing stripes of rainbow colored lines. I've only read about this on a forum and never knew about it before. I've searched the internet and found no mention of it in medical literature. Nobody has done a research paper on it. It's a phenomenon unknown to medicine.

These are 3 examples of this. I could write about this all day and night, but then nobody would bother to read this (already too long) post."

This post is centered around a Eurpean perspective, and so it might be confusing to some of you. 


I live in Germany as an immigrant, and I have friends from all across the world. I am European. 

Across the bank, the majority of friends I have met that were from outside of Europe had a very specific set of prejudices against me, that never really bothered me too much and just calmly explained this was not a thing in my country. 

I have noticed, however, that some things always repeated although being absolutely absurd. Here are some examples of the things I have been told/ were expected of me. 

1) Not seasoning food

- I am Italian. We have very simple cuisine but it's good. The same friends who tell me this about ""white people"" love my cooking and ask for my recipes/ to make their favourite dish again. 

2) Not having an own culture

- A friend of mine said something along the lines of ""White people appropriate other cultures and festivities because they don't really have their own"". I believe we were talking about Dia de los Muertos in that regard. But all European countries have their own very different cultures. 

In general, I don't think ""black culture"" and ""white culture"" apply to Europe the same way they do to the US. While there may be an african american culture across the U.S., my Ethiopian friend and my Tanzanian friend have just as little in common as a Russian and a Spanish person. They don't share one culture, they each have their own, which may overlap in some parts of life. 

3) My culture was never oppressed

I come from a part of Italy that used to have it's own language and traditions. When Italy was formed in the 19th century, people were forced to stop having their own customs and speaking their own language, or call themselves anything other than Italians. 

My grandparents still spoke the language, but I was never allowed to. I was expected to behave like an Italian so that I would have better chances in life and people would not know my background, which was considered lesser. 

I am not an exception. There are many ethnic groups in Europe that are considered white and still suffered oppression and sometimes persecution. I hate to see these stories devalued by someone saying a blanket statement.

4) This is silly, but the sandal

""White people will never understand how scary it is when your mother picks up the sandal"". But we do have the sandal in Italy. And when I pointed this out, I was told that that was cultural appropriation. 

5) Beige

""White people love to have their walls painted beige and all interior decor has to be beige.""

This was just yesterday. I talked about how houses in my region are not like that at all. And then I thought about it and described how Swedish houses are not like that. Nor are russian houses. Or French ones. Or Spanish ones. Or German ones, at that. Even my German friend, who initially agreed (in shame) that all white houses were just beige, did so while sitting in her perfectly colourful apartment with no beige in sight. I asked her if she had ever seen such a beige home in real life. She has not. Neither had anyone else, when we thought about it. 

To be honest, I don't even think most American white people live like that. I think it's just a social media fad. 



And that brings me to the reason why I am here:

As much as I am not upset at people when they make assumptions, it can be tiring when you hear the same things over and over again. I am upset that European people have to be culturally associated with North America just because we look similar, even though culturally we are so far apart. Social media paints a picture where every white person is from a Florida suburb, and people choose to believe it. 

Please tell me I am wrong about this, a I would hate to be right."

0,2023-11-25,CMV: The entire concept of regulatory capture seems to be BS,u/RuffleCopter,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/183yva8/cmv_the_entire_concept_of_regulatory_capture/,changemyview,"Context: As a result of the rise in calls for AI regulation this year (many of which are coming from AI companies themselves), the idea of ""regulatory capture"" is often cited by bloggers and journalists as being the most plausible explanation for why AI companies are calling for greater regulation of their own industry. Those who make this claim argue that the mechanism of regulatory capture works via the following steps:

1. Incumbent companies of a young or young-ish industry alert regulators that their industry needs regulating.
2. The regulators, lacking the necessary domain expertise, ask the companies for input and advice as to how the regulations should be formulated.
3. The companies then manipulate the regulators into drafting regulations that favour their companies and (importantly in the AI argument) make safety protocols, allegedly for public good, so stringent that they are almost impossible for small newcomer companies to adhere to, thus creating a barrier to entry.

I can't find any evidence that this has actually happened. Like, ever. And not just AI but in any industry. Oh, I see blog posts claiming it as being commonplace existence (for example in [tech](https://fee.org/articles/3-reasons-why-facebooks-zuckerberg-wants-more-government-regulation/) and finance), but not that much in terms of articles published in peer-reviewed journals. Going and reading David Freeman Engstrom's article [Corralling Capture](https://www.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/publication/370256/doc/slspublic/corrralling_caputure.pdf) didn't exactly fill me with confidence either, as he seems to provide quite a lot of evidence that the idea of regulatory capture is basically a mirage. And [Daniel Carpenter's book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1107646707) also seems to indicate that the situation is far more nuanced than is commonly believed. Likewise, this [CFA report](https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/article/position-paper/corrupt-or-collaborative-an-assessment.ashx) throws some cold water on the idea for finance etc.

Anyone got any rigorous, hardcore evidence of regulatory capture ever actually happening? I'm talking detailed reports and investigations / meta-analyses. Not clickbait journalism."

Meanwhile, Donald Trump has steadily made gains in those same demographics and will likely continue to do so. Neither of these two candidates is especially well-liked, but Americans on the whole do not seem to like Biden's handling of the economy, to the point that some actually prefer the way it was with Trump as President. 

With all that stacked up against him, I'm having an increasingly hard time finding any logical scenario where Biden actually defeats Trump. As a Democrat, I'd love to be proven wrong, but the facts speak for themselves. The only thing that *might* work in Biden's favor is if Trump is convicted for one of his indictments, in which case there are polls showing a small but significant percentage of Republicans might not vote for him.

From my understanding the Palestinian unconditional right of return to what is now Israel would just result in two majority Arab states. Obviously Israel will never agree to this, but it is also an unreasonable demand. It’s “having your cake and eating it too” - What is stopping the Palestinians from just uniting the two new Arab majority countries and wiping Israel off the map forever, if they get their wish? I sympathise with the Palestinians who’s ancestors had their homes stolen, but this demand seems completely unreasonable if peace is the actual goal."

We are now entering the age of technology. They say no silly religion, no silly superstitious beliefs to weigh us down. We can now rise up beyond all that and get some real work done as humans in society. 

Wow cool scientific discoveries! 
New life! New Planets!  
This is fun!

And sometimes it is. 

But it’s hard to be really excited when big companies control the cures to diseases and lobbyists can influence scientific fact. ( for example, Kelloggs buying studies that say breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and now everyone says that). So for me, everything sciencey is just extra dystopian these days 


Like wow we grew a human brain in a jar and put it in the skull of a mouse, and it worked!! 
Wow! We built this robot that can kill homeless orphans in third world counties with 1000% more efficiency

Look we made this paralyzed Japanese person….work!

Come on lazy bones, you can’t just lie around all day. Put your only bodily function to good use and greet those Karens using your Kawaii robot exoskeleton. All in a days work!



Oh yeah and art is dead. It’s just gone. Ais got that dumb job taken care of, now we can do all the fun jobs like mopping the floor at Sears! 

Oh and dead people can be brought back as soulless clones for superhero movies.
What fun. 

Maybe I’m just being pessimistic but I genuinely think science sucks now. To clarify I’m not antivax or anything, I just think we’ve crossed a line. 

Robotics used to be super cool, but seeing as though they’ll be used for military and job replacement

“They can save people from house fires” 
Ok? Why don’t we just build better houses with all this robot technology? Or is that too much to ask? ( I’m aware I’m oversimplifying and I’m sorry) 

“ they can discover new things underwater and in space!”
Discover what exactly? New rocks to be mined raw? Cures for diseases that’ll be locked up and put in artificial scarcity?


Even astronomy has lost its spark in me , as every new breathtaking image just has everyone saying, “look how meaningless we are lol” 

Maybe there’s still some aspect of science to be enjoyed, but right now, it’s just exhausting."

Muslims consist of roughly around 7 percent and is expected to grow to 17% by 2050. In any secular country that accounts for freedom of thought, ideas, and lifestyle, if Islam gets past the 20% mark, it starts becoming a threat to the country. And islam just cannot correlate with the West because it opposes all Western values and living standards. A lot of Muslims condemn the West and white-Christian and western values, but still go on living there and migrating there in large quantities. And you know why ?! Because this is huge propaganda, a modern-day islamic Colonization. They have 46 Muslim-majority countries out of which 20 have declared islam as their official state religion, but still, Muslims will only migrate to Europe and make them change their laws according to them. Don't you see anything fishy?  
  
Its a simple process:  
  
1. Migrate to a Muslim minority country. Become a resident eventually a citizen.  
  
2. Criticize their values and way of living, culture, and their laws.  
  
3. Call the people there Islamophobic if they try to oppose you. This workd everytime as you are still a minority in that country.

11. start implementing Shariya law. Now you can't call the people who criticize you Islamophobes but at this point, you don't care because you have totally taken power from their hands.  
  
12. Implement Shariya law harshly and force people to convert.  
  
13. You abolish secularism from your dictionary, as there is no secularism under islam rule because Islam is the only true religion.  
  
14. Bravo!! Now there are 47 Muslim countries.  


A lot of  Islamists blame the European invasion of the world for it saying things like Europe should have never taken over other places. But as they have, they deserve this modern-day colonization and ethnic and cultural cleansing that is happening to them. These idiots like to selectively criticise history,     (Each and every ethnic, religious or regional group which had power had invaded and conquered each other, but now we live in a civil post-colonial world with everyone having their own regions and culture) With their bulls#hit analogy All European countries should be at war with Islamic countries as in the past when Islamic invaders and conquers ravaged and enslaved European settlements when they invaded Europe. Brutally molesting women and kids and killing the native population. They took away European babies as blood taxes and enslaved an enormous amount of native people. 

Also, notice all the Islamic countries are the first ones to lecture the world about human rights and freedom when their own countries don't have Individual freedom, freedom of religion, freedom of culture, freedom of thought, freedom of way of life, freedom of speech, equal rights to women. Terminologies like liberalism, democracy, women's rights and freedom are just myths to them. Any sane person would critique Islam based on the Islamic countries, where the total foundation of their countries is based on the Quran and Islam. Islamic countries, whose culture tradition, way of life, mindset of the people, laws, and morality everything is entirely based on Islam and that book. Believing the lies of a Muslim living in a free country in the West, Asia or anywhere else, defending Islam by saying something like ""that's not real Islam"", ""that's not how Islam"" etc is totally stupid.

  
A lot of Europeans will call me names and criticize and call me a racist because they are blinded by liberalism and self-hatred and are programmed by their government to ethnically and culturally clean themselves (I mean the funniest thing  I have l seen is gay people supporting the propagation of Islam when Islam technically says to kill or put them in life'-in prison.) This is happening right in front of your eyes. This has been happening in France right in front of our eyes. Sadly 101 percent happen in the entirety of Europe America and Asia too until so many open-minded people more like swollen-minded people, just stitch their minds together and think straight for a second and act against it.  
  
And even if you still criticize me for what I have said and still back these people up, then I am sorry but you deserve what is coming for you!!

1,2023-11-26,CMV: Cancel culture is completely unnecessary,u/Time235236,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1844vqt/cmv_cancel_culture_is_completely_unnecessary/,changemyview,"Cancel culture is the phenomenon of publicly shaming, boycotting, or ostracizing individuals or groups who have said or done something that is deemed offensive or unacceptable by a certain segment of society, usually on social media. It is often motivated by political, ideological, or moral reasons, and aims to hold the offenders accountable for their actions and to deter others from repeating them.  
I believe that cancel culture is completely unnecessary, and in fact, harmful for the following reasons:  
\- **It violates the right to free speech**. Cancel culture silences dissenting opinions and imposes a single narrative, undermining the diversity of thought and expression that enriches human culture. Free speech is essential for a liberal and democratic society, as it allows people to challenge, debate, and learn from each other.  
\- **It does not allow for due process, forgiveness, or redemption**. Cancel culture relies on incomplete or inaccurate information, and does not consider the context or intent of the accused. It also does not give the opportunity for the accused to apologize, learn, or grow from their mistakes. Instead, it punishes them harshly and permanently, without any regard for the consequences on their personal or professional lives.  
\- **It applies different standards to different people**. Cancel culture ignores the flaws and faults of those who align with the dominant group, while exaggerating and magnifying the errors and offenses of those who disagree or challenge the status quo. It also creates a culture of fear and self-censorship, where people are afraid to speak their minds or express their individuality, lest they face the wrath of the online mob.  
\- **It does not respect the diversity of human experiences and perspectives.** Cancel culture assumes that there is only one right way to think, feel, and act, and that anyone who deviates from it is morally inferior and unworthy of respect. It also ignores the fact that people can change and evolve over time, and that their past actions or statements may not reflect their current views or values.  
\- **It exploits the power of social media to harass, humiliate, and isolate individuals**. Cancel culture involves personal attacks, threats, and insults, rather than constructive criticism or dialogue. It also creates a hostile and toxic environment, where people are afraid to express themselves or engage with others, for fear of being canceled.  
\- **It avoids the hard work of engaging with complex and nuanced issues.** Cancel culture reduces people and situations to simplistic labels and judgments, without considering the context, evidence, or arguments. It also discourages critical thinking and learning, by dismissing alternative viewpoints and sources of information.  
\- **It privileges the opinions and preferences of a vocal minority over the majority.** Cancel culture reflects the biases and agendas of a specific group or ideology, rather than the common good or the truth. It also undermines the democratic process, by silencing the voices and votes of those who disagree or dissent.  
\- **It denies the right to a fair trial and a presumption of innocence**. Cancel culture relies on hearsay, rumors, or allegations, rather than facts, evidence, or verification. It also disregards the principles of proportionality and mercy, by imposing harsh and irreversible penalties, without any possibility of appeal or forgiveness.  
\- **It harms not only the canceled, but also the cancelers and the society as a whole**. Cancel culture incites anger, hatred, and resentment, rather than compassion, empathy, and reconciliation. It also erodes the social fabric and the trust that are essential for a peaceful and harmonious coexistence.

&#x200B;

I am open to changing my view if someone can provide me with convincing counter-arguments or evidence that show that cancel culture is necessary or beneficial for the individuals or the society."

11. start implementing Shariya law. Now you can't call the people who criticize you Islamophobes but at this point, you don't care because you have totally taken power from their hands.  
  
12. Implement Shariya law harshly and force people to convert.  
  
13. You abolish secularism from your dictionary, as there is no secularism under islam rule because Islam is the only true religion.  
  
14. Bravo!! Now there are 47 Muslim countries.  
  
A lot of Islamists blame the European invasion of the world for it saying things like Europe should have never taken over other places. But as they have, they deserve this modern-day colonization and ethnic and cultural cleansing that is happening to them. These idiots like to selectively criticise history, (Each and every ethnic, religious or regional group which had power had invaded and conquered each other, but now we live in a civil post-colonial world with everyone having their own regions and culture) With their bulls#hit analogy All European countries should be at war with Islamic countries as in the past when Islamic invaders and conquers ravaged and enslaved European settlements when they invaded Europe. Brutally molesting women and kids and killing the native population. They took away European babies as blood taxes and enslaved an enormous amount of native people.  
  
Also, notice all the Islamic countries are the first ones to lecture the world about human rights and freedom when their own countries don't have Individual freedom, freedom of religion, freedom of culture, freedom of thought, freedom of way of life, freedom of speech, equal rights to women. Terminologies like liberalism, democracy, women's rights and freedom are just myths to them. Any sane person would critique Islam based on the Islamic countries, where the total foundation of their countries is based on the Quran and Islam. Islamic countries, whose culture tradition, way of life, mindset of the people, laws, and morality everything is entirely based on Islam and that book. Believing the lies of a Muslim living in a free country in the West, Asia or anywhere else, defending Islam by saying something like ""that's not real Islam"", ""that's not how Islam"" etc is totally stupid.  
  
A lot of Europeans are blinded by liberalism and self-hatred and are programmed by their government to ethnically and culturally clean themselves (I mean the funniest thing I have l seen is gay people supporting the propagation of Islam when Islam technically says to kill or put them in life'-in prison.) This is happening right in front of your eyes. This has been happening in France right in front of our eyes. Sadly 101 percent happen in the entirety of Europe America and Asia too until so many open-minded people more like swollen-minded people, just stitch their minds together and think straight for a second and act against it.

I think 18 years is a long enough “trial version” or “tutorial” of life and one should be able to imagine how their life is going to be if they stay their current path.

They shouldn’t be bombarded with people trying to change their mind or be forced to attend therapy or psychiatric evaluation.
They also shouldn’t be forced to continue to live their life (if it’s miserable or not), if they don’t want to for whatever reason.  I always hear “killing yourself is so selfish”, or something along those lines.  I think it’s also selfish to want someone to keep living just so you don’t feel X, Y, Z. If they have dependents, I can understand it being more selfish, so that scenario may need to be handled differently.

I think ultimately my issue lies with the fact that by virtue of our incredibly divided society, all politicians are financially dependent on capital owners and rely heavily on establishment media support. It costs millions to finance a campaign of an important scale. The working class lacks any ability to compete with capital owners in this regard and so we are doomed to pick between representatives if different sects of capital owners, who all have the same overarching interests in opposition to the working class. In an electoral system the working class will never be able to have its interests supercede that of the capital owners, while we are doomed to have our interests be dominated by the capital owners at every conflict. We only get lucky when more capital owners determine that they should fund politicians who seek to raise income for the sake of raising commodity consumption than those who don't.

What better way to close this gap than by making available those idle resources through trade or mutual exchange of value between the owners of the resources and those who need access to them

it becomes a win-win for everyone: the owners of the resources get compensated while the users of resources get to also benefit from use.

This is different from the common ""donation"" approach which basically appeals more to guilt than common sense

However, I have lived for 18 years in London and several years now living in Stockholm, so I am certainly much more familiar with British culture and Swedish culture than any American who claims ""British ancestry"" or ""Swedish ancestry"" but have never even visited these countries! This is not unique to Americans; here in Sweden, there are people who claim to have ancestry from elsewhere that makes them uniquely qualified to comment on what life is like in eg. the Middle East or the Balkans. But they don't actually know what life is like there, as they have never lived outside of the country they were born and raised in, and the perspectives they have of their ancestral countries come from people who decided to leave it behind.

More than just irritating, I think people claiming to ""be from"" a country that they have never lived in (and often never even been to!) is downright dangerous. It spreads factually inaccurate stereotypes about countries and nationalities, when those stereotypes may be completely untrue, or at best only reflect the behaviours and actions of the immigrant communities in which these people grew up, NOT the people they left behind."

the fact it is, homophobia is a problem that many lgbt people deal with, whether homophobic bullying at school (especially middle school) or having unaccepting families and even if you haven't experienced homophobia directly you've probably heard people around you use homophobic slurs and i think media should reflect peoples struggles (though that's just my opinion)

1,2023-11-26,CMV: The hyperfocus on the Israel/Gaza conflict is at best deeply hypocritical and at worst anti-semitic,u/HannibalBarcaBAMF,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/184ak2a/cmv_the_hyperfocus_on_the_israelgaza_conflict_is/,changemyview,"TLDR; The people being outraged about what's happening in Gaza right are being selective about their outrage, ignoring other cases of genocide/ethnic cleansings in the world. At best these people doesn't care about these other cases, and at worst it seems that they only care about ethnic cleansings when it's done by jews

All over the internet I've seen people be outraged over Israel's actions in Gaza. From celebrities speaking out, countless of anti-israel/pro-palestine posts on many leftist/left-leaning subs here on reddit alone, and more anti-Israel demonstrations than I can remember. And I don't deny what's happening over in Gaza. I don't deny what's happening over there is terrible.

But you know what's also terrible? [The ongoing Turkish occupation of northern Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_occupation_of_northern_Syria) which has seen ethnic cleansing of Kurds, Christians, Yazidis and other minorities. [The Rohingya genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_genocide) which has seen tens of thousands children and women raped, villages destroyed and more than 700 000 Rohingya muslims have become refugees, who are often mistreated in the countries they flee to. Or what about the [Tigray War?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigray_War) A conflict which left close to 3 million peple internally displaced, 13 million in need of food aid and killed up 600 000 people? That is terrible

And have any of the people now outraged about what's happening in Gaza made as much as a squeak about any of this? Melissa Barrera, [who was recently fired from Scream 7 due to pro-palestine posts,](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-67494374) has she made even as much as a comment about Northern Syria, Tigray or the Rohingya? No, not a single one. Search for Tigray on r/ TheMajorityReport, a leftist sub that is now filled with anti-Israel and pro-palestine posts, and you won't find anything that as much as mentions the Tigray war. The same pattern repeats itself when it comes basically every person or any community I've seen that is outspoken about the Israel/Gaza conflict. They will shout at the top of their lungs about what Israel is doing, but what happened in Tigray, or what's happening to the Rohingya doesn't even exist on their radar. 

If your principled stand against genocide and ethnic cleansing only exists in regards to the Israel/Gaza conflict, then you in truth has no principles against ethnic cleansing or genocide at all. And I really don't want to hear any moralizing about people who are outraged about the Israeli/Gaza conflict, but for whom the Rohingya might not even exist at all. And I honestly find it mighty suspect that these people are seemingly only against ethnic cleansing and genocide when jews are the ones doing it. Seems to me that they might not have a problem with ethnic cleansing, as much as they have a problem with jews. "

It was goofy, but while watching I remembered that my high school did the exact same thing. I went to a decently well-funded public school in the Midwest during the early 21st century. 

At the time I didn’t care all that much, I was raised Christian but I was always a curious kid so I already knew about and believed in evolution. Actually, I did care a little bit because, while on the debate team, I *lost* a debate regarding whether creationism should be taught in schools. So maybe you could say the episode reminded me of some embarrassing high school moments. 

I agree with the Simpsons: creationism should *not* be taught in school because there is no scientific merit to the book of Genesis. Schools are institutions of science and evolution is science. Churches are where children should learn about creationism and how religion squares with our contemporary world. 

Still, as an adult I don’t care all that much, so my opinion can still be subject to change. I lost the debate arguing that creationism should *not* be taught in public schools, so obviously there are valid arguments as to why creationism *should* be taught in schools. 

I should also note, I chose the words in the title carefully. Creationism should not be taught *at all.* In my school it was an option, you could learn about evolution and creationism in tandem. I’m taking a rather extreme position that creationism shouldn’t be taught at all. So maybe change my view so that I can see the merit of teaching them both and giving the option for students. Or change my view that creationism should be taught instead of the evolution hoax. 

TL;DR: creationism shouldn’t be taught in schools at all, even if it’s taught alongside evolution."

I personally couldn't care less where someone is from as long as the person is considerate, polite and has manners (and, preferably, displays a reasonable standard of education). I live in the UK, though I'm an immigrant here myself. I was born in a poor country where people are pretty rude, but emigrated to Western Europe as a teen.  
Now, when I e.g. go shopping, and the man at the counter is black and doesn't say hello or bye (while nice white British ladies mostly say something like ""Hello love""), and I say both hi and by, then I obviously register this. And I can't help by feel racist for thinking: He's like that because his family is from Africa (or maybe he himself is from Africa), and they are poor and rude there, and when they move to a wealthy western country, they don't try to adapt. The same goes for e.g. delivery guys.  
Of course, I do realise that this isn't just about one's ethnic origins. This is also about one's level of education and ""class"" (pardon the expression) - but one's education and class are dictated by one's ethnic origins, among other things.

1,2023-11-26,CMV: Israel's crimes do not deserve this much attention,u/phileconomicus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/184d9iq/cmv_israels_crimes_do_not_deserve_this_much/,changemyview,"*Important: My CMV is only about Israel as a state and is very specific. It is not any kind of defence of any actor in the present conflict. Nor does it concern Israelis as a people (Jewish or otherwise). I will not reply to any comments that go in even the direction of anti-semitism or other racialisms, and will immediately report them to the mods for removal.*

I believe that the state of Israel has historically committed significant 'mass atrocity crimes' (i.e. war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity), and continues to do so in the present conflict. These are crimes that are by definition the duty of the international community to investigate and attempt to prevent and punish ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_to_protect)). So Israel's actions do deserve the world's attention and condemnation. That point is not what my CMV is about.

My CMV is that Israel's crimes receive **more** global attention and condemnation that they ought to, by two distinct criteria: 1) moral neglect of equally bad or worse crimes and 2) ineffectiveness at making the world better.

1) The level of attention to Israel's crimes is excessive because it comes at the expense of attending to the crimes committed by other states (and sub-state actors). Consider how the Israel news story has eclipsed all others, even while similar or greater crimes are occurring right now in multiple countries from China to Myanmar to Sudan to Ethiopia (and more). Even in years without a 'hot conflict', the UN frequently passes more resolutions critical of Israel than of every other country in the world put together ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_Nations_resolutions_concerning_Israel)). A key principle should be that mass atrocity crimes deserve the world's attention because of the evil nature of the crime, not the identity of the state doing them. 

2) It might be argued that global attention should be allocated not in proportion to the moral magnitude of the crimes being committed, but in proportion to the likely effectiveness of such engagement in deterring or ending such crimes. This might justify paying more attention to Israel's crimes than to China's, given the almost complete immunity of China's governing regime from moral criticism or international sanctions. Yet it seems that there are many crimes that would be much easier to do something about than Israel's. Most obviously the almost unimaginably brutal and genocidal civil war in Sudan seems far more amenable to external intervention (aid, sanctions, and perhaps even military intervention), not least because unlike Israel the geopolitics is so much simpler (only one external player - the tiny UAE). Yet the mass atrocity crimes of Sudan are being almost completely ignored by the world ([link](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/16/the-world-is-ignoring-war-genocide-and-famine-in-sudan)). 

&#x200B;

**Sidenote: Explanation is not justification**

It is of course easy to explain why Israel's crimes receive so much attention, but these do not amount to justifications. For example

* The complex and unsettled geopolitics of the region mean that lots of states have an interest in what happens in Israel, which then draws in even more countries (such as China or Russia looking to distract or embarrass the US).
* The compelling histories, recent and ancient, of the peoples and territory concerned fascinate, excite and outrage great numbers of people. 
* Reporting from Israel is relatively easy (compared to places like Sudan, China, or Myanmar) so the world can follow Israel's actions much more closely

I think the initial accelerator for this was a planned gouvernament psyop.

I'm not here to judge anyone's appearance or other's prefference on attractiveness. I am of the opinion that those preferences has been **artificially shifted over time.**

It seems to me that the obesity and overweight percentages in the US correlate directly with the popularity of this movement. This may seem like a natural result of normalization of being overweight, but I don't think biologically people's attraction would naturally **shift that fast.**

Biologically, sexual attraction is driven by healthy looking features, including an athetic body. Sure, a lot of people may deviate from the mean, but that IS the mean.

Usually I am the type of person that **debunks** conspiracy theories. But this has always seemed suspicious to me.

Why would the gouvernament care? Fertility rates. If the average women would seem unappealing to the average man, then the fertility rate would drop. Also, this alienation based on BMI would further cause disruption and hate in society.

So, I guess what I'm asking is... Please debunk this for me."

Average should be better though in the instance that it should have the highest possibility of working with most women.




And yet it's clear that larger is more aesthetically pleasing and erotic/fetishizing for both Men and Women. Just read any literotica for Women and rarely do guys have an average size or smaller.

They act like it's a charming personality trait, but it's not. It's a sign of poor physical literacy, lack of awareness, and low self-control.

Physical literacy is the ability to move with competence and confidence in a variety of physical activities and environments. It's a skill that can be learned and improved with practice, just like reading or writing. It's not something you are born with or without. It's something you work on throughout your life.

Clumsy people are lazy because they don't want to work on their physical literacy. They don't care about improving their coordination, balance, agility, or strength. They don't pay attention to their surroundings, or their movements. They don't take responsibility for their actions, they blame it on bad luck, fate, or genetics.

Clumsy people are irresponsible because they cause harm to themselves and others. They break things, spill things, knock things over, and create messes. They injure themselves, bruise themselves, cut themselves, and bleed. They hurt other people, poke them, elbow them, step on them, and hit them. They are a hazard to everyone around them.

My girlfriend is one of these clumsy people. She keeps accidentally hitting me, yesterday she poked me in the eye twice and elbowed me in the same eye again once I was sleeping, is that not excessive? It's annoying and painful. She doesn't try to be more careful, she says it's just how she is. She doesn't respect my feelings surrounding this.

I'm fed up with clumsiness. Clumsy people are not cute, they are lazy and irresponsible. **They need to stop making excuses and start working on their physical literacy.** They need to stop hurting themselves and others and start respecting themselves and others. They need to grow up and get their act together."

Animation as a whole allows for the characters to do the impossible you can’t do with regular human bodies, but in the scope of animation your allowed to get a way with a lot more than in live action.

I’ll use Game of Thrones as an example, Game of Thrones in many ways would have benefited from being animated, firstly John Snow. His character comes off as very flat and one dimensional on screen he’s always brooding barely ever smiling he comes off as boring. But in the books John really comes off more in his inner monologues, he comes off complex and actually has a character, we know more about him his decisions etc. I don’t think I’ve seen a person think out loud, in live action and it not come off goofy. 

As well as fights. As I said before Scott Pilgrim Takes off inspired this post, fight scenes in animation have more of a spectacle to them, and I’m not just talking about Anime, I watch invincible and the fights in that show are always 10/10. In the Scott pilgrim the fights were not that interesting like when Matthew Patel does his dance with the girls it’s so strange, and awkward in animation his abilities work, when he fights when he dances it all works well.

Netflix live action one piece does this as well, let’s even compare Zoro vs Mihawk, in the anime, Mihawks over whelming skill over Zoro is accurately showcased, it’s done so well that while Zoro has skill his desperation to hit mihawk shines through every single strike. In the live action it doesn’t work the same, while the live action tries it comes off like a caricature. Especially in the event of Luffy’s powers."

However, many millennials just say that having kids won't be great for them personally. That they should be able to choose what's best for them. I think in 20-30+ years, that will be viewed as extremely selfish, the same way as boomers outsourced jobs and restricted new housing, because it simply benefitted them personally at the time.

1,2023-11-26,CMV: a worker’s replaceability should not drive down their wages,u/darth_snuggs,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/184grel/cmv_a_workers_replaceability_should_not_drive/,changemyview,"From my perspective, it’s morally problematic and practically unsustainable to allow a “free market” calculus of employer demand and worker supply to drive wages. 

The question shouldn’t be whether the particular worker can be replaced with another worker. The question is whether someone doing the job is necessary to the company’s profit model (or the successful fulfillment of a non-profit or government entity’s mission).

Any given employee might be replaceable with a similarly skilled employee, but I would argue that doesn’t matter. The point is that the employer cannot function without *someone* in those positions, doing those jobs. And anyone doing those jobs is, at least for the duration of their employment, *doing essential work* that keeps the business afloat. The whole business model depends on there being people in those roles, doing that labor. 

(Note: I’m not operating from an elaborate Marxist framework about “surplus value” here. I haven’t read much economic theory. Here I’m arguing in way more practical terms than that, informed by years of minimum wage work & later “skilled” labor. If a person doesn’t cook the burgers, the owner cannot sell burgers—that’s all I’m getting at.)

As long as our economy revolves around the reality of these service jobs, it’s a built-in assumption that *human beings will have to do this work,* and that the economy would fail if people did not do that work. Therefore, from a moral standpoint, those people should be compensated well enough to survive in whatever place they happen to live and work. And from a practical standpoint, social conditions will grow increasingly unstable in any system that presumes that a large % of its necessary labor force will not be able to survive on their pay/benefits. Eventually people will turn—if not on the ruling class, then on each other.

In the past, I have been unpersuaded by counter-arguments about this. I find that refutations often rely on circular reasoning: that our economy has to treat “replaceable” jobs as subject to the whims of the market because that’s just “how things are.” I just don’t find that any more compelling than appeals to any other “fundamental truth.” Especially when so many societies out there are so much better about worker’s rights than my own (the US).

But, on balance, I know I am not deeply informed about this issue. To be persuaded, I’d need some practical evidence that, on balance, adopting my perspective would hurt more people than it helps."

Antinatalism posits that there is an asymmetry regarding procreation: Creating positive lives is amoral, while creating negative lives is immoral. However, any attempts to justify this asymmetry by saying nobody exists to benefit from creating a positive existence (or other arguments relating to Benatar's asymmetry) are nonsensical, because one could always respond that nobody exists to be harmed from having a negative existence.

I believe the left is better equipped to address these issues (not communists, the reasonable left.) Reparations are an incredibly divisive issue that most people do not support. Pushing them will hurt the left's political chances, decreasing our power and making it a great deal more difficult, if not impossible, to address other critical problems that affect every group. If we can solve these problems, I think it is incumbent on us to do so. Reparations are an obstacle to this goal and a fiscally left platform that nixes reparations will still have plenty of black support with the added benefit of not scaring off white voters. 

That's more the political side of things. From a moral perspective, if the goal is to reduce harm and suffering- which seems like the most moral goal to me- helping everybody secure basic needs is a far better approach than giving large amounts of money to one group. San Francisco's pie in the sky proposal would give one group of people enough money to meet their needs and obtain certain comforts and luxuries beyond that instead of giving everybody enough money to meet their needs. 

And I'll be honest: I would rather everybody have their basic needs met and reparations not be repaid than reparations be repaid and everybody not have their basic needs met.

Rock, soft rock, and pop was in its’ “transition phase”, and the experimentation in this period birthed some of the most well-known songs to date.

Here’s some examples:

Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody (1975) and Another One Bites The Dust (1980)
ABBA - Mamma Mia (1975), Dancing Queen, Money x3 (1976), Angeleyes, Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (1979), and Lay All Your Love On Me (1980)
BeeGees - Stayin’ Alive (1977)
Village People - Y.M.C.A (1978)
Pink Floyd - Another Brick In the Wall (1979)
Journey - Don’t Stop Believin’ (1981)
Survivor - Eye Of the Tiger (1982)
Michael Jackson - Thriller, Beat It, and Billie Jean (1982)
George Michael - Careless Whisper (1984)
A-Ha - Take On Me (1985)
TOTO - Africa (1982)
Chicago - (Album) Chicago 17 (1984)

This decade gave us some of the best tracks to ever be produced, but it also gave up better ways to listen to music. Cassettes were invented in 1962, but they really kicked off in this period. The compact disc (CD) was even invented in 1982 and became the standard music format for most artists in the early 90’s.

Singers also simply had more talent in this generation, as autotune and pitch correction hadn’t been invented yet. Nowadays, anyone can “sing” by just saying some lyrics in time and tuning them afterwards. But until 1997, artists had to sing without tons of filters, allowing their pure voices to shine through. For these reasons, I think that this era was the peak of music so far, and no artists have come close to the brilliance of these legends.

a common rebuttal you see against veganism is ""I'm going to go eat a burger"" or ""I'm going to go eat some bacon lol"" Proponents of anti-veganism will often talk about the health problems with the diet.

But, if you compare this to the SAD (Standard American Diet) or western diet that most people in the US are on before becoming vegan, you'll see that the problems pale in comparison to what was happening beforehand. And, this diet is starting to plague other countries as well. Only 12% percent of Americans eat the recommended amount of fruit, and 9% eating the recommended amount of vegetables. (probably myself included) The SAD diet is full of foods like Fried foods, Grain-based desserts, High-fat dairy Processed foods, Processed meats (e.g., bacon and deli meats), Red meat, Refined grains (e.g., white pasta, white flour, etc.), and Sugar-sweetened beverages. It critically lacks vital things like whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and low fat dairy. While in a vegan diet, you may lack things like protein, B-12, and omega fatty acids (these are often supplemented though) the SAD diet is also lacking, missing important nutrients like Calcium, vitamin D, fiber, and potassium. The SAD diet contributes to many health problems like some types of cancer, Cardiovascular disease, constipation, type 2 diabetes, ect. 

Not every vegan diet is healthy of course. You could be vegan and eat a diet full of ramen, candy, and other junk. But, it in order to feel full, I imagine you'd have to stick closer to what is recommended. It is recommended to eat 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 cups of fruit and 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 cups of vegetables a day. I think it would be much easier to achieve this goal if your diet is plant based. Overall, I find it hypocritical to complain about the health effects of veganism if you are eating this diet. If you are eating a diet full of healthy animal products, plants, then I don't see the issue really, but that's not what i see lol. Even if we aren't vegan, we should all work to include more plant based meals into our diet. "

 There’s a few incidents when you dig into either what he wrote or what he has said he seems wrong on some very basic points. There is a [talk](https://youtu.be/hq-sYP5VobA?feature=shared) on YouTube.

He goes on a little digression on the cause of the violence on Northern Ireland. The short version is that he blames it all on religious violence. Anyone who knows anything about Northern Ireland knows it’s almost entirely rooted in ethnic nationalism. Religion has little to no relevance to the conflict. 

A layman you would expect to make this basic mistake but a British journalist / academic ? Someone who claims to be a journalist ? 

His writing or speeches have these little moments when he touches on something someone could have direct knowledge on and he is very wrong and so confident in being wrong, you start to doubt his views.

There is his writing on Mother Theresa in which he ranted against her saying she denied medicines to sick people in the slums in India because it brought them closer to god (what she believed). Forgetting that were very little painkillers or real drugs available. Many of these people would have died anyways. Conditions in the 1950s/60s weren’t the best in India back. Some of these people had diseases like leprousy or were [Dalits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit) and regarded as untouchable (literally). 


He is the main source of the idea of Kissinger being the worst war criminal of the late 20th century. His book is regarded as very [flawed](https://www.theguardian.com/books/live/2015/oct/09/niall-ferguson-webchat-kissinger-biography?page=with:block-561baa2ce4b05fda645c57a7#liveblog-navigation) and he isn’t a historian. I’m not defending Kissinger but he seemed to more or less slander him with a poorly researched book.

The real lack of credibility is 9/11 on which he was completely wrong in every respect. Research that for yourself but he sold his soul to neocons.

He seemed to write and talk very confidently on many things but not do basic research or any kind of factual analysis but make up his mind about something and work his way to it. To me he lacks credibility as some very simple things he espouses are based on flimsy evidence."
1,2023-11-26,CMV: 18 year olds should be allowed to get sterilised and you should be able to sue a doctor for denying you the procedure.,u/Vose4492,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/184ku46/cmv_18_year_olds_should_be_allowed_to_get/,changemyview,"In the United States, where I live, anyone over the age of 21 is technically allowed to get a sterilization surgery. However, many doctors refuse to sterilize people. Many doctors will only sterilize you if you are over a certain age or you have a certain number of children. The idea is that if a young child free person gets sterilized, he or she may regret it, later on, when and if the patient in question wishes to have children. Even if you can find a doctor willing to sterilize you, let’s see if your insurance is willing to pay for it. In some countries, it is actually illegal to undergo a sterilisation procedure unless you are over 40 years of age or you have had children before. 

If you ask me, I believe that, as soon as you turn 18, you should be able to undergo a sterilisation procedure. If a doctor provides sterilisation procedures to some people, they should be required to provide it for all people. Doctors should not be allowed to discriminate for non-medical reasons. 

Let’s go over two concerns doctors have and why they refuse to provide these procedures to childless 18 year olds. 

Concern #1: You may regret having the procedure. 

If you get sterilised and decide later on that you want kids, you could adopt, hire a surrogate or utilise the services of a sperm bank. Even if you have a sterilisation surgery and go on to regret it, at least that only affects you. You chose to have that sterilisation surgery, so it only affects you, that is completely fair. If, on the other hand, you want to have a sterilisation procedure and you are denied one, a child could be born to two parents who are not prepared to take care of him or her. If you can't get sterilised and you have an unplanned child, that child is statistically more likely to be abused or neglected and is statistically more likely to live in poverty. That isn't fair to the child who had no control over the circumstances of his/her own conception and birth.

Which is worse, regretting having a sterilisation procedure or resenting your children? 

Concern #2: At 18, your brain is not fully developed, so you are not mature enough to make that decision. 

The part of the brain responsible for impulse control is not fully developed until the age of 25, that is true. Consequently, teenagers have notoriously pour impulse control. To remedy this issue, I propose we implement a mandatory 30 day waiting period. That way, impulse control is not a problem. Science teaches us that the teenage brain has knowledge and reasoning ability to make decisions ( https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=3051 ). Impulse control is the achilles heal of the teenage brain. You can impulsively have unprotected sex, smoke a cigarette, get involved in a fight or drive over the speed limit. Under the policy for which I advocate, you will not be able to go get a vasectomy or tubal ligation surgery on impulse. 

If 18 year olds are not mature enough to undergo sterilisation procedures, then a lot of other age requirements need to be reconsidered. Here are a few things 18 year olds are legally allowed to do, that are significantly riskier than undergoing a sterilisation procedure. 

Obtaining a driver’s license without the permission of a parent.  

A person who is 16 or 17 years of age can obtain a driver’s licence with the permission of a parent. As soon as you turn 18, parental permission is no longer required. Over 40,000 Americans died in car accidents in 2021. 

[https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+americans+died+in+car+accidents&rlz=1C5CHFA\_enUS959US960&oq=how+many+americans+died+in+car+accidents&gs\_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBBzQwMWowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+americans+died+in+car+accidents&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS959US960&oq=how+many+americans+died+in+car+accidents&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBBzQwMWowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) 

I would bet money I do not have that the annual number of people who die as a result of having a sterilisation procedure is significantly lower than 40,000. Clearly, driving is significantly riskier than having a sterilisation procedure. Anyone who is mature enough to get a driver’s licence without parental permission is mature enough to undergo a sterilisation procedure. 

Vote. 

This one explains itself, it affects the entire country. At the age of 18, you are mature enough to decide what is best for your country, but not mature enough to decide what is best for yourself?  

Be held financially responsible for a child you produced.

In the United States where I live, child support laws basically say this; 

Once a child is born, if both biological parents want to give the child up for adoption, that can happen. However, as soon as one biological parent decides that they feel like keeping the child, it then becomes the responsibility of the other biological parent to support the child financially, even if the latter never wanted the child in the first place. If the mother wants to keep the child, she can sue the father for child support. He might not have even wanted the baby. He might have wanted her to abort, she might have lived in a state where abortion is legal, she might have given birth anyway just to spite him, that does not matter. He is on the hook for child support weather he wants to be or not. On the other hand, if the mother gives the child up for adoption, the father is first in line for custody. I have no problem with that. What I do have a problem with is that the father can demand child support payments from the mother. To hear more about this issue, click this link ( https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalOpinions/comments/17d9ezv/you\_should\_be\_able\_to\_opt\_out\_of\_financial/ ). 

Any requirement that you have to meet in order to have a sterilisation procedure, you should have to meet that same criterion to be held financially responsible for a child you do not want. If people under a certain age are not allowed to undergo permanent sterilisation, then you should not be forced to be financially accountable for a child, if you where under that age at the time of conception. If you should need to have a certain number of children before you are allowed to be sterilised, then anyone who has not chosen to parent that many children should not be forced to be accountable for an unwanted child. 

If you are not mature enough to undergo a sterilisation procedure, then it follows logically that you should not be held financially responsible for a child you bring into the world, if you do not want to be financially responsible. It would not be fair to subject someone to adult responsibilities like forced child support payments, but then treat them like children who do not know what they want to do with their own lives. 

I would argue that there are many reasons why it would work the benefit of society to provide sterilisation procedures to anyone over the age of 18 who requests a procedure. Here are a few such reasons. 

Reason #1: The belief that doctors have a duty to sterilise young childless people contradicts other conservative principles. 

The people who most worry about a person regretting the decision to get sterilised and therefore believe that a doctor has a duty to not sterilise young childless people are often the same people who are morally against abortion. That is all the more reason for those particular people to want people to have access to sterilisation surgeries, as it will prevent unwanted pregnancies from happening, thereby preventing abortions.

Reason #2: It will benefit the people economically and improve the physical health of the general population. 

Planned children are usually healthier. There is ample evidence that babies do best when women are able to space their pregnancies and get both prenatal and preconception care. The specific nutrients women ingest before they get pregnant can have a lifelong effect on the health of the offspring. Also, women are more likely to look after themselves during pregnancy if it was planned. Wanted babies are more likely to be welcomed into families that are financially and emotionally ready to receive them and to get preventive medical care during childhood. Therefore, more and more people having access to sterilisation surgeries will have economic benefits.

Reason #3: It is the most effective way of ensuring that the world population remains neither overpopulated nor underpopulated. 

If every single person, who can reproduce, did so, the world would become over populated. On the other hand, if enacted the policy that existed in China at one point, where you where only allowed to have one birth per household, that would cause the planet to become underpopulated. If the right to marry and start a family is still a protected right but fewer people choose to exercise it, that is the most effective way of keeping the population at a Goldilocks size. 

Hypothetical scenarios you ought to take into account. 

Scenario #1: You are worried about giving birth to disabled kids. 

Dr Phil once did a segment on the parents of a trio of blind and deaf triplets ( https://youtu.be/TBjrn8zQgZo?si=0FFHvip03XipKrw6 ). If you are worried about this happening to you, so much so that you never want to have children, you should not have children. 

Scenario #2: You may get pregnant from rape and be forced to give birth. 

Imagine an 18 year old high school senior goes to a gynaecologist and asks for a tubal ligation surgery, because she recently went through a pregnancy scare and does not want to have to deal with that again. Her gynaecologist laughs at her condescendingly, because the doctor sees it as absurd the idea that just because you are legally old enough to vote and be tried as an adult in a court of law, that makes you mature enough to decide what you want to do with your life. 

Fast forward 7 years. The now 25 year old woman falls pregnant after being raped. Because she lives in a state where abortion is illegal even in cases of rape, she has to give birth. Even though she is pursuing adoption, she still has to pay for the cost of prenatal healthcare. That is so costly, she has to move back in with her parents. Unsurprisingly, she is being slut shamed for ending up pregnant before marriage. When she explains to people that she was raped, a lot of people do not believe her. When people do believe her, they ask her a lot of questions about how the rape happened, to figure out what she could have done to prevent it, then they victim blame her for not taking those precautions. 

The child is born. She gives the child up for adoption. The father gets custody of the child. Any laws about rape and the rights of victims would not apply in this case, as she did not report the rape. When a woman gives her child up for adoption, the father is next in line for custody and the father can take the mother to court and demand child support payments. That is what happens to this woman. 

If the gynaecologist had just performed the tubal ligation surgery on the woman like the patient wanted, this could have been avoided. Because the doctor was paranoid about the possibility that the patient may regret having a tubal ligation surgery, the woman now had to give birth to an unwanted child and pay child support to her rapist. 

Scenario #3: You might not be able to afford children. 

This one explains itself. 

Scenario #4: 

A woman already has four children and she has a medical condition that makes hormonal birth control not work. Her husband’s vasectomy fails. She has a high risk pregnancy with her fifth child. 

The fear of people regretting having permanent sterilisation is irrational, not because it does not happen, but because even if it does happen, the potential consequences of regretting a sterilisation procedure is miniscule in magnitude compared to the potential consequences of having children you do not want. 

Look at the above hypotheticals. I would say that these hypotheticals are all much scarier than regretting a sterilisation surgery. 

Does your doctor have a right to refuse the service?

I am sure that at least some of you will probably agree with me that you have a right to obtain a sterilisation procedure, but your doctor has a right to deny you that procedure. 

I disagree. Imagine if a woman wanted to get a breast reduction surgery, to alleviate back aches and have an easier time finding bras that fit. Imagine the plastic surgeon refused her that procedure, because she is single and undergoing the procedure might make it more difficult to attract a mate. Should the plastic surgeon be allowed to do that? 

If you said no, a plastic surgeon should not be allowed to discriminate based on marital status, why is it different if a urologist or gynaecologist discriminates based on the number of children you have? Both of these are clearly different from discriminating based on a medical issue. The doctor’s medical training enables them to understand, better than you, what will or won’t cause medical issues. However, a woman who has had a breast reduction surgery having a harder time attracting a mate and regretting a vasectomy or tubal ligation surgery are not medical issues. 

If, however, you said that the plastic surgeon should be allowed to discriminate, I disagree. Click this link ( https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalOpinions/comments/16fl0td/businesses\_should\_not\_be\_allowed\_to\_discriminate/ ) to hear an argument that doctors should not be allowed to deny people breast reduction surgeries because of marital status. If, after reading that post, you still do not agree with me, tell me why. 

Counter arguments and my refutation of them. 

Argument #1: Your doctor, with all his/her medical training knows better than you what is best for you. 

The question as to which is worse; resenting your children or regretting a sterilisation procedure, is a philosophical question. 

Argument #2: Doctors should be allowed to discriminate based on age and the number of children you have, just as doctors can discriminate when deciding who to prescribe aderall. 

Doctors should discriminate when prescribing adderall, because that is a medical issue. Their medical training enables them to know if being prescribed adderall is best for you or not. 

Regret is not a medical issue. 

Besides, while a person who undergoes permanent sterilisation may regret that, a person who has children could regret having children. You can decide for yourself which of those risks you would rather take. 

Argument #3: It is much less harmful for those who will not regret the sterilisation procedure to have the minor inconvenience of using birth control for a couple oif decades. 

First of all, I think it is a bit of an understatement to reduce decades of having to use birth control to a minor inconvenience. 

Second of all, birth control can fail. 

Third, having to use birth control is not the worst thing that can happen to someone who is denied permanent sterilisation. You might resent your children. 

Argument #4: Just use the IUD. 

Three things. 

What about men who want (and are unable to obtain) vasectomies? That I know of, there is no male equivalent to the IUD. 

Many anti-abortion advocates take issue with the IUD, because it kills fertilised eggs ( [https://reproductiverights.org/iuds-are-like-abortion-wait-what/](https://reproductiverights.org/iuds-are-like-abortion-wait-what/) ). 

What if doctors started refusing to provide the IUD, as they are currently doing with tubal ligation surgeries? 

Regarding that last point, I do not know how likely that is to happen. However, it is theoretically possible, that is good enough. 

Argument #5: Resenting your children isn’t the result of a medical procedure. 

That would be the the answer to the question; is resenting your children the result of a medical procedure? 

The question is was asking was; Which is worse, regretting a sterilisation procedure or resenting your children? 

Telling me that resenting your children isn’t the result of a medical procedure does not tell me if resenting your children is worse, less bad or equally as bad as regretting a sterilisation procedure. 

Argument #6: Regretting sterilisation procedures happens more frequently than resenting your children.

Not everyone who regrets having children reports it. Some of them claim to be happy when they are not. Therefore, we do not know (and probably never will know) for sure if this is accurate. Even if this is accurate, so what? It is likely the case that people committing felonies and getting away with it happens more often than people being wrongly convicted for felonies they did not commit. Does that mean that we should do away with the presumption of innocence? 

Argument #7: If you cannot purchase alcohol, you should not be allowed to have a sterilisation procedure.   
I happen to be in favour of lowering the drinking age to 18, so this does not even apply to me. However, even I can think of a reason why purchasing alcohol is riskier than having a sterilisation procedure. 

You can impulsively buy alcohol. Under the policy for which I advocate, you would be required to wait a 30 day waiting period before undergoing the procedure. 

Argument #8: You are obligated to have children. 

This argument essentially means that you should fulfill your duty to reproduce and anyone who has not fulfilled that duty should not be allowed to undergo permanent sterilisation. 

I disagree. To see an argument that having children is NOT your moral duty, click this link ( https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/176ecg8/cmv\_it\_is\_not\_your\_moral\_duty\_to\_reproduce/ ). If, after reading that entire post, you still sincerely believe that it is your moral duty to reproduce, tell me why you still believe that. 

Imagine that someone showed you a button. If you press the button, you will suddenly live in a country where any 18 year old can obtain  sterilisation procedure, if a doctor refuses to provide you the procedure, you can sue them in the same way that you would sue them for racist discrimination. Insurance companies are required to cover the procedure. Before you press the button, you must look into the future. 

You look into the future and see an epidemic of spinsters who regret having tubal ligation. I would still press the button. It is better (in my opinion) to regret having permanent sterilisation than it is to regret having children.

The ease of access to information, coupled with the ability to connect with like-minded individuals globally, has enabled the rapid dissemination and reinforcement of radical beliefs. many in Gen Z can get caught up in online echo chambers that reinforce extremist ideologies, many may develop a distorted view of the world that is marked by hostility towards those who are perceived as different. 

We see the with the rise of Tate, the alt right, and the like. Even on reddit which is very liberal by internet standards can often have racist and misogynistic posts and comments on front page threads. And these echo chambers seem to be getting bigger and more numerous. When rarely if ever platforms take action against them, they just make another channel, subreddit, etc that is often bigger then the last. 

Its scary because as a minority, we are called vulnerable for a reason. For minorities, this presents a genuine threat, as these radicalized individuals contribute to real-world discrimination and violence. The atomization of society, economic stress and the increasing reliance on the internet can exacerbate these issues, as lonely poor people are more susceptible to extremist ideologies. "

The poll is more than a month old, and it also said that a majority of Muslims believed that Israel has the right to defend itself, making the results somewhat contradictory.

My faith in humanity at large is officially at an all-time low. I’ve had little to no faith in humanity for a while, to the point where I began to believe that morality is unnatural and the result of indoctrination. The Oct. 7 massacre and subsequent Israel-Hamas war has only made me more misanthropic. You have entire groups of people supporting terrorists, you have numerous displays of pure depravity, and you have rising ethnic and religious hatred worldwide. In my view, our entire race is at fault. It takes very little for us to dream of the slaughter of innocents. I remember reading Crispin Sartwell’s The Genocidal Killer in the Mirror and learning about Milgram’s obedience study when I was in high school. Both Sartwell and Milgram said that it’s very easy to make someone willing to commit genocide. I agree wholeheartedly.

I’ve heard some other disturbing information. It’s no secret that *Homo sapiens* have been killing each other ever since we evolved. However, what makes humans unique is that they are the only known species that kill for conflicting ideas. According to one scholarly source, the reason could be psychological. From what I’ve heard, changing one’s beliefs uses up quite a bit of energy, as the brain already consumes more energy than any other organ in the body. Thus, we sort of evolved to be reluctant to change our beliefs, which led us to believe that people with conflicting beliefs must therefore be liars that the world would be better off without. So, perhaps genocide is in our nature. That’s what I’m led to believe. The fact that people have tried to justify genocide, as Sartwell writes, makes this idea believable to me."

A staggering amount of people believe that putting in the required amount of work in any skill will result in a definitive improvement in ability. For example, it's often said that by doing years of structured and targeted practice, even the most artistically inept person will be able to to produce decent art.

Through my whole life, almost everyone I've brought this concept up to were dramatically offended by it. It seems almost everyone believes fervently that hard work will always result in major improvement and good results. They don't want to believe it's possible to suck so much at something that the improvement will only result in a marginal increase in ability, like going from being incredibly bad at something to being just very bad.

I believe that if the concept of talent exist, ''anti-talent'' also exists. A person's baseline ability in something is not binary, it's a sliding scale. Let's say that the skill scale in question goes from -100 to 100, with the general human average of the skill being 0. Someone who ranks at -100 is completely inept at the skill, while ranking at 100 means the person is an absolute unrivaled master at it.

Practice will not always make you actually skilled at something. It will simply increase your position on the skill scale. For simplicity's sake, let's assume that in general, a lifetime of structured practice will increase your skill level by 50. If you started at -100, you would effectively end up at -50 which is still way under the human average.

Am I defeatist and pessimistic about this subject ? Yes, I have no issue admitting it, but I feel like it's more realistic than blind hope. I'm speaking from my own life experience here. I've always had incredibly low artistic ability. I've tried so hard to become good at it. For 10 years, I've practiced at drawing almost every single day. Classes, books, step by step tutorials, mentors. You name it, I've tried it. Yet, my drawing ability is about at the level of a teenager absentmindedly doodling in a notebook during boring school classes. It has always caused me a lot of grief. I have a very fertile imagination but I can't even remotely express what I see in my mind's eye. I eventually gave up on it completely.

Just to be clear, I'm not talking about actual disabilities that may heavily impair a person's potential ability in a skill. Obviously, a person who has no legs will never be good at sprinting. Yes, I know alternatives like paralympics exist. That's not what I'm talking about here."

**There’s too low population density**. Nope, at least connect and serve major cities and highly-populated metro and suburban areas. No one expects every alley and dirt road to be serviced by a mag-lev.

**There’s not enough funding**. Nope, we find the money to afford massive national defense spending. To subsidize billions worth of crops that largely go to waste or get used in industries where it isn’t even essential just to keep farming conglomerates happy. We *repeatedly* find tens of billions to bail out irresponsible corporations and industries, under the guise of “well, we would want them to face any consequences… that would be uncomfortable for some people!”. I don’t buy it.

**The capex would simply be unmanageably high, it isn’t practical.** Again, I don’t buy it. Sure it’s hard to spend lots of money up-front in favor of long-term value. *But we do that all the time.* we build fancy bridges. We send rockets to space. We build giant space telescopes. We give billions to tech companies for super-computing research, AI research, and quantum-computing research. We build and maintain massive airports, parking structures, and road infrastructure. I don’t believe it’s a CapEx / ROI problem.

I’ve considered the “well, everyone’s corrupt!” Possibility, but come on… those people would benefit from it too! I’ve considered the “we’re too dumb” explanation, but come on - we consistently lead and innovate with all kinds of other **super-expensive** crap.

So hive-mind, truly, what is the issue preventing us from having good public transit in the contiguous U.S.? I think it’s nothing more than poor organization and planning, covered up by decades of layers of excuses and kicking the can down the road."

It's important to understand the various reasons people dispute transactions.[Here's one source](https://www.clearlypayments.com/blog/chargeback-statistics-in-credit-card-processing/)  and [another](https://midigator.com/chargeback-report-statistics/). The majority of cases have to do with fraud, but I don't want this CMV to spend too much time on that, except to notice the second source is fairly emphatic that most merchants don't use good enough fraud prevention methods. We can obviously agree that customers deserve to not pay for fradulant purchases and that companies should do whatever they can to prevent fraud. 

I want to focus more on the cardholder dispute statistic. Basically, where you are not satisfied with a product/service and you want your money back. **First, I believe a chargeback should be summarily denied if the customer hasn't attempted to communicate with the merchant before disputing a purchase.** With that caveat out of the way, my argument is that customers deserve recourse in cases where a company is being unreasonable or is sticking to a return policy despite extrordinary circumstances.

I've only done one chargeback. It had to do with Priceline not wanting to change a flight even though they were offering that flight as an option. The website had a bug or some special circumstances which prevented me from being able to just get a flight credit as per their policy. The customer service agents were all telling me it would be several hundred dollars more. I tried to escalate, but decided after two hours that it wasn't worth my time and I needed to charge it back. I disputed it and then booked the flight I wanted. I sent all of that to my card company with records of all of my chats and prevailed in the dispute. 

It is absolutely possible for a company to prevail in chargebacks, and is far more successful if it has a robust customer service staff, detailed language, high-quality products, and a functional infrastructure. Companies that don't invest in those things open themselves up to more chargebacks. It's the same risk assessment dance that they do for everything else, but being able to ban people for chargebacks sidesteps it too easily. Think about it. If a company can win a dispute with the proper documentation, they're basically just choosing not to spend the time to have that documentation. The excuse for a lot of companies is that fighting chargebacks is more expensive than the actual lost revenue, which is another way of saying it's cheaper to pay chargebacks than invest in their infrastructure. 

Basically, every refund is given at the discrestion of a merchant. In the wide spectrum of refunds that get denied, on one end is an unreasonable Karen, in the middle is someone who got a customer service agent on a bad day, and on the other end is a legimate failure on behalf of a company. An unreasonable Karen would be habitual, which would get her banned from holding a credit card. Those other customers' only other recourse are chargebacks or lawsuits. Those chargebacks are powerful tools to keep companies in check, because in addition to losing revenue, they also may be banned from a credit card company for too many chargebacks.

PS. There's a statistic you can find that 86% of chargebacks are fraud. This was data gathered by chargebacks 911, which is a service for businesses to fight chargebacks, based on a survey of merchants. It is not a reliable source of information. Also, I specifically mention publicly-traded companies in the title because I don't want someone bringing up their mom who sells soap on Etsy. We make many regulations that are specific to big business, so it's not unreasonable to carve that out."

Unprecedented:  People say things like “humanity has always made porn, it’s natural” which is true but incredibly disingenuous. Humanity made pictures of sex and stories of sex, sure, but this massive amount of instantly accesible unlimited really fucked up porn has never happened, ever. No ten year old  boys were raised getting into deep throating while women cry and incest porn even fifty years ago. Men didn’t spend literally hours watching pornography and masturbating like some do now. This period of history is completely unique in regards to erotica and porn. Why are we pretending it’s normal? It’s objectively not.

That point is pretty much fact so I won’t belabor it. 

Concerning:

I have two issues I’m concerned with. One, the *type* of porn that’s so common now. And two: the effect on people, especially young male brains.

One: I know people are gonna freak out about kink shaming, but come on. The uncritical acceptance of all kink as fine is ridiculous to me. Is there any evidence that boys who grow up watching women get the shit beat out of them isn’t damaging? Because slapping and other abuse seems to be expected in blowjob porn and others, and sure seems like people are fetishizing women in pain and crying and trying to say that’s perfectly normal. From what young women say, they are being expected to do extreme sex acts that they aren’t comfortable with. And the obsession with incest is just ridiculous. Considering all the sexual abuse that happens to many children of all genders in families, “barely legal teen fucks her not dad” is fucking gross. 


2. Using critical thinking, I simply do not believe that a man who gets off to women being beat up is non-misogynistic, okay and safe. The horror stories of men infiltrating into kink communities to abuse women are ridiculously common. So how can people tell me this is completely neutral and there’s nothing unhealthy about pubescent boys training their brain on this stuff? If you start watching violent, misogynistic porn at ten there’s no chance you’re growing up with a  healthy view of women OR men. It’s not normal, or natural, to do what my coworker said his son did over the weekend and watch porn and masturbate literally all day. That’s addiction, and it’s concerning, and it’s common. The way these boys treat girls is also dangerous and awful. They aren’t being taught to be respectful men, and women and girls are being subjected to this stuff. 

It’s not just me. Studies support there’s addiction potential and misogyny and abuse of women is related to their depiction in porn. Boys exposed to violent porn are more likely to perpetuate it and be victims themselves. Girls are more likely to be aggressive exposed to violent porn. These studies support some of what I’m saying but they are just examples. I have others.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6751001/

https://uwjoshuacenter.org/pornography-and-sexual-violence

I think the evidence of effect on adults is not as closely related, but these boys have been watching since they were little kids. Men today didn’t have this access to the same extent except for young ones. I’m scared for women and girls and boys as this current group grows up more.  

So come at me. The only thing I ask is no one try to prove their point with that study from the eighties that claims SA is reduced with access to this stuff. The eighties was nothing like this."

I genuinely believe that Westerners are evil and Iranians should never be friends with them, and  I believe that Western culture with all its loose morals and butt-secksing and peepee-cutting is the new Soddom and Gommorah. Sadly I don't believe in God so I don't think that rocks will fall from the sky to turn Westerners into pillars of salt. Mostly because Lut screwed his daughters, and Westerners are already searching for incest porn on the internet so it's not far off to assume that Westerenrs will soon see incest as a morally acceptable thing and start boning their sisters -- given the Westerner's proclivity for immoral sexual acts it's just a stone's throw away. I honestly don't thin kiranians should have a positive view of West.

It may sound like I am making these arguments in bad fate but I am not seeking for you to change my opinion on West and Western culture. I am seeking for someone to tell me why exactly a pro-West Iran would not lead to Westerners --- weakened as they maybe in the upcoming decades, starting shit in Iran.

427,2023-11-26,CMV:Ear Piercings on Babies is Wrong,u/Immediate-Pool-4391,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/184svdg/cmvear_piercings_on_babies_is_wrong/,changemyview,"I sincerely believe that ear piercings on babies are wrong, are done for superficial purposes, and Violates the right to their bodies and what they chose to do with them as they grow up.

I was not pierced as a child, and never wanting them anyway this never bothered me. I asked my mom why out of curiosity, and she stated that she and my dad thought it was my decision to make.

That is how it should be for all babies. Piercings are not necessary body modifications done because..
Culture
To tell she's a girl!

Culture, my BF is Hispanic and he grew up around a lot of this. All his sisters were pierced as babies. He still thinks it is wrong, and that the it's the culture think puts  pressures on individuals to give into the pressure of the many. I feel the same when it comes to religious practices that lead to body modification. The child in question can't  help the culture/religion they were born to, and should not have their body altered in a way they didn't consent to.

I hear a lot of people say, oh if she doesn't like them she can take it out later! That's not the point, you violated their right to have control over their body before they can say no. I have friends who have scars from their Piercings, even now that their Piercings were gone. I have friends who chose to keep them but their ears have grown since they were babies and now the piercing is too high up and looks weird.

It's to tell she's a girl!- There's other ways to nod to gender without physically altering your child, if declaring gender is so important to you."

It’s obvious that the current laws aren’t working to prevent this so we should have much stricter laws and consequences for people who continue to give everyone else who follows the rules a giant middle finger. If we forced whoever was caught littering or not picking up after their pets to do unpaid trash cleanup on their days off for an entire year no exceptions I guarantee America would have the cleanest streets in the world

1,2023-11-26,"CMV: Squid Game is not really ""about capitalism""",u/qwert7661,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/184uvl8/cmv_squid_game_is_not_really_about_capitalism/,changemyview,"Obviously, spoilers for Squid Game follow. I enjoyed it enough to include a spoiler warning, and if you haven't seen it, you won't be able to contribute to this dicussion.

I was underwhelmed by the purported anticapitalist message of the hit Netflix series. More than in the trivial way in which any depiction of life under capitalism is to some extent ""about capitalism"", I expected the series to offer a critique of capitalism *per se*. Instead, it left me with the impression of a tragic horror story told *within* capitalism. Basically, I saw only a bad thing happening *in* capitalism, not a bad thing happening *because of* capitalism. I'm hoping to learn that I've missed something which will reveal the critique of capitalism *per se* that the series offers, if it actually does.

Before you call me a clueless liberal who couldn't recognize a blaring anticapitalist messaging if it hit me in the face, I'm a Marxist academic who has taught Marx in college courses. I am not an expert, but I can speak competently about Marxism, and I'm consistently able to interpet anticapitalist subtext in media (such as the masterpiece Korean film *Parasite*, for comparison). I'm more prepared than most to detect anticapitalism in art, and anticapitalism is a central theme of some of my favorite art. I just don't think Squid Game is all that anticapitalist.

I'll now try my best to detail a few of the reason why Squid Game, as I've understood it, fails to offer a fundamental critique of capitalism. I'll close with a paragraph on what I think a critique of capitalism must contain. If you show me that it does contain what I think a critique should contain, or that I'm wrong about what a critique should contain, you'll have changed my view.

1. First and foremost, the Squid Game is *illegal*. It does not exist because of the system, but in spite of it, and a good deal of the series focuses on a cop's quest to shut it down. It is easy to imagine an analogue to the Squid Game being held under any political or economic system. Capitalism does facilitate the commission of atrocities of various kinds that are at least nominally illegal (slave and child labor, for example) and does systemically fail to redress these crimes - so I do not argue that the bare fact that the Squid Game is illegal in capitalist South Korea precludes it from providing a critique of capitalism. Rather, I argue that the Squid Game, as depicted in the show, is a crime not peculiarly capitalist in nature.
2. Squid Game depicts the desperate poor willing to die and kill for a chance of escape from poverty. At the superficial level, this is easy to read as anticapitalist. But it is only anticapitalist if it attributes their poverty and their desperation as a result of capitalist systems. Gi-Hun is a degenerate gambler, not an exploited worker. His briefly mentioned business (a noodle shop, I think?) fails for unremarked reasons, and I don't recall why he does not work now. I think I would recall why he is out of work if the series made explicit that the cause was due to a systemic failure of capitalism. The only hint about this I remember is his brief flashback to a union strike turned violent after police aggression. This single moment was the most anticapitalist message I took away from the series, and it's over in a flash and never brought up again. Given that he is broke because of a gambling addiction, and not because of the machinations of capitalism to ensure the emiseration of workers, I can't read his poverty as a failure of capitalism. For comparison, his friend Sang-Woo is an investment broker (a capitalist) who is in debt for the same reasons - a bad bet.
3. Its depiction of the desperate poor is juxtaposed with its depiction of the monstrous rich. Again, at a superficial level, this is easily read as anticapitalist. But again, the series never claims that capitalism encourages the *production* of monsters among the rich. They are simply monsters, and they are rich; no link is claimed, whether it is that their wealth makes them monsters, or that their monstrosity leads to their accumulation of wealth. The most we get to suggest this is Oh Il-Nam's explanation for starting the Squid Game that he and his friends were so rich that they got bored. This could have been the start of a critique of the emptiness of consumerism, but it doesn't follow through. Squid Game is an underground, niche interest for rich *psychopaths*, not for the rich as a class, who the show does not claim are generally psychopathic. There are also comparably monstrous people among the poor, embodied in the gangster Jang Deok-Su.
4. The Front Man executes an employee for breaking the rules of the game, saying something along the lines of ""the fairness of the game is sacred."" This is vaguely reminiscent of liberal rhetoric about the meritocratic virtues of the free market. This excited me - I thought, at last, the series would flesh out the ideology of the Squid Game organizers in order to draw parallels. But this is as far as it goes.
5. In the final episode, it is revealed that Oh Il-Nam, the old man, player 001, is the organizer of the Squid Game and a moneylender. In the English translation, he says that he ""earns a living, lending out money."" Gi-Hun responds, with some disgust, that ""you give money to people for a living, and you get rich doing it?"" Oh Il-Nam responds ""you know what making money is like, it's not a simple thing to do."" At this point in the show, I've given up on seeing a critique of capitalism, but this piqued my interest - would they talk about M-C-M'? About the fundamental fact of capitalism, that control of sufficient capital allows one to acquire exponentially greater capital? We get a short follow up on this. Later in the episode a news report flashes: ""INCREASE IN AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD DEBT RANKING KOREA 2ND GLOBALLY"", attributing its cause to ""lifted government restrictions on financial loans."" So, something like the American financial crash of 2008 (maybe Koreans can help me on the context of this, if it's not fictional). But there is so little detail given, and what is given is just ""the government made a bad policy that caused a rise in debt."" Critiques of *policy* under capitalism are not critiques of capitalism. To regulate more or less is the eternal debate held between capitalist parties in all capitalist countries, and the series hands this particular win to those favoring a bit more regulation. If the show depicted the government as being owned wholesale by capitalist interests, such that it was incapable of passing policy that would not lead to the emiseration of the proletariat, this would be a critique. But as presented, it is attributable to a blunder.

Throughout, the series drops hints and gestures toward a critique of capitalism, but it always fails to follow through to actually saying something. A critique of capitalism should identify capitalism specifically as the root cause, or at least as the primary exacerbator, of some bad thing. It should do this by, for example, identifying the wage-labor relationship as intrinsically exploitative, or demonstrating the incentive of the bourgeoisie to emiserate the proletariat, or arguing that the extreme disparities of wealth capitalism creates produces dehumanizing conditions, or presenting the extraordinary levels of waste and overproduction inherent to a system that prioritizes the sale of commodities above all else, or satirizing the emptiness of art produced solely for profit. Unless there are complex references and symbols at play that are illegible to non-Korean audiences, or if I've for some reason been especially inattentive to the series, Squid Game doesn't do any of this."

There are certain behaviors that are illegal offline but are basically unable to be policed online due to privacy restrictions. It seems that we may have to start looking at online forums as a form of public speech; free speech is still protected, but things that are illegal should absolutely be punished. By classifying doxxing as a negative thing you're saying someone's rights to privacy on a public forum triumphs the rights of society as a whole to operate normally. 

Vigilantism occurs when the law either doesn't or is unable to act. It's a response to uncorrected injustice. It occurs most commonly in poorer areas without proper government intervention. 

""Who gets to decide judge jury and executioner?""
The same people that make that decision in real life. Putting some measure of checks on conversation is pretty normal - its a reason you don't hear people plotting assassination attempts in Walmart. 

Telling someone to commit suicide is illegal for instance. A number of actions and behaviors that people undertake online in what is basically a public setting is illegal. People don't have any consideration for the consequences for their actions, and if people did I think online would function a lot more like the offline world. People behave without a filter because they don't believe there will be consequences. This hurts everyone. 

I think your right to privacy ends where another person's rights begin. I was reading a post about a whole group of people who were cheering on a child who had committed suicide. These are not things any person would conceivably say in a real life public space. And yet this was on a public forum.

Obviously there is more privacy that is to be expected in a truly private space, but I think if someone is on a public forum, just like real life, there shouldn't be an expectation of privacy. 

There needs to be a website or something setup, a file for each person made public. If you make a comment on a public forum it goes there for anyone to read.

You don't want your family hearing your racist rants? Don't post them and they won't go in the file. Don't want to have your boss hear you give an argument defending a pedophile? Don't make it. 

To be clear this is mainly directed at online forums that have a general expectation of publicity - something like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter etc. Reddit maybe less so because privacy is sort of built into the buisness model, but even so, I think if it's illegal it should be made public. Make things public, challenge people on what they're saying, set boundaries for socially acceptable behavior. 

I think society is fucked otherwise."

Meanwhile the western mainstream mass media and analysts and even intelligence agencies were hyping the Ukrainian counter offensive it and kept pushing the notion that Russian were drunk incompetent conscripts who will run away rather than fight against the Ukrainians.

Anyone who was warning of a Russian army which had learnt from it's mistakes during the Kharkiv and Kherson offensive was smeared as a Russian bot ,Putin simp, pro Russian or my personal favourite ' a useful idiot 'especially online in places like Reddit or twitter.

As the offensive went on, Ukrainians spent months and casualties in 10s of thousands and hundreds of destroyed western equipment that it cannot replace for a handful of villages and small hamlets.

The western mainstream media was saying Ukraine would made a breakthrough and they would start moving towards towns like tokmak very soon. That also didn't happen and the ukranians got stuck in robtyne for almost five months now.

At the end of the day non of the ukranian objectives were reached and thousands of men and equipment were lost.
Ukrainiams gained 0.002 percent of their territory back in the spring/summer counter offensive.
They gained 0.1 percent of the land they were supposed to gain in their counter offensive.
With all these stats, I'm inclined to believe that the ukranian counter offensive failed and non of its objectives were met.

Now, why did that happen?
Is it because the west had overhyped and overestimated it's NATO training and equipment?

Or have they underestimated the Russian effectiveness, discipline and ability to learn from its mistake?"

I don't doubt that in the event of war between Taiwan and China, the US will ramp up its arms trade with Taiwan and even provide military intelligence, but what I'm talking about is a formal declaration of war with China.

If the US and China do go to war, it will be the first time two major economies and two nuclear states have gone to war since WW2. For the US, this means risking a nuclear war, cratering the world economy, putting American lives at risk, and reshaping global diplomacy for decades to come.

I don't think Americans are going to buy that. China is not (or has not yet been) vilified like communists or Islamic extremists are. They run a state capitalist system that many Americans benefit from. It's not Vietnam or Korea where the US was fighting a much weaker opponent, nor is it like the wars in the Middle East where the US held absolute military supremacy. Taiwan is also not part of the canonical ""West"" like Ukraine is so Americans will not feel as invested. Critics can argue that this is a civil war that the US should not be involved in and I think because both Taiwan and China are majority Han Chinese, most Americans will agree with that sentiment.

The only calculus China has to do is whether they can complete an amphibious attack against an island nation beefed up and supplied by the Americans, not whether this invasion will involve American military directly."

## Being Average

You are average. You are living in a decent place where you can sleep well, have food to eat and sometimes, like every week or two, eat the delicacies restaurants offer near you. You are a little fat but you have some kind of physical activity everyday (walking for instance). You go to work from 9 to 5, come back home, watch tv or play video games , meetup with your basic friends regularly. There are times when you are lonely but hey, you can just fap to sleep right? Or maybe that new Rum with boiling water is just the sedative you need to live for one more day. Today's women are so annoying and difficult ; if the bitch got one screw loose in her head, she just might accuse you for any damned thing and put you into jail, destroying your so-called career and putting a black mark on you. Even if she doesn't, let's say you fuck around, get in a relationship. Now depending upon whether you marry or not, it is an undocumented and accepted truth that relationships are work (basically, tolerating her as long as she is useful / gives sex and respect). The amount of sex you get decreases and she gets uglier every year or two.

## The question

Ultimately, all the pleasures and accomplishments you seek come with a cost: 1 unit of pleasure comes with 4 units of pain. What will change if you become above average? What are you supposed to seek for if everything is temporary, initially brings pleasure but then produces pain? Why should you suffer the pain of discipline to be better?

## Hypothesis

Based on the average paragraph, you might get a better place to live, a better mattress to sleep, better dishes which you can eat, a premium tv / gaming console, a decent (or jacked) body who goes to gym regularly, meets with his friends regularly in ""better"" places (as compared to home), a tinder chick to act as a fleshlight and a premium alcohol to sleep better. The women will not change. With age her looks will decrease and also the frequency of sex. The amount of mental resources required to deal with her will increase the longer you are with her. Sure you might get a few better lawyers to fight your case if you are falsely accused but you will still go to a jail, still get  your reputation soiled.

## Closing notes

336,2023-11-27,CMV: Men and boys are coerced and brainwashed into accepting a social paradigm where they have fewer socially acceptable fashion options than women and girls,u/eachothersreasons,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/185799c/cmv_men_and_boys_are_coerced_and_brainwashed_into/,changemyview,"**Thesis: Men and boys are coerced and brainwashed into not complaining about a cultural environment where they have fewer fashion options than women and girls, and this is the main reason why they very very rarely tend complain about their diminished fashion options. Coercion includes peer pressure and other forms of social pressure.** 

Alternative explanations that contradict this view include the view that men and boys are largely silent about this because they simply naturally don't care about fashion or because having increased fashion options has a set of tradeoffs that make the endeavor not worth it for men and boys. Or men and boys look uglier with expanded fashion options.

Women and girls have more fashion options than men and boys. It's a very obvious visible fact of reality. Not only is it much more socially acceptable for women to wear men's clothes than it is for men to wear womenswear, but womenswear as a category is many times more diverse than menswear as a category. In addition, it's far more likely for a woman to be wearing makeup to enhance their looks than it is for a man. Women are much more likely to have shorter than chin-length hairstyles than men are likely to sport longer than chin-length hairstyles. Men's formal wear for most occasions is more more limited than women's. Women fashion options are vastly more extensive than men's fashion options.

Women and girls having more fashion options is a form of inequality**.** If half the world can do something the other half cannot without facing the same kinds of social ostracism because of the way each is born, that's a form of inequality. Wearing clothes are something you do everyday for most of the day. Your visual appearance is how you interface with most of the world, and people make judgements and assumption about you, whether they are immediately aware of it or not, by other people's appearance. How you appear visually is something that matters. It's visible. Evident. And not insubstantial. 

Fashion as a tool can be used and can be used as a method to 1) gain attention from others and stand out 2) induce good will from others 3) get people to like you 4) making others amendable to providing you favors. People subliminally react to visual stimuli, and fashion can help create different varied nuanced subliminal reactions in other people. People dress to impress. You can impress through other means but lack of a substantial toolset is still lack of a toolset. You could accomplish more if you had access to this toolset. Fashion historically was used as signal of social stature; a lot of societies had those with more power wore more elaborate fashion as a sign of being better off or of a higher social class. Beyond use as a tool to influence others, lots of people also enjoy having access to fashion. It's a rich category of items.

People tend to complain about inequality they are subject to; they tend to complain about being excluded from activities because of the way they are born. Even if men and boys didn't want to wear womenswear generally, it still hurts men and boys that they are subject to social ostracism if they would on occasion choose to do so. Various women complain about slight inequalities like mansplaining or manspreading or lack of access to fashion because of school dress codes, but men and boys complain comparatively very little about their lack of access to the fashion that women have access to. The very act of complaining about this can suggest that one wants to wear sport fashion and make more vulnerable to social ostracism -- particularly those related to the taboo of emasculation. Boys are simply taught not to care, or better --- not to really notice, and they comply. This silence is powerful. There has to be a a very powerful coercive cultural force to create this much deafening silence on such an obvious inequality.

Lots of boys and men would take advantage of expanded fashion options if they were available and more socially acceptable. Selling skins of characters and weapons and other visual features is a very lucrative business in video gaming. Many businesses are based off of it. Some men and boy play female characters and dress up their characters in lots of elaborate outfits. Beyond that, large numbers of children will naturally take advantage of flashy options they are freely given. The sex assigned at birth of children before puberty is not easily discernable without looking between their legs, and if boys could look like elaborate girls and get the same social praise that girls receive for wearing pretty things, a massive amount of them would be interested. Boys don't express interest because they've been brainwashed by a circumstance that tells them that they shouldn't have interest.

Some may argue that women are subject to higher fashion expectations on account of having more fashion options. But it's not altogether clear that large amounts of boys and men wouldn't prefer that tradeoff -- having vastly expanded fashion options for higher standards on how one dresses oneself.  It's not an inconceivably unfair tradeoff. Now it can be argued that men can look good without expanded fashion options, but men are generally not considered or treated like an equally fair sex as women, and those with more fashion options designed to make them look gorgeous have more greater to hacking good looks and also a higher ceiling on how good they can look. Yes, life is harsher for women for not meeting society's expectations on beauty, but men aren't regarded as particularly fair, and I think ultimately negatively impacts how a lot of men are treated. It's not altogether clear that this factor would make men forgo expanding their fashion options.  


Uniforms also have historically been used a way to encourage people to have their personalities conform or encourage them not to have personalities that stand out. Limiting men's socially acceptable fashion options and making their fashion options more drab than women's options has been a way to limit the range of male personalities. I don't think this is lost on everyone necessarily, but again, substantial silence. Men and boys don't recognize their diminished fashion options as a problems, and haven't substantially fought to expand those options as a population.

Happiness without a foundation of meaning to tether itself creates far too much potential to be abused and corrupt itself, to become self serving. There must be some filter to pass happiness through before entertaining the authenticity. If there is no questioning of “who/what is this for?” before participating in an activity, it lends itself to

I would argue that players and coaches should be permitted to criticize officiating as long as they do so in a way that's 1) factually correct and 2) professional. (And, of course, ""free speech"" has nothing to do with it. That's about the government; the First Amendment doesn't apply to a private-employment situation. So I'm not arguing about legal or constitutional rights, which are irrelevant here.)

It shouldn't apply if the coach or player is *criticizing the refs in a crude or bigoted way.* If some player says, ""That black N\_\_\_\_\_ referee is blind, he should F\_\_\_\_ himself"", yep, that should definitely warrant a heavy fine if not outright suspension. If some coach says sexist slurs about a female referee, that should definitely get a heavy fine. Etc.

But if a coach says, ""The referees awarded that player a first down even though he wasn't even remotely close to the first-down line"" or ""that was blatant goaltending and yet the refs allowed it; you can clearly see that the ball was on the downward trajectory"" - that should be totally free to say."

Assuming this is not merely a threat and in fact a course of action they plan to take, this seems like bad political calculus. In my mind, this is starkly against the interests of any left of center person. In a FPTP system, the two largest parties are the only viable candidates. It behooves anyone interested in either making positive change and/or preventing greater harm to vote for the candidate who is more aligned with their policy interests, lest they cede that opportunity to influence the outcome of the election positively.

Federal policy, namely in regards for foreign affairs, is directly shaped by the executive, of which this vote will be highly consequential. There's strong reason to believe Trump would be far less sympathetic to the Palestinian cause than Biden, ergo if this is an issue you're passionate about, Biden stands to better represent your interest.

To change my view, I would need some competing understanding of electoral politics or the candidates that could produce a calculus to how not voting for Biden could lead to a preferable outcome from a left leaning perspective. To clarify, I am talking about the general election and not a primary. Frankly you can go ham in the primary, godspeed.

To assist, while I wouldn't dismiss anything outright, the following points are ones I would have a really hard time buying into:

- Accelerationism
- Both parties are the same or insufficiently different
- Third parties are viable in the general election"

166,2023-11-27,CMV: Gay people are not over-represented in media. People are just angry that they can no longer pretend that gay people don't exist.,u/princek1129,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1858v7g/cmv_gay_people_are_not_overrepresented_in_media/,changemyview,"Just as the title of this post says, there is not a over representation of gay people in the media. There is no gay agenda nor is anyone trying to ""force"" homosexuality onto kids. First of all, homosexuality cannot be forced. If your child turns out to be gay, they will be gay regardless of what you teach them or expose them to. 

Back to my point, Even with all of the representation of non-straight people in the media, it still pales in comparison to the representation of straight people. You see, years ago gay people were forced to keep their sexuality a secret. There was no such thing as ""coming out"" back then, society basically operated as ""don't ask, don't tell"". During these times, it was easy for people to live in their own bubble and just pretend that gay people were not around. Even if they suspected that someone might be gay (or lesbian), they wouldn't address it and would just pretend like they didn't know. 

Now, people can no longer do that. Homosexuality is much more accepted and more gay people are open about their sexuality. This angers people because it forces then to accept that not only do gay people exist, but that they've always been around. When people say that they're ""okay with gays"" but then say ""just don't force it onto people"", they really mean to say ""It's okay if you're gay, just stay in the closet and act like you're straight because it makes me uncomfortable and I want to pretend that gay people don't exist"". 

Also, people don't actually care that much about what kids watch, they just don't want kids to see any kind of gay representation out of fear that it will ""influence"" them to be gay. Why? because deep down, they still have a bigoted view toward gay people. It's totally fine for their kids to watch anything else, just please ""no gay stuff""."

Marriage rates have decreased, [political polarization](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/) has increased, and a lot of people have issues making friends and opening up to others. If people have trouble making friendships, it is no wonder that they have even more trouble establishing sexual relationships.

These stats are mainly focused on the straight-majority however. When it comes to lesbians, gays, bisexuals, queers, and similar sexual minorities, interpersonal relationships are completely different. The average gay man has 66 [lifetime sexual partner](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3334840/#!po=44.5652)s while the average straight man has only 11 partners.

Homosexuals often report [higher satisfaction rate than heterosexuals](https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:8eb992e/UQ8eb992e_OA.pdf) when it comes to dating and hookups due to gender roles being a total non-factor (everyone is a chaser and chased in a gay bar), contraception being unnecessary, and the sex partners innately knowing the other's anatomy. 20 years ago or even 15 years ago, a straight person wishing they were gay or even bi would have seemed really silly. However, considering this evidence and same-sex relationships being legalized and normalized, it is no surprise that some men and women wished they batted for the other team.

To change my view, you have to prove that heterosexuals have major advantages over homosexuals when it comes to short-term relationships or one-night stands. I'm aware that LGBT behavior is illegal in many countries and it is a capital crime; that is tragic, but it is irrelevant to my viewpoint. I'm exclusively talking about anglosphere countries where being gay is publicly okay (and to be honest, countries that execute gays are without exception terrible places for anybody to live). Other issues that LGBT individuals face that aren't connected to interpersonal relationships are also tragic, but irrelevant to my viewpoint."

Lately I've been thinking this entire model of thinking is nonsense. Couldn't you say Mathematics is also an art? Because there are multiple ways of solving a problem........some of those ways will be simpler than others. And you can get creative in how you approach and think about those problems. So problem-solving seems to be a skill. Different people will approach the same problem in their own unique way (i.e. their style).

Ignoring bullying a lot of times doesn't work. People will try to tell a victim, ""Just ignore them, and they'll eventually get bored and stop."" No, oftentimes they keep doing it and doing it until they get a reaction out of you. And once the bullying is physical and people are putting their hands on you, that's nearly impossible to ignore. Telling a teacher or authority figure doesn't always work. If teachers don't catch them in the act, they oftentimes don't get punished. A lot of times they won't just punish them just based on hear say. Teachers will talk to the bullies and tell them to stop, but as soon as the teachers aren't around they'll keep doing it and even worse since you ""snitched"". And sadly some teachers just don't care.

I think the most effective strategies for bullying are teaching and developing self-defense techniques. I believe increasing confidence, teaching children to be more assertive, teaching them how to handle difficult people and situations, and developing social skills are pretty much all you need to teach victims how to handle bullies and not make themselves an easy mark.

Bullies are less likely to go after someone who exudes confidence, knows how to stand up for themselves, and has friends. They don't want to target someone who appears strong and is not going to make it easy for them. Having friends gives you a support system. There are strength in numbers. Your friends will most likely have your back if the bully tries to mess with you. 

Having these characteristics should greatly reduce the bullying because you are no longer an easy target and you now know how to handle bullies.

These characteristics can be achieved through a self-defense class, therapy, or someone in their life who can teach and model these behaviors for them.

Unfortunately it's a harsh reality of life that there will always be bullies and there will always be bad people in the world who choose to hurt and harm other people. Bullies don't target any and everyone, they specifically target people that they perceive to be an easy target. Teaching children how to handle difficult people and difficult situations is going to help them throughout life.  
And I don't believe bullies should get away with what they're doing. I always think they should be punished and held accountable for their actions.  
But I also think it's a good idea to teach children self-defense and how to handle bullies, because more often than not this is what helps as opposed to running to an authority figure or trying to ignore it, etc.  
I'm speaking as someone who was heavily bullied in school and did not know how to handle it or put an end to it."

1,2023-11-27,"CMV: Science is ultimately based on belief, so it always has some subjectivity.",u/wigglesFlatEarth,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/185kxlq/cmv_science_is_ultimately_based_on_belief_so_it/,changemyview,"There are [3 branches of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_science): formal, natural, and social. Formal science includes things like math and logic, natural science includes things like physics and biology, and social science includes things like psychology and anthropology. If someone says ""I have no beliefs. I only go with what science says is objectively true"" then I would call them either a liar or delusional. They are being scientismic, not scientific. To do math you need axioms, and these are unproven statements about [undefined primitive notions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_notion#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20logic%2C%20philosophy%2C,to%20intuition%20and%20everyday%20experience.) from which everything else is deduced. You can either choose to believe or disbelieve the axioms (the axiom of choice is a great example), or you can possibly prove an axiom (as in the case of the Peano axioms). However, if you do prove an axiom, you would have had to prove it from other axioms and this is simply a problem of infinite regression that never gets solved. Natural sciences are based on hypotheses and theories that are supported by evidence, but these theories never get proven because of how they are logically formulated. Briefly, if you have a hypothesis statement H, then from that you calculate a prediction E. The logic goes like this:

If (H and A1 and A2 and ...), then (if C1 and C2 and ..., then E) (statement 1),

Where Ai is an auxiliary hypothesis used to calculate the prediction and Ci is an experimental condition. For example, ""if mass attracts mass, then by Newton's theories, if we make sure we do the Cavendish experiment correctly by preventing air currents and electrostatic forces, then we should observe the gravitational constant to be about 6.67E-11 Nm^(2)/kg^(2).

If your calculated prediction is wrong, then that means that the hypothesis is wrong, an auxiliary theory was wrong, or an experimental condition wasn't satisfied. If the calculated prediction matches observation, then that is consistent with statement 1 whether H is true or false. In either case, we can't prove H true and we can't prove H false. We have to come up with hypotheses that lead to very specific predictions so that they can be thoroughly tested. The hypothesis ""holding a crystal increases your energy vibrations"" is so vague that it's quite hard to pin down definitions and come up with a test to falsify it; it predicts almost everything that happens and is thus useless as a tool for predicting something specific that will happen as a result of holding a crystal. The hypothesis ""Earth revolves around the sun, Earth is tilted at an angle of 23.5, ..."", or the statement that the heliocentric model is correct, has quite specific predictions that can be calculated and we can test them with accurate enough observations. When we fail to falsify the heliocentric hypothesis and we are sure of all the Ai's and Ci's, then we become quite confident in the heliocentric hypothesis. The point of this simple, well-established example is that we can't be completely sure that all the Ai's are correct because they themselves are hypotheses. For fun I think about the idea of how science must have started in the first place without any auxiliary theories, and someone had to pick the first scientific hypothesis H1. Without any auxiliary theories, they just calculated things that resulted from H1 and checked if they were true. However, just because H1 -> E1, H1 -> E2, H1 -> E3, and all of E1, E2, and E3 were observed to happen, that doesn't prove H1 because H1 being false is consistent with all 3 of these observations called E1, E2, and E3. The hypothesis H1 looks a lot like an axiom, and things are abstractly deduced from it just like in mathematics. If there was some expectation E4 that turned out to be false, then contrapositive on H1 -> E4 and modus ponens says H1 is false, but maybe H1 would be true under some strange experimental condition C4 so we can't rule out H1. The logic goes like ""H1 -> (C4 -> E4)"", and this holds if C4 is false, E4 is false, and H1 is true. The point is finally reached: we have to arbitrarily choose some hypotheses which appear to always work and build natural science up from there. Hence, science is based on arbitrarily believed statements, which could be referred to as a person's or persons' metaphysics.

___

Clearly, in math we have the integers and only a few cranks might disagree with how the integers seem very fundamental and appear to exist outside of just the abstract thought of mathematicians. In science the same could be said about kinematics and Newton's laws on a local level. We appear to all gravitate towards the same beliefs and accept the same basic hypotheses (except people like flat earthers who don't actually do any science and can be ignored), and these serve us quite well, but I cannot bring myself to say that science is perfectly and entirely objective."

1,2023-11-27,CMV: the internet is largely responsible for the breakdown of families.,u/missfeline99,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/185l7ku/cmv_the_internet_is_largely_responsible_for_the/,changemyview,"Something I’ve noticed is that intergenerational strife is super common now, particularly once kids/babies are in the mix. I don’t think people realize how much the internet has changed things. People now have so much information at their fingertips, even professionals they can talk to, that familial advice is not really needed, nor usually wanted. 

This is EXTREMELY new from a historical perspective. Pretty much everyone pre-2000 or so relied on friends, mom, aunts, grandmas, etc for child rearing advice, particularly the baby stage. It didn’t matter that they hadn’t raised kids in 20 years, they had been there and done that and had the wisdom to show for it. 

Except now everyone rolls their eyes at that “wisdom” because it’s outdated and irrelevant and there’s a mommy blogger somewhere with more current information.

The thing about this is it’s ousted everyone from their roles. I’ll use my own family as an example - my grandmother and great grandmothers were the definition of matriarchs. They were literally the backbone of my family, and this is the case with most other people I know. They helped raise every child born into the family and were super hands-on. They were honored and thrilled to help; this made them feel important and needed. It didn’t matter if they weren’t up on the latest parenting advice. We survived and they were doing their best.

Now people rarely rely on their parents and grandparents for such advice, but they still want to offer since they couldn’t have gotten through parenthood without it, and it’s thrown back in their face. 
I’m not saying that having current info in an instant is a bad thing, or that baby’s well-being should be sacrificed to make grandma feel important. What gets me is that 95% of people seem to be totally oblivious to this dynamic. I think most older family members (and by “older” I’m talking 50+) are feeling lost and outcast in this respect, and young parents are clueless. 

To summarize: yes, they might criticize your parenting…because by blowing off their advice, *you’re criticizing THEIR parenting*. It’s really that simple, even if they don’t outright say that’s how they feel. By putting down and scoffing at every old school parenting method, it’s like you’re saying everything they ever did was wrong and they’re bad parents. Many young parents are completely unaware how condescending they are to their family, especially because they can come online and find an echo chamber to tell them they’re totally in the right.

To be clear, I am NOT talking about genuinely abusive or toxic people. More like how people will prioritize being “right” over the bigger picture. Say, a mom who refuses to let her kids go to their grandparent’s house because they’re hanging onto old toys with lead paint. Or cutting off their mother-in-law because she put whiskey on the teething baby’s gums. Are those things outdated? Sure. Are they more harmful than depriving your child of a relationship with their grandparents? Absolutely not."

According to some ethicists anything that prevents you from obtaining rational reason is morally incorrect. Culture and mental states bypass the rational part of the brain and install ideas that aren't really rational. With this reasoning, we can conclude that culture is morally wrong and should be abolished. However this is only justified with a society that is 100% rational and will instate these values to the population from whom it has entirely removed the culture from. You may bring up the terribleness of the holocaust and the destruction of native populations around the world. I will admit that violent removal through murder is morally unjustified. Instead we should remove their culture and society though less violent methods similar to Indian Reservation Schools. Additionally your disgust is a mental state in my opinion that is likely to be incorrect and is preventing you from seeing things rationally. Also you are being selfish by seeing things as if your culture is the one being removed without care for rationality. Instead of processing it rationally you are only opposing it for selfish reasons. I mean if it is morally correct then you have no right to get mad about it. It would be like getting mad that 2+2=4."

networking sites, such as Twitter, Parler, and Reddit, has
become a growing concern. Consequently, this study aims to
assess the level of toxicity in COVID-19 discussions on Twitter,
Parler, and Reddit. Using data analysis from January 1
through December 31, 2020, we examine the development of
toxicity over time and compare the findings across the three
platforms. The results indicate that Parler had lower toxicity
levels than both Twitter and Reddit in discussions related to
COVID-19. In contrast, Reddit showed the highest levels of
toxicity, largely due to various anti-vaccine forums that spread
misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. Notably, our
analysis of COVID-19 vaccination conversations on Twitter
also revealed a significant presence of conspiracy theories
among individuals with highly toxic attitudes. Our
computational approach provides decision-makers with useful
information about reducing the spread of toxicity within online
communities. The study's findings highlight the importance of
taking action to encourage more uplifting and productive
online discourse across all platforms.

Looking at the data from 1994, international aid to the Palestinians is over 40 billion USD 

https://arabcenterdc.org/resource/international-aid-to-the-palestinians-between-politicization-and-development/

This is without including money from Qatar transferred to Gaza in the past few years.

During this time, the rate of economic growth normalized to the population size did not grow:

https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/profile/WBG

What *did* grow, were the net worths of the leaders of the Palestinians:

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/arafats-billions/

https://theviproll.com/mahmoud-abbas-net-worth-know-more-about-the-palestines-leader/

You can claim that the reason for the lack of growth is the Israeli occupation. While it probably does account for some of it, in turn we can see that trade and work in Israel has driven economic growth and prosperity to Palestinians.

https://www.institute.global/insights/geopolitics-and-security/israeli-palestinian-trade-depth-analysis

My claim is that the Palestinian leaders, be it Hamas or Fatah, have an incentive to prolong the conflict with Israel as long as they are receiving aid. They take the money for themselves (or worse, for terrorism), and blame terrible living conditions on Israel, which in turn helps them get more aid.

This is, in my opinion, an extreme case of dependency theory: https://unisapressjournals.co.za/index.php/Africanus/article/download/1096/1725/14802

I think that only way to really make progress towards peace in the middle east is by conditioning foreign aid to the Palestinians on democratic and liberal reforms."

In what world is this simple service worth a MINIMUM of 18% which always ends up being over $20? 

I have absolutely nothing against waiters and appreciate what they do but what they expect from us is just completely unrealistic. Most waiters I've seen are serving ~5 tables at a time, if each of these tables have 4 people at them there totals are always going to get to the $100 mark, $20 tip per table so let's just go on the high side and assume these people are there for 2 hours, that's $50 per hour in tips alone! Even if you're earning minimum wage thats an insane rate to be paid for what you're doing.

I can't understand why being interested in seeing another person naked would be an issue for someone. Isn't that just biology? Especially for men who are much more visual.

I think that having to shut that off to cater to a partner's insecurities is unreasonable. It's like asking someone to become asexual for anyone but you.

I genuinely don't understand. I've seen so many people talk about their partner's pornography use or even finding other people attractive on social media and becoming jealous over it.

Why is it ok to cater to that insecurity? Isn't that unhealthy in a relationship?

I also think men have different biological urges than women. Like, alot of men will get physically uncomfortable if they go too long without ejaculating. If they don't do it while awake, they'll do it in your sleep. I view it as a regulation like peeing or pooping, and porn just making it simpler.

I think it becomes an issue when it interferes with your sex life or you expect your partner to fill the void pornography does for you.

Can anyone enlighten me on why I could be wrong in my perception of this?"

46,2023-11-28,"CMV: There is a ""citizen load"" that our western society model is unable to adress and it nourishes most of modern social issues.",u/Devadeen,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/185von1/cmv_there_is_a_citizen_load_that_our_western/,changemyview,"What is the citizen load ? It is inspired by the concept of mental load, and applied to all the work and the skills necessary to live as a citizen without being marginalized or putting themself in danger.

With technology, social progress and ecology issues, this load became a burden that isn't reconized. Because of our human psychology, there is a ""reactance"", a reaction that push us to refuse something   if it is perceived as a constraint. And within this reactance grow most of the conservative mindset.

If we don't adress this issue, and make people feel this isn't really a constraint, we will be unable to move toward a progressive society that respect ecology. This is my main opinion. One of my ground is that a progressive and egalitarist society is the goal, and I don't believe one can change my mind about this. The point I want to confront is that I think we have to drastically change our model of society to achieve that. 

To go in depht about what contain the modern citizen load.

\- The basic social contract : Win your subsistance, pay your taxes respect the law. Nothing new here.

\- The sharing of traditionnal gender tasks. Tradionnality, having precise things to do regarding your gender is easier for everyone (Even if it means domination, the issue isn't on gender domination here, I'm for gender equality, and that's exactly why we must understand the complexity bringed by this equality)  Of course it means for men to share the mental load of woman : being able to do any housetask as cooking and cleaning, also taking care of kids and the list goes on. But gender equality put also a pression on women, they have to be careerist, able to protect themself and their closeones, and able to find solution to any problem. 

\- With the numeric world, we must master several technologies, maintain ""numerical identity"" (The version of us that appears through social medias), being able to inform ourself and avoid scams in a world of griefter and fakes. In short, technologies impose a burden of skills and permanent attention in almost every steps of our personnal life.

\- While last decades, everything was thought to make our like ""easyer"", every items in stores are think to be the more coveniant to the consumer, we understand today that the social cost is often not worth it. Overpackagings, imported goods from the other side of the world, industrial poisons in most food and items, overconsumpion of energy, all those things can stop if as consummers we are able to chose alternatives. Knowing the consequences of our choices as consummer is now a citizen task. Being informed, finding the right seller, and taking time to go shopping righly is almost a full time job! And it implies often more time cooking, and preparing things at home for refusing many easy solutions that are not eco-friendly.

\- Sacrifice in time of crisis. As with covid, we are asked to be compliant in dire time. And with the ecologic crisis, those will only occur more and more. Be compliant to restrictions while maintening a social solidarity to help each others is necessary, and far from easy. 

\- We can add the administrative burden and the self-presentation (hygiene and physical health) that are also necessary. 

With so many things to handle, with so many subject that can be marginalizing, I find it logical that many  people prefer to be blind to those necessity, or just can't stand the social pressure and end up with mental health issues. If we don't find ways to accompany people with this, the conservative reactance and the mental breakdowns/ the lost of perspective in society by a large portiion of the population will only grow.

&#x200B;

Now handling that means to me changing some point of our society model : 

\- The prevalence of work. We need to have shorter work weeks (as the 4 days week) to be able to have time to handle all those. Also it means do not consider someone lazy by only the working aspect, for someone that handle all of the citizen load isn't lazy, even if their are not working a job. That's not personnal like-work balance. That's a personnal life-work--citizen load balance.

\- A way to reward this load. I'm for a citizen reward (aka universal basic income, in the form of a negative tax) because without a carrot, I don't see how to convince people to do all of this.

\- End the isolated houseold. While not forcing people, I think encouraging flatsharing and living into extended household is something that can help many. Living either alone or by couple as norm is something that make many being unable to live decently while reinforcing individualism. An extended household allow to share some of the citizen burden, and to share many expenses. 

&#x200B;

You can change my view if you convince me that :

\- Theorically we can keep our model of society while allowing people to handle this citizen load.

\- There is no necessity for everyone to handle this load in a progressive and stable modern society.

\- We can solve issues like the overwhelming social pressure and the conservative grow without help and compensation for doing thoses tasks.

Therefore, a guy who's not ashamed of whatever he's got, being seen in whatever state he's in, is extra hot.  
*Second*, There's an eroticism to it. The fact that it's not screaming ""I'm horny!!!"" somehow makes it much more appealing.

In my opinion, using this new technology stifles the ability to think flexibly, discourages critical thinking, and the ability to think for oneself, and academic institutions are failing miserably at secondary education for not taking a quick and strong stance against this. As an example, I had students watch a psychological thriller and give their opinion about it, weaving in the themes we learned in this intro to psychology class. This was just an extra credit assignment, the easiest assignment possible that was designed to be somewhat enjoyable or entertaining. The paper was supposed to be about the *student’s opinion*, and was supposed to be an exercise in critical thinking by connecting academic concepts to deeper truths about society portrayed in this film. In my opinion, using AI for such a ridiculously easy assignment is totally inexcusable, and I think could be an omen for the future of academia if they allow students to flirt with/become dependent on AI. I struggle to see the benefit of using it in any other class or assignment unless the course topic involves computer technology, robotics, etc."

This is because of the classic moralistic scenario where a man steals to feed his starving family. This is ethical, insofar as the theft comes from a profound & genuine need. 

Anything else is inherently unethical because you’re stealing and harming the law-abiding yet still poor community. Prices will rise due to shoplifters increasing the costs of goods sold through liquidating inventory and increased security needs. Therefore shoplifters aren’t “picking billionaires’ pockets” they’re indirectly robbing the communities they live in. 

Stores are completely justified in treating shoplifters harshly. There is nothing wrong with dramatic surveillance or reliance on pepper spray and other non lethal methods of subduing criminals. 

Or am I wrong? How so? I argue that even if people have a right to eat and be clothed, they don’t have a right to *good* food or nice clothes. Especially if such commodities are stolen fresh off the shelves."

As a premise: my coworker is at an age (late fifties) where a not-insignificant number of his friends and peers have started getting divorced. The causes range from cheating and dishonesty to “the kids moved out and our hearts just weren’t in it anymore.” In the course of our discussion, posited something along the lines of “Well, if it’s an unhappy marriage that can’t be salvaged, there’s no reason to stay in it.” My colleague was immediately like “That’s not how that works. When you’re nearing age sixty you can’t jus go out and find somebody again. It’s not like you’ll meet somebody at a bar.” 

I’m not late fifties, nor am I married, but that seems like an inaccurate characterization of things. Not saying that being newly divorced isn’t a fundamentally isolating or stressful experience, of course.  A few reasons I feel this way:

- Dating apps are rampant even among older people. The pool is smaller but once you get a hang of using them, it’s like Amazon shopping for a date/hookup/whatever.

- Sixty is the new fifty—not necessarily because of life expectancy, but because so many people are meeting life milestones later.

- Now that the pandemic is “over,” there’s more opportunity to get out and socialize. 

- More middle-aged people are getting divorced than ever before, since it’s a lot more acceptable than it has been in the past. 

I’m probably missing some major reason that this is not the case, and am open to arguments about this! CMV!"

African Americans had thir history wiped clean through 230+ years of slavery where their identity was erased. After this aa were the literal object of violence and hatred for the entire country for like 100 years of Jim Crow. Finally, many of them were packed into crowded inner cities where drugs were literally introduced into their neighborhoods. At the same time the US government took Education away from this one particular community in a campaign to make sure blacks remain dumb and unequipped and NOW blacks are less educated and less equiped than everyone else in modern America (lol surprise...).  

The list of atrocities just keep adding up: 
     • Public lynching, Castration, Celebrated Murder 
     • Tulsa Ok City Massacre (slaughter) 
     • Tuskegee Experiments 
     • Red Lining / Education Disparity 
     • Etc

the worst thing of all is white people have slandered black people and have applied pseudoscience to justify why blacks are inferior. These ideas have stuck so much that people seeing blacks displaying stereotypical behavior don't consider it an issue. They just asume that's how blacks are instead of just realizing that it's because these people have historically been denied education and  have been subject to poverty/ violence. 

Even things like blacks not liking the police make totall crystal clear sense; when you consider that police were tasked with arresting blacks for literally anything just so they could be considered slaves again under the US constitution. Likewise it was law enforcement that slaughtered them in Tulsa, it was law enforcement that arrested all those drug users in California and East cost despite the US government literally giving them cocaine. 

It's just crazy to me that most Americans don't realize that THEY literally created the ""hood"" as well as the ""thugs/ evildoers"" they always complain about. Yet when it comes undoing the system that keeps pumping out these poor uneducated people Americns pretend like their history doesn't exist and the country has always been  100% equal . Like things are the way they are because ""blacks just don't work hard"" rather than white people making a literal killing off of free labour and just using their influence/ money to subject for slaves to the very bottom of their society. Ie the abysmal state of the black community today. 

In modern America there's this tendency for everyone to separate themselves from black people like we have a plage or like we asked all those things to happen to us? Shi is actually so aggravating because there nothing wrong with us. My skin is black because I'm from Africa. I don't have a gene that makes me wanna steal nor am I automatically less civilized than a white person because my skin is dark all that shi is LITERALLY made up and pushed on us in the US. Like in the West you are conditioned to believe in these nonsensical Eurocentric BS about race and people literally can't see past it. Americans are obsessed with this illusion. It's built into the very fabric of our existence as Americns to look at everything from race even tho it's a human contruct and isn't rooted in objective science. 

Example: Irish people use to be treated just like black people for so long untill things escalated with race and America chose to treat them better and prioritize the mistreatment of blacks. Now, Irish people are fine, their former stereotypical tendencies are nearly unheard of today. Why? They were simply accepted by whites and treated better. There was never anything inherently wrong with Irish people it was just made up shi perpetuated by whites with a different faith. 

Like there were tons of Educated blacks in North Africa and Ancient Europe (Greece/ Rome). Literally nobody had a problem with them because:
     • They were educated 
     • They had their own culture and identity
     • Nobody had exploited them/ subject them violence/ enslaved them. 
     • The idea of a superior ""race"" was unheard of and toal nonsense. 
     • lastly, nobody tried and say that one race of people were automatically inferior for literally no reason.

All of the above was perpetuated be whites during the 16th century just so they don't have to feel bad for performing the most barberic act of slavery know to humanity. They get to make off with a killing and now they are using the conditions they subject slaves to as justification for their babary. ""We had to do it to civilize them, look how bad they act today"" yet THEY literally created the conditions that make said former slaves act bad/evil/ uncivilized today. Are you starting to get my perspective??? This whole thing about seeing us as inferior was made up In a Eurocentric think chamber so whites can become rich overnight. 

We Nigerians come here and are very prosperous in the United States yet everyone equates us to African Americans and believe we act like them automatically because we are black. It literally makes no sense at all. Those people have been subject to conditions separate from us. In Africa we have built school for ourselves and we have organized our community. We are unified under our faith WE ARE JUST POOOOOOOOOOR. All of our stuff goes to the west but luckily we didn't have to live with Europeans who would have terrorized us as you can see with the horrendous history of Africans in the US. Like African Americans have been so mentally raped that the door is open yet they still act like uncivilized uneducated slaves which was the literal whole purpose of racism in the US. ""How can we make sure these people never do well so long as we live here with them? = Take away education/ subject to poverty / slander slander slander repeat"" 

Like there is no other race of people that can go into public and sing about murding, hard drugs, sex, and crime and get away with it. But when black people do, it's supported......why? The country literally WANTS to maintain this image of us at all cost. I can't tell you how many kids told me I act ""white"" instead of ""black"". What was I ""supposed"" to act like as a black person (African)."

Whenever I see a woman planning a wedding and their fiance is bending to what their future mother-in-law wants, I see immediate red flags. That is a person who will always apologize for their family, and the wife will always be forced to feel unsafe and uncomfortable. 

I'm not saying you should just cut off family for nothing. But I've been in a situation where I received repeated disrespect from a family member of my husband. After a few times, he point-blank said, ""the way you are speaking to my wife is not okay, and if it continues, you will no longer be invited to be in our lives."" If you can't picture yourself saying that to your family if it needs to be said, you shouldn't be married to the person you are married to. You don't value or prioritze them enough.

And to people who will say ""it's family though!"" - *The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.* That's the full saying on the ""blood is thicker than water"" bit.

It is mind-blogging that many progressive activists to this day still refuse to condemn Hamas' rape, torture, and beheading of innocent civilians. Some even go so far as to deny that rape and gender-based violence even took place.

**It shouldn't be difficult to stand with innocent Israeli and Palestinian civilians while still condemning Hamas' terrorist attacks.**

If a Christian Copt Terror group in Egypt, started to rape, torture, and behead innocent Muslim civilians in the name of Jesus Christ, you can be sure that these same progressive activists would condemn them.

They would ignore the context of the oppression that the Copt minority has suffered at the hands of Egypt's Muslim majority Government and instead, they would only focus on ""Christians killing Muslims"".

Instead, most of the blame lies on anti-semitism in Europe, the US and other parts of the world. This viewpoint focuses on the origins of the conflict (e.g. late 1800s to mid 1900s) and does not focus on recent events (e.g. 1960-present).  
To explain why, I'll start by pointing out two narratives I've heard about the origins of the conflict. I think both of these are true.  
1. Pro Palestinian Narrative: The indigenous Palestinian people's land was colonized from the late 1800s to mid 1900s by Jewish immigrants whose goal was to establish an independent Jewish state on the Palestinian land. The Palestinians rightfully did not want their land governed by an external group, and committed violence to attempt to remove them, which in turn caused a cycle of retaliatory violence. The end result of this was the expulsion of large swathes of Palestinians from their homes, or ""ethnic cleansing"".  
2. Pro Israel Narrative: The Zionism movement was born from mistreatment of Jews in Europe. Jews subjected to pogroms in Eastern Europe sought a better life, bought land in Palestine and legally emigrated. Other waves of immigration occurred leading up to and during the holocaust in the 1930s-1940s, as well as expulsion of Jews from other middle eastern countries. These people were mostly refugees escaping murder who had nowhere else to go. Even moving to the US and South America was not an option, because refugee ships were turned around and refugees rejected, so the Jews moved to the only place they could.  
I believe both of these narratives to be true, and both the Palestinians and Israelis are victims. I think the narrative that the Jews were an ""evil colonial power hell-bent on forcing out the Palestinians"" lacks a lot of context. This is not a simple case of colonialism. Importantly, colonialism requires choice. These Jews had few good choices. It's unfortunate that the Palestinians had to suffer and be expelled from their land, but the Jews do not bear the moral responsibility for this because they themselves were forced into it by being put into an untenable situation. For this reason, I don't think it's accurate to call the Israeli's actions up to the 1950s ""ethnic cleansing"" because I believe that definition requires a choice, and the Jews had no good choices but were merely defending themselves.  
Instead, the moral responsibility for this situation is born by anti-semites who mistreated the Jews and forced them into an untenable situation. This includes those conducting pogroms in Europe, the Nazis, but also importantly the British, US and other nations who held less overt anti-semitic views and would not take Jewish refugees simply because they were Jews."

Let's look at Nazi Germany, after Allies discovered the Concentration camps they forced the population of Germans to reckon with that fact. A fact a good majority of them didnt know existed. This was one of the first steps to deradicalising the nation away from Nazism and into modern Germany. 

&#x200B;

[https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/film/german-civilians-forced-to-view-atrocities-committed-in-buchenwald](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/film/german-civilians-forced-to-view-atrocities-committed-in-buchenwald) 

If these German people saw those camps, knew of its existence and were polled and still supported the existence of the camps and the overall message of Nazism at a rate of 75 to 80% I wouldnt think its out of the norm to want to level those cities and start again as they are too far gone in their radicalisation. 

&#x200B;

Now we have Gazans, whom when polled overwhelmingly support many illiberal things....

80% support the killing, rape and torture of 1200 Jews and kidnapping of just over 200 women and children on Oct 7th

If you want to see the full level of radicalisation- just look up the polled views of Gazans in reference to America, Sharia and Global Islam. They are not liberal hippies. I never understood this painting of the reality. "

The term and that conclusion have garnered a lot of controversy recently, but I feel that this is due to wealth inequality. Capitalism is broadly defined as “an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit.” Private ownership is freedom. The individual, so long as they have money, is free to apply their capital in any (legal) manner to derive a profit. This freedom is doubled on the back-end, because in a free market, the person owning capital can buy goods and services limited only by the market’s (legal) supply. 

Obviously, such a system also requires a free market. Such a free market needs a level playing field and equal access to relevant market instrumentalities. Capital is one of the most important means of production in a capitalist system. When such capital is narrowly concentrated among a particular class, orders of magnitude wealthier than the rest of the market, the system is basically communist without the legitimacy of the state. Private ownership controls the means of production in effect, and capitalism is no longer “capitalist.” 

Communism is moonshine, its an excuse for the state to assume total control over the individual under the lie of economic equity. The modern billionaire is basically doing the same thing by hoarding such a commanding control of the market to render it unfree. If capitalism is to survive, and continue to provide the benefits of private investment and free enterprise, then the billionaire class must be broken apart. It is not capitalism when the means of production (capital) are owned by a private few who control the market with their massive share of wealth.

 It is irrelevant that they acquired this control legitimately. Capitalism created the negative externality of the billionaire and capitalist states would behoove themselves to rid society of the billionaire and liquidizes their capital for broader private ownership."

I think her voice is mediocre, I think her dance moves are medicore, and I think her performance set is as well. I do not understand the appeal of her lyrics either. They are a hit or miss. She can defintely write a song, but it's never anything groundbreaking for me. She's not particulary a ""bad artist"" to me, just very repetive and bland."

I have lived a pretty meaningless life all in all up to now, simply doing as I felt, never trying to amount to much. 

Pandemics emerge and wars break out, the economy worsens, and a heavy darkness looms over all our futures with a deteriorating climate. 

And in all of it… where is the conscious thought? And who is the one who says “this chaos has gone on long enough” - where are they hiding? Well, the truth I now so clearly see is that the answer to all of the world problems was me all along.

Who else is going to do it? Trump, Biden? The president of my stupid tiny farming country? I have questioned for years now why can I through all the bullshit that nobody else can? The answer must be that I am the only person in this world who is truly alive. 

This is my simulation. 

This entire universe, all of the very fabric and essence of existence has been created just for me to do with as I see fit. Perhaps God is testing me and my will. Perhaps I am God and I have simply decided to test myself. Well, I can see it now. I’m seeing the situation clearly now.

Everything that exits is about me. Any of you reading this - attempt to prove that you actually exist, in true reality and not as an extension of my mind, you cannot. Besides that - you do not. You are merely inhabiting a body in my world. You believe yourself even somewhat intelligent, foolishly. 

But who am I to try to convince you of your situation? Sure, I might as well be God to you but you’re not my focus with the limited time I have been given to perform.

It is crystal clear the enemies of this world are conservatives, of all kinds (yes, including you dirty fasc-coms). Billionaires and corporations and lobbyists, you all exist to test me and the strength of my will. I will bring hell to earth in order to put you all back in your place, to show you where you belong, it will only take some of my time and it will be done.

Once I die the world will go back to not existing. I will return to my true form, beyond your primitive mortal comprehension, and will likely enjoy a trillion more of these simulations in order to continue to know myself and my purpose beyond life and death. 

You can all rest assured - you don’t have to worry about WW3, civilisational collapse or anything silly like that ever happening. All of this was merely the backstory I invented for myself, in a few decades the story will end and that will be that. 

Be grateful, in this world you have been allowed an immense privilege to think there is a “you” that truly exists. Experience my world with the wisdom I have shared here today and you will be free from pain and nihilism, your life will be short - fitting for bumbling insects like you haha - so enjoy each other and attempt to enjoy what peace you have to enjoy before my curtain draws. 

Farewell!"

Any response that does not include a direct answer to that question will be ignored. I've been asking it for over a year at this point and not one person has even bothered to try to answer it.

The sooner a person is taught that they have a voice and it matters, the more empowered they both are and feel and the more empowered society is as a whole.

Your first argument will be that a young person's vote will be influenced by their parents. Well, so was mine the first time I voted at 18. In my experience, the views a person holds become more their own as they accrue experience in the political process. Without a minimum age to vote, this process starts sooner.

You might also come at me with how disinterested in politics you were when you yourself were a young person, as was I. It makes enough sense to me that if all of society is impressing upon you that your opinion is completely inconsequential, you might not have much of a reason to form one.

We pass laws all the time that pertain to the youth and only the youth. One specific instance of this was a law they tried to pass many years ago in CA that would have made it illegal for a teen girl to get an abortion without parental consent, something a 17yo friend asked me to vote no on because he could not. How can it be correct that the youth themselves would not have the right to vote on laws that pertain to them?

Can anyone remind me of the other two times in US history when one group of people was voting on and passing laws that pertained to a different group of people while that other group of people had no right to vote on the legislation being passed in the first place? How did we end up feeling about it those two times?

This view is very much core to my platform so don't expect deltas to come easily. And if you have adolescent children yourself, you might want to think twice about refuting me altogether, as in doing so you will essentially be conceding that I believe their thoughts and opinions are of more consequence than you do.

That said, I am looking forward to your guys' rebuttals and anything that causes even a small amount of wavering in my stance will be rewarded appropriately as it most certainly will have had to have been significant."

One of the ways we can value information is how much effort goes into getting and reporting it.  It has to be considered worth it for a person to investigate and document or even create or document things.  This gives it some credence, automatically, because who's going to write an encyclopedia of realistic fake history? If the internet is flooded with realistic but fake AI generated  information how can the average person figure out what reality is. It won't even be worth it to try anymore because we will be flooded with fake or biased or manipulated video and pics and stories and wikis and old newspapers online and all digital media.

There are millions of Israelis. There are millions of Palestinians. Most of them have no where else to go.  And neither group is going anywhere. Whether it's a two state solution or a single multi ethnic secular state, the only peaceful outcomes involve both groups recognizing the rights of the other group and giving up something they want. The US and other western powers are using Israelis to maintain a strategic ally in the middle east. Russian and Iranian billionaires are funding terrorist operations to embarass western states. Both Israelis and Palestinians are being used as pawns to fight a proxy war for resources and public opinion. The conservative government of Israel are enemies to the Israeli people as they are a barrier to peace negotiations. Hamas and other extremist organizations are enemies to the Palestinian people because they are also a barrier to peace negotiations. If you push rhetoric that calls for the expulsion of either Palestinians or Israelis then you are neither pro- Palestinians nor are you pro-Israeli. They live on the same land. Neither are going anywhere. The little boy who hid in a closet after witnessing both of his parents die in front of him and believing his little sister also died only to later learn she was taken hostage, will one day be a member of the IDF. The little boy who woke up in the middle of the night to bombing and saw the mangled corpses of his neighbors and family will one day be a member of Hamas. Their fates are intertwined. Narrative that demonize one side or the other aren't helping anyone. Most western activist on both sides are making it worse as they are emboldening entrenched sides to not give anything up, and an actual peace deal is going to involve both Israelis and Palestinians giving up something they want."

one time in my high school there was a bomb threat and everyone was evacuated and another time, I was in a event when all of a sudden, people started running and screaming because apparently there was a shooting. I also have seen brawls where groups of people fight and again, theres something about the drama that just amuses me so much. 

I love videos games and movies (like a lot of people) and I adore resident evil and similar games to it.  
I have been playing the 3rd game where the whole city is overrun by zombies and other mutated and powerful monsters and gosh... I wish I could be in that position. I think I would enjoy going around killing zombies and watching powerful monsters fight each other. 

basically, badass action movies, shows, and video games where shit goes down, like godzilla, silent hill, attack on titan, the boys, the sonic movie etc are very awe inspiring and makes you kind of wish something on such a scale happened.

I haven’t watched porn or masturbated for a very long time and don’t plan on it ever again. Having overcome my addiction, I know the signs of porn addiction better than most because I lived through it. Never was a basement dweller, not socially awkward & pretty good with getting women. Only saying this because I know someone in the comments is quick to assume stuff. That being said I’m making this post not to say literally everyone into anime is porn addicted degenerates in this community but I’ve come to realize a large majority are. 

I came to this conclusion years back when I joined a lot of different anime centric groups on social media (Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, etc). I personally have never joined those groups for anything other than partaking in shitposting, memes, and discussion. However overwhelmingly and inevitably someone would always do 1 if not more of the following:

1. Outright post hentai ( cartoon porn) images/scantily clad character unprovoked for comedic effect/ horny in the comments or as the post itself
2. People ask for the “sauce” ( the source) of the hentai image if they wanted it for “ research purposes” (masturbate to it)
3. Someone would send links to the origin of a porn image even if it was just a random image
4. People openly thank the poster of the pornographic image 
5. People would faun over the pornography 

If that sounds like a normal interaction in any sense of the word then most likely you’re desensitized to porn consumption.  That’s not something that should be on a public platform.
Especially since this wasn’t even on NSFW pages. Look I could understand if this was an isolated incident then I’d just ignore it and go look for other stuff. Although this has been a reoccurring thing regardless of what groups I joined. Especially the bigger they got. 

If you’re still not convinced it’s been an issue there are millions of fan art, stories and animations usually based on characters from the actual anime shows. All done by the community itself. This goes way past just a bunch of teens are really horny considering grown adults are engaging in it just as much. There’s literally a hentai jacket you can buy of girls making orgasming faces. I understand it’s for jokes but the jokes gone too far because this shouldn’t be normalized for public consumption. Even influencers like Instagram models have become aware to the point they’ll practically dress nude on the gram in something like a Hinata or Tsunade ( Naruto characters )wig and have their ass showing for views and money then call it a cosplay( dressing up as a fictional character). That’s just referring to hentai imagine how much other porn categories they expose themselves to. I’ve talked to hundreds personally and even in brief interactions online or in person they seem off.

I think people in the anime community need to call out this weird behavior way more frequently and not support the ones who propel this way of thinking because it’s just going to devolve and get worse for everyone if not. Porn addiction fucks up your comprehension of how real sex works, it’s harder for you to climax with a real partner, you start seeing people as objects for sexual gratification, and sometimes you may not even be able to be turned  on by a real person if the addiction is really bad. Plus porn addiction promotes depression( which I’ve seen in spades in the anime community), anxiety,brain fog, lack of motivation, & even suicide in some cases. Porn is an addiction and being constantly stimulated online will f up other areas of your life eventually."

Imagine if we kept prisoners alive permanently somehow and kept them in a cell for the rest of the universes existence. And that’s only a cell, that’s not burning them the entire time it’s happening

And worse yet, this doesn’t just go for somebody who mercilessly rapes then murders an innocent child, this goes for me, and most of the people who have ever existed and exist today because we either reject God or worship the wrong one. Why should a Hindu who is born in India and spends their entire lives only knowing Hinduism be tortured for the rest of eternity? Why should an atheist scientist be tortured for the rest of eternity for simply learning about science and realizing that fundamentalist abrahamic religions don’t work well with it? 

This honestly seems like one of the most evil beliefs one can have to me, given that the religious person believes it literally and not metaphorically. I can see believing that people will go to a metaphorical hell for not adopting certain beliefs, though even that I disagree with cause it doesn’t apply to everyone

I’ll give Muslims a bit of leeway for this cause at least, according to what I’ve been told as I was converting to Islam, a persons exposure to the religion is taken into account and for some I guess there is another challenge after they die if they don’t make it to jannah. But even then, many ex Muslims go on to be perfectly decent people so this is still morally reprehensible

For Christians from what I know this is a hard set rule that if you reject Christ, you burn for eternity

Please if you have a good argument against this, try to change my view. I have an open mind"

To give examples of what I mean .

Ink smearing for money retrieved from ATMs to render money useless or ATMs being rigged to detonate if they are pried off from their housing or if they are pried into.

Bomb vests for all retail/bank staff connected to a heart rate monitor with the option of manual detonation that would automatically detonate  when their heart rate reaches zero (since you can force people to hand over keys to cash registers or bank account details)

122,2023-11-29,CMV: Debating the most likely extinction event for humanity. My take- A man-made pathogen is the most likely catalyst for a runaway apocalypse that dooms humanity,u/Money_Whisperer,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/186ofp5/cmv_debating_the_most_likely_extinction_event_for/,changemyview,"Nothing lasts forever, its just a fact of the universe. And what's more fun than hypothesizing about the extinction of humanity? This CMV my crack at how things will end for humanity, at least on how I assess the current most likely trajectories and risks facing us as a species. 

I’ll start by laying some definitions here-   
  
“The runaway apocalypse that dooms humanity” in this case means an apocalypse that renders humanity stranded in our solar system permanently, which will end in our inevitable extinction in the far, far distant future when something happens to the Earth and we can’t escape from it (another asteroid, volcanic super eruptions, the sun getting older and boiling our oceans, etc.)  
  
The belief I’d like changed today is that this is the most likely outcome for humanity, and that man-made pathogens will be the most likely catalyst for the apocalypse of which I speak.   
  
Genetic engineering is a scientific discipline that is evolving rapidly. This has led to the rise of “Gain of Function” research, where scientists enhance the genetic composition of viruses in such a way that they’re more transmissible, more deadly, etc. They do this to try and preemptively observe potentially dangerous viral mutations and come up with cures for them.   
  
However, there is also a secondary reason for this research- to be used as bio-weapons. The United States and China have accused each other of developing viruses that will target specific racial ethnicities.   
  
[https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-coming-threat-of-a-genetically-engineered-ethnic-bioweapon/amp/](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-coming-threat-of-a-genetically-engineered-ethnic-bioweapon/amp/)  
  
Much has been said in recent years about the strong possibility that Covid-19 was developed in a lab and accidentally leaked. I personally believe this is the case, as do many reputable groups including the FBI and the US department of energy.   
  
We already know that the US government has engaged in various, highly dangerous gain of function experiments in the past. For example, here’s an article from 2012 where Fauci was defending the modification of bird flu to be transmissible to humans.   
  
[https://www.cnn.com/2012/05/12/us/journal-avian-flu/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2012/05/12/us/journal-avian-flu/index.html)

  
I think it’s safe to say that the following things are inevitable- 

1. intentionally engineering viruses to be as deadly and infectious as possible will lead to one being developed that succeeds at being a “civilization killer”, because all it takes is a virus with a high infectious, have a long incubation period, and very high mortality rate (all things which are being intentionally engineered into these viruses).
2. Such viruses will inevitably leak from a lab and immediately go out of control, as covid quite possibly did.   


So I believe such a virus getting unleashed is inevitable in the future. 

And what will happen when 50% of the human population starts dying? Governments around the world start collapsing. Experimental viruses that they were working on likewise get released, and their nuclear arsenals are unleashed. This will be the true apocalypse of which I speak. 

Why will this lead to a ""runaway apocalypse that doom humanity""? 

We have used up all the easily-accessible surface-level reserves on Earth. We cannot jump start a new industrial revolution if our current civilization collapses. And so, the future of humanity will die with the society that we currently have. And if the apocalypse I just described plays out, and all our infrastructure is destroyed, then this current society will end. We will be stranded on Earth forever. 

Things that could CMV- 

\- Alternative arguments for the most likely extinction event for humanity. 

\- Explanations as to why man-made pathogens are not the most likely initial catalyst for what I've described (climate change, for example). 

\- More optimistic takes I guess.

Where is the fun is that? At that point, you are just wasting money just to watch a ball spin on a wheel. The only point in gambling then is just to hang out with friends.

The real fun comes when you start betting money that you have to pay back, or money that you really need for something else. The excitement that grips your heart where if you bust in blackjack, you bust your kneecaps is exhilarating.

So yeah, if you go into gambling thinking “I’m gunna lose all this money”, don’t bother and waste that money in something else, like paying off student loans or funding cancer research. But if you go into gambling thinking “I am going to win a million dollars, no matter how much time or money it takes”, then that’s when the real fun begins."

1024,2023-11-29,CMV: a Trump 2024 presidency would irreversibly alter United States politics & partisanship as we know it,u/Ok-Story-9319,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/186p36m/cmv_a_trump_2024_presidency_would_irreversibly/,changemyview,"Loaded post, I know and this is a bit heady, but please let me explain. I’m from the Midwest and Trump supporters are everywhere. They frequently claim that Trump is being hit with “political” legal attacks during these court cases. They claim this like they’re saying something outrageous. They also act like Trump wouldn’t do the exact same thing against his opponents, or worse if re-elected. 

First off, obviously the cases against trump are completely political. He’s the former president, and I don’t see any republican plaintiffs. However, when I mention politics, I’m looking past the superficial ideological divide and I’m analyzing the actual mechanics and science behind “power” and mass influence. The study of politics is just that, the discipline studying the application of power and exercise of authority. Any system with more than one individual is political because there will be a power imbalance. There cannot be two chefs cooking the same meal unless one delegates. This is power and its political. 

In my view, systems of power become contentious when you have powerful individuals supported by other powerful people, institutions, or undifferentiated masses. Such as a political party. 

Trump is currently being tried for many different alleged violations, both civil and criminal. Trump was a former and recent president of the United States. This dynamic is completely unprecedented in the balance of Anglo-American politics. Trump could have murdered 3 people with a knife on camera and admitted to it and prosecution of him would still be political. It’s inescapable that the act of exercising government power against trump in the form of judicial oversight is an act of political power. It’s irrelevant how much or how little Biden, or any democrat, has to do with any prosecution. Its political no matter what.  Submission to any court and its laws, under any circumstances, is a recognition of political sovereignty. The very act of Trump, an important political figure, being accused and called to answer for his crimes is political. 

Therefore, if Trump somehow wins in 2024, as a felon or otherwise, it is unthinkable that he would be able to restrain himself from challenging the political systems that tried to hold him accountable in the first place. Even if he wanted to restrain himself. Again, it’s politics, if he is in power he will exercise it, his supporters would command him to do so regardless, right? Given the inherent political nature of the proceedings against him, it seems obvious to me that Trump would use government power to do something equally political. 

Since the nation is already in uncharted waters trying to prosecute a former, contentious president, if Trump wins in 2024, there is an incredibly likely chance that Trump would respond in kind and legally prosecute his enemies or otherwise exercise political power in ways unseen in American political history. 

This post is a prediction, one that I feel many Trump supporters are either ignoring or they want it to happen. Either way change my view and make it easier for me to live in TrumpTown and not be so cynical of US politics. Please poke holes in my appraisal of the situation. Please give me a reason to change my view and expect a boring election cycle in 2024. 

TL;DR: Trump is being accused of felonies and other crimes. Political or not, it’s all politics and it’s unthinkable that if re-elected, convict or otherwise, Trump will launch legal actions against his perceived enemies and a dramatic political battle, unprecedented in scope and scale, will erupt if he wins 2024."

1,2023-11-29,"CMV: Copyright makes no sense nowadays, and here's why:",u/Games-Master,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/186snl4/cmv_copyright_makes_no_sense_nowadays_and_heres/,changemyview,"Now that we're heading towards an AI revolution, I don't really think copyright makes sense.  
For instance: We have [**Leonardo.ai**](https://Leonardo.ai) (this is an AI image generator that uses a certain database of images so that it can generate new ones). You could use images that have been created by various artists without asking their permission to create a new image that looks similar to the artist's original creation. So my question is: At what point do we draw the line of ""looking too similar"" ?  
**Here's an example:**  
>!(Note: Damn I can't upload images here ? ffs... oh reddit my subreddit..)!<  
Here's an image made by [panjoool](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.deviantart.com%2Fpanjoool%2Fart%2FFantasy-Angel-864123182&psig=AOvVaw2nHLl-bo1-tENlD7OUeyj7&ust=1701356296634000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBQQjhxqFwoTCKConJq86YIDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) (this is the original image)  
And Here's an image I created by using the AI tool ([link](https://imgur.com/kmc5hmN))  
Compare the two images and now explain this to me: Since the images differ on every individual pixel (color-wise), how can you even claim that it looks ""similar"" ? Where do you even draw the line of ""Looking too similar"". Just because your eyes tell you so ?  


Ok what about this then: ([link](https://imgur.com/F7dg31v)) ?   
Did you know that the last image I linked was created by using the original one by panjoool ?  
Btw, how would you know if I am lying to you right now or not ? (For the sake of this post, I am not lying. Yes I used the original licensable image). And Yes I didn't pay for it, neither did I ask for permission. >!Or did I ?!<  
**AND WOW- Look at what I created !!! Such an amazing abstract painting ! OH WOW I AM SO TALENTED.** I could sell the last one for **1 million dollars**.  
*(btw panjoool I'm not going to do this, if you are reading this I am very sorry, I am trying to prove my point here XD).*  
Even if you claim that all this \^ is ""ban-able"" or against an invisible ""copyright law"" then - suppose I generated this image without telling all of you. How would you or even the artist know that I created it in the first place ? Here I just generated a dozen of them and I have been selling them to my local shop nearby my town. Who's gonna sue me ? Is the artist gonna find my address and murder me ? Let's be real here... this is idiotic.  
By the way I don't do this \^, (I just used it for an example).>!Or do I XD ?!<  
Like do you see the problem here ?  


If I take an image and change just one pixel, would that make it ""my work"" ? How many pixels can I change so that it becomes unrecognizable ? If we can't draw the line to this question then we can't say what ""copyright"" means. My Conclusion ? = It means f\*\*\*\*\* nothing.  
This applies to **videos** and **music** as well. I can take a music track and distort it so much, and no one would notice. I could change it's pitch and set the speed to x12. No one would notice. I am just taking frequencies and **frequencies are free to use for everyone**. Yes or No ? **Yes.** Period.   
So what difference would it make if I take the original file (music, image, video) without changing it, compared to changing it a lot ? I'm still ""stealing"" the original work. So ? SO ?

  
Also, [If someone is reacting to a movie in Youtube](https://youtu.be/bsmQ9gVk8iY?si=IYR7GEKhSi_pHCVk&t=1590), should Warner Bros sue them ? The answer is No, if they are not profiting, because they are promoting their movie.   


So here's the important factor:💸 **MONEY💸**

If a person copies someone's work (and claiming it's theirs) or they are profiting by making money, they shouldn't. I agree to that 100%. It sucks, don't do that. But what is considered a ""copy"" nowadays honestly ?  
If a person copies the work of an artist and uses it without the intention of misleading or profiting, then I don't see how this is considered ""wrong"". This is being done by [Leonardo.ai](https://Leronardo.ai) as we speak. If the copyright laws apply then why doesn't anyone sue [Leonardo.ai](https://Leonardo.ai) or say-  MidJourney ?   
Here's why: Because Copyright makes less sense as the years go by. And ""copyright"" as a concept should be eliminated.  
**Those should be the new rules for a better Society:**  
If there's any work out there, and you use this work (without misleading intentions and without profiting -that is: gaining money) + link the original source - then there's nothing wrong in using someone's work. And you shouldn't be sued. You shouldn't be banned, or copyright-striked. PERIOD. F\*\*\* Getty images, f\*\*\* sutterstock. F\*\*\* whoever copies other people's work -without ANY change for their own profit - and promoting it as if it was their own. And F\*\*\* those who sue you when you're not profiting.  
And F\*\*\* Copyright. "

I don’t know a whole lot about economics necessarily but as a general principle I think a system where the executives with all the shares are able to “reinvest” massive amounts of corporate revenue into boosting their own personal net worth, is kind of fraudulent.  Maybe super fraudulent even idk.  They’re pulling the money out of the economy and out of their company and they’re not using it in any way that would practically increase the value of their company or their products.  It’s just a roundabout way of making themselves super-rich at the cost of the long-term stability of their company and suppressed innovation, and any system where this is possible is inherently cancerous and doomed to eventually collapse in on itself.  

As it is it’s a big ol prisoner’s dilemma where every corporate board of shareholders acting in their own rational self-interest will inevitably end up choosing to sacrifice their company’s future and making things worse for everyone in the long run in exchange for a better personal outcome for themselves now, if they’re allowed the option.  Nobody chooses the option to not give themselves millions of dollars when it’s on the table, even if that means the company they’re taking it from might not exist in 20 years or that the economy will tank eventually.

I can probably see how there’s some amount of stock buybacks that would be necessary maybe for a corporation to do in various circumstances, like how there’s times when taking an opioid may be necessary.  But to me the whole system seems to be run by opioid addicts that are only acting in their short-term self-interests and chasing a bigger personal net worth and a fancier parachute while riding their companies and the economy off a cliff.

Designed for quick and efficient data transmission, it poses a challenge when it comes to monetization, as its primary purpose differs from that of traditional businesses. The internet was created to allow for data to be sent from a to b quickly and efficiently. It was not designed for making money. Products are created by businesses, and the purpose of a business is to make money. Thus the purpose of the internet completely differs from a business. When the two collide, we end up with a problem. How does a business make money off of a free digital world? The answer is to put a price tag on the data being provided, and convince the user that they should pay.  
  
Digital products by their very nature are easily replicated and transmitted, whilst physical products by their very nature are not. It takes time and money to replicate a physical product like a keyboard, but it takes mere seconds and no money at all to replicate a digital product. Music used to be engraved onto record disks, but now it is stored as a digital product, easily replicated within a second. Same for movies. Used to be that movies were exclusively on film, but now every movie has a digital release, turning it into a digital product. Businesses want to make money off of these digital products, but the internet does not run on money and digital products are normally free, so it makes it very difficult to do this. Hence you end up with intrusive ads, paywalls etc.  
  
In a digital world where everything is normally free, paid digital products are an alien concept, leading to their paywalls being circumvented quickly, which completely foils a businesses’ plan to make money off of digital products. Companies and people whom don’t understand the fundamental difference between the Internet and the real world will think that they can put a price on digital products and expect everyone to pay like a physical product, when that will never happen. However they aren’t willing to give up all the potential profit they could make, and thus the propaganda begins. How do you convince someone that a bunch of 1’s and 0’s is a physical product? Time to create an illusion. Advertise your digital product as a physical product, guilt trip people using your employees hard work as a selling point, do everything you can to separate your product into it’s own cyberspace where only paid products exist, thus making people believe that they are not looking at digital products, but physical ones, because if you are only seeing paid products, then everything must be paid right? Examples of this are streaming services, paywalled newpapers, music, movies, software, games, art and books. E-commerce giants such as Amazon and eBay are exempt from this as they predominantly facilitate the exchange of physical products, which are universally recognized by society as requiring payment.  
  
If a customer figures out that the content they are paying for is digital, and that free copies can be obtained, they will quickly stop paying you and go use the free copies instead. This is bad for business. But if you can convince thousands, millions, that using the free copy is bad, giving it a bad name, bad connotations, and a mass distrust, then you can keep the customers paying, keep selling the illusion that they are paying for a physical product, and you can successfully monetise a free world.  
  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/)

TLDR;  
The internet is accustomed to free content, because it was designed that way. The real world is accustomed to paid content. So when businesses try to make users pay for digital products, they are going against the nature of the internet, which leads to efforts to manipulate perceptions and create distrust in free alternatives."

I have never really been on dating apps except for when i was fresh out of high school and had no friends but I think I'd rather die than date someone off like Bumble or something. God forbid tinder

I guess what would change my mind is like some success stories. Ive personally never met anyone who had a successful relationship off of an app that went further than a sneaky link or situationship. 

A lot of times i just want to go back to the past. If people could survive everything without the help of technology then, why do we need it now? I want to go back to the slow life. Where people meet because the universe drew their paths together by chance. 

Im looking for a positive discussion and by no means am i intending this post to come off as rude to anyone in a relationship from an app"

 Now unto the main argument. If u spend anytime on dating subreddits or subreddits for women dating, you will keep seeing post saying women only want the bare minimum but is it actually true? 

No, it's not and as far I can tell has never been true 

Statistically [women are more picky](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9599033/Proof-women-demanding-men-look-partner.html) 

[Do care more about looks more than some women would like to admit](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/02/12/in-experiments-researchers-figured-out-what-men-and-women-really-want-in-a-mate/) though to be fair, men do seem to care ever so slightly more 

And as much as people might not like to admit it, ethnicity does play a significant role in dating as shown by the infamous OKCupid study but what is even more interesting is that being white counteract or at the very least reduces the effect of monoethinc dating

 So far as I can tell, from a statistical standpoint, to qualify for the so called ""bare minimum"" you would need to meet other standards that are probably not very low 

But wait you might say, what about hot girl who date average to not so average guys? 

Doesn't that disprove my entire point? 

Well I would argue that is just survivors bias at play and it is an exception rather the rule You only really see the 'success' stories, you don't see the countless times hot women reject average/conventionally unattractive guys 

And finally there is a difference to what women say they want vs what they actually want"

Having people show up to an office to WORK FOR YOU is a privilege.,u/Medical-Ad-2706,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/186vlwq/cmv_working_from_home_is_a_right_having_people/,changemyview,"Working from home is a right. Having people show up to an office to WORK FOR YOU is a privilege.

There seems to be this idea floating around that being able to work from home is a privilege. That’s funny because privilege is usually defined by what someone DOESN’T have to do or deal with.

If someone’s entire job is on a computer, they should have the right to work from home. It shouldn’t be something handed out to the good boys and girls after slaving in an office for a few years. 

Here’s my reasoning:

People rarely get jobs because they want to work. They often get a job because they have to live like everyone else. They need money to do that and not everyone is entrepreneurial. Fair enough.

As an employer, I don’t just make up jobs and pull them out of my ass. I decide who to hire based on things I need done that I DO NOT want to do myself and I don’t already have someone who can do them. These are tasks that need to be completed, some recurring, some not. They are not things that require someone to be in the office everyday for a set amount of time.

I understand that I am privileged to be in this position because many people cannot afford to pay someone else to do things that directly put more money in THEIR pocket or free up some of THEIR time so they can do whatever THEY WANT TO DO.

So to me, the level of ego you must have to think that people who wake up (usually early) 5 days a weeks to fit themselves into YOUR schedule, to maintain YOUR lifestyle, and help YOU achieve YOUR goals is simply too high to calculate.

I personally think it’s important to be grateful that people don’t just take your money and leave. It’s important to be grateful and acknowledge that you are the one in the privileged position. The person who spends all day away from their family, sacrifices time with their kids, and gives up their dreams IS NOT PRIVILEGED!

The least we can do is acknowledge that as employers we ask employees to give up their right to work from where they want when we ask them to come into an office."

I'm willing to change my mind. But I need some convincing arguments as to why poor people shouldn't have kids. I'm not talking about abortion. But rather, poor people should avoid having kids until they have a lot money. 

Before you think this a strawman.  

[https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/186hzt8/why\_do\_people\_who\_are\_poor\_think\_its\_okay\_to/?sort=new](https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/186hzt8/why_do_people_who_are_poor_think_its_okay_to/?sort=new) 

Here are several people who agree with the notion poor people shouldn't have kids. Which on its face it crazy. Because I doubt everyone who left a reply came from a rich or middle-class family.

Regardless, the main reasons why I'm against this argument. Is because at certain point when doesn't it become eugenics? Saying poor people shouldn't have kids. Is like saying short people shouldn't have kids. How is it any different. You're likely to suffer and be bullied and made fun of if your poor or short.

So why should wealth determine when you should have kids. On paper, the idea makes sense. Kids costs a lot. So you should wait until then until you have money to have kids. But the majority people don't acquire wealth until later on in life once they become old. Are you saying I should wait until I'm in my 30s, 40s or even later until I have a kid.

Not only that, the effects that would on society would be terrible. If only wealthy people had kids. I doubt anything good would come from that.

There are countries where the vast majority of the population lives in poverty. And it will be like that for a while. Should they just stop producing because some westerners think it's cruel? 

Also it feels like condescending to poor people onto how to live their lives. And how being boor is the worst thing ever. When children who work hard can easily bring their family out poverty."
1,2023-11-29,CMV: Advancing AI technology will ultimately cause an economic crisis and social divide.,u/Nemo_Important,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/186wtwg/cmv_advancing_ai_technology_will_ultimately_cause/,changemyview," Progress marches indefatigably forward with no regard to lasting, long-term effects. Take for instance the automobile: it revolutionized travel, afforded individuals to travel more freely, and allowed people to travel further without the use of a train or animal; however, with travel becoming easier and more widespread resulted in towns and cities to grow in size, which eventually made it mandatory to own a vehicle for one to be able to get to work or go out and buy food. Furthermore, automobiles require fossil fuels to operate, so mining the precious fluid becomes inextricable to powering the machine; electric automobiles are not much better, for their lithium used in their batteries must be mined from the earth, and both the former and the latter have a negative impact on the environment. My point is that the progress from animal operated travel, to locomotive, to automobile was unavoidable due to humanities seemingly insatiable desire to optimize, and the negative effects of said progress were only addressed after the progress has been made. Sometimes, the negative effects were even justified due to the positive effects from progress. I believe AI will affect humanity in a multitude of ways, but just like the automobile, some will be positive, and some will be negative. 

Obviously, no person can accurately predict the future; such an ample thing is influenced by so many variables it would be nigh impossible to account for every possibility. My claim in the title is a modicum of a fraction of what I believe AI will wrought on humanity. 

First, I must establish individual potential. Not everyone has what it takes mentally (and sometimes emotionally) to be a successful engineer, IT professional, or be a part of any other vocation that requires tedious amounts of education and specific training. There are also people who are more adept in physical vocations e.g., laborer, athlete, etc. Some people fall in both the former and the latter groups of the mentally and physically fortuitous, and for those individuals the future is bright and the world their oyster; however, there are a plethora of people whose aren’t so fortunate, and their potential would not allow them as many opportunities in finding work, and these people (I conjecture) make up a substantial portion of the population. People with lower potential tend to find work in more menial fields. For now, I will move on from this topic, but I will come back to it shortly.

Second, we must consider the fact that AI is autocatalytic i.e., as we make small advances in technology, it will lead to bigger advancements at an exponentially increasing rate; this may not be a problem at the moment and might actually be seen more like a solution to advancing AI. I’m not suggesting a rouge computer program will start manufacturing robots to start terminating humanity, but rather if AI starts to advance more quickly than society can keep up with it, then it can pose a myriad of potential risks for humanity. A learning program could learn to write code, maybe rewrite its own code, to achieve its end. I could go into hypothetical situations, but I will leave that for the comments.

I will now go back to people with lower potential and how AI may negatively affect them. AI has in some ways taken over some menial jobs, such as the robots who pick orders for Amazon, self-driving delivery vehicles, etc. As AI develops, the speed of which is develops speeds up, and the complexity of the jobs it can overtake increases as well; this could lead to two outcomes: the first is the menial jobs that people with lower potential rely on for work will no longer be available, and the second is the only work left for humanity to undertake would be jobs which revolve around supporting the growth of AI and entertainment (both will have some competition with AI). The speed of which AI is advancing, may not allow society to prepare for AI’s introduction to the workforce, thus leading to a sizable amount of the population being incapable to find work and to suffer financially; they will socially suffer as well due to the unintentional segregation that will ultimately take place. Foreclosure signs will become a common sight, and quaint little houses will sit empty until a bank buys the land to put in a parking lot for a new condominium. 

I am aware of how dour my assessment of the future seems, but I am curious what the community has to say about it. Change my view.

I think they are wrong. Social security collects the payments on treasuries purchase with the surplus. The federal government issues debt to pay for it. Social security is a government agency. By an act of legislation, congress can have social security turn the treasuries back to the Treasury unilaterally in exchange for nothing.Then as would stop contributing to debt."
64,2023-11-29,CMV: Punctuation would be better placed outside quotation marks,u/orbtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/186xwnz/cmv_punctuation_would_be_better_placed_outside/,changemyview,"I recognize the grammatical rules state punctuation goes inside quotation marks, so my view here is that the rules should change.

Quotation marks as I understand it used to much more commonly apply to dialog.  These days I feel there are more and more instances of them being used much in the way a code block is used in markdown -- to quote or reference a specific phrase or set of characters.  In this sense, I find sometimes when I quote something, it feels inaccurate to be putting a period or comma at the end inside the quotation marks, because that comma or period was not present in the original text I am quoting.  I recognize this does not have a large impact, as usually A: it can be inferred that the punctuation did not exist in the original text (though this is certainly not always the case and can occasionally cause confusion), and B: the punctuation often doesn't make a large difference (though again, sometimes it does).

I also recognize that aesthetically, an argument can be made (and I would largely agree) that putting the punctuation inside the quotes *looks better*.  How much of this is based on having seen it that way all my life versus what is actually more aesthetically pleasing in vacuum I cannot say.

To clarify, if the quoted text has punctuation that is part of the quote, that punctuation would then (under my proposed change) still be inside the quotation marks.  Only punctuation added that did not exist in the original text would be moved outside.

So for example, I would propose that if I was to quote the last word of that last paragraph, it might look like ""outside.""  But if I were to quote the first word of that last paragraph, it might look like ""To"".

Would love to hear some interesting examples people could come up with on either side of this to illustrate the benefits/detriments of punctuation being inside quotation marks or being moved to outside."

286,2023-11-29,"CMV: The integral ingredient to chocolate chip cookies is brown sugar, not chocolate chips.",u/Sleepycoon,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/186y802/cmv_the_integral_ingredient_to_chocolate_chip/,changemyview,"I think it's safe to say that in the US at least the chocolate chip cookie is the de facto cookie. It's the one that most people immediately think of when hearing ""cookie,"" it's the one that 95% of the results are if you Google image search ""cookie,"" it's *the* cookie.

The other contender, or more accurately, the runner up, is the sugar cookie. It's the default cookie. The most basic, nondescript, blank canvas of a cookie out there. It's a classic for holidays, decorating, and the cookie that most cookie flavored things are based on.

The basic version of these two cookies are very similar. They're both flour, baking soda, salt, softened butter, egg, vanilla, and sugar in similar quantities. The only two notable differences are the chocolate chips and that sugar cookies are made with white sugar and chocolate chip cookies are made with brown sugar.

Intuition would say that the integral difference in basic sugar cookies and *chocolate chip* cookies is *chocolate chips*. It's in the name, it's the iconic chip-in-cookie look, it's the textural variety of crunchy-on-the-outside melty-on-the-inside chunks in your cookie, it's the difference in vanilla and sugar flavored vs vanilla, sugar, and chocolate flavored. Obviously the chocolate chips are what make the chocolate chip cookie!

I posit, though, that if I were to ask someone to describe two cookies, one a classic chocolate chip cookie recipe but *without* the chips and one a classic sugar cookie recipe but *with* chocolate chips added, most people would say something along the lines of, ""This is a sugar cookie with chocolate chips, and this chocolate chip cookie has no chocolate chips in it.""

The look, feel, texture, and taste of the brown sugar cookie base is iconic and recognizable enough that a brown sugar cookie will generally be identified as a chocolate chip cookie even without the chocolate chips because it's the brown sugar, not the chocolate chips, that give it most of its defining traits. In the same way, the dough base is so integral that even though ""chocolate chip cookie"" simply implies a cookie with chocolate chips most people would not call a cookie with chocolate chips a chocolate chip cookie if it wasn't a brown sugar cookie with chocolate chips.

I haven't had the opportunity to blind test my hypothesis, so I thought I'd lay my chips on the table and see if anyone on here can give me a compelling reason as to why I'm incorrect."

Without getting too personal, I know one woman who exemplifies this phenomenon. She seems to only cry in public or around other people, and she is almost always rewarded for it because other people think they need to step in and make her feel better...

I used to think it was a unique form of narcissism on her part until I read (part of) the book ""White Fragility"" (also written by a white woman) and then I realized that she does it far more frequently regarding race-based issues to illicit pity (and then tacit acceptance) for her objectively racist opinions.

At that point, I started seeing this behavior in viral videos of other white women so it became to clear to me that it's not nearly as unique as I had once imagined.

Punishment for crimes should be to disincentivise people from doing them, and if they do, connect the committing of the crime to negative emotions so they do not do it again. The fact is, prison is ineffective at all of this.

Firsly, while it is a horrendous thing to experience, that doesnt make it a good deterent. People are very bad at evaluating risk, and the more obvious and imaginable the risk, the less likely people are to commit a crime. Prison does not fulfil this criteria and is too vague of a concept to imagine, as it hasnt been experienced before. While everyone can agree it is awful, in the moment of committing a crime it is hard to imagine and less likely to make someone stop or reconsider than something immediately imaginable. In contrast, the idea of losing money or physical pain is very easy to imagine, and has been experienced before. It is both more humane, and more effective at deterrence. I am not advocating for corporal punishment, merely stating it is more effective at deterrence.  
  
Onto the second part of punishment, rehabilitation, prison is just awful at it. You're put into a concrete box with other criminals, what do you think is going to happen? Reoffending rates back this up.

  
As for cost and how easy it is to implement, prison sucks. We pay for criminals to be housed, fed, guarded, for years. Yes prison labour but even then, it would be much more beneficial to have them as fully functioning members of society, contributing to the economy.  
  
Ethically its awful too. You strip someone of their rights, lock them in awful conditions for months to years, stuck with other criminals and often barbaric guards who will only harm them more.

It just isnt good at all the things it set out to do. It does not reform, and if emphasising deterrent (which I disagree with, but that isnt the point of this CMV), why not just use corporal punishment? People will point to ethical and moral reasons, but I'd much rather get a flogging than be imprisoned for years. It is much more moral to harm someone physically than harm them mentally, strip them of their rights and take away huge chunks of their life, while leaving them in conditions that likely will lead to them being physically harmed anyways.

  
The only argument I can see for prisons is for holding people who should not be let out into society, however reducing the use or prisons or reforming them doesnt mean abolishing them. Most crimes people are imprisoned for are not the ones which require isolation from society. Put those people who are a danger to others in prison, the rest get more effective forms of punishment.  
  
Or in my opinion the ideal thing, proper rehabilitation. That is very difficult to implement, but it should be the goal."

The meter is simply too long to be practical for measuring everyday things. The foot is just the right distance to measure pretty much anything that you need. You know how long it is because it’s a part of you. Ifyou just need a rough estimate of the length of something, a meter is too abstract. A foot is just the right length for pretty much anything.

Why? Because it would make things such as achivements worth more to them. There is a limited time for people and by extension all living things to live in this world. This makes achivements in life something of great value to people like checking something off a personal bucket list as they know that they have relatively limited time on this earth and if they don't do it before they die, they'll pass on 4with regrets.

Compare that to having a centuries long lifespan. You'll have more time on your hands, so you can put thimgs off your personal bucket list for a longer time. As time passes, you have a growing nagging feeling that you left something behind in your life and when you complete them, you'll feel less thrills from it since you have more life ahead of you compared to those with normal lifespans.

TL:DR. If the option to extend lifespans is there, some people will choose not to as they want their achivements to matter more.

1,2023-11-29,CMV: The only solution to stop the violence in Palestine is the Palestinians practicing non-violence,u/IAmNotTheBabushka,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1876zph/cmv_the_only_solution_to_stop_the_violence_in/,changemyview,"This post is in no way denying Israel's multitude of war crimes. It also does not deny Hamas' war crimes. For this conversation, Hamas is referring to the military organization.

I believe that in order to fix the situation the first step towards a solution not involving the genocide of more than a million people is for the Palestinian people to begin practicing nonviolence in response to Israeli war crimes.

My reasoning for this is as follows:

1. All violence will inevitably lead to more violence without someone breaking the cycle first

2. Hamas will never be able to kill enough Israelis to make them consider leaving, and will not be able to kill the entire population. There is no endgame with these attacks that does not involve the genocide of the Palestinian people.

3. If Hamas continues to use violent means, such as shooting rockets into Israel from Gaza or actions like the October 7th attack, Israel will use these actions as justification for their own attacks, ending up in for more Palestinian civilians dead than Israelis

4. Hamas' attacks will further alienate the Israelis, creating a farther and farther right wing government until they genocide the Palestinians.

5. The Israeli children are the ones most in danger of being alienated from Palestinians, with some of them facing attacks and the majority hearing about attacks on fellow Israelis from the POV of Israeli media, which likely exaggerates numbers and rhetoric to further radicalize. If instead Palestinian non-violence begins Israeli children will grow up in a situation in which Palestinians have never done anything to them or their Israelis, there will be no sense they need to get revenge for, and once they begin their IDF service they will view the Palestinians as civilians instead of terrorists, leading to less war crimes against the Palestinian people.

6. The international community that currently supports Israel will also begin to heavily lean towards Palestine's cause, viewing them as a genocided people being oppressed by a foreign government instead of Nazis hiding terrorist soldiers in their mosques and schools

7. With the International community and the sizable Israeli Gen Alpha and Beta (28% currently) turning more Pro-Palestine the Israeli government will be forced to become more left-wing, leading to less violence towards Palestinian Civilians."

My depression was an effect of shitty childhood and escapism followed by not giving a fuck about anything anymore and letting go of everything, no work towards anything just addiction and food. No wonder why people say i cant find friend or some other problem, you gotta go there and work for it. life is hard, same for unattractive people, of course they have harder time finding someone, but you can grind your Basic needs so u wont feel that shitty. Social media/tv gives illusion of world where people didnt experience real hardship of life. Life is survival like any other animals on the planet but we learned how to survive better, god might exist but we arent sure, he clearly cares about something else than happiness of ours (only maybe in grand scheme of things that we dont see), or he doesnt exist, getting higher position in jobs mostly depends how you can deal with people egos, how to find common ground and make them feel good or for benefit of circumstances, diploma is just for starter, if you cant cooperate you gotta play nice and listen becsuse they have power, one word away from being broke=-homeless (if no savings)

Nepotism is real, and people there have real advantage same for rich people because they learn their position so you know shit about it and they have more experience about more things if they are smart about their assets . You gotta be smart and live without delusions or you are in somewhat danger of being homeless or outcast. You gotta learn how to use emotions so people dont feel offended when you tell about your opinions. I am shit at many of those above. Love is very much helping dealing with these stuff. I like being delusional beliving in love and not taking responsibility for my life until i have no money. Most people dont wanna hear or focus on the above so they...feel better.

Here’s why I think this could be the real deal:

1. The congressional hearing this July featured a bipartisan panel questioning military and/or government officials, under oath, about their alleged interactions with the phenomena. This issue got politicians on both sides to work together to probe deeper into the claims of these men, who have credibility 

2. The politicians involved are not the typical conspiratorial whack jobs, the show-boaters, or the back-benchers. As one example, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is involved, pushing forward legislation requiring any contractors or corporations withholding information or technology associated with “non-human intelligence” to give it to Congress  for proper oversight 

3. Even if it’s not aliens, UFOs, or whatever, it would still be a massively underreported story if these individuals running a psyop were able to fool politicians from both parties (e.g., Marco Rubio, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, Kirsten Gillibrand, etc.) enough to launch a congressional investigation, pass legislation about it, hold hearings, etc.

Im an Indian and it hurts to put this forward but it is what it is. 

**Why I think so?**

1) **Corruption**
   - Deeply ingrained corruption cripples progress.
   - Almost feels like corruption is second nature in India.

2) **Religious intolerance & Tensions**
   - Often exploited for political gain, causing instability.
   - Politics revolving around Hindu-Muslim issues rather than development, transparency, and accountability.

3) **Primary Education (Up to 12th Std)**
   - Need I say anything regarding Govt Schools?
   - We all know the pathetic and dilapidated conditions govt schools & colleges are.

4) **Poor Quality of Politicians**
   - Lack of qualified and visionary leaders.
   - I'm honestly tired of hearing about Hindu-Muslim Masjid Mandir, Pakistan, and all this.
   - No accountability & transparency.

5) **Compromised Federal Institutions (Non-Independent)**
   - Like CBI, ED, IT, etc., doesn't ensure accountability & transparency.
   - They fail to keep frauds, corruption, and malpractices in check.

6) **Growing Population**
   - Rapid population growth strains resources.
   - Adds pressure on job creation and infrastructure.

7) **Job Opportunities**
   - Employment challenges due to population growth.
   - Need for sustainable job creation strategies.

8) **Bureaucracy and Red Tape**
   - Complex and bureaucratic procedures.

9) **Slow Judiciary (Justice Delayed is Justice Denied as we all know)**
   - Overburdened and slow legal system.
   - Delays justice and hinders business operations.
   - Again leads to accountability problems.

10) **Brain Drain Problem** because of some of the above-mentioned issues

Anything that's a ""trade secret"" or ""proprietary information"". This is a view I've held for about two decades, and it's based on a relatively extensive understanding of physical and electronic security. 

To me it seems like people who think otherwise just don't understand the way computer intrusions happen, the way logs are overwritten, the way code can self delete, or the unique complications introduced by the fact that your vote is supposed to be authenticated but also anonymous. I think most experts in the field agree with me, especially if they're independent, but they aren't being asked. An attack wouldn't need to involve something like ""changing votes"" it would be enough to make sure that certain machines in certain places just didn't count votes at all, or that the previous votes were lost. This type of thing is simply too difficult to avoid. 

I understand that encryption can make things more or less mathematically secure, given certain relatively safe assumptions, but at that point there is still way too much error possible in software and physical implementation of any cryptography.

A defender needs to lock up every window, every possible entrance, but the attacker only needs to find one weakness. And even all of this rosy optimism is based on the fact that every single employee at the entire company making these, is properly vetted and doing what they should. If a few employees there are corrupt, it's way harder to tell what's actually going on and all bets are off. The attacker in this case is almost infinitely motivated - it's hard to imagine the power they would wield, especially as voting machines become more popular."
1,2023-11-30,"CMV: The Problem of Evil, when taken to refer to moral evil, does not eliminate the possibility of God’s existence.",u/Londoner421,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/187euac/cmv_the_problem_of_evil_when_taken_to_refer_to/,changemyview,"In order for me to explain my view I want to start with some definitions. Firstly, moral evil vs. natural evil. Natural evil is evil for which no non-divine agent can be held morally responsible for its occurrence. Moral evil is evil caused by the intentional action or inaction of an agent.   
The Problem of Evil is the idea that it is either logically impossible or extremely unlikely for an omnipotent, omniscient, and morally good God to exist and also allow evil to exist. Obviously, this is because if God was truly all powerful and good, he could and therefore would eliminate evil. Therefore, the Problem of Evil posits that it is likely the God we believe to be all powerful and good, may be not one of those two characteristics, and so the traditional God, as viewed by many Christians and Muslims religions doesn’t truly exist. On the other hand, there is the proposal that God does not exist at all because if God is a perfect being, then therefore the existence of Evil proves that God isn’t real because it would inherently not exist in compatibility with God.   
\*\*IF AT THIS POINT you disagree with anything I’ve written, or you think I have a misinterpretation of the Problem of Evil, keep in mind that I’m laying out the premise which I will soon reject, so this hopefully isn’t the part of the post you are trying to disprove\*\*  
I believe that the Free Will defense fully protects God against non-existence.   
The Free Will Defense argues that God realized that Free Will/Free Choice/Free Moral Choice was more valuable than intrinsic goodness in the world itself.   
First I will explain 1) how this connects to evil , then I will explain 2) why Free Will is more valuable than inherent goodness in the world.  
The Free Will Defense states that you cannot have true free will without also having the ability to act both rightly and wrongly.   
This is because we can observe how some of the time, people will act in evil ways out of their own free will, so if people did not have the moral choice to act evilly, this would not be true free will.  
Free Will is tied to the amount of moral choice one has.   
Goodness is one moral, yet by definition it must be contextualized with other morals. Morals are “concerned with the principles of right and wrong behavior”. Therefore, without the ability to choose between behaviors, morals fade into non-existence.  
This poses the question, is the non-existence of both good and evil better than the existence of both concepts? The preclusion of one negative concept would eliminate free will and true choice between moral options, which God obviously encompasses due to his perfect nature.   
	  
I’m writing this at 3am, will post it tomorrow so I can sufficiently respond to people’s arguments. Thanks!  

Edit: I should have made the distinction, but I believe in Libertarianism free will, not compatibilism

Edit 2: the closest argument to changing my mind is the one which states that physical existence itself, which is created by God, restricts our Free Will. My response is that we as humans currently have the maximum possible free will, proven by the existence of evil. The ability to fly would not be a change in moral choice, it would be a change in the definition of “human”. Free Will refers to our ability to exercise choice within our existence, particularly in the sense that we can choose between good and evil. The fact that we cannot fly is not a feasible choice to be made, it would be a change in state of being.

Edit 3: awarded delta because its difficult to argue about the extent to which free will is restricted and the totality of the of existence of morals, particularly since this is operating under the impression that god created everything. I agree that the free will defense cannot explain why god limited humans via physical existence and hadn’t thought about that previously. I’m going to keep responding to comments though. 

Edit 4: awarded delta because I agree that the Free Will defense fails to explain that if moral evil did exist with humans on earth it would logically make sense that it existed with them in heaven, meaning that after death they are either restricted in their existence in heaven or god is not all powerful because he cannot enforce the very ideal by which he let the humans into heaven.

1,2023-11-30,CMV: Death Penalty Should Be Legal,u/SentenceSure6277,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/187fd0c/cmv_death_penalty_should_be_legal/,changemyview,"Some people think the death penalty is a good idea because they believe it scares others from committing serious crimes. They also argue that it's a fair punishment for really bad actions and can save money compared to keeping someone in prison for life. Supporters say it helps keep dangerous people away and gives closure to victims' families.  
However, many people disagree with the death penalty. They worry that innocent people might be wrongly executed, and they find it morally wrong for the government to take a person's life. Some studies even question if it really stops crime better than other punishments. Globally, more and more countries are choosing to get rid of the death penalty, seeing it as a violation of basic human rights. The debate continues on whether the potential benefits of the death penalty are worth the serious problems it brings.

While acknowledging concerns about wrongful executions and moral objections, improvements in legal processes can minimize the risk of errors. They contend that the effectiveness of the death penalty as a deterrent may go beyond certain study findings. Additionally, the global trend against capital punishment doesn't negate its potential benefits in specific situations, suggesting a need for nuanced consideration rather than outright dismissal."

Like I thought (and still kinda do) about flat earthers in the same way because I genuinely believe that the claims were equally idiotic.

Even the Catholic Church has to kowtow to religion when the evidence is so incredibly overwhelming that you just make yourself look aggressively unintelligent arguing against it. There would probably still be people that doubt heliocentrism if the church hadn't publicly (and posthumously) apologised to Galileo.

People that believe in the entirely of for example the bible or the quran are just eventually going to be left behind in science, maths, biology and so many other important fields of study. They're almost modern day luddites.

Just to clarify this isn't for the nominal or moderate religious folks who can accept things like evolution and rainbows not being gifts from God. Just for those who are die hard enough to ignore scientific advances that contradict their scripture.

13,2023-11-30,"CMV: Of all the big tech companies, Google provides most benefit to society, while several others (especially Meta) are a net negative",u/montecoelhos,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/187kh7n/cmv_of_all_the_big_tech_companies_google_provides/,changemyview,"I am posting this here since this is my (obviously) subjective judgementt about many of the big tech companies, and I would like to evaluate whether this belief is wishful thinking, partially true or simply outright flawed

My belief is roughly twofold, as follows:
- Society as a whole is better off with Google than without it. Indeed, they provide services that are incredibly empowering to nearly everyone: access to information via powerful search, communication via Gmail, organization via Google Drive, Sheets and Docs, navigation via Google maps, ... Many of these services (at least the basic versions) are provided free of charge and are extremely user-friendly. Especially for low-income groups (e.g. students, poorer countries, ...), this is empowering and improves their quality of life.
- Society is worse off with Meta than without it (by extension, all companies whose main focus is social media). Namely, the explosive growth of Facebook and similar platforms has contributed to a large extent to the incredible polarization in society (which can be attributed to a large extent to ""anger"" as a main engagement driver to keep people for longer times on the platforms, for ad exposure, and to the now well-known ""echo chambers"" which tend to form on social media platforms). Also, I hold social media accountable for the rise in mental health problems (especially in younger users), e.g. by promoting unrealistic expectations, increased social pressure, etc. Facebook seems to have become a de-facto place for news consumption by many users, which has sparked an incredible number of fake accounts / bots that steer comment sections and pages propagating fake news. Maybe this is not directly Meta's fault, but I observe the effect. Google did not seem to suffer from this ""fake account tsunami"" problem, despite there being fake-news YouTube channels as well, of course. It just seems to me like Google has not meaningfully shifted news consumption away from ""regular"" media (which I conisder important so that every citizen can have a shared basis of facts and trustworthy news). If Meta and their platforms would cease to exist tomorrow, it may be a mild annoyance in the beginning, but we'd get over it quickly and we would benefit from improved mental health (less inflated feelings of anger, feeling offended, ...). 

Points that go against this belief that I've already considered, but find insufficient:
- ""WhatsApp is an incredible free communication service as well!"" True, but Facebook didn't develop it, they acquired it. So WhatsApp would have existed even without any large social media company buying them (not considering their profitability for the moment). Also, without WhatsApp, it seems like Hangouts could have filled that vacuum and might have grown into a similar, feature-rich and widely used communication app.
- ""YouTube is also a social medium on which echo chambers exist, and which can promote hate and polarization!"". True. Nonetheless, the scale seems different compared to e.g. Facebook, and massive polarization seems to have increased mostly once Facebook started really growing big (with YouTube having been around for longer already).

I understand that both companies have similar business models based on advertising revenue and that there services are paid for by (often privacy-unfriendly) exploiting of user data. However, the way in which this is done (based on the arguments above) seems substantially different.

My belief is likely incomplete or flawed. I admire Google for their contributions, as stated above, while I wish Meta never existed (even though I have used their products, most ly due to the ""preferential attachment""/platform effect where I want to be able to interact with other people that happen to heavily use the platform).

While some may think someone who is anti-abortion as extreme measures would be far right I beg to differ, the far right does support abortions but for completely different reason than someone pro-choice would be: I’ve seen support of abortion for the same reason the Nazis supported abortion: Inter-racial babies, babies with disabilities, having minorities get more abortions etc.
  This isn’t some right wing talking point that pro-choicers want abortions because they’re racist or hate disabled children - I’m merely stating that far right support for abortion is consistent with their viewpoint on the world.

To play devil’s advocate sure, conservatives themselves aren’t usually wanting abortion because they think minorities need to have less children or that interracial babies shouldn’t exist, but those that are like this a small minority that would later turn into far right wingers would be in support of abortion later on because “the world needs less minorities, Jews and so forth”

  Let’s also dive into the trans stuff, conservatives despite what people say usually support the transgender movement just as long as those same transgender people have some of the same conservative talking points: Pro-gun, lower taxes, etc. they’re apparently the more sane ones. Whereas someone on the far right doesn’t care about any of this, they either want them dead or they want trans people alive because it keeps the feminists they desperately hate as a way to dismantle the left wing. I have also seen support of trans people from the far right for a few reasons: One extremely rigid gender roles correlate with their world view, two a few trans people are far right and Nazis (especially antisemitic) and three as I mentioned before they are a good way to dismantle the anti-trans feminist movement and divide the left. They are more realpolitiks than neocons claim to be.

Finally, I’d like to say that although I know that a lot of far right views aren’t intelligent most notably their insanely stupid and inconsistent views on Jews which seperates them from the conservatives, the very small minority of them that do support Israel actually have somewhat consistent views of their world despite the contrary: Israel is not an ethnostate but they believe Israel is because it is the land of the Jews, if they want a place for the Jews to live than Israel is the place to be.

   All in all I believe that conservatives try to be morally too ideological, while The Far Right doesn’t care: I wouldn’t be too surprised of they’d be in favor of the Canadian suicide thing where they’d be justifying it saying depressed and mentally ill people deserve to be killed."
1,2023-11-30,CMV: All currently prevalent interpretations of the 2nd amendment are dead wrong,u/DrCornSyrup,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/187ldsb/cmv_all_currently_prevalent_interpretations_of/,changemyview,"CMV: All currently prevalent interpretations of the 2nd amendment are dead wrong

""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

This clearly states that the intention is to allow militias. Here are the definitions of militia

* a military force that is raised from the civil population to supplement a regular army in an emergency.


*  a military force that engages in rebel or terrorist activities in opposition to a regular army.

Clearly, a militia is  a warfighting force that exist outside of government control. I believe the intention is to allow strong fighting forces to deter government overreach but that is not something I can prove with the text

The 2nd amendment says quite clearly that it is here to protect militias. For this reason, I think nongovernment fighting forces should be allowed to obtain heavy weapons such as full power machineguns, mortars, and anti-tank missiles. Obviously this would only apply to a WELL REGULATED militia (as the text states), rather than allowing random crazies or mass shooters to obtain heavy weapons

On the flipside, I see no reason why pistols or concealed carry should be protected by the second amendment. While pistols are in some cases used as sidearms in the military, they are not important or essential to a military fighting force. Concealed carry is most certainly NOT anything pertaining to militias or warfighting and should 100% not be covered

Arguments that will not change my mind:


> Some judge said this one interpretation is what the amendment means

I care what the constitutions says, not what some judge or lawyer said

> I need pistols to protect myself

OK, but that does not fall within the scope of the 2nd amendment

> I hate the 2nd amendment we need to ban all guns

John insists it’s a bait-and-switch. The sign promised fifty cent tacos. The restaurant needs to fulfill their promise or they’re guilty of false advertising.

1,2023-11-30,cmv: Progressive Atheism is like Religion where 'God' is replaced with 'the Greater Good',u/tkyjonathan,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/187nazp/cmv_progressive_atheism_is_like_religion_where/,changemyview,"I've been thinking about this for quite a while. It seems to me that atheism today is very much like Christian religion in terms of its morality. Help your neighbour. Help the poor. Do good. Be a good person. Don't sin. Don't harm others. 

The core of religion would be a supernatural being called god. While there are moral laws about how to behave and how to behave with others, the core of a lot of reasoning for those moral laws are around god and because 'god says so'. 

If an atheist moral system would choose to use a religious moral system, but just remove god, then it seems to me that there will be a massive hole in it. At the very least, the part where ""god says so"" wouldn't work logically. So for an atheist moral system to adopt the moral principles of Christianity, they would need to replace god with something else. 

There has been philosophical attempts to secularise religious morality by Kant and Hegel. Hegel in particular, seems to have introduced concepts like 'society' and 'the greater good' as reasons to act morally. But to me, 'society' is not a 'real' thing. Sure there are people that make up a society, but there is no convergence or emergence of those people into a new metaphysical entity called society and the same goes for 'the greater good'. We feel good doing something for the greater good, but we cant touch the greater good, we can't see it. We just have a warm fuzzy feeling, because someone else told us that is the right thing to do for society. 

Anyway, I hope I was able to dump my thoughts in a semi-coherent fashion. 

Change my mind. 

P.S. I am not religious, so please do not ""but Christianity is just as bad as.."" because I won't really respond to that.

To ever disregard your own personal manifestation of the holiday already ruins the question entirely. If you are American and ask the question in the context of how our overall society and culture celebrates it, then yes it's pagan, dedicated to the gods of Coca-Cola and black friday sales. If you ask the question in regards to it's namesake, then it is wholly Christian. Christmas meaning ""Christ mass"", a literal liturgical worship of Christ dedicated to his birth. If you ask the question in regards to it's tradition and practices, and define ""pagan"" as anything that is either pre-christian or connected to a form of spirituality, then you'd have to admit that it's a little split, but with many traditions falling into that definition of ""pagan"".

Archaeology, linguistics, comparitive mythology, and even the FDA recognize that numerous Christmas sybmols are tied to pre-Christian European traditions. But if you are a Christian celebrating the holiday with those symbols, it would be stupid to say that it's a pagan holiday, and even more stupid for you to tell someone else that *they* are celebrating a pagan holiday. A Christian, no matter what symbols or traditions they use, can dedicate every practice into how it ties to Christ, therefore making it a Christian holiday and letting it live to it's namesake.

Which is why neo-pagans refer to use the term ""Yuletide"" instead, the namesake is already a dealbreaker. But why should it? Yule terminology is still used when the holiday is celebrated as Christian, a yule log does not have to be pagan, neither does the yule goat or a yule tree. The meaning behind those practices is only what you give it.

The Christmas tree has a very unclear history and people like to debate it's origins as well. In reality, there is no ancient origin tied to it. Christian people in Germany began hanging fruits on trees just a few centuries ago, any religious significance is given to it by people who use it in the modern day and is not defined by any pre-existing tradition. You could draw a connection of the Christmas tree to the veneration of trees and groves by the Celtic and Germanic peoples. Then surely it's pagan. You could alternatively commemorate the tree to God's gift of nature to humanity, drawing numerous connections between trees and the atonement of Christ. Thirdly, you could tie it to the story of Thor's Oak, a decorated pagan symbol in northern Germany which the pagans believed was protected by the gods, only for a Christian missionary to chop it down and use it to build a church, converting the entire pagan population in the process. In that case it could be both an anti-pagan Christian symbol or dedicated in the same way as Thor's Oak itself.

Santa Claus and the elves, while certainly taking a lot of imagery from Scandinavian folkore, and having possible ties to Odin, does not have to be pagan in any sense. Santa and the giving of gifts is often used to portray the coming of Christ. But most of the time, he is neither, and is purely a cultural symbol instead of having religious significance to any form of spirituality. Why then can't he be whichever matters more to you personally?

These arguments apply to all holidays with this kind of debate. Halloween (by both namesake and most implications) is Christian, being dedicated to the passing of saints. But Samhain, a pagan holiday which holds a lot of cultural ties and signifance to Halloween, is responsible for a lot of it's pre-Christian symbols and practices. Neither of these mean anything to anybody unless they personally apply it to some form of spirituality. Easter is pagan by namesake, Christian by cultural implication, and yet again depends entirely on how it's celebrated individually. Is it commemorating Christ's ressurection? Or acknowledging the cycle of seasons and fertility? Both, neither, doesn't matter. Because a holiday cannot have an objective meaning or interpretation unless it holds that identity universally.

In conclusion, the only reason there is a debate in the first place is becaues of confusion given by the namesake. People are unsure wether to define the meaning of a holiday by it's name, official declaration, or practices. When in reality, none of those things matter and it depends entirely on how it's chosen to be celebrated. Neopagan groups who want to celebrate Christmas as a pagan holiday are valid for doing so, and at the same time it doesn't matter how many symbols have pagan roots, it never means a Christian is celebrating a pagan holiday.

from this court decision we have some civil rights laws that have made it illegal to racially/sexually discriminate. the fact that many civil rights regulations are built upon this ruling is perhaps the primary reason there is little to no effort being expended to overturn this decision even by people who think it was a bad ruling. most people would agree in our modern culture that telling a farmer what he can and cannot grow is immoral, perhaps even a greater majority would agree that refusing to employ a person because they are black would be even worse.

there are other reasons why people don't try to challenge the decision, specifically because most of the regulatory agencies like o.s.h.a, a.t.f and d.e.a are also built mostly upon that decision or benefit greatly from it.

it seems plausible that congress and the regulatory state could legally implement rules that could require an individual to go to college and earn a degree in a specific field because that would effect interstate commerce. they could also require you to perform certain jobs even if you didn't want to (except if you have a religious exemption). they could also limit the number of employees that can legally work at any business or require a business to hire more people in certain fields.

it is my opinion that any law, regulation, or agency that requires this supreme court interpretation of the commerce clause needs to be repealed along with the supreme court decision regardless of how good some of it is. any agency, regulation or law that is considered a moral necessity needs to be justified by other means."

You get days or weeks notice that somebody with a bunch of authority is going to come by. You either bring in extra staff, or suspend normal operations, so that you can bring everything up to a standard that is unsustainable under any other conditions.

I think this is an absolutely terrible policy. 

In the best case scenario, these folks know exactly what is going on and the visit is a test of how well local management can respond to curveball. I would expect such a situation to therefore involve talking to staff about how the preparations were done. I've never witnessed that. 

More often (within my experience), this appears to be nothing more than an ego stroke for somebody with a very high opinion of themselves to ""survey their kingdom"" and feel puffed up about how spotless it is. These walk-throughs tend to be very cursory, with a brief tour followed by the visiting dignitary disappearing into meeting rooms to get on with the actual business of the day. 

In the worst cases I have experience with, the ""important person"" is on the lookout for anything they can comment negatively on. They seem to genuinely believe not only that the current state of the facility is normal, but that it's inadequate and needs to be better. It's worth noting that I have never seen this one with a Chief Executive or anybody with similar levels of authority. It's always some miserable shrew with *just enough power* to treat people like garbage with apparent impunity, such as a regional manager.

The first case seems like a lot of wasted effort to me, but at least something meaningful is being tested. I would be likely to award deltas to folks who can tell me they've seen explicitly this, with enough regularity (i.e. you've seen it at more than one company) that it clearly isn't an anomaly.

The other two are just bad, and I'm convinced they contribute to bad policy. ""Look how clean and smooth running they keep everything with only 800 man hours a week! We can definitely cut them down to 600 without productivity loss.""

And if this is somebody's intentional strategy just to make sure things *get* cleaned up once a year or whatever, I think it's a dramatic and ridiculous way to do it. Just have a designated periodic spring clean up date so you aren't disrupting operations and playing pretend.

Out of those 10 million, surely at least one million would be quite exceptional - people who have substantially high IQ, have advanced quite far in life and a career - such as being a doctor, or having worked in public governmental service for decades, etc.

And out of those million, surely at least 10,000 would have the political know-how, the charisma, the political interest, maybe have spent significant time abroad in foreign countries or speak multiple languages, to be a suitable president.

It’s more so that looks are subjective, but not very much as that subjectivity is still governed by conventional beauty standards.

Let’s look at the west. In men the things that are seen as attractive are the following, in good shape, tall, strong masculine facial features, and healthy.

About 95% of what who most people deem to be fall into this category. If we’re talking celebrity examples of attractive people, Timothee Chalamet, Chris Hemworth, Chris Evans, Ryan Gosling, Simu Liu, Ryan Renolds, Michael B. Jordan.

People find these men attractive but they might not find all of the attractive, which is where that subjectivity comes into play. However if you hold up a picture of Timothee Chalamet against any random guy off the street. 9/10 times women are going to find Timothee hotter than the guy. This is where the objectivity comes in.

If looks had no objectivity towards them, we’d all be hot enough to have enough people attracted to us like a celebrity. That’s clearly not the case. Hotness isn’t something that’s widely debated or widely seen. It’s in a select few people. It’s techincally subjective but not really. It’s in the same way that you could technically say water isn’t objectively blue because you can dye it.

I think people should consider this when trying to coach ugly people in their dating efforts by telling them “looks are subjective” they are, but not in any meaningful way if you don’t already have attractive physical qualities."
1,2023-11-30,CMV: Choosing not to have or help raise kids because you think it is the only unselfish procreation choice is actually just a different but equally selfish choice,u/KartlindWitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/187wtr0/cmv_choosing_not_to_have_or_help_raise_kids/,changemyview,"Note: I am talking to the subset of childfree people that hate all children and/or refuse to interact with them kindly.  
Note: I do not currently have kids, but I do intend and want to be a parent.  
I see a lost of posts and videos on the internet of people saying ""There is no non-selfish reason to have kids"" which might be true but my issue with this popular internet opinion is many of these people think that by not having kids they are making the unselfish choice and that is not true. It is equally selfish to demand labor from a generation you did not play any part in raising. It is selfish to expect others to raise the people that you will need. It makes you a leech.  
There is no way to not rely on the younger generations for things if you live in society. If you don't die young, you will continue to go to restaurants, continue to get medical, dental, eye care, continue to need a car mechanic, continue to need city infrastructure, continue to need clothing makers, continue to need grocery stockers, delivery people, etc, etc, etc and at some point ALL of those roles will be filled by a generation you did not help raise. If everyone on earth stopped having children right now, in like 25 years everything will suck pretty badly!  
Then they will say ""If your reason for having kids is so your old age doesn't suck that is selfish"" and maybe that's true but I don't live in a black and white world so I don't see ""selfishness"" as a 100% wrong value. I think in some situations being selfish can be the correct choice.  
Now, I completely recognize not everyone can have kids, and not everyone wants them, not everyone should be a parents, but I am saying that you need to contribute to raising the next generation in some manner beyond ""Well I work and pay taxes and will pay for all those services you mentioned above so I AM contributing to society!"" Those of us creating/raising/helping the next gen are also still doing all of those things ON TOP of the labor of keeping society moving forward.  
So if you want to keep saying people who have kids are selfish and therefore worse people than you, put your money where you mouth is and prove that you don't need the minds and labor of the next generations."
