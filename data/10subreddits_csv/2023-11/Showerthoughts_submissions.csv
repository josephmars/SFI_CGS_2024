- 🦘 Unique & dangerous wildlife: From Roos, to armadillos, from koalas to fire ants, and from kookaburras to the grackles at H-E-B. We have wildlife covered. 

- We ❤️ BBQ & Rodeos.  

- 🌵 Vast Landscapes like the outback and West Texas that are unbelievably hot.

- 🐎 Cowboys and Outback Bushmen. Tough guys with iconic hats. 

- 🎙️Y’all don’t understand how much we love our accents. It’s the rest of the world that talks funny. 

- We both enjoy drinking a pint while watching collision sports. 🏈 🏉

I have no clue how long the narrative has been playing out, and as a result I simply cannot understand the depth of the relations that various characters share. One character seems to love another. Is this reasonable? I have no clue.

Aside from procedural shows or very specific programs like 24 or Strange Luck that are based on time, TV shows seem to pay little attention to informing the audience of how much time passes between episodes. I wish this trend would cool off and that every episode or two would establish where we are as a show and an audience so that we can assess which characters have been drinking too much for too long, sleeping together long enough to be a couple, obsessing about something long enough for it to be unhealthy, etc.

This generally doesn't matter with comedies, but I still like a time-frame reference here and there. The Office and Parks & Rec did this well by plotting out goals and events from episode to episode."

You look up or turn around and make eye contact with someone. You felt like someone was staring at you before you saw them. 

Hear me out: it's quantum physics. I read an article about how light behaves differently when observed. Now I'm no expert but I reckon if light behaviour is altered through looking at it then looking at someone has an effect on them. Or rather reality. 

By that theory, humans have the ability to sense this effect. Like how a bird can sense magnetic fields by having metal filaments in their wings. My conclusion: paranoia is when this biological ability is damaged or altered. Now you feel like you're being stared at all the time. There, my shower thought of the day."

And witnessing that change in person. Just doing basically a variety of seemingly small miracles for those in need and who need representation. The way social media works these days, you’d likely become even more rich and famous. Kinda leaning towards the Mr. Beast model, right?

Warren Buffet still lives in the same house he and his wife have lived in for like 50 years or something like that. 

Should some of the super wealthy have hundreds of cars or millions of dollars in artwork? (Or tens of, hundreds of millions, billions of $) I can’t wrap my head around it.

For some reason or another I doubt whether or not I want to progress on something I’ve started doing - like learning a song on the guitar or writing a poem or working on a personal project or a job. When that feeling comes up I either stop or keep going, obviously. If I stop then I often come back to that unfinished project and think “man I wish I could have seen that through to the end”. I’ve had that with so many things in my life.   
“I just want to see this project through to the end.”  
I think that to myself and move on with some vague notion of what that end might be. Whispers of ends like ‘finishing the song’, ‘finishing the project’. If these ends are analyzed any further they reveal a loop - finishing the song is finishing the song, the end is the end. When the end is so vague, it’s hard to actually make sense of what milestone you are trying to aim for.  
In a sense, everything can be endless. You can practice the memorization a song endlessly to perfection, always striving for it to be closer and closer to the source material. You can keep aiming for a raise in your job, striving higher and higher in your expectations for wealth and recognition.  
In a sense, everything has an end - whether you determine it or not. Your hands can develop arthritis not allowing you to practice guitar any more. You can settle down and have a family so you reconsider your career goals. You die.  
What even is an ‘end’? The end of a life is when someone dies. The end of time is when nothing else exists. Our youths end, our teens end, our college years end, our 20s end, our 30s end. There’s some finish line. Some memoriam. Some expectation of celebration. There’s grandiosity to an end.   
Is there? I mean, we all end minutes, we all end seconds, we all end days - all the time. End walks, end talks, end drinks, end showers, end sentences. No applause, or fanfare, maybe sometimes but mostly not.   
Should I celebrate ends more often? Maybe that would make me more present in the moment. Maybe that would drive me insane.  
What seems most important is defining clearly for yourself what the end is for you on the endeavors you begin. A starting question that has helped for me is, how much would you have to commit to this project to be able to say you gave it an honest try?

Thanks for joining me for this shower thought - the water is cold now and my hands are all wrinkly. Until next time.  
TLDR: I think I need SMART goals"

August to December Review namin from Review Centers in Manila which is super malayo samin kasi taga Taguig kami so Taguig to Manila & Manila to Taguig is very hard lalo na commute lang ako. I need to wake up 2 hours before the Review class starts. Sobrang hirap & inconvinient sakin kasi imbis na natutulog pa ako, kailangan kong gumising nang maaga para makaalis din nang maaga at hindi maipit sa traffic. Jeep, MRT, LRT, Jeep. Hirap. Mas lalong sobrang hirap dahil minsan umuulan pa, kung hindi niyo alam. Lagi pong binabaha sa Maynila. Yung 1 hour byahe ko pauwi naging 4 hours stuck in traffic at baha. Yung pahinga at pagrereview nawawala na din dahil sa nasasayang na oras sa traffic. 

Nung mga August to October okay naman performance ko sa Review Center, nagugulat na lang din ako kasi nakakapag review ako nang maayos, naiintindihan ko lessons namin, nakakasabay ako at higit sa lahat tumataas mga scores ko sa quizzes at sa exam namin every end of the subject topic pero this Mid October something happened & I started not to attent my Review Class anymore. (Ayoko sana mag drop ng any private information regarding to that) pero may hinihintay kasi akong Review Assistance which yun dapat paymentnamin for the last payment kaya lang hindi pa naibibigay & I have no other choice but to not attend anymore since 10k it’s not a joke. Wala na din kaming mahiraman.

Then it’s all started na nahihirapan na ako magreview, sisipagin ako pero kapag magrereview na ako nagtititigan lang kami ng laptop ko at ng mga reviewers ko which is really really hard for me. Sobrang hirap mag self review. Mababaliw ka na lang na hindi mo naiiintindihan yung binabasa mo and nakakapag hina ng loob :( I don’t even know kung kaya kong mag take ng board exam this year."

Let them tell you what they need!,u/Proof_Insect_2188,https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/17wm58h/people_are_knowledgeable_and_capable_about_their/,Showerthoughts,"If someone doesn't give a direct call to action, DON'T FUCKING TELL THEM WHAT TO DO OR TAKE IT AS A INVITATION TO DO SOMETHING!

Background: I left an abusive relationship a few months ago. It was bad. It was messy. The end seemed (to the outside) as a very rapid action. It's been a crazy mess since then.

I've had a number of times where I have said something about the situation as a way to either explain a fact or to form a connection with someone. Unfortunately, there is a large contingent of people who hear a story and then immediately jump in with ""You need to do X!"" or ""I'll do X!""

This is not helpful and is incredibly patronizing. I'm not a child. If I don't know what to do or need help doing something, I'll ask. If you feel you want to do something, ask if you can give advice. Ask if you can offer help. Say that you are there if I need help. My story isn't about you. Don't try and make it yours and white knight the situation.

---

A stupid example that might better illustrate:

I post an interpersonal work conflict. I'm in software development leadership and it's a philosophical discussion about work process. I ask for resources to understand the underlying situation. I don't ask for advice on dealing with it. I don't ask ""How do I respond?"" I ask for resources to understand the other perspective.

Don't tell me a story about how this person is wrong and that I should go beyond them. Don't tell me that I should do X. Let me ask when I need that. Let me give that call for help. Answer the question, ask for clarification, or ask if it's acceptable to provide an opinion. If you NEED to post and it doesn't fit within that, just offer support.

People are capable.
People are resourceful.
People know what they need.

Let others ask when I need help. Otherwise, sit down and shut up. Don't make it about you."

As i got closer to home, i became more and more frustrated between traffic and the fact i was so close to home yet so far.  But i remembered my favorite sports talk radio station.  As soon as i put that on i just coasted through all the traffic and enjoyed the wonderful sports banter that i would usually enjoy on my way home from work.

I noticed that the feeling that I get when my favorite sports team loses, is similar to how I am when I am mourning a loss, or I was just dumped by a girlfriend, failed at a huge test in college, etc. In contrast, the feeling of watching your sports team win is akin to a life achievement, watching your team win elicits these feelings of such triumph, it feels so lizard-brainy.

I completely understand that not everyone is the same way in this regard, about sports in particular. However, it's just something I thought about and it's quite interesting to me. I find myself making very loud, obnoxious noises at my TV on game days, and nothing else quite brings out that side of me."

I'm going to try to go through a drive through with my own nifty container and see if they'd allow me not to pollute more than I have to.

Are we trying to work against evolution as a natural phenomenon by trying to medically eliminate these genetic disorders?

1,2023-11-22,Jealousy is not real,u/Fighting_Bull_1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/181bzog/jealousy_is_not_real/,Showerthoughts,"When I hear people say jealous things about another persons appearance, whether it be about facial attractiveness, height, or muscle, I always think this:

It sounds like that person wishes that their consciousness was born in the body of the person they’re jealous of. But it doesn’t work like that. If you were born with that persons genetic makeup, your current consciousness WOULDN’T EXIST. Your personality, thoughts, and consciousness is a product of 1. Your experiences and 2. Your hormonal profile. No two people have the same memories and hormones. 

So if you magically were born with these perfect genetics that you wish for, you are essentially wishing to not exist because a completely different person would result from that life. The reason being because this “better” body would undoubtedly cause you to have different life experiences and hormones. You are basically wishing your own consciousness to not exist. Not o my your current consciousness, but every single instantaneous version our consciousness has ever been throughout every year if your life would never exist. You’d just be gifting those perfect genetics to another person that isn’t you.

You are a product of your life. The idea that you would be the same person if you were born into a different body is fantasy. There is not “other” version of you. 

Your consciousness and your body are not separable like people tend to believe. Jealousy is wishing to not exist."

Sex is awesome when it's happening and at its climax. But everything else around it is annoying. I think this can be better felt with an analogy. Forgive the visuals.

Sex for guys is like blowing your nose. Also, your nose gets stuffier over time. You can feel that stuffiness and each sniffle reminds you of that discomfort. We've all felt this sensation. All you want is to blow your nose. You can always blow your nose in your hands, but that's pretty lame. You would prefer a soft tissue. However, that will only defer it. Give it time and your nose will be stuffy again. It's a constant battle against that discomfort. Some harness that discomfort to do more uncomfortable things (workout), some just use their hand.

I'm not sure what it's like for gals, but I imagine it's more like a deep tissue massage, with the occasional shiver (or shivers). Or something like rubbing out a charlie horse. You could live without it, but it's nice.
