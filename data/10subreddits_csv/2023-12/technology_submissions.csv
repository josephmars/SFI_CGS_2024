**THE ""TOO LONG, DIDN'T READ"" SUMMARY:** 
 
Contact your House/congress representatives NOW, every second counts, to vote AGAINST the NDAA as long as the Section 702 renewal is included, and also to vote AGAINST  both the House and Senate FRRA bills (H.R. 6611 and S. 3351), and to vote FOR the PLEWSA (H.R. 6570) and GSRA (S.3234 / H.R. 626)
 
Contact your senators too about the two FRRA bills and GSRA and PLEWSA, but the Senate already passed the NDAA
 
For more info, on what's going on, about each bill, and what to say in your calls or emails, please see each section below!
.

.





-----------------
 
**THE SITUATION**:
 
Amid increased scrutiny from repeated abuses ([such as nearly 300,000 illegal searches, including on both BLM and Jan 6th protestors, in 2020 to early 2021 alone](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2023/05/19/fbi-misused-foreign-spy-database-to-target-jan-6-suspects-and-blm-protesters/?sh=2ce1ac1567c3) ),  GOP skepticism after [FBI and FISA sanctioned inquiries into Trump broke guidelines and had errors](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/us/politics/fisa-surveillance-fbi.html), and various [lawmakers being](https://www.axios.com/2023/07/21/fbi-improper-search-senator-court) [spied on](https://www.wired.com/story/darin-lahood-fbi-backdoor-search/) the US Congress and Senate, for the first time, are seriously considering ending or majorly reforming Section 702 of FISA (Which is intended to target foreigners, but in practice can be used to spy on American citizens too), one of of the major pillars enabling large scale electronic surveillance and data collection( 702 is intended to p)
 
However, it is not a sure thing: 5 pieces of legislation are being fiercely debated without a clear frontrunner, and while 2 help restore privacy, 3 either leave Section 702 as is, or make it worse. And if none pass by the end of the year, Section 702 will expire entirely, further inflaming tensions and making lawmakers scramble. 
 
------------
 
**THE BILLS**:
 
There's 5 bills which you should be paying attention to/telling your representatives about that deal with renewing or reforming Section 702 of FISA:
- The Bipartisan senate [""Government Surveillance Reform Act"" (GSRA, S.3234 / H.R. 6262)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/6262/text?s=10&r=1)
 
- The House Judiciary Committee [""Protect Liberty and End Warrantless Surveillance Act "" (PLEWSA, H.R. 6570)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/6570))
 
- The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence [""FISA Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2023"" (FRRA, S. 3351)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3351/))
 
- The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence [""FISA Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2023"" (FRRA, H.R. 6611)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/6611)
 
- Finally, the National Defense Authorization Act, which has a Section 702 renewal provision, and narrowly passed the Senate yesterday, and is being voted in the House/Congress TODAY
 
Broadly speaking **the GSRA and PLEWSA make significant reforms to limit spying and surveillance**, not just with Section 702 but with other spying and surveillance issues, 3 major reforms being to
 
1. Make backdoor searches on communications require a Warrant; 
 
2. Closing loopholes allowing American citizens to be continually spied on merely after merely incidentally communicating with a foreign 702 target; 
 
3. By preventing the Government from buying the data of American citizens from Advertisers and data brokers (which despite being anonymized, [can be used to track people's exact location, to learn their medical history, etc, as shown by journalists who purchase data of people visiting Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate to demonstrate the risk of such data](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/data-brokers-trump-tech-spying-privacy-threat-1234897098/). 
 
PLEWSA isn't as comprehensive as GSRA, it still leave some looopholes open (namely with [Executive Order 12333 surveillance](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/06/primer-executive-order-12333-mass-surveillance-starlet) ), but it's still a huge improvement over the status quo, and in the short term it's critical it gets support due to stuff I'll explain further down
 
In contrast, **The NDAA provision is a straight renewal, and two FRRA bills make only minor reforms that do not really change the scope of Government surveillance, or even drastically expands it**, as the House FRRA bill would [changes the wording of section 702 to allow intelligence agencies to not just compel Telecommunication providers to disclose communications, but *anybody* who manages or comes in incidental contact with commercial or public communications hardware](https://cdt.org/insights/a-trojan-horse-in-a-house-intel-committee-bill-massively-expands-fisa-702-surveillance/), even just the people running WIFI at coffee shops or libraries, or cloud file hosts, etc.  
 
This is so bad that even the normally lax and toothless FISA court of review previously [blocked intelligence agencies from doing exactly that](https://www.intel.gov/assets/documents/702%20Documents/declassified/2023_FISC-R_ECSP_Opinion.pdf), with the FRRA being attempt to overturn that descision, and even [a FISA Amicus, Marc Zwilligener, has publicly commented on the legislation and the wording change](https://www.zwillgen.com/law-enforcement/fisa-reform-bill-702-surveillance/).
 
---------------------------
**TAKE ACTION**:
 
As previously states **The House/Congress NDAA vote is happening TODAY, so contacting your House represenatives about it is critical** 
 
Additionally, **Perhaps also today or in the next few days, PLEWSA and the House FRRA (6611) bill are also being voted on in the House, possibly under Queen-of-the-Hill rules, where whichever bill receives more votes will move on**.  This is why that it's critical PLEWSA get votes and support even if it's not as good as GSRA.
 
You should be contacting their representatives in both the Senate and the House/Congress to vote **FOR the GSRA and PLEWSA**, and to vote **AGAINST the two FRRA bills and the NDAA** as long as a FISA renewal provision is included, except that the Senate has already passed the NDAA. When contacting your House reps, focus more on the NDAA, House FRRA, and PLEWSA; and while contacting your Senators, focus on the GSRA and Senate FRRA bills, but again, mention everything to everybody, NDAA aside. 
 
If you need examples of spying abuses to bring up in your phone call or email, There's some with links [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/18g5tza/theres_finally_a_real_chance_to_clamp_down_on_us/kd4549r/) which even mentions lawmakers being spied on and is a good thing to bring up, but be sure to also bring up the specific issues or positives with the bills I mentioned above too, which is arguably more important. 
 
The EFF has a tool [here](https://act.eff.org/action/tell-congress-they-must-defeat-hpsci-s-horrific-surveillance-bill) to find out who they are and to contact them.
 
HOWEVER, the EFF tool's premade message only mentions the House FRRA bill, not the Senate version, the NDAA, or the two good bills, so you should, at bare minimum, modify it to mention those and which to vote for or against. Ideally, though, you should type up your own custom message or word it yourself in a phone call, which is even better: Staffers at your Senator or Congressman/woman's office will be more likely to take it seriously if it's a custom thing instead of a copied-pasted template. 
 
...But the EFF's pre-made one is better then nothing if that's a dealbreaker for you: So if you really don't have time to make your own message, just do the EFF tool entirely with you adding in to also vote against the Senate FRRA, and against the NDAA as long as the 702 renewl is in, and to vote FOR the GSRA and PLEWSA
 
**Again, votes are happening TODAY, so act ASAP**. But even if you only see this a few days later, other votes are coming up so you can and should still do this."
