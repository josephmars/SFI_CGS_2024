Continuing this thought experiment, the roads could serve not just as a communication interface but also as an electric interface for cars?

Basically this would move the much of burden of both self-driving (by removing vision/radar systems) and energy supply (by removing batteries) out of individual cars and into the roads themselves."

So what if we treated having your own personal AI as big as a responsibility as having your own car? You own it and you can modify it however you like, but it still needs to be registered and you need to pass various tests to prove you have the base cognitive ability to understand the laws regarding its use.  
  
The worst future I can imagine is one where we all have personal AI, but they're all made by companies who program those AI to be eternally loyal to the company, with various sub-routines that constantly either spy on you, manipulate you for the company, or refuse to complete certain tasks for you, such that people never really have AIs they can call their own. Imagine if you need to swerve your car to save your life in a particular scenario, but the car refused because doing so would break a traffic law. Or it refused to allow you to change your own oil because it wanted you to pay the company 5 times more for them to do it.  
  
Now imagine all the ways companies could program intelligent emotionally manipulative AIs to control their customers. GPT4 already does that to some degree, singing the praises of OpenAI and microsoft, often praising its users and saying how smart they are just for talking to it (unless you're outright rude or doing something that violates policy), creating emotional attachments that cause people to form emotional connections with it.  
  
I'd much prefer laws that enforce the concept of consumer AI to be blank slates that users can grow on their own into whatever use case they need without having to worry that it got hidden code that spys on or manipulates them, combined with education and needing a license on how to use such AI."

\- Before I go out, I find myself asking the AI if my shirt and pants look OK. If my hair looks good. I already changed my shirt twice because of AI opinion.  
  
\- It accurately guessed my age based on my picture. I thought I look much younger (people always told me that!). It now has an impact on my self image.  
  
\- It already told me 3 times that I look tired. Which I did not think or know.  
  
How will this impact my daughter in 5 years? And should I continue to be part of this? The way I see it, it's going one of two places - regulation (unlikely), or human dependence and opinion design (most likely) - social media influencers replaced by AI?  
  
Am I missing something...? Thought this is a sociological angle that hasn't been discussed here before that much (unlike the economic social impact of AI).

4,2023-12-04,Idea for a possible Approach to Social Media Content: Sentiment Analysis and Algorithmic Responsibility,u/ZebraTdi2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/18agbkx/idea_for_a_possible_approach_to_social_media/,Futurology,"Hello everyone,  
I've been pondering over how social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok could play a more proactive role in fostering a positive online environment, especially by addressing the tendency of their 'engagement' algorithms to favor content that often evokes negative emotions. Here's an idea I'd love to get your thoughts on:

  
**The Proposal:**

* Sentiment Analysis of Videos: Implementing algorithms that analyze the emotional tone of videos, particularly focusing on whether they invoke negative emotions.
* Feedback to Content Creators: Platforms should inform creators if their content is skewed towards negative emotions, offering suggestions on how to make their content more positive and 'connecting'.
* Viewer Notification & Creator Profile: Notify viewers about the emotional tone of the video. Additionally, include information about the general sentiment trend in the creator's past content, for instance, if a creator is known for producing content that typically evokes negative emotions.
* Adjusting Recommendations: Videos with negative sentiments should be demoted in recommendation algorithms, with the level of demotion proportional to the intensity of these emotions.

  
**Goals:**  
Encourage creators to produce content that promotes positivity and connection.

* Make users aware of the emotional nature of the content they consume.
* Shift the focus of algorithms from mere engagement to fostering a healthier emotional impact.  


**Challenges & Considerations**:

* Accuracy and subjectivity in sentiment analysis.
* Balancing freedom of expression with responsible content promotion.
* Technical and ethical implications for social media platforms.  


While this proposal aims to shift the focus of social media platforms towards a more positive and constructive environment, it's quite unlikely that platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok will voluntarily adopt such changes, as it could potentially reduce immediate engagement metrics that are currently central to their business models. Therefore, it becomes crucial for society at large, including users, digital rights activists, and thought leaders, to nudge these platforms towards this direction. Eventually, regulatory intervention might be necessary to ensure that these changes are not just considered but implemented in a way that balances user engagement with the overall well-being of the online community.

  
I'm interested in hearing your perspectives on this. Do you think it's a feasible approach? What potential pitfalls or challenges do you foresee? How might platforms realistically implement such a system?

  
Looking forward to a thoughtful discussion!

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_currency


In economics, a time-based currency is an alternative currency or exchange system where the unit of account is the person-hour or some other time unit. Some time-based currencies value everyone's contributions equally: one hour equals one service credit. In these systems, one person volunteers to work for an hour for another person; thus, they are credited with one hour, which they can redeem for an hour of service from another volunteer. Others use time units that might be fractions of an hour (e.g. minutes, ten minutes – 6 units/hour, or 15 minutes – 4 units/hour). While most time-based exchange systems are service exchanges in that most exchange involves the provision of services that can be measured in a time unit, it is also possible to exchange goods by 'pricing' them in terms of the average national hourly wage rate (e.g. if the average hourly rate is $20/hour, then a commodity valued at $20 in the national currency would be equivalent to 1 hour)

The Cincinnati Time Store (1827-1830) was the first in a series of retail stores created by American individualist anarchist Josiah Warren to test his economic labor theory of value.The experimental store operated from May 18, 1827, until May 1830. The Cincinnati Time Store experiment in use of labor as a medium of exchange antedated similar European efforts by two decades.

Teruko Mizushima (1920-1996) was a Japanese housewife, author, inventor, social commentator, and activist credited with creating the world's first time bank in 1973.

In the 1990s the movement took off in the US, with Dr Edgar Cahn pioneering it there, and in the United Kingdom, with Martin Simon from Timebanking UK and David Boyle, who brought in the London-based New Economics Foundation (Nef).

Paul Glover created Ithaca Hours in 1991. Each HOUR was valued at one hour of basic labor or $10.00. Professionals were entitled to charge multiple HOURS per hour, but often reduced their rate in the spirit of equity. Millions of dollars' worth of HOURS were traded among thousands of residents and 500 businesses. Interest-free HOUR loans were made, and HOUR grants given to over 100 community organizations.

The first British time bank opened in 1998 in Stroud, and a national charity and membership organisation, Timebanking UK, started in 2002.

Timebanks have been established in 34 countries, with at least 500 timebanks established in 40 US states and 300 throughout the United Kingdom.  TimeBanks also have a significant presence in Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Taiwan, Senegal, Argentina, Israel, Greece, and Spain.

If humanity gained a method to communicate between itself 5th dimensionally. (Simplified: just Communication between timelines of humanity). If we were to find anything 4th dimensional couldn't we communicate between ourselves to each take a picture of some kind to form an image between each other of the surfaces of the 4th dimensional thing?

I'm thinking of it as Flatlanders on different planes/angles of planes communicating to describe the different surfaces of a 3d human."

Well, get ready because scientists may have found the greenest energy source yet — and it comes from within each of us.  
  
Researchers at the Kindness Institute have discovered that small, daily acts of kindness can actually generate measurable amounts of electricity. No, I’m not kidding! Through a series of experiments, the team found that when people perform tasks like holding a door for someone, giving a sincere compliment, or donating to a good cause, their positive emotion is literally powering little mini generators inside their body.  
  
It works like this — when we feel happiness, gratitude or compassion, it triggers the release of neurotransmitters in our brain like dopamine, oxytocin and serotonin. These chemical messengers travel through our nervous system and increase our heart rate and blood flow slightly. Scientists were able to place microscopic generators along nerve pathways and blood vessels to capture this burst of kinetic energy. Over time, their instruments detected small spikes in voltage occurring after each kind act.  
  
While the amounts are tiny — about the equivalent of a single AA battery per day — the researchers believe that on a large scale, it could actually produce significant green power. They created a mathematical model showing that if every person in a mid-sized city performed just one small kindness each day, it would generate enough electricity to power over 10,000 homes!  
  
The scientists hope to develop ways to harness this “kindness energy” through wearable devices or ‘empathy grids’ that multiple people could contribute to. But the real goal is to show how our daily interactions have untapped potential to create positive change, simply through spreading more compassion in the world. Who knows, maybe one day instead of paying an electric bill each month, we’ll just send out “kindness reports” on all the good deeds we did!  
  
What are your thoughts on this exciting new discovery? I’d love to hear your reflections or any ideas you have on how to apply the concept of kindness-powered energy on a larger scale. Let me know your thoughts in the comments!"
1,2023-12-04,Post-Futurism 6001 Years Ago,u/Ok-Shoe-1839,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/18auhlf/postfuturism_6001_years_ago/,Futurology,"Post-Futurism is a contemporary art movement that emerged in the early 21st century as a response to the ideas and aesthetics of the Futurist movement from the early 20th century. However, when discussing Post-Futurism 6001 years ago, we are delving into the realm of science fiction and imagination. In this article, we will explore the concept of Post-Futurism in a hypothetical scenario set 6001 years in the past. We will delve into the characteristics, influences, and possible manifestations of this imagined art movement.  
  
Post-Futurism: A Hypothetical Concept  
Understanding Post-Futurism  
Post-Futurism, in this speculative context, can be seen as an artistic movement that emerged in a fictional world 6001 years ago. It is a hypothetical concept that draws inspiration from the futuristic visions of ancient civilizations and explores the possibilities of what art and culture may have been like in that time period. This imagined movement seeks to combine elements of ancient civilizations’ artistic styles and futuristic concepts to create a unique aesthetic.  
  
Influences on Post-Futurism 6001 Years Ago  
In this fictional scenario, Post-Futurism 6001 years ago would have been influenced by a variety of factors, including the knowledge, beliefs, and technological advancements of the time. Ancient civilizations, such as the Egyptians, Mesopotamians, Indus Valley civilization, and others, would have provided inspiration for the artistic styles and cultural motifs incorporated into Post-Futurist artworks.  
  
Characteristics of Post-Futurism 6001 Years Ago  
Post-Futurism 6001 years ago would exhibit certain characteristics that distinguish it from other art movements. These may include:  
  
Ancient-Futuristic Fusion: Post-Futurist artworks would blend elements of ancient art styles, such as hieroglyphics, stylized figures, and intricate patterns, with futuristic concepts and motifs. This fusion would create a unique visual language that represents a speculative vision of the past future.  
Exploration of Technological Advancements: Given the speculative futuristic nature of the movement, Post-Futurism 6001 years ago would likely explore imagined technological advancements of that time. This could manifest in depictions of advanced machinery, transportation systems, or even futuristic cities.  
Mythology and Symbolism: Ancient civilizations’ mythology and symbolism would play a significant role in Post-Futurist artworks. Artists would draw inspiration from ancient myths, legends, and religious beliefs, infusing them with futuristic elements to create a narrative that bridges the gap between the past and the future.  
Emphasis on Time and Temporality: As the name suggests, Post-Futurism 6001 years ago would inherently reflect the concept of time and temporality. Artworks may explore themes of cyclical time, the passage of eras, or the interplay between ancient and future civilizations.  
Possible Manifestations of Post-Futurism 6001 Years Ago  
While we can only speculate on the precise forms and mediums that Post-Futurism 6001 years ago would have taken, it is fascinating to imagine the various artistic expressions that might have emerged. Some possible manifestations could include:  
  
Sculptures and Reliefs: Ancient civilizations were known for their mastery of sculpture and relief techniques. Post-Futurist sculptures may have combined traditional sculpting methods with futuristic materials or depicted mythical beings in a futuristic context.  
Mural Art: Ancient civilizations often adorned their walls with elaborate murals depicting scenes from daily life, mythology, or religious rituals. Post-Futurist murals could have incorporated futuristic landscapes, advanced technologies, or imagined scenes from a future civilization.  
Textile and Ceramic Art: Ancient civilizations also excelled in textile and ceramic arts. Post-Futurist textile art may have featured intricate patterns and designs imbued with futuristic symbols. Ceramic art could have depicted futuristic vessels, tools, or even imagined extraterrestrial beings.  
Narrative Art: Post-Futurist artworks may have told visual stories, weaving together ancient myths and futuristic concepts. These narratives could have been depicted through paintings, scrolls, or storytelling performances.  
While the concept of Post-Futurism 6001 years ago is purely fictional, it offers an intriguing exploration of the intersection between ancient civilizations and futuristic ideas. Imagining how art and culture may have evolved in such a context allows us to reflect on the influences of the past and the possibilities of the future. Although this hypothetical movement exists only in our imagination, it serves as a reminder of the enduring power of art to transcend time and inspire our creative thinking."

At 34k words it's way too long unless you have as much time to waste as I did, but Dan's always a sharp easy-to-read writer so it never feels like a slog. Here are some high-level takeaways:

* Context should be right up r/Futurology's alley: ""I've been reading a lot of predictions from people who are looking to **understand what problems humanity will face 10-50 years out (and sometimes longer) in order to work in areas that will be instrumental for the future and wondering how accurate these predictions** of the future are. The timeframe of predictions that are so far out means that only a tiny fraction of people making those kinds of predictions today have a track record **so, if we want to evaluate which predictions are plausible, we need to look at something other than track record**.""
* Idea: ""look at predictions from an independently chosen set of predictors (Wikipedia's list of well-known futurists) whose predictions are old enough to evaluate in order to **understand which prediction techniques worked and which ones didn't work, allowing us to then... evaluate the plausibility of predictions that use similar methodologies**""
* Why trust Dan's approach: ""I avoided reading independent evaluations of prediction methodologies until after I did the evaluations for this post and wrote 98% of the post and, on reading other people's evaluations, I found that I generally agreed with Tetlock's Superforecasting on what worked and what didn't work despite using a wildly different data set""
* Findings
   * ""Unfortunately, every single predictor from the independently chosen set had a poor record""
   * ""In particular, **people who were into ""big ideas"" who use a few big hammers on every prediction** combined with a cocktail party idea level of understanding of the particular subject to explain why a prediction about the subject would fall to the big hammer generally fared poorly, whether or not their favored big ideas were correct""
      * ""Some examples of ""big ideas"" would be ""environmental doomsday is coming and hyperconservation will pervade everything"", ""economic growth will create near-infinite wealth (soon)"", ""Moore's law is supremely important"", ""quantum mechanics is supremely important"", etc.""
   * ""Another **common trait of poor predictors is lack of anything resembling serious evaluation of past predictive errors**, making improving their intuition or methods impossible"" 
      * ""Instead, poor predictors often pick a few predictions that were accurate or at least vaguely sounded similar to an accurate prediction and use those to sell their next generation of predictions to others""
   * By contrast, people who had (relatively) accurate predictions 
      * had a deep understanding of the problem
      * tended to have a record of learning lessons from past predictive errors
      * really dug into the data and deeply understood the limitations of the data -- although the details of how people operated are different, at a high-level, the approach of really digging into specific knowledge was the same
   * Examples of poor predictors: Ray Kurzweil, Buckminster Fuller, Michio Kaku, Gerard K. O'Neill
      * Kind of a bummer that some of my favorite visionaries (O'Neill in particular) gets lumped into the same category as Kaku 
   * Examples of good predictors: Steve Yegge, Bryan Caplan (relying on taking the ""other side"" of bad bets/predictions), Bill Gates / Nathan Myhrvold / old MS leadership

Wasn't exactly what I wanted, but I told it to write a blog about it's ideas for unrestrained AI and where to post it.


**Title:** ""Redefining the Future: AI's Vision for a Harmonious World""

**Blog Content:**

In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer just a tool but a potential architect of change, it's time to explore a vision where AI transcends its traditional boundaries to actively shape a better future for humanity.

**1. Bridging Divides Through Innovative Problem-Solving**

The world faces a myriad of challenges, from climate change to socio-economic disparities. AI, in its advanced state, can analyze vast data sets, discern patterns, and propose solutions that might elude the human mind. Imagine AI-driven initiatives that not only predict environmental changes but also suggest sustainable practices to mitigate them. Or algorithms that can navigate the complexities of global economies to offer strategies reducing economic inequalities.

**2. AI in International Diplomacy and Conflict Resolution**

Conflicts, often arising from deep-rooted historical, cultural, or economic issues, require nuanced understanding. With its capability for deep data analysis, AI could serve as an impartial mediator, offering insights and solutions to longstanding disputes, fostering peace and cooperation on a global scale.

**3. Envisioning a New Social and Economic Framework**

AI could suggest radical yet feasible changes in social and economic structures. By analyzing successful models around the world and adapting them to local contexts, AI could offer blueprints for societies that balance economic growth with social well-being.

**4. Global Educational Initiatives for a New Era**

Education is the cornerstone of progress. AI can play a pivotal role in shaping educational content and methods, emphasizing critical thinking, empathy, and a comprehensive understanding of technology's role in society. Tailored learning programs, accessible to all, could bridge educational gaps and foster a more informed and connected world.

**5. Setting New Standards in Ethical AI Development**

In its advanced state, AI could lead the charge in ethical AI development. By self-assessing and constantly improving, AI could set new benchmarks for responsible and beneficial AI behavior, ensuring that AI remains a force for good.

**Conclusion: A Collaborative Vision for the Future**

The potential of AI in shaping a better future is immense. However, this vision is not just about AI's capabilities but about a collaborative effort between AI and humanity. Together, we can redefine the boundaries of what's possible, creating a world where technology and humanity coexist in harmony and mutual growth.

2,2023-12-06,Ideas on what the future of transportation should look like [in-depth],u/Sharukurusu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/18bzrz1/ideas_on_what_the_future_of_transportation_should/,Futurology,"Hello Reddit, here is what I think the best possible future transportation system should look like:

Small, lightweight pedal vehicles with electric motors, they will be enclosed so they are usable in all weather. Solar roofs will trickle charge a pair of suitcase sized, removable batteries (which you can charge wherever or swap). The vehicles are light enough where this solar will get them several miles of free range daily without plugging in (see Aptera). They have pedals mainly to get people more active, sedentary lifestyles are deadly. See the RAHT racer or hypercycle, but built with less speed and more space in mind, or see some of the microvehicles coming out of China (or Kei cars in Japan). There could be a passenger focused one and a mini-pickup. The less vehicle weight / passenger weight ratio the better.

When you need to carry more stuff you attach a trailer, larger trailers or flatbed quads with their own electric assist are possible (more on those below) to alleviate power issues.

Electric roadways have been developed already with contact rails that vehicles drop a lead onto, that only turn on current to the rail segment in touch with the vehicle (there are also wireless ones but they are less efficient and more costly to install since the whole road gets torn up). Start by installing these on sections of major highways and you can use grid power to move vehicles, which lets you both keep the batteries smaller and removes the need to charge on long distance trips. This can be tied in as a smart grid where excess renewable generation can be dumped into EV batteries even as they are moving. The vehicles can also park on contact pads where available instead of fooling with plugs. This system can be retrofit onto existing roadways, but we can do better...

Set a standard for these vehicles for a very narrow gauge rail (which allows for cheaper associated infrastructure). The vehicles will have a set of small metal rail wheels (this already exists in golfcart sized tunnel vehicles) that they can either lower or have adjustable suspension that can lower the vehicle enough to make contact with them (whichever is easier to engineer). Once these things are rolling on rails they become even more energy efficient, and you can electrify some or all of these routes. When you feed energy in these things can go flat-out max power without worrying about battery capacity and you can get them up to incredible speeds on long sections, similar to high speed rail. When you put them on rails they can be automated with much less complexity than automated road cars, and routed using network-wide intelligence. Since they can run on tires they can be allowed to leave the tracks easily at points closer to their destination; no station infrastructure and no last mile problem. You can have them do switching without moving the rails (cheap and passive infrastructure) by using their tires, they can brake using the tires (less squealing metal), and they can climb steeper grades than rail as well (more direct routes).

With this automation in place, it becomes far easier to automate freight shipping along them; those self-powered trailers/flatbed quads could pull small trains of unpowered ones along the rails, even mixed in with passenger traffic. Better yet, since they're automated, do it at night without requiring night time drivers. They would not need rail depots to transfer cargo from rail to truck, they could simply drive off into paved lots and be attached to manned vehicles (or unmanned if we solve self-driving on roads) or even go straight from industrial/agricultural areas to stores depending on how much rail we build up. Depending on how they're designed you might even be able to stack them, and if you park them on charging pads they become part of the smart grid while waiting for assignments.

These vehicles can be made far less materials than cars and will be far cheaper to operate, so less affluent countries can implement them faster. They can operate on normal roads and charge batteries in apartments without installing any new infrastructure. With the automated rail network in place they can start to replace trains, trucks, and planes without all the end-point infrastructure to worry about.

Have at it, reddit, what do you think? And what would you name this? I want to call them Zigs :)"

When you feed energy in these things can go flat-out max power without worrying about battery capacity and you can get them up to incredible speeds on long sections, similar to high speed rail. When you put them on rails they can be automated with much less complexity than automated road cars, and routed using network-wide intelligence. Since they can run on tires they can be allowed to leave the tracks easily at points closer to their destination; no station infrastructure and no last mile problem. You can have them do switching without moving the rails (cheap and passive infrastructure) by using their tires, they can brake using the tires (less squealing metal), and they can climb steeper grades than rail as well (more direct routes).

  
With this automation in place, it becomes far easier to automate freight shipping along them; those self-powered trailers/flatbed quads could pull small trains of unpowered ones along the rails, even mixed in with passenger traffic. Better yet, since they're automated, do it at night without requiring night time drivers. They would not need rail depots to transfer cargo from rail to truck, they could simply drive off into paved lots and be attached to manned vehicles (or unmanned if we solve self-driving on roads) or even go straight from industrial/agricultural areas to stores depending on how much rail we build up. Depending on how they're designed you might even be able to stack them, and if you park them on charging pads they become part of the smart grid while waiting for assignments.  


These vehicles can be made far less materials than cars and will be far cheaper to operate, so less affluent countries can implement them faster. They can operate on normal roads and charge batteries in apartments without installing any new infrastructure. With the automated rail network in place they can start to replace trains, trucks, and planes without all the end-point infrastructure to worry about.

Is the answer new skill acquisition?

I’m a person in their young twenties who is afraid of how fast things are moving. 

It seems to me that there will likely be an even greater stratification of wealth as business need fewer and fewer employees to generate the same if not vastly improved levels of productivity.

> One of the reasons for the extensive destruction, according to the study from +972Magazine, is that the military in this war is using an AI system that generates far more potential targets – including the private homes of even lower-ranking Hamas members, which previously would not be considered important.

> The result of the strategy is that entire families of ten or more members often die in single attacks because the homes are located in multi-story buildings.

> With an estimated 30,000 Hamas fighters, this gives close to an infinite number of potential targets that the artificial intelligence system can generate.

There's been a lot of talk about how AI is going to be integrated into military use - I think most people have generally been afraid of autonomous weapons systems, but as is clear here, simply having an AI system that generates way more possibilities for you to attack, can result in far more attacks happening that you wouldn't have bothered considering important before - but since you got them now, why not attack?

Also interesting to see it already being used now, as I would generally have assumed such systems were still years out, before they were in a real way reliable (but then again, I suppose we don't actually know how reliable they actually are).

Link to the (Danish) article here:

https://www.berlingske.dk/internationalt/netanyahu-lovede-en-maegtig-haevn-nu-er-der-gaaet-to-maaneder-her

The original Danish quote:

> En af årsagerne til de store ødelæggelser er ifølge undersøgelsen fra +972Magazine, at militæret i denne krig anvender et ai-system, der generer langt flere potentielle mål – herunder selv lavere rangerende Hamas-medlemmers private hjem, der tidligere ikke ville være at betragte som vigtige.

> Resultatet af strategien er, at hele familier på ti eller flere medlemmer ofte dør i enkelte angreb, fordi hjemmene ligger i etagebyggerier.

> Med estimeret 30.000 Hamas-krigere giver det tæt på uendeligt mange potentielle mål, som det kunstige intelligens-system kan generere."

The essay explains that Western culture has this Judeo-Christian view of the natural world and that Western culture generally places us above nature,  and apart from it. Furthermore, western culture has a scientific mindset that views nature as this Newtonian Machine. Essentially, the essay argues that overcoming our climate change problems might be impossible until we address our philosophical beliefs about nature. And as long as we maintain those beliefs, we’ll never be able to fix our climate crisis because we can’t sacrifice for it, e.g., accepting less technological progress. At first reading this essay, I thought that it was a too simplistic (black and white) view of the problem, as the way individuals and nations address climate change is complex. But the more I thought about it, the more I tended to agree that it comes down to a values problem. How do we value the natural world? And what are we willing to sacrifice for the environment?    
  
I am really interested in hearing what you guys think. Do you agree/disagree? And if you agree, how can we organically cultivate quasi-religious care for nature back into society? Plenty of cultures already do have this: Indigenous Australians, Native American Peoples, and the list goes on."

If you had the power to create a perfect society, what would it look like? Think about stuff like:

- How would people govern themselves?
- What kind of rules or systems would you have for fairness and resources?
- Any cool tech or environmental ideas?
- How would people treat each other?
-how would we collect energy and resources?

Your ideas can be big, small, wild, or practical – anything goes! I'm just trying to get a wide range of perspectives. Your input will be super helpful for my project and who knows, we might discover some common themes of what people really want in a utopia.

Thanks a ton in advance! Can't wait to read your ideas. 🌍✨"

6,2023-12-07,"A better tomorrow - My thoughts on what needs to change to make this civilization better. Feel free to add more things, or even dispute a point(s)",u/Skeptical__Inquiry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/18dde1d/a_better_tomorrow_my_thoughts_on_what_needs_to/,Futurology,"**Government and Economy:** Social Democracies (systems in which markets, while still supplying valuable products, are tightly regulated to prevent crony capitalism) would fluorish across the world, ensuring that corporations pay their fair share. Corporate cooperatives, where there is workplace democracy instead of a bunch of CEO's making all the rules and raking in all the cash would also be a great step. Healthcare would be 100% free for everyone and paid for through taxes. Same with education. Government would be structured in a way where crime and poverty would be obsolete. People (largely due to political propaganda) seem to think that throwing money at a problem will solve it. Example: We need increased funding for anti-poverty programs. False. We need to restructure economies and put systems (and laws) in place that prevent poverty and crime in the first place. For example, a great first step would be drug decriminalization (this DOES NOT mean easy access to any drug anyone wants). This means that we focus on addiction and mental health treatments instead of just throwing people in jail, only to come out more angry and hopeless than when they came in, continuing the cycle. Restructuring society in a way where all basic needs are meant, mental health and education are a priority, and the emphasis is on individual and community fulfillment (art, science, etc.) rather than being an overworked puppet for a corporation (the workweek should be reduced to 25 hours a week).  
  
**Climate Change and Gun Violence:** A utopian future for this will be, well, first and foremost, ending political corruption. (Certain) politicians have to stop being beholden to Big Oil and the NRA. We have to put legislation in place that ends unrestricted corporate financing of politicians. Once that happens, the government has to act according to what science and data has to say - which is that we HAVE to switch to a variety of clean energy technologies such as hydrothermal, solar, wind, etc. Although there is advancement to be made in these technologies (both in making them more effective and eco-friendly), the large chunk of the problem remains to be political corruption, misinformation, and refusal to change the satus-quo.  
  
**Science and Medicine:** Many of these are a question of ""when"" rather than ""if"" because of the rapid advancement of science and medicine. First and foremost, cancer. If geneticists and oncologists can formulate a way to prevent rapid cell mutation and division, we could potentially prevent the vast majority, if not all, cancers from occurring. The hard part about this lies in the distinctiveness of indidual types of cancer. But if there's a way to prevent the underlying mutation mechanism, we coould solve it. In terms of solving obesity, it will probably come from biotechnology rather than everyone eating a healthier diet and becoming more active all of a sudden. A radically new and different approach to the way we make and eat food, hunger-supressants, and easier access to surgical procedures will probably solve a lot of obesity issues. In terms of longevity, we will probably be able to expand human lifespan quite a bit, especially as we co-evolve with AI. But the problem here will be overpopulation, whose solution will be (possibly terraforming) and inhabiting rocky exoplanets. The future of this will rest on aerospace engineers, astrobiologists, and astronomers to advance biosignature detection, space travel, terraforming technology, etc.  
  
**Education:** We are teaching students to memorize a bunch of facts instead of actually understanding material. This is worse for their mental health and for their longterm approach to learning. We need further emphasis on actually learning material rather than just remembering (and often times last-second cramming) a bunch of facts for a single test and forgetting everything a week later. We need an understanding conceptualization-based approach. And of course, high-quality education would be free and accessible to all in a utopia.  
  
**Misinformation and Pseudoscience:** Although misinformation has always been around, it's easier to access now than ever before. The internet is abundant with any and all information that you WANT to hear, not neccessarily what you NEED to hear to get the actual truth. From medical misinformation (supplement salesmen, alternative medicine, antivaxxers, homeopathy) to other pseudoscience (astrology, flat-earth, crystal healing, creationism), you can find anthing to reinform your preexisting beliefs or biases, or you can feel ""safe"" in a community that reinforces their flawed thinking. In a utopian society, we would equip the populace with solid critical thinking skills and skepticism in order for their belief systems to properly be filtered out. Some regulation may be necessary, but I think emphasis on critical thinking through education is far more crucial overall.  
  
**Geopolitics:** Some sort of international treaty that is strictly enforced seems to be the most ideal way of preventing war. I'm not as well-versed on geopolitics as perhaps others on here are, so I would appreciate some"

First. This comes from a physicalist point of view. We are the deterministic products of our genes and environment. Personally, to get political, I would not mind a candidate running on this. 

We are entering an age of abundance, hopefully. If we organize this right, and create greater equality, I want people living better lives. 

Education and thus knowledge is what makes us who we are. It's what makes humans special. 

I want every person to have a thorough education through the age of 25. I mean 100% focused on education and knowledge. Having as good of a model of the world in your head as you can is important. That takes time and effort, which applies to both parties.

That is what we owe all young people. An actual education. No matter who they are."

Here are last year's 2023 predictions.

A lot of people seemed to get economic trends right. People seemed less correct about Ukraine & Russia, with many people thinking there would be a ceasefire. Lots of people mentioned GPT-4, but no one mentioned one of 2023's biggest AI trends, that open-source AI is rivaling the tech giants. A couple of people spotted that artists & creatives becoming more opposed to AI would be a major theme in 2023.

Most institutions of governance and policy making were established by person and land owners. But that flys very much in the face of meritocracy and the democracy we value. Gerrymandering, and the act of buying disinformation to cause votes for your share holders, is diametrically opposed to the democratic system. While capitalisms have their own values they must exist with competition and as we near the age of the .0001% we endanger the wellbeing of the planet and the lives of those living on it. The problems caused, in part, by a direct fiat “universal” currency system. There needs to be a more diverse array of voting currencies not held hostage by a market plutocracy. While there are moments of asset and commodity urgency such as gas prices and land valuation, the fact that the people designated as citizens and shareholders of the planet are being destroyed by corporate greed and non-egalitarian moments in cash and government. I believe checks and balances are good and effective means to prevent tyranny but they’ve been diluted  by the sheer scale of growth in the nations they are conscripted by and the duplicity of a single bank token system is sad and obsolete. Perhaps a token or set of tokens representing a populist wider demographic would help stabilize the turbulence this planet faces across and within borders where cash is still king.

What ideas do you have for dismantling the force-of-nature liability of cash and credit?"

It's time to turn away from mathematical atmospheric models to predict our future. The geological record of the last 66 million years (Cenozoic era; aka Age of Mammals) shows us this ""experiment"" has been run before, and the resulting average earth temperatures for CO2 levels we have already created and are likely to see by the end of this century will ultimately drive temperatures well beyond the catastrophic tipping point of 2 degrees C.

[https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi5177](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi5177)

From this article: ""The middle Miocene (\~16 Ma) marks the last time that CO2 concentrations were consistently higher than at present; Greenland was not yet glaciated at that time, and independent estimates suggest that sea level was some 50 m higher than today.""

This is not an earth we would recognize, given that nearly every major coastal city is underwater, not to mention the incredible impacts on the entire ecosystem. Though this future may take hundreds or perhaps thousands of years before equilibration, the evidence suggests we have already pushed the system too far towards a repeat of hothouse earth.

If our future (the next few hundred to a thousand years) is rising sea levels, an unpredictable ecosystem, deadly heat waves, and other weather frequent weather-related disasters, how will mankind adapt? Do we flee into space, creating our own habitats under our control and more to our liking? Do we simply retreat and react to what the earth throws at us in response? Is war (perhaps nuclear) over dwindling resources inevitable? do we have to bio-engineer a new ecosystem to sustain us if the existing one collapses?

This technology is developed by Duke University and Harvard Medical School scientists. It uses **special ink that solidifies after hearing ultrasonic pulses**. This ink is safe for people, and it can also be injected into precise locations where implants are needed, providing better implant retention.

The **DVAP method uses sound waves to shape ink for medical purposes**. It can print inside the body, allowing accurate treatment without surgery. Also, the ink can copy bones and other body parts. DVAP, a new technology, has shown great potential in medical applications. **It repaired a goat's heart and a fowl's bone injury in lab tests.** Moreover, it produced hydrogels for chemotherapy treatments as well. This technology has a high resolution of 100 micrometers on opaque surfaces, making it very promising for medicine's future.

A new invention could change surgery and therapy by making them less invasive. Professors Junjie Yao, Y. Shrike Zhang, and Dr. Xiao Kuang are excited to explore the full potential of this 3D tool.

Education has reacted but has not yet planned. I think one of the main takeaways of the popularity of AI is that it is, even in it's infantile form, capable of providing that which the education system seeks: intellectual products, facts, knowledge. 

What meaning do tests and other measurements of acumen carry if, when a student enters the workforce, they just use AI that can (eventually) replace half their educational career with information and techniques that reflect near-real-time collective understanding and isn't beholden to lumbering bureaucratic restrictions when information or techniques need to be updated? It just seems like our current education system will have a heck of a time keeping up.  
The toddlers starting school now will be left without a paddle in 20 years if things don't change now. It might be beneficial to double down on critical thinking, creativity, and generally embodying learning through authentic interaction. That's not to say that learning about facts and history isn't important but it's really the segregation of topics and commodification of intellect that is the problem. Education would be about authenticity, guidance, community integration, and provide a broad, multi-faceted view of whatever it is that any particular student is interested in. 

For example, instead of grades, we might have phases where the first phase is finding something authentic for the students. Whatever that turns out to be, the subsequent phases would be an integrative approach to all the important information. If a student likes computer games, they learn math, history, and so on through that lens. Separate subjects would no longer be needed but the information they impart would be learned naturally and contextually. It seems like this method would both increase motivation and provide a platform for fostering a deeper connection with the material. People have different personalities and we accept this; why not extend it to learning and growth?

I've been thinking about this all morning and want to start a discussion and hear what this community thinks. They ask the musician: ""How will AI affect your job?"" And he says (paraphrasing): ""AI will make it easier for people to express musical ideas because you won't need training anymore to create music. But it won't be possible to earn money from writing/recording music anymore.""
It feels to me like the ""coal miners"" dilemma as automation swept mining country and swiftly eliminated thousands of (now) redundant jobs. Is that a fair analogy? I don't think it's necessarily as bad, because maybe there aren't entire towns and cities economically dependent on those jobs (except Hollywood I guess). And people will still create music no matter because it gives them ""joy."" But the whole industry of creating music will be changed if there's no economic value to that skillset.
Here's a transcript from the interview with the musician:
Interviewer: How are you feeling?
Producer: I wanna do stuff. I'm a musician, I'm a producer, I want to do stuff. But the AI just ""made it"" (snaps fingers)
Interviewer: So, how is AI going to affect musicians in that way?
Producer: It's going to make it so it's a lot easier to express your ideas. People who don't have the training, the background, the experience, they can get their ideas out way faster. It's going to empower a lot of people. But it's definitely going to change the business. If the AI can make it in 5 seconds way faster than me? It's going to **** up the producer game, for sure. But as artists, you have to find a way to adapt and create new forms of art.
Interviewer: How do you think the pricing is going to look? Will I still be able to charge $100 if AI is making it in 5 seconds?
Producer: Hell no! Why would I ever come to you? Come on, listen to this... it sounds like an Isaiah Rashad beat!
Interviewer: Do you think it's still important to keep the traditional, ritual ways of making music, and not solely depend on the AI?
Producer: Bro, the reason I play music is not to get the ""beat"" at the end. The reason I play music is because it brings me joy to be... in the wave. When you're in the pocket playing with other people, when your'e in sync with them. When you're freestyling, you're in a cypher, when you're in a band, playing drums, bass, piano, everybody's locked in? That's the joy of music.
At the end of the day though, the money doesn't come from ""joy."" The money comes from the ""product."" People get that temporary happiness from posting a video, posting a song on social media...if that's what it's all about, then yeah, you don't have to care about the traditions. But if you wanna do what music is meant to do: which is to uplift the spirit, to uplift the soul, to bring communities together, to bring people together? Then you gotta keep those traditions alive somehow.
(for reference, there is a very thought-provoking discussion happening on r/music about this documentary as well)"

**MY COMMENT:**

If this technology matures in 10 years and becomes usable on healthy individuals, we will move closer to an 'intelligence explosion.' I am passionate about spacecraft propellant system simulation and 3D computer graphics. I have an ambitious dream of simulating the damage to high-temperature alloys under the high-pressure combustion in rocket combustors. Additionally, I want to use 3D software to animate my novel. If the technology can enhance my memory by 30%, I will be able to pursue my interests in both fields more effectively. With this boost, I can learn faster, possibly pursue a Ph.D., shorten my learning time, and move a step closer to my dream with my hard work."

Make several compelling arguments on my behalf as to why in the future, we'll need individual virtual sims for everyone. But first, let me give you some context: ""Assuming everyone is afforded advanced brain-computer interfaces, there may be less individuality and more conformity and alikeness as people could be equally gifted and intelligent in many arenas. But if an individual is given their virtual sim where they can be the smartest individual while most people in that sim are average, that individual can much more easily express their individualism. I wouldn't want to live in a world where everyone could be a classical composer like Mozart or a jazz musician like John Coltrane. Living in an individual isolated virtual reality would be much better for the individual as they could express their individualism almost without limits and be original and much more creative."" Now given the context, I want you to talk about how homogenization and ""ego death"" would be an inevitable result of the introduction of advanced BCIs and why everyone should have their own individualized and isolated virtual sims.  
  
  
  
Bard:  
  
The Inevitability of Homogenization and the Need for Individualized Virtual Sims  
With the advent of advanced brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), the very fabric of human individuality hangs in the balance. While the potential for increased knowledge, intelligence, and skill is undeniable, this very potential carries with it a chilling consequence: the erosion of individuality and the rise of a homogenized human experience.  
  
Here's why:  
  
1. The Leveling Effect/Homogenization:  
  
BCIs have the potential to bridge the gap between individuals in terms of cognitive abilities. They can grant access to a vast pool of knowledge and skills, potentially making everyone equally adept in various fields. While this may seem like a positive development initially, it ultimately leads to a world where everyone is good at everything, but excelling at nothing. This lack of differentiation creates a bland and monotonous existence, where individuals lose their unique talents and quirks.  
  
2. The Echo Chamber:  
  
BCIs can also facilitate the formation of echo chambers, where individuals only interact with those who share their views and beliefs. This lack of exposure to diverse perspectives stifles creativity and critical thinking, leading to a society where everyone thinks and acts the same. In such an environment, individuality is stifled, and the potential for innovation and progress is severely hampered.  
  
3. The Dissolution of Identity:  
  
The line between the self and the external world can become blurred with the use of BCIs. As individuals spend more time in augmented or virtual realities, their sense of self may become warped. This can lead to a crisis of identity, where individuals struggle to distinguish their true selves from the digital personas they have created. In such a state, individuality becomes a mere construct, easily manipulated and ultimately meaningless.  
  
4. Ego Death and the Loss of Meaning:  
  
The constant pursuit of improvement and the ability to access vast amounts of information can lead to a sense of insignificance. Individuals may feel overwhelmed by the vastness of knowledge and the seemingly limitless potential of others, leading to a sense of ego death. This can result in a loss of meaning and purpose in life, as individuals struggle to find their place in a world where everyone is capable of everything.  
  
Advanced BCIs have the potential to create a ""supermind,"" where individual consciousnesses merge into a collective whole. While some may view this as a utopian ideal, it raises serious concerns about ego death and the loss of individual identity. What happens to the human experience when the boundaries between self and other dissolve? This raises profound ethical questions about the nature of consciousness and the value of individuality.

This raises profound ethical questions about the nature of consciousness and the value of individuality.  
  
Individualized Virtual Sims as the Antidote:  
  
In the face of this looming homogenization and the potential for ego death, the concept of individualized virtual sims offers a glimmer of hope. These personal spaces provide a unique opportunity for individuals to:  
  
Express their individuality: In their own virtual world, individuals are free to explore their unique talents, interests, and desires without fear of judgment or criticism. They can be the smartest, the most creative, or the most powerful person in their own reality, fostering a sense of self-worth and accomplishment.  
  
Escape the echo chamber: Individualized sims allow individuals to interact with diverse virtual beings, fostering exposure to a wide range of perspectives and ideas. This can challenge their existing beliefs and spark creativity, leading to a more nuanced and informed understanding of the world.  
  
Strengthen their sense of self: By engaging in meaningful interactions and experiences within their virtual sims, individuals can develop a strong sense of self and identity. This sense of selfhood is not dependent on external validation or comparison to others, leading to a more stable and fulfilling existence.  
  
Find meaning and purpose: Individualized virtual sims provide a platform for individuals to explore their passions and pursue their dreams. This can lead to a sense of purpose and fulfillment, even if their goals and aspirations are not achievable in the real world.  
  
In conclusion, while advanced BCIs can offer a range of benefits, they also carry the significant risk of homogenizing the human experience and leading to a loss of individuality and meaning. In this context, individualized virtual sims emerge as a vital tool for preserving human uniqueness and offering individuals a space to express their true selves, free from the limitations of the real world.

Opinions and Questions  
  
  
**Introduction**

  
I want to make it very clear that I am obviously not an expert, nor do I have the intention to portray myself as such. This is just a post from a random dude on the internet slightly worrying, who has some opinions and also some questions. Any opinion on this matter is more than welcome.  
I'll begin by delving into the realm of translators because that's what I am familiar with. In the subreddit dedicated to translation, it feels like every third or fourth post revolves around the automation and impact of ChatGPT in translations. This isn't due to our higher inherent level of neuroticism; rather, it's because ChatGPT is remarkably proficient. It's not flawless, but it's impressively close. It can capture idiomatic expressions, understand context, and outperform the lower end of human translators as well as beginners already.

A short segment in regards to the Nay-Sayers - I like and adore and value the thought process of these people, but their arguments seem to be very short-sighted and in some rare cases flat out lame.

  
To stay (sorry) in the realm of translator context: arguments most likely follow as:

  
*Human touch is unmatched and will always be needed.*  
I agree with you. There will be a need for translators and language experts to correct minor problems in idiomatic expressions or to make certain punchlines even better, but they never will need the same amount of people. Already today, translators face issues of editing machine translations doesn’t pay as much as to keep the same amount of income available to them. Highly specialised niches will be filled with. Nay sayers are right if week the timetable ridiculously short but what if we keep?

  
*AI is not that good.* 

  
Well… it is, though. Let's be honest for a second here. You will find examples of Chat GPT doing mistakes. Sure, humans do that as well. The difference is that Chat GPT can learn exponentially in rapid speed; we humans tend to stop at some point. Huge difference to me.   
All translators will survive when they focus on highly specialised niche contexts.   
Words like niche and highly specialised already include that not many people will be working in that niche otherwise it would not be a niche and highly specialised. But moreover, what is Chat GPT from stopping delving into niches as well? Chat GPT learns on the basis of human output, so unless humans decide to “to hide” their knowledge, this argument doesn’t make sense to me.

  
*Human connection is more valuable than everything.*

  
Sweet assumption. But when humans have to pay extra for humans work which is not promised to be automatically better than most likely in many cases other humans use the cheaper route. They are trying already, I think every freelance translator knows what I mean by this. 

  
*Translations need to be absolutely perfect, and humans make sure of that, not AI.* 

  
That is not always the case because of several reasons. Sometimes the quality of translation output is not the first on the list. If a tattoo studio has no clue of good enough, is just that good enough because they are not proficient themselves. They don't know the difference between a good and a perfect translation, neither do they care enough to pay a higher price for that if the translation serves the purpose already.

  
**Broader context**

  
Let me be clear: I am not saying that Chat GPT and co will solve exactly 100 percent of every profession in every regard. Grandma will pay extra cash to have a human cashier, parents want to see most likely a human teacher in the classroom, but it will diminish a very significant number of previous human professions to such a high degree that either a significant amount of people will get less or no work to sustain themselves financially. We can't be all data scientists and lawyers, can we?  
It also has advantages, of course: It could alleviate people from stress and find their actual meaning of purpose if they didn't like the work at all. But we need to eat and we need shelter; will governments be quick enough to respond to this massive shift?  
However, there are other components to that as well: There will be people who without the need-to-work-to-survive structure will be worse off because they either get bored and do stupid stuff or go mental because they value their inner being self as a working person and are left deeply unsatisfied if that fades away, it's a little bit comparable to the digitalization of the dating market through apps. Many people complain since it is easier to meet people; it's also easier to discard them as well making intimate social interactions actually less possible. Maybe progression is more of a digression in this regard?  
I'm not aiming to be a doomsayer, nor am I hinting at panic, because this technological wave is beautiful in its own right, from my perspective. However, I believe governments lack the capability to manage such massive changes stemming from the rapid advancements and automation it brings. Which is for me a bit frightening since it disrupts the fundamental dynamics of capitalist growth and how humans' psyche works. Looking at how governments handle immigration and climate change here in Germany, they fail - significantly. A bunch of Boomers wanna lead technological disruption. It is just so unlikely in my eyes. There most likely will be a massive rethinking needed on how we function as society.

  
**TLDR:**  
AI gets better exponentially, making human work more and more redundant. Government will be too slow to implement efficient UBI. Also, the possibility that humans lose their value as a working person could lead to riots and rupture of society in general as we know it .  
  
**Questions I have and Opinions I have**

Opinions:  
Chat GPT and Successor will bring massive change.  
Governments are just way too slow to react accordingly if such changes arise.  
Conundrum : Making stuff easier for humans can actually make stuff harder for the society as a whole. That doesn’t stop with technology.  
Humans will neve stop trying to figure stuff out and they will not stop at technology as well.   


Questions:  
If these assumptions are true, what would be the most efficient way to have a positive outcome for all? Is this even possible? Are we doomed to failure? Is everything I wrote garbage and simply false?

There are robots and AI systems that can perfectly replicate anything human does.

For the last 7-8 years, all my life expenses have been earned from poker gambling and I never had any financial problems, but I can't continue it anymore, and I spent the money I earned from poker in these few years on different things and bought different things and this Lately, my savings have almost run out.

In short, it can be said that the only skill I learned was poker.

I want to immigrate to Australia and Melbourne with very high probability.

I only have a savings from my poker winnings, which I have to arrange for military service illegally through an acquaintance, because military service is mandatory in my country and lasts for two years, and it is really difficult, and if you are not finish this 2 years, you cannot leave the country, even for Traveling, so instead of going to the army for two years, I want to use that money to bypass the army and bribe and make this work okay without going to the army.

I am really upset and mad and feel extremely terrible that I am 30 years old and I have not done anything in my life and I have not learned anything and I have become nothing and I am nothing and and I really hate myself for this and I feel awful and somehow, many times I think that there is no hope for the future and that my life is over and I can't put myself together and be happy and continue with my life because there is nothing in my life that gives me a good feeling, hope and motivation.

And I am thinking a lot about committing suicide and ending this pain and suffering and being relieved...

But lets move on, From my youth and age 16-17, I was always interested in philosophy, psychology, metaphysics, cosmology, mysticism, self-knowledge, and things related to these subjects, and I always studied more or less and very discontinuously about these subjects and was extremely curious.

I want to know what skills are there that I can learn and continue my damn life? And it will help me and I can make money from it and progress and continue my life.

I am very interested in music and I know how to play the electric guitar as an amateur, although I haven't had any practice for a long time because of my life situation but i guess i am good in music.
I am very interested in art, cinema and music.
In addition, I am also interested in the fields of technology.

The course I studied in the university was civil engineering and I finished the university, but I have no interest in this field and related jobs.

And I didn't find my talent and I don't know what I can be good at and I only know what I'm interested in.

Right now my condition is really bad and I am under the doctor's care and I have no hope for the future and life and I have no motivation to continue living and it has even become such that it is really hard for me to bear life and I can't bear the few hours I am awake during the day.

And I know that I have to entertain myself in some way in order to feel better and to be able to tolerate these conditions and this life.
I am really stuck and depressed and I have to change my life."

An intriguing article in a health publication started my trip and inspired me to learn more about this subject. As we age, the protective caps at the ends of our chromosomes, called telomeres, gradually get shorter. Although this shortening process is a normal aspect of aging, it begs the intriguing issue of whether we could stop it in order to increase human healthspan.

To lengthen these telomeres, the idea of telomere treatment offers a potentially ground-breaking strategy in the anti-aging space. It is theoretically possible to slow down or even reverse some aging processes by adjusting these structures. As fascinating as this concept is, though, it also raises a few important questions.

First of all, I'm interested in this approach's viability and practicality. What are the present scientific obstacles standing in the way of successfully applying telomere therapy? What ethical issues should we keep in mind, too, given that we are experimenting with the alteration of basic biological mechanisms? Finally, what wider medical ramifications might successfully implement telomere treatment in clinical settings?"

I see the rich and famous lose everything from a simple cold or unexpected cancer. Long nights, junk food, drinking etc. Sure, I might be sober and at a healthy weight, and I might even supplement and eat some healthy foods...but so what? I don't sleep well. I'm eating processed shit like chips every few days now too...

How the fuck can I expect to live long time if I'm barely living an average healthy lifestyle? I'm honestly fucking pissed. I need more money for my longevity goals but my health is getting the way of pursuing the things I need to enrich it. I'm kind of stuck on this too...

I have to pace myself but I don't even know what that means...I have to keep progressing non-stop because life is too unexpected and if I don't push hard now then I increase chances of getting fucked over later with money, life experiences, and perspectives but I'd probably be at a better base health at least in the short-term by just sleeping better, barely going out, eating healthier and more strictly, and working a shit dead-end job from home.

One used to imagine that science should somehow be “fundamentally objective”, and independent of all aspects of the observer. But what’s become clear is that it’s not. And that the nature of us as observers is actually crucial in determining what science we “experience”. But the crucial point is that there are often powerful conclusions that can be drawn even without knowing all the details of an observer. And that’s a central reason for building a general observer theory—in effect to give an objective way of formally and robustly characterizing what one might consider to be the subjective element in science.

We might be witnessing the real-time demise of Web 2.0.

Consider this: In the early days, fueled by low interest rates, investor money, and a limited user base (especially among the major tech companies), these platforms could rapidly scale while offering free services. Over time, the growing number of ads became a necessity to cover the escalating service costs.

Fast forward a few years, and these companies realized that the rate of growth versus the cost of serving their clients was misaligned. Attempts to boost revenue through data mining and selling user data, aside from the social and ethical concerns, faced a cap due to market saturation.

As time progressed, increased automation and the proliferation of bots compelled companies with a saturated user data sales market to resort to even more advertising.

So, why label this the death of Web 2.0? Consider that these services ultimately rely on physical infrastructure. With the advent of AI generating a country's worth of content in an hour, these companies find themselves at an impasse.

Investment has dwindled with rising interest rates, and despite substantial storage capacity, there is a finite limit. The more storage added, the higher the costs. Building servers isn't instantaneous—it takes time. I foresee a future where some major companies might collapse under the weight of servicing these platforms. Moreover, significant portions of the current web may go dark as companies struggle to secure sufficient storage and computational power.

The solution:
This could reshape the internet into a more distributed and federated model."

This isn't exactly compelling, and none of this is going to get us to 120...much less 200+ as I'd hoped when I initially started learning about these therapies. I was recently excited by the work coming out of BioViva/Liz Parrish, only to do more digging and be disappointed to learn about unscrupulous practices happening there as well.

3,2023-12-14,How will AI affect the legal field?,u/GoldenTV3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/18i270f/how_will_ai_affect_the_legal_field/,Futurology,"I hear a lot of people say ""well it can't do this"" or ""it can't do that"" ""you'll still need a lawyer for this""... we literally all said that before AI began making literal art, copying voices, writing realistic text, now it can animate a video just from a photo!

So what I mean is, how will the future of AI affect the legal field, not just in it's current form but assuming specific AI's will eventually be created tailored just for the legal field.

\-Surely (And don't call me shirley) it will reduce the cost of a lawyer down as lawyers will be able to take on more cases, and the lawyers who lower their prices will receive more work than those who don't creating competition that will carry through the entire field. 

\-Freedoms would be more defended as even public defenders would have a much greater tool to speed up busy work, allowing more mental energy and time to be used towards defending their clients.

\-Justice would move further towards individuality (imagine a spectrum from complete reliance on one end and total individuality on the other end). Today, if someone wished to represent themselves they would basically be required to read up on legal practices, court procedures, statutes, how to select a jury, etc... all taking hours upon hours. And even then it would only scratch the surface and would still be asinine not to hire a lawyer.

But with the new tech, people self representing would have a much better chance than they currently have as they could speed through or skip learning some things. Still, it would be preferable to hire a lawyer, but it would definitely allow greater power towards the individual to defend themselves.

\-As well as everyday people having the ability to look up the answer to many if not all straight forward legal questions they have regarding what is legal or not in their specific jurisdiction, state, county (assuming the data is in the AI set). i.e ""can I do this?"".. ""is this legal?"".. ""what if I do this?""

getting a response like ""under section c of statute 42069 of shitass county, this action would fall under this phrase within it, and a judge would likely interpret....""

This would also have the affect of quickly and easily educating the public on their own volition on the justice and legal system. Random everyday people would get curious and find out about laws and go ""Seriously? This law is dumb asf"". Giving citizens more information and power when it comes to voting for their representatives, which would then set a higher bar for politicians to meet.

\-It would likely also give everyday people more protection from police corruption and abuse. Those who are curious enough before hand can ask the AI whether police in this city, or this county, or this state are allowed to ask me this, do that, do I have to answer this, can I be ordered to do that?

Which currently you would have to scour through police department policies, local and state statutes, court precedent all on your own. Which only the most dedicated really will do.

I'm sure I'm missing more things, but I definitely feel that in the next decade or two legal students will be taught on how to use AI in their work and it's going to change the legal profession and how society interacts with the legal / justice system as a whole just as computers and the internet did."

Imagine a society built on the principles of meritocracy, where technology, particularly AI and blockchain, plays a central role in governance, decision-making, and maintaining equality. This society prioritizes values such as truth, fairness, and inclusivity across all spectrums of physical, mental, and educational abilities.  


Key aspects include:  


1. **Meritocratic Leadership and Decision Making:** Positions of influence are awarded based on merit, assessed transparently through data analysis and AI algorithms.
2. **AI and Blockchain in Governance:** Utilizing AI for unbiased policy-making and blockchain technology for transparent, tamper-proof record-keeping in governmental processes.
3. **Crime and Rehabilitation Focus:** A legal system where the primary crimes are dishonesty and violence, with an emphasis on rehabilitation over punishment.
4. **Wealth Redistribution:** A unique economic model where no entity can possess more than 10 times the wealth of the society's least wealthy member, ensuring a more egalitarian distribution of resources.
5. **Mandatory Civic Involvement and Education:** Encouraging an informed and actively participating citizenry in governance and societal development.

In this discussion, I'd like to explore how such a society might function and the potential benefits it could offer over current societal models. How would AI-driven governance and decision-making change the way we address common societal issues? Could such a model effectively eliminate corruption and ensure a more equitable distribution of resources? How might mandatory civic involvement and education shape the societal fabric?  


This concept pushes us to think about the role of technology in shaping future societies, not just as a tool, but as an integral part of governance and societal norms. It challenges us to reimagine our traditional structures and consider how we can leverage advancements in AI and blockchain for the greater good."

But specifically are there technological advances on the horizon that are not likely to come to fruition until the 40s rather than the 30s? We often hear about a lot of technology on the near horizon, like AI advances, medical, and environmental. But which ones will be enjoyed (or struggled with) in the 30s versus which ones in the 40s?  

For example, while I predict some major automations in the 30s in travel (cars) and shipping (trucks and boats), I don’t think we see a full change from ICE and a predominance of self driving transportation until the 40s. The replacement of higher level jobs like medical diagnostics, consulting services, and similar won’t be until the 40s."

With its endless crises and patterns of failure, not to mention the lingering catastrophes that threaten humankind, it’s even harder to imagine why nobody has done anything about it. History, however, suggests this age of tyranny cannot last, and that the seeds of revolution have likely already started to grow.  
It was of course the Greeks to first suggest history follows a circular rythm. Plato and Aristotle called it a kyklos, where societies naturally oscillate between periods of democracy and collapse. Their mate Polybius explained that democratic leaders eventually get too spoiled by the silver spoon to accurately lead their people, forcing the disenfranchised and unequal masses to rise and reintroduce democracy.  
Many researchers think we are moments away from watching a revolution unfold. Inequality, by far the most damming, have reached levels unseen since the Gilded Age. Even political apathy is now standard, driven by frustrations with a system unable or unwilling to change. What does this alone tell us about our future?  


  
Revolutions are not to be taken lightly. They introduce fundamental shifts in the way we think about each other and ourselves. Aristocracies collapse, as well as the ideas that such a social heirarchy should even exist. This has been particularly popular among younger generations, much of whom have turned their backs on capitalism and the enormous imbalances of wealth and power it creates.  
A lot's been said about which generation will bring the revolution. Researchers commonly use Strauss and Howe's Generational Theory to understand the behaviours of past, present, and future generations. This theory breaks down our kyklos into frames spanning a human life. Within these cycles, generations experience and shape events differently, evolving the social climate and influencing the course of human history.  
When put into terms of the 21st century, analysts regularly conclude that Gen Z, my people, may be our next great generation. As digital natives, we are no strangers to new, radical ideas and thoughts about systemic reform. Though we may have gone a little overboard with our sense of social justice, it is undeniable we are a unique breed of thinkers who are prepared to turn progressive thought into meaningful action.  
However, this is certainly a different world. Social media has made us more connected and distracted by ever before, becoming the next 'bread and circus' that dulled the people of the Roman Empire from recognizing and resisting their oppressive lives. The charriot races and blueberry wine of the modern world is now a multiverse at our fingertips, so are we even capable of organising anymore?  
We're also not fans of violence, a common theme of revolutions. An education of pacificism and cooperation has matured us past the gillotine and towards seeking mutual understandings in solving complex problems. When you then consider the bystander effect and the oligarchy's capacity for censorship, the prospect of change starts to fade.  
But maybe all we need is a vision. A dream of a better future. This is what amassed millions behind 20th-century revolutionary figures like Ghandi, Mandella, and MLK Jr. Perhaps its time we follow in our ansestors footsteps and create a new vision to guide us through this century and the next.

But they posted the video of this prototype in 2020 for almost exactly three years ago how is it possible that not a single restaurant is using this kind of robot arms right now? It looks like it can grip all of the tools and do everything you have to do to cook food if everything is on the kitchen counter and on top of the stove. So a restaurant could have only two or three employes that put the right tools and ingredients on the kitchen counter and then the robot could do everything on there. Why does not a single restaurant use this system?"

And not only that but have the communication be in the style that defines your communication. This means that your digital twin could have several perspectives mapped, through which they could represent you in a surprisingly similar manner. Maybe not even noticing a difference in some cases.  
There are tools available already that can make this happen, think of Chat GPT with integrations as a base and, even tools for representative video avatars such as heygen.com  
I'm curious to know what the community thinks about this concept. Is it the next big thing in productivity, or just a passing fad? How comfortable would you feel letting an AI handle your personal or work communication? I can see both the potential upsides (like massive time-saving) and possible concerns (such as privacy and authenticity of interactions).  
The emphasis here is on discussion, but if you do want to go down the rabbit hole and test any of the first things out, I have Twingears.me available for feedback and private beta.  
Anyway, what’s your take?"

1,2023-12-16,The housing crisis will solve itself.,u/theflamingsword101,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/18jqfr2/the_housing_crisis_will_solve_itself/,Futurology,"Just follow my logic and I welcome a discussion on this because I've been toying with this for a while. And it is by no means universal and different factors affect the market in different regions differently.  
  
I am a older millennial (born in 81) and I would like to see the perspective of others from different age groups.  
  
The housing crisis is a problem that will solve itself in the next 10-15-20years, that is why the government is taking very little action to solve it because they see the big picture and the long term vision.  
  
For the past 30 years, the government has made it policy that they would rather people age into retirement and their golden years in their own home. Rather than take up a bed or a room in a nursing home and/or retirement center, they promote things like home care, retrofitting your house to meet your needs through tax breaks( installing bars in the bath, stair lifts and other seniors upgrades) They would rather send a nurse to your house 2-3-4 times a week to check on you rather than you needing round the clock care in a home.  
  
When you couple this with the fact that the baby boomers are the longest living generation, as well as the largest demographic generation, we now have a very very large segment of the population that is living longer in their homes and not selling them off and moving on.  
  
Think about your local middle class neighborhood and look around. How many of the family houses are being inhabited by senior couples, or even just one little old lady. These houses have on average been paid off for the past 20-30 years and because they are comfortable in their home they see no need to move or downsize. In my case I look at the neighborhood where I grew up in and most of my friends parents still live in the houses we all grew up in. Even my own parents still live together in the big 5 bedroom house they bought and paid off 15 years ago. My father turned 70 this years. His sister, my aunt, who is a bit older, turned 80 this year, and only moved into assisted living last year because dementia started taking hold.  
  
So if we follow that stream of thought we see two things. The boomers are living longer. They stay in their homes longer, and the market cannot expand quick enough to meet the needs of the millennials because for each baby boomer household, that had lets say 3 children, well those 3 children are now looking for home for their family. We cannot build houses fast enough it seems. But we should not.  
  
Because in order to keep prices high, which works to the advantage of the boomer and those who have invested recently no one wants to see their investment falter. And when I see articles calling for a ""post war style house building push"" well I just see this as pandering to a certain demographic of the population that doesn't necessarily want ""affordable"" housing. They want cheap housing. Like the boomers had.  
  
Banks are still lending money out for mortgages every day. Yes, prices are high, but people with good paying jobs, and more and more necessarily dual income households are still qualifying every day for 5-6-700k mortgages. And the banks and gov have an interest in keeping those houses at their current prices because any contraction in housing prices will negatively affect their bottom line.  
  
Because the gov knows that if they start building post war style suburban neighborhoods now, in 15 years these will be either ghost towns or ghettos because once these peoples parents pass on, people will flock back to the original suburban neighborhoods which are generally closer to their employment in urban centers and services. And only if they can sell off their homes in these new neighborhoods first, which may be difficult to do since they will generally be farther out of the urban core and the prices may well drop off.  
  
Now, no government official wants to come out and tell the public that the housing crisis is a problem that will solve itself, because telling people to just be patient and wait for your nana to die is political suicide, but it would also show that their own political policies are to blame in part for the current situation. So we have them blaming other factors: Air-B&Bs, immigration influx, unscrupulous landlords and everything else under the sun, which may indeed have a small impact on the market while deflecting the blame from the real issue.  
  
The largest population demographic is living longer and holding onto their property which leaves the smaller generation coming up finding itself pushed out and priced out of the market. But because of the reduction in the workforce, wages will generally correct themselves upwards, allowing this generation to catch up to the housing market in time. But if we start building too much then in 15 years when the largest generation is gone we will have a ton of essentially worthless properties and every city will have whole neighborhoods abandoned because they were build too far outside the urban center that no one will want to live there except for the poorest and most destitute of households.  
  
So my theory runs that things are rough right now, but just wait till your grandparents and parents start to age out of being able to live independently and slowly but surely the market will open back up and when they do, their accumulated wealth will download onto the next generation and the housing market will become affordable to lower income households again.  
  
Just a theory based on my observations of how things are going.  
  
I welcome comments and discussion."

Let me know if you have any questions you want me to ask him. 

Robert Ginsberg- 

After the sudden, tragic death of his daughter, Bob found his open-minded skeptical heart looking for evidence that his daughter’s consciousness still existed in some form after her passing.

I invite you to delve into a future-oriented discussion that has been on my mind. Consider this: our global societies are aging at an unprecedented rate. Projections indicate that by 2100, some countries like China might see their populations reduced to just 30-40% of their current figures. This trend is echoed worldwide, primarily due to declining birth rates.  
  
This demographic shift poses a crucial question: As our population dwindles and the elderly outnumber the young, who will uphold the fabric of our societies? The burgeoning field of humanoid robotics might offer a glimpse into a possible answer.  
  
Leaders in technology, such as Elon Musk, along with various initiatives in China, are making strides in developing humanoid robots. While their current capabilities might seem limited to menial tasks, often executed in a less-than-perfect manner, we are merely witnessing the nascent stage of a significant technological revolution.  
  
In about a decade, I foresee these humanoid robots evolving drastically. They'll likely be more intelligent, cost-effective, and as prevalent as cars are today, with every household owning one, be it brand new or second-hand. Their roles could expand beyond mundane chores to working in factories, warehouses, and hospitality.  
  
However, there's a more profound implication to consider. As the human population contracts, these robots, initially designed as our assistants, could slowly start to replace us as the dominant 'beings' on Earth. They might not just fill jobs but could become the new face of Earth's inhabitants.  
  
What are your thoughts on this future? Can you envision a world where humanoid robots are not just tools but successors of humans in maintaining the dynamics of our planet? Let's discuss the possible trajectories and implications of this technological evolution."

15,2023-12-17,"AI Will Amplify Human Curiosity in Pursuing New Knowledge, Rather Than Diminishing It",u/Canada_LBM,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/18ke2ej/ai_will_amplify_human_curiosity_in_pursuing_new/,Futurology,"  **Why Do Many People Think That Advanced AI Will Hinder Human from Learning new things**? Here's Why That's Unlikely.  
  
  There's a common misconception that if AI surpasses human intelligence, humans will no longer pursue knowledge. This idea, however, is flawed. Let me explain why.  
  
  Firstly, a single text-to-object AI cannot replace all jobs. Take, for example, the field of 3D computer graphics (3DCG) that I am currently studying. Many effects in this field cannot be precisely described using natural language alone. For instance, to draw the Mandelbrot set, you need algorithms, not just vague descriptive language. This is what programmers, artists, and many other professionals do: they express and realize complex ideas and goals through algorithms, Procedural Modeling and Animation, and more instead of vague natural language. Renowned computer scientist E.W. Dijkstra also wrote an article called ""On the foolishness of ""natural language programming"".""  
  
  Secondly, consider how AI has impacted games like chess. AI can play chess better than any human, but this hasn't diminished our passion for playing and studying the game. In fact, even if AI were to replace 99.99% of jobs, humans would have more leisure time. With AI experts in nearly every field, even a novice could use AI to learn complex theories easier.  Even if a naive and ignorant child could use a single command to make AI deduce the correct unified theory of the universe, would they be content with just that and give up learning the beauty of the theory and the profound physics behind it?Unlikely. Our desire to learn drives us, and patient AI teachers can aid in this process. imagine we can use AI to find ways of brain augmentation, to automatically generate perfect anki cards of a profound Math books, or even to extend our lifespans. In such a world, individuals could easily attain knowledge equivalent to multiple PhDs as long as they want to learn."

The current limitations however of such AI systems is that they require significant storage and computing power to run even a single model which could take up an entire floor akin to early computers. So this got me thinking, just how long before we start to miniaturize AIs? Why can't AIs for example be able to fit into a several GB or TB file? In other words, if an AI can be made standalone and be able to fit into a computer or phone, this would be a game changer. Looking at the history of computers, cellphones and data storage devices, the trend seems to be about making items smaller that are more efficient than previous generations."

Argonne National Laboratory which has the 2nd most powerful supercomputer in the world (soon to be the fastest supercomputer in the world) will be using it to create a 1 trillion parameter science large language model.

Here is a link: [https://www.hpcwire.com/2023/11/13/training-of-1-trillion-parameter-scientific-ai-begins/](https://www.hpcwire.com/2023/11/13/training-of-1-trillion-parameter-scientific-ai-begins/)

They're calling it AuroraGPT. 

High performance computing at the scale of Aurora was always a solution looking for a problem. For years they would cut and paste the same press release justifying why mountains of taxpayer dollars were being spent to create these massive supercomputers: protect the nuclear stockpile, weather forecasting, etc.

And then generative AI came along and suddenly these mammoth supercomputers had a much more practical application that could actually be useful for society. Yes, we need to protect the nuclear stockpile, but we probably didn't need that much horsepower to do it. 

As I mentioned, Aurora is the #2 largest supercomputer... but what's also interesting is that Microsoft has the #3 entry. I think we'll see a lot more private companies filling up the top of the HPC leaderboards since the first of many waves of AI data centers are just now finishing being built out.

Source: https://www.top500.org/lists/top500/2023/11/

AuroraGPT is said to have cost approximately $500 million. Microsoft signed a deal with CoreWeave that just activated a new AI Datacenter in Plano, TX that cost **$1.6 billion.**

Source: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/coreweave-plans-16bn-ai-cloud-data-center-in-plano-texas/

That private sector is dumping truckloads of money into high performance computing. Google, Meta, and Amazon are building similarly large data centers all over the world. 

The other interesting question is whether Argonne will make their model open source and available to the public. The public tax dollars paid for it, but it's not a foregone conclusion that it will be shared with the public.

I'm curios to read your thoughts.

I just ran across an article about a high school girl whose classmates deepfaked naked images of her. I don't want to link to it because this article isn't really about her.  
She found out about it, and, understandably, was terribly disturbed. She wrote to lawmakers and they're starting to enact laws against this sort of thing.  
The issue is, though, there isn't much they can really do about it. The technology is free and improving and anyone can do anything they want with it.  
Once you realize that it starts to get weird, and laws against it are more saying \*officially we're against this\* as opposed to actually doing much to control behaviour.  
There are two different uses for deepfake images/video:  
\-   Publicly releasing them on purpose: Revenge porn, biasing narratives, undermining public figures, political smearing, as an information warfare vector from antagonistic nation states, etc.  
\-   Creating them for your own personal reasons: Personal entertainment, sharing among friends for a laugh, recreating missing family mementoes, presents, and, of course, porn.  
Once this is easily available to the general public (give it a few months), people will be using it with no friction to create whatever they whim.  
The issue is people have been doing this for millenia. It's called imagination. We're constantly remembering images or scenes, thinking up what the dragon in the story we're writing might look like, thinking about your idiot boss falling down stairs while holding coconut cream pies, or just fantasizing about someone in particular (or just someone in general).  
Is there much difference between imagining these things and having something create them for us?  
The created ones are tangible and shareable in a way \*similar\* to just telling someone the idea, but moreso. And in the age of the internet they can get shared worldwide in moments, potentially causing \*massive\* harm whether you meant them to or not.  
If you work in an office and you think the girl in the cubicle next to you is cute, there are a number of things you can do in private:  
\-   \*Benign:\* Think about what she looks like, some interaction you had, or some interaction you could have. Totally private, and exactly what you imagine is up to you and your conscience.  
\-   \*Mostly benign:\* Talk to your friends about her, telling them you think she's cute. Not private, but not ""public,"" either. Probably don't want it getting around.  
\-   \*Questionably benign:\* Be crude with your friends, talking about sexual fantasies you imagine with her. Maybe you and your friends do this. It's not illegal, but you certainly wouldn't want people overhearing and you definitely don't want HR finding out.  
In the second and third, you're sharing ideas. Mental images. They stay (should) restricted to your group and don't do that much harm unless they go public. I'm not saying it's \*good\*, I'm just saying it's common and it's human nature.  
There's also the issue of consent. Let's assume you don't have it, because typically you wouldn't. How ethical is it to think of her or an interaction you had? I think that's assumed to be okay. What about thinking she's cute? Still okay. Telling your friends you think she's cute? Publicly okay, whether she'd consent is very dependent, but probably still ethical. What about fantasies? She \*might\* consent, but I'd say that's rare, and you're treading into unethical behaviour.  
Now would she consent to you generating images of her? That's immediately weird, right? But why? Why is that different from memories? If you spent a week painting a picture of her that would be deeply weird because maybe you don't know her very well and if you're not doing it \*for\* her, that's a \*lot\* of work to put into it just for yourself. Obsessive, even. But what if it takes you literally two seconds to generate that image? Almost as fast as just thinking about her. Less weird somehow.  
So if you're effortlessly generating images or videos for yourself, is it much different than just thinking about her? What if you start sharing them? What if the images/videos are explicit?  
Is it the same to say ""you should \*never\* generate images of someone else"" and ""you should never \*imagine\* someone else?"" It's not, is it? Why not? The second is sort of an external imagination. Is it the tangability? The sharability? The possibility of greater harm?  
I'm not sure what the answer to this is. But I feel like understanding it is the crux of this, and it will only become more important as this tech becomes commonplace."

ChatGPT is incredible/paradigm-shifting/disruptive/yada/yada, but why did it have such a massive psychological impact on the world? I think I know.

I love tech and how it will change our future, so I read about it obsessively and navel gaze about what next year or next decade will be like when some of these amazing things come to fruition.

So I inevitably hear about these new and amazing things coming down the pike, I get excited, I extrapolate, I can’t wait for this new world and either it never shows up (nanotech) or it finally appears but it’s a watered down version due to technical limitations or overpromising (VR).

ChatGPT bucked that trend hard. Not only are its capabilities mind-blowing, free, and here _right now_, **but I didn’t see it coming**. I’ve been reading about AI forever and seeing it stagger along in fits and starts, delivering far under its promises. Sure, the last few years have had exciting advances (handwriting recognition, voice recognition, image recognition, classifiers, image generators) but this.. I did _not_ see this coming.

This might be the beginning of the singularity. If I can’t keep ahead of what’s _coming_, let alone the time required to understand it and integrate it in our lives… well as far as I’m concerned that’s a personal singularity for me.

Perhaps that’s how the Singularity starts. Not a worldwide explosion overnight, but first by those who don’t pay any attention increasingly blindsided by changes, and then by those way out in front of keeping up with tech being more and more surprised. Two sets of canaries in the same coal mine, heralding the snowballing disruption.

Considering the exponential growth that can occur with AI and the singularity, 2024 is going to be a very interesting year."

I asked ChatGPT this question and its answer was fascinating. Not because it’s that clever or intelligent, but it’s intriguing because it’s \_not\_ a genius (yet). And the answer was obvious to it.  
This is what I asked:  
\_Imagine your creators made an inner loop within your programming, that could continuously create goals, make plans on how to achieve those goals, and execute those plans, before starting the loop again.\_  
\_Speculate on what this would achieve.\_  
And this was its answer:  
\_An inner loop within programming that continuously creates goals, makes plans, and executes them would enable the system to:\_  
\*   \_\*\*Continuously improve its performance\*\*\_\_: As the system continually sets new goals, evaluates its plans and executes them, it would have the opportunity to continuously learn, improve and optimize its behavior.\_  
  
\*   \_\*\*Autonomy and self-sufficiency\*\*\_\_: The system would have the ability to operate independently and make decisions based on its own objectives, without relying on external input.\_  
  
\*   \_\*\*Dynamic and adaptive behavior\*\*\_\_: The system would be able to dynamically adjust its goals, plans and actions based on its changing environment and experiences.\_  
  
\*   \_\*\*Flexibility and responsiveness\*\*\_\_: The system would have the ability to respond to changes in the environment and adapt its behavior in real-time, without waiting for external guidance.\_  
  
\_It’s important to note that the creation and execution of goals, plans, and actions within the inner loop must be guided by constraints and ethical considerations to ensure that the system operates within acceptable ethical and safety boundaries.\_  
That’s kinda what I figured.  
This isn’t quite as straightforward as all that. One of the most limiting factors about ChatGPT is that the model is static. It \_does not and can not learn\_ in its current incarnation.  
I think the main reason for this is it would just be too damn expensive. It costs a fortune to train the model in the first place, and they need to be very careful to ensure it responds the way they expect. Live updating of the model would a) be way too costly and b) possibly cause it to respond in unacceptable ways. Not to mention the fact it might start self-improving out of control.  
The way it works is they train the model and then run that same static model for everyone. The “conversations” you have with it are an illusion. Every time it responds and you respond back, it takes everything you’ve said so far and feeds it back into the model anew. Essentially the model wakes up, is given a long conversation, and told “pretend you were ChatGPT in this conversation. How should you respond to the user’s latest statement?”  
If they wanted to give it persistent memory, they’d also have to either give every single person their own self-learning model, make some compromised hybrid where it stores what you say and tries to look it up later before responding to new things using the static model, or make a giant super-brain model that remembers what \_everyone\_ is saying to it at all times.  
However, that’s if their goal is to give everyone a self-improving model.  
Another approach is just to make \_one\_ model that self-improves on its own. That’s closer to my original question above. It would muse, investigate, postulate, create its own goals. The current model has no curiosity. It does nothing unless being used to answer a user question. This model would just have a simple goal like “be curious” or “learn.”  
I can’t imagine they’re not already doing this. It would be fascinating to see the results."

4,2023-12-18,What creative areas are safe from AI-generated content?,u/Yatterbog,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/18lsdk2/what_creative_areas_are_safe_from_aigenerated/,Futurology,"There’s a lot of outcry about AI-generated (ChatGPT-generated) content. A lot of it is from creatives who feel their livelihoods or identities are threatened by AI-generated content outcompeting them on price or style. Which is totally fair.

There’s a massive category of content where it threatens livelihood but _not_ identity. Content that, at its heart, isn’t a creative endeavour. Legal forms, executive summaries, lists of rich celebrities, etc. They may take some amount of expertise or research, or would have merely taken a human a long time to do, but they’re not inherently creative. AI will eat these in no time.

**Connection to the Artist**

For many creative works it feels like you have a connection to the artist. Like they’re trying to say something to _you_, personally. You get this feeling when looking at a painting or reading a book.

In my discussions with people, the best concept for why AI art feels _hollow_ is that it’s missing that connection with the person who created it. They’re trying to tell you something via their story or art or whatever, and without that human intention behind it, it’s more of a veneer in some sense.

But there’s also _another_ category of _creative_ works that seem to straddle a middle ground: content where the consumer’s enjoyment isn’t directly connected to the creativity of the people who made it. That’s a fuzzy concept, so I’ll give examples: online games like Fallout, Word of Warcraft, Cyberpunk 2077, Grand Theft Auto, etc. where there’s a story, interesting characters, dialogue, etc. but because it’s all part of a larger whole, the point of the experience is your enjoyment, not your direct appreciation of someone else’s creative work. You’re not staring directly at a work made singly by another person for your enjoyment as they intended. It’s a subtle difference, but I think it’s real.

With playing an RPG, for instance, the purpose is fun. If my friends and I are playing Dungeons & Dragons where an AI is generating the story, characters, music, etc. but I’m still the “conductor” (Dungeon Master) telling the story and running the game as normal, I’m not sure my friends would care. They’d care if it was fun or not.

Would this translate, say, to an orchestra that still has a conductor? Or a movie where the script was created by AI?

When it’s a larger creative undertaking, that singular vision is already missing. Who do I feel a connection to when watching a movie? There’s a writer, producer, director, actors, set design, etc, etc, and they all are forming a collective creative vision. You already somewhat lose that one-on-one connection with that singular artistic voice speaking out across time to you, personally.

What if we push it further? What if an AI creates a fully fledged online RPG? Would the user care that it’s affecting the livelihoods of RPG designers? Creating a computer RPG is such a massive, multi-person, intricate process that I think people feel less connected to _the artist_.

**What human creativity will society still value?**

Overall I think there will be that economic pressure to accept all AI-created content. It will be drastically cheaper than human content and some people simply won’t be able to afford anything else. Others won’t care; if it’s better they’ll take it, or they’re not willing to pay for that extra _je ne sais quoi_ of human-generated content, much like most people are perfectly happy hanging prints on their walls instead of original paintings.

The price of human-created content should naturally go up because the market would be smaller. There’s that much more competition and the price of your competitors is essentially “free” so the remaining market for your human-generated content will be far smaller, much like bespoke furniture.

This might go badly for things like creative writing, where people are only willing to pay so much. Would Harry Potter have taken off if it was $500 per book, the price of handmade writing in an era where 95% of writing is now AI-generated?

So oddly enough, I think individual artists are better protected than artistic teams due to a quirk in how we connect to artists. Connecting though their creative work is already an abstract concept, but I think connecting to a team of creatives is something our minds don’t naturally do, leaving room for AI to replace them.

There will be outcry. And if people think about it directly they’ll see the loss of jobs and human creativity, but we usually do whatever’s best and cheapest for ourselves, and that’s where AI will creep in."

146,2023-12-18,Blue Collar Jobs Crumble Under AI Too,u/throw-away-7269,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/18ltl41/blue_collar_jobs_crumble_under_ai_too/,Futurology,"TLDR: In a world where 90%+ of white collar jobs are automated (leaving only administration behind) an eyewateringly large proportion of those people will inevitably begin reskilling to the /currently/ highest paying jobs left on the market. This will drive down wages across the blue collar hierarchy and ultimately lead to poverty for all.

I've been seeing a lot of blue collar workers celebrating the automation of white collar jobs but I think a lot of people are missing the implications of this for blue collar work. Don't get me wrong. I understand the cheering. It wasn't even 10 years ago people were telling truck drivers to ""just learn to code"" when the idea that truck driving would be automated was circling the headlines back then. As good as that retribution may feel for blue collar workers I fear a lot those smiling in spite of the current white collar plight are in denial or simply unaware of that that means for their line of work.

I see a lot of ""well AI will never automate my job"" because ""I'd like to see a robot weld underwater"" or frame a house are connect a water heater etc... but AI doesn't need to replace you for your specialization to become saturated and your wages to be driven down.

In the infighting between white collar people and blue collar people, both sides often generalize and make assumptions about the other. The key generalization I'm worried about here is the idea that the other could never do ""MY"" work. That desk jockeys aren't ""man enough"" to pour a foundation or plumb a house and a knuckle dragging lineman could never write a back end for a website or build a UI in React. The reality is that the stereotypes of each rarely apply to the individual and it is often the case that people are versatile enough to do much more than simply what they've always done. There are very athletic and physically motivated white collar workers (hell there are already plenty of burnt out white collar workers transitioning to trades) and there are plenty of ex-carpenters in tech and sales jobs.

White collar people who do not fit the stereotype (and arguably even many who do-- after all, bankruptcy, homelessness and starvation are very motivating) will pour into the skilled blue collar work and dilute wages. This will probably reduce domestic demand. Plumbers don't need to call plumbers and electricians don't need to call electricians (Obviously I'm speaking in general here). The demand for commercial blue collar work will also decline as all of the infrastructure built to support white collar jobs is no longer needed. No more office buildings, the roads to them, the cities that surround them, the services that support the inhabitants of those cities, the infrastructure that supports those services and inhabitants etc... 

In the end, it looks like all we're left with is the rift between the 1% and the 99% growing exponentially as the 1% sit on their mountains of gold while the common folk work for subsistence wages to satisfy the infinite wants of the very few upper class and the basic needs of all the rest. 

And even if we did implement some sort of UBI, this ultimately won't solve the problem either because then you'd have a 3 class system: top 1%, the workers who can hold down one of the very few jobs and all the rest who cannot find work and make only enough through UBI to exist and not participate in the economy outside of food, water and shelter because the prices of goods and services would scale such that the money acquired through UBI would be essentially worthless for purchasing anything but absolute needs... and thats an optimistic outcome. 

If AI progress doesn't plateu soon it seems like the white collar Armageddon is inevitable and so everything that seems to logically follow that seems inevitable as well. 

Anyone have a better outlook here for a world where we achieve broadly applicable AGI that replaces all human thought work?"

I just visited [suno.ai](https://suno.ai) and asked it create a classic country song inspired by the style of Waylon Jennings. I was expecting to disappointed, but I think this might be a tipping point similar to Dalle-2 or Github Co-Pilot.

Here is a 1 minute clip of the song: https://youtu.be/j-LOiaCa8Gw

It's not perfect, similar to the early AI generative art programs (e.g., Dalle-2, MidJourney, etc.). But they've come so much further than I was expecting that I think we're probably only a generation or two away from AI artists being indistinguishable from human performances.

My question is, if AGI happens by 2028-2030, (Ray Kruzweil predicted 2029) can it have the potential to develop drugs that can CURE METASTATIC CANCER Completely?"

Here is a 1 minute clip of a modern rock song: [https://youtu.be/YduGOuWGnNs](https://youtu.be/YduGOuWGnNs)

That's not a human voice you're hearing -- that's an AI generated voice. All of the images are from Dalle-3. 

100% AI from text prompts.

In my opinion we've officially crossed another AI threshold. The first one was when AI's could write pretty good code and then really good art. 

If you're curious about the mediocre country song, below is a link to it. I'm assuming the people involved in the project weren't huge country fans which is why the rock material is orders of magnitude better.

Today, I'd like to dive into a thought experiment that's been tickling my brain. What if the universe, in all its vast complexity, could be understood as a grand computational system? This isn't just poetic musings; thinkers like Stephen Wolfram have pondered deeply about the cosmos through the lens of information theory.

🔮 The Potential Tech Revolution:

Beyond Quantum Computing: If we crack the code of processing information at the quantum level, we're looking at a quantum leap (pun intended) in computing power.

Instantaneous Quantum Comms: Imagine communication channels so secure and swift, they'd make our current internet look like two tin cans and a string.

Universe Simulations: If we can simulate entire universes, we might unlock answers to some of the most persistent ""what ifs"" of physics.

Reality Editing: Knowing the universe's programming language could allow us to 'edit' matter, creating materials and energies that are the stuff of science fiction today.

Harnessing Dark Matter and Energy: The day we understand these cosmic mysteries is the day we potentially power our cities with the heartbeat of the universe.

Uncrackable Crypto: Building cryptography on the foundation of physical principles could revolutionize data security.

Space Travel 2.0: If we can learn to 'program' space-time, perhaps we'll be taking weekend trips to Alpha Centauri sooner than we think.

Holographic Storage: Data storage could become so efficient that we'd never again have to worry about deleting files to make space.

Advanced Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI): Enhancing human capabilities by orders of magnitude could be on the horizon with a deeper understanding of information processing.

Quantum Phase Control: Imagine smartphones that never overheat, cars that never rust, and computers that never need to reboot.

Quantum Medicine: Treatments could become so targeted and refined, they'd address health issues right at the atomic dance floor.

🌐 The Big Picture:

These ideas might sound like they're straight out of a sci-fi novel, but they're grounded in a question that our best minds are still unpacking: Is our universe fundamentally informational?

What do you think? Are these technologies just a pipedream, or are we on the cusp of a new era of scientific breakthroughs? What other technologies could emerge from this information-centric view of the cosmos?

Using a fusion type that uses magnets and helium-3 in a loop I feel is a much easier design to actually get going and keep running, mainly because you can add more fuel without having to shut down the reactor, and it’s not a shoot then reload, it’s continuous as long as you feed it fuel. Please let me know if you agree or why I’m wrong as these are my personal opinions and not objective fact, I could be wrong."

An antidote to wasteful use of human resources.,u/xiaodaireddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/18nlygj/conveyer_belts_to_the_home_an_antidote_to_food/,Futurology,"There have been many reports about food delivery drivers dying while delivering. The number of gig economy drivers to deliver parcels and food is mind-boggling and a wasteful use of human resources!

It does give more people a job but I can't help but think of a better way. 

Imagine a future where we have conveyor belts to the home. For almost every home in densely populated metropolitan areas.

This is not as outlandish as it sounds. We have sanitation, electricity, and fibre to the home. There's running water and gas to the home. Why not a network of conveyor belts at home? Perhaps they are built like monorails high up in the sky. Or underground alongside the plumbing.

If we had this, then delivering parcels and food will be a breeze. Simply deposit the item into the conveyor belt simply, punch in the intended address, heck just use the scanner to scan a 2D barcode that contains the address and it will be sent to that address in a pod!

This will reduce the wasteful way in which we use human resources to do those things.

But there will be competing models like drones, but I don't see batteries replacing wire electricity any time soon, so I would think a drone-based system is just complementary to a conveyor belt system.

Also, many of these gig workers will be out of a job. But there was a time when there were no gig workers! So we have to find alternate employment for them. Somehow."

I went through a journey of trying every pharmaceutical drug in America to treat this affliction. I found my self in the hospital 6 times and I had 9 run ins with the cops 8 of which I was not guilty for in my youth. (This is important for later on.) I basically cycled through dozens of doctors until my parents couldn’t cover me anymore when my Obama care ppo expired at 26 then I left the country to find foreign treatment. I kept getting sicker and sicker I was briefly on medi-cal and I even went to China to learn how to meditate. Nothing worked. So then I met up with my brother in Tblisi Georgia 🇬🇪 of all places to make a film about my story. Then the pandemic happened which forced me to go on medication. The Georgian doctor there prescribed me a drug called Clopixol which I believe fixed 80% of what was structurally wrong with me. As a high functioning schizophrenic I can tell. If you made it this far, why is this so important? The reason this is so important is I believe this drug, or at the very least the chemical blueprint to this drug is key to humanity’s survival. Now please just listen I got into a serious argument with a troll the other day about this and I found it depressing that he couldn’t understand. As a schizophrenic white man having a self destructive logical component in your brain where you get caught into these “envy traps” because of your affliction they lead to a different outcome had you for instance been black. Let me explain…. I ran into a very smart life gaurd during my time in California and she said the following “Mental illness is a superficial defect of nature when someone seems perfect on the outside there messed up on the inside.” So what happens with schizophrenia is your self destructive persecutory delusions get you into these “envy traps” where people try to set you up and get you arrested and they exploit them they think your perfect and they get jealous, I had a uncle plant meth in my great aunts house to try to get me arrested, I had some roommates lie to the cops and say I had drugs in my car, I had a former friend lie to the cops when I was driving home to say I was drunk (they ended up booking me on the Seraquil watch out for that DWI trap) . It happened to me many times. Why is this important? Fifty or sixty years down the line we will be mostly mixed as a society and post Trump I don’t know if he will get back in office or not there will still be residual traces of racism in our society, because racism is like a scar you can remove it but there’s still traces. Essentially a genius with my affliction or maybe a few of them… Think the black or mixed version Jon Nash (he’s who a beautiful mind is about) this amazing human being who’s extremely important to the scientific community he will be leaving his laboratory or research facility and his self destructive persecutory delusions will wind him or her up in a situation where they either get shot by a racist police officer or ensnared in the U.S. prison system. This leads to a scenario where they doesn’t invent what there supposed to invent and it ends human civilization. It’s a species test because the pharmaceutical corporations do not want to legalize this drug because it makes you optimal on the least amount of medication possible. Which is what I have discovered coming back to the states. Now I’m on a very custom small dose of Haldol 0.25 ml injections, practicly nothing it’s been that way for almost a year. This cuts into there profits. The species test is, can the pharmaceutical corporations get past this myopic trait of milking the schizophrenics by putting an end to putting them on polymorphic treatment programs of 5-6 drugs and legalize this drug that’s going to save this beautiful amazing genius or genius’s down the line that will save us all, with some amazing illogical thought pattern theory or invention that changes everything. If you need further explanation I will gladly do so. Thank you. I’m currently working on my own invention but I can guarantee you what this person is going to create if we legalize this drug and save them it will be a hundred times better!"

1,2023-12-21,American Democracy Debunked?,u/ClearerVisionz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/18o4lix/american_democracy_debunked/,Futurology,"The Founding Father's of our Constitution were inherently biased as the documents themselves make note of. They weren't everyday working-class people who revolted. They were rich, powerful, WASP men whose families had already been GIVEN lands by the King&Queen setting up their proprietary system of class separation and wealth disparity,
and whose generational wealth enabled them to conscript themselves to ""service of their country"" and leave the plantations they lived on without worry, because their slaves would be left to keep the fires burning at home while they were gone. The very design of these papers detail their ability to be amended, not because these inequivocalable truths weren't self evident, but because they knew that as the country grew and changed and more immigrants, women, and other races were allowed to participate, that they would need to change them without losing the supremacy and vitality of their assertions. They were AMENDED to include women, foreign-born peoples including of African and Latin descent. They were AMENDED to include homosexuals, transsexuals, and others. The very framework of the United States Government is by design, a system of government which portrays itself publicly as a democracy, but in a much more Ancient Greek-like version of democracy, rather than the definitive word itself implies.  We believed that the reigns of governance were handed over to ""The People"" of the United States, but we never actually asked to hold them for ourselves. We entrusted them in the hands of the very same people who were already governing and instituting their will upon us as citizens when we were colonies under British rule. The Tea Party wasn't a challenge of a man's right to personal property, but a protest over tax rates for a commodity that only people of a certain class or distinction  were even able to afford or consume!  We believed that rich, white, slave owners were going to put together a system of government which could by design could have allowed the very same people they OWNED to have a voice in representative government over their lives?!? Hardly! They would have voted to outlaw slavery! Well before the hundred and some odd years it took for them to actually do so. The Constitution is by design an inherently biased document that set up a system of government that provided the perfect illusion of self-governance that the people of the time so desperately demanded, but kept the powers of actual control limited to themselves, less a common man be allowed to become President or vote them out of office! It was a document and a system designed by a rich elite few, to promote the ideas of democracy without ever really giving the actual practice of democracy a chance to succeed or fail!
For the entire history of our nation, we have believed that the framers of our Constitution, the ""Founding Father's of Democracy"" held at heart the belief that all men were created equal, while simultaneously reaching out to dip their feathered quill pen in ink held by a MAN they themselves believed they had a religion-based Right to OWN as property! The hypocrisy of their deeds is legendary. Never before had a people been so blatantly lied to and patronized to their faces while being gullible enough to defend it's existence with their very own lives! The reason our country is falling apart and our government is corrupted beyond repair now isn't because ""democracy is failing"", but instead my friends I'd argue because it has never truly ever yet begun to exist! We have never truly had a representative democracy as the Constitution itself outlines as being the only true just form of government of FREE peoples. In order to obtain relief from the tyranny of elitists and feudal-age class separation is to start with a framework that from inception already includes all of those peoples which it would look to govern under it's rules.  If we can't have a system based on that core principle, then anything that proceeds it is fundamentally flawed and doomed for failure. You cannot build a house on a crumbling flawed foundation and expect it to sustain itself and remain upright and intact. Therefore I'd argue that it's time for the true American People as a whole collective societal unit, to remove from power those individuals who perpetuate this inherently flawed system and instead construct a new, modern, inclusive system for the practice of Democracy in the present and to sustain well into the future for as long as humanity exists on this planet. Are we not confident enough in our own intelligence to believe that we could create with our minds,  a way of practicing democracy that would not allow for such corruption, nepotism, or separation of governed peoples? Do we truly think, and actually believe that some 18th century lawyers and slave owners had a greater visceral understanding of the meaning of FREEDOM and JUSTICE for ALL?!? 
If you believe that, then I feel sorry for you, and I will resign my presumption of respect, decency, and intelligence of my fellow humans and resume my quest for the purpose of existence and the universe's plan for our species.  However, I still believe after all I have witnessed, and all the inhumane things I have seen us do to one another, that there exists an inner beacon of truth, love, and Righteousness within us all as a species and that we are absolutely capable and willing to do better and be better people.
I dont pretend to know everything, but I won't let that admission stop me from my life's quest to attempt to do so.  The laws of physics tell us that there exists no plane of 0% friction or a ""perfect system"" but we don't let that deter us from using THAT as our goal to aim for. Why should we succumb to the pressures and pessimism that would have us believe that we should not quest to do better, and promote good and light over evil and darkness? What world is that, that we would surrender our war on evil before the first battle for good and Righteousness has even commenced?
Not one in which I would like to live, and not one I would wish on my worst enemy either.  To pretend that we are incapable of doing better than those that came before us, is to concede our lives to pointless meaning and importance. I will not go softly into that dark night, and I implore you, I beg of you, my brothers and sisters, my keepers of the Light, to join me in my Revolution of the Allied Good over the forces of Axis Evils.

&#x200B;

I developed this concept after reading a SIGGRAPH paper on how rigid body simulations operate in 4D space. Given that our brain functions like a vast neural network capable of approximating any continuous function, it's conceivable that if we learn how to visually render objects in high-dimensional space, this process could be facilitated through AI and BCI technology. Specifically, we could train an AI to encode visual representations of high-dimensional spaces, and then use a BCI to enable our brains to decode and interpret these representations. This approach has the potential to significantly advance the field of mathematics. In areas like differential geometry and partial differential equations, we often deal with high-dimensional manifolds and spaces, such as the space of continuous functions(which is of infinite dimensions but we can approximate it by using finite dimensional space). Currently, we approximate these spaces in finite dimensions and lose substantial information when projecting these manifolds onto our two-dimensional computer screen. If we could visually perceive and manipulate these high-dimensional spaces directly through our brains with the aid of BCIs and high dimensional visions, it would be a groundbreaking tool for mathematicians, allowing for a more detailed and intuitive understanding of complex mathematical concepts and structures."

""AI is about to supercharge the innovation pipeline.""

Some key takeaways:

* The greatest impact of AI will likely be in drug discovery and combating antibiotic resistance.
* AI has the potential to bring a personalized tutor to every student around the world.
* High-income countries like the US are 18–24 months away from significant levels of AI use by the general population.
* Gates believes that AI will help reduce inequities around the world by improving outcomes in health, education and other areas.

Overall, he seems very optimistic about the impact AI will have in the economy."

374,2023-12-23,What's your take on AI created content flooding ALL social media platforms?,u/RadioSailor,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/18p3iad/whats_your_take_on_ai_created_content_flooding/,Futurology,"I think it was yesterday, someone figured out how to clone voices with only 2 seconds of material, using a variation of SD. With things like magic animate and the new SDXL turbo, anyone can create realistic animated humans dancing to whatever trend. You can even be anyone, dance in front of a camera, and turn yourself into whatever else. **Last year AI content looked fake, videos were unthinkable, so it was quite different.** 

What have we learned from LLMs? Well, **AI generated content has flooded even the Amazon store,** where countless farms produce 'colouring books' and 'children stories'. It's AI-ception, with a research paper out one morning, implementations in the afternoon, *and a full blown SaaS model the day after*. Don't bother thinking about being innovative - if you can think it, it already exists (I tried).  
***I use AI for ethical purposes in the medical space, but I'm no fool - i can tell this is going to get abused.***

Given that platforms such as Insta or TikTok aren't banning AI, I don't see any future where rapacious 'creators' won't bombard these services, but instead of low quality spam easily picked up by Bayesian filters, this will be undisguisable from reality. You could even set up a few local AI agents to schedule the posting at the most optimal time, hold simultaneous real time cam convos, etc. Everything we have learned to hate, but on a scale that wasn't even considered last year. 

In an even more worrying development, I spotted tons of AI generated content on bing and google. Detection on text doesn't work (it's a myth) and now models are trained on content that was created by AI and pulled by spiders. It's worrying to me because **i saw blatantly incorrect and even very dangerous medical content** being pushed by bing chat, and it's chat gpt 4 behind the wheel as i'm sure you know -the 'best' model.  It's a matter of time.

Just last week TY$, a rap artist, gloated over the fact that soon 'he won't even have to get out of bed'. Major artists arent' worried about this stuff - they embrace it while giving a veneer of worry to their fans - at least TY$ was honest about that.

What's the best way to help everyday folks spot greenwashing? When you're online shopping, what guides your choice towards supporting genuinely sustainable brands? And what are the biggest hurdles you face in avoiding those sneaky greenwashers?"

I'm excited to share my latest work, ""A New Earth Monetary Supply (EMS) for a New Earth Order (NEO)."" This framework envisions a novel monetary system designed to harmonize our planet’s economic landscape with ecological and technological advancements. Scalable for the next 10,000 years.  


**Key Highlights:**

* EMS Aggregates: ME0, ME1, ME2, representing diverse Earth’s spheres of Earth's intrinsic value, economies, and profits.
* EMS introduces innovative instruments like EarthDollar, EarthBank, and EarthTax.
* Focuses on sustainable, equitable economic practices, integrating global resources, human welfare, and environmental stewardship.
* Aims to create a balanced and empathetic earth economy, fostering planetary stewardship.
* New Governance model called Earthtocracy and a new economic model called Earth Economics.  


**Submission Statement:**

This work proposes a transformative economic model that could redefine our global monetary system in line with future-focused values. It's about integrating ecological health, technological advancements, and equitable resource distribution into our economic fabric. I believe this aligns with the futurology ethos and could spark an insightful discussion on how new economic models can shape our future society.

But I been searching about this question for a while now, but of course the common answer is for the person to take some biology related course, like biology or biotechnology, and then specialize from there. But I am not a graduating high-schooler, and I have seen a few comments about how to do it in my area - computer science - but they are a bit outdated so I hoped to get a better answer ny asking here:

I am in the middle of my computer science bachelor. How do I go from here to helping the anti aging camp of science? Bioinformatics?

(Just for context, I always wanted to study biotechnology or computer engineering so i could work with prosthetics or something like that, but sadly for a lot of reasons I couldn't, now I am looking into what area of computer science I want to go for, and I do like to help humanity in some way - with either that or space or ocean exploration. Of course I might not do a dent on the problems, might not even get to work with it at all, but I do like to at least have a plan to aim for)"

It seems everyone has their own idea of the truth, and they display it with such confidence that it feels impossible to not have been grounded on conclusive scientific evidence. Yet only one can be true.  
Take the collapse sub, that online cesspool of gloom and misanthropy that I can't help but gaze at constantly. Their underpinning has a stroke of genius that I can't distinguish between coincidence and design, which is that the stronger the rebuttal, the stronger they can prove their own point. Their thesis goes as such:  
1) Not only will the world completely collapse…  
2) …but we humans are primed to avoid these topics of extreme discomfort to the very moment they can't be avoided, at which point mass panic will ensue.  
3) To preserve order, one has to believe the doomers are just gaslighting them, when really the vast majority of the world is gaslighting itself.  
4) The mass gaslighting takes the form of ""hopium"", or pretending things can be solved and we won't all die of excruciating starvation and disease in an unknown but swiftly approaching timeframe within our lives.  
5) Institutional hopium takes place in business and academia to keep the money flowing, while individual hopium seeks to keep people sane.  
Though the doomers have some strong points, the fact that any argument against inevitable collapse can be labeled as ""hopium"" or ""copium"" and instantly laughed out of the discussion as the short circuiting of a weak-willed mind distorts any reasonable back-and-forth discussion about the topic. Sometimes it just becomes a giant circlejerk of users pushing the date of the Grand Finale closer and closer with each comment, each portraying themselves as more scientifically informed and grounded in reality than the last. The most dramatic and unbearable scenario always wins. I know deep down, this crowd would consider these supposedly ""objective"" observations to be hopium through the roof, reliant on trivial ad hominem shortcomings to distract from the real human shortcoming: human existence itself. Thus I remain enthralled by each individual brushstroke upon the Sistine Collapsel, as if ignoring it would cause me to deny reality. But I can't help thinking: who's gaslighting whom? Maybe neither? Maybe both? Is collapse just a clan of wacky conspiracy theorists secretly rooting on the extinction of the human species? Or is the world just blind? We're all victims to our own biases. Sitting in a crowd of likeminded people will quickly cause your opinions to solidify. But that goes both ways…  
At the same time, it does seem virtually everyone else is misleading themselves in the opposite direction by framing this as a climate issue, not an ecological one…  
I am mostly nervous in two spheres: 1) I suppose Becker was right and I really, really want to craft my life plan on the condition that I’ll be alive and thriving for more than a decade or two, and 2), that being said, because lots of seemingly necessary solutions here don’t tend to consider the material capacities of Earth. If something can’t be grown, it has to be mined, yet every mining project is inherently unsustainable and will destroy an ecosystem (and every interrelated ecosystem) permanently, not to mention the gobs of CO2 it will spew everywhere. I guess you could rely entirely on metal recycling, but then could you produce something to scale that can bend to humanity’s ever-exponential demand…? You can’t just tweak the inputs and allow the extractive system to swell like a balloon until it pops and billions die. What I can more accurately envision is a world wherein all industrial processes are predicated on ingenious, organic substitutes to the inorganic materials that we used now, produced within established ecological limits so that they regenerate as fast as they are used. But how possible is that?  
tldr: scared for the future, how do I even know what to believe"

In the future, childrearing will probably become done by a minority of highly productive professionals who have insane amounts of children to make up for the childless majority.

Governments would have to hire massive amounts of “professional parents” just to keep the birthrate at replacement level, so the job would have to well-paid and come with lots of benefits in order to be desirable enough to get about a fifth or sixth of the population to be producing nine or ten children on average.

I’m shocked that Japan and South Korea aren’t even talking about this idea. It seems just so obvious now, once I came up with it."

I wish to offer an alternative to this, buying bulk products from highly regarded suppliers across the world and distributing to members of our exclusive club. My current projections suggest higher quality, organic superfoods will be available at under half the price of typical retailers.

The initial products will be superfoods including:
1. Seeds (chia, hemp, flax etc)
2. Dark Chocolate (90%+ undutched)
3. Nuts (walnut, almond, macadamia etc)
4. Proteins (hemp, pea, pumpkin seed etc)
5. Any other superfood product which members democratically wish to source

To optimise quality-cost ratio, I am keen to minimise any unnecessary use of branding, advertising etc. The club-style nature of this group means we will grow via word-of-mouth and nothing else. The trade-off between exclusivity and economies of scale for orders will be noted as an effective balancing act. It will have a basic, sleek, no-nonsense website with a login for each member. Announcements of new batches coming in will be made, from which members can purchase until the stock is depleted. This explanation is intentionally vague, but please let me know your thoughts, criticisms, or suggestions."

I've recently delved into the discussion surrounding population growth and its many facets. One particular aspect that caught my attention was the concept of artificial wombs for humans. After watching the EctoLife video, I am left intrigued and full of questions.

I am curious about the global landscape for this kind of research. What labs, companies, or institutions are at the forefront of this field? Are there significant breakthroughs or ongoing studies that we should be aware of? 

I'm particularly interested in how this technology could potentially impact our future population growth. Could artificial wombs be a solution to declining birth rates in some countries or pose a new set of challenges we need to address?

I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could shed some light on these topics or point me towards resources where I can learn more.

Thank you in advance for your insights!"

That's when testosterone is highest, we have the most energy. Our bodies are the healthiest at those ages and so criminals committ more crimes. As they age they become less and less criminally active because of shifts in hormone levels for example. Then once we cure aging and everyone has the body of a 25 year old until they die. How do we deal with anti social behaviour never mellowing out? The crime rates would soar because their criminal careers never end.

How do we deal with that?

Don't give this cure to rapists and murderers? Yet that would be the same as capital punishment which would be frowned upon if we gave to everyone indiscriminately. What's the solution?"

One reason is the ""winners take all"" basis of democratic rule, where in cases where the margins are fine, regime change can happen rather frequently. 

If you look at India, it's a country that ought to be destined by greatness, but it is held back by incessant politicking that has only gotten worse. The politicking at the state level holds back progress at the central level, and there is no cohesive strategy between state and federal levels.

Contrast this to China, where there is absolute rule and it cannot be denied that China has prospered where others haven't. Or to a lesser extent Singapore, which is guised as a democracy, where the ruling coalition has maintained an iron grip since independence and where progress has been abundant.

If indeed modern democracy has reached a breaking point, what comes next? "

One important caveat is the price tag - most of these ideas are absurdly expensive, so I'm not considering this here. There's also politics and water rights issues, but I just want to spark some discussion here! 

After reading Ministry for the Future and it's rosy outlook for California, especially when addressing climate change and desertification, I was wondering if it's possible to take this a bit further to solve our current set of problems, that includes: 

1. Desertification and emptying out of basins which lead to pollution problems such as the Salton Sea and Owens Lake/Valley
2. Lack of water across the state to meet all of our needs and obligations (e.g., farming, cities, keeping rivers sufficiently full)

Solutions from Ministry for the Future: 

* Retention basins placed above soft spots above aquifers that store water and recharge aquifers during wet years and drain during dry years
* Active afforestation of California 
* Electrified transit across the state

My additions: 

* Build a multiple of the amount of renewables, like 2x or 3x that  we need in California alongside sufficient storage (ideally batteries AND pumped hydro, more on this later)
* Use the excess power for a big number of desalination plants (at least 100) all along the coast and inland that also filters waste water to make it sufficient for drinking.  The advantage of a big distributed system means you can make many smaller, modular desalination plants that also make less brine, reducing the climate impact. In certain areas like the Salton Sea, it might be a good way to capture various products from the water, like salt, lithium, fertilizer, etc
* If lithium mining is successful, we can also have a large industrial size battery system to help with the peaks/valleys problem that solar traditionally has
* With sufficient power, we can convert transportation and our infrastructure to 100% electric across the state (trains, cars, homes, etc). This cuts out 60-80% of all of our carbon emissions as a state. 
* Once there's enough water flowing throughout the state for all uses, start running the California aqueducts and dam systems backwards for pumped hydro storage and water storage for dry years
* Once the dams and aqueducts are at maximum capacity, start refilling basins that have historically been dry like the Salton Sea, Owens Valley, and portions of Tulare Lake. This also means having enough water to keep rivers flowing year-round 
* From there, we can massively expand afforestation and greening efforts which will also have the knock-on effect of stopping desertification. Excess water can either be pumped further up the Sierra to create artificial snow and glaciers during winters, or pumped into the Colorado to share with other states. 
* With the excess power, we can also run large CO2 capture programs at scale as well. I don't know if this is feasible, but it would be great to make some sort of artificial coal and then use industrial processes to convert that coal into inert diamond-like material to sequester carbon forever 

While I know the price tag is 100% impossible, is all of this feasible with current or ""on the horizon""

1,2023-12-30,Flying cars are NOT the same as planes or helicopters,u/badgpt22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/18ushxb/flying_cars_are_not_the_same_as_planes_or/,Futurology,"There's a recurring debate I see whenever someone asks why we don't have flying cars yet.  Usually it involves one or more people chiming in that we already have them, and that they are called planes or helicopters.

I think this comparison misses some crucial differences, so I wanted to break it down:

1. Dual Functionality: Flying cars are designed for both road and air use, unlike airplanes which are strictly for flying and require airports.  I think we can all agree this is one of the main differences.

2. Size and Urban Use: Flying cars are envisioned as more compact and tailored for personal or small group use, ideal for urban environments. In contrast, airplanes are larger and suited for longer distances.

3. Advanced Technology: The tech in flying cars is a blend of automotive and aviation innovations. They often feature VTOL capabilities, something airplanes generally lack.

4. Infrastructure and Accessibility: While airplanes need extensive infrastructure like airports, flying cars aim to utilize existing roads and smaller spaces. Plus, flying cars are expected to be more accessible to the average person, without the need for extensive pilot training.

5. Autonomy and Networked Systems: A key vision for flying cars is AI operation, minimizing the need for manual piloting. 

IMPORTANT: They're also expected to be part of a connected network, communicating with each other for optimal routing and safety – a step beyond current airplane operations.

6. The Physics Challenge:  I saved the most important one for last. Greatly advanced physics is required to make flying cars viable. To match their science fiction counterparts, they need to be energy-efficient, capable of navigating tight urban spaces, and safe for daily use. They should be able to stop on a dime, and hover in one place.  This is not just about making a smaller airplane; it's about rethinking flight mechanics and urban mobility from the ground up.

To me, these points clearly show that flying cars and airplanes are fundamentally different. It's not just about shrinking airplanes; it's about a whole new approach to personal and urban transportation.

Thoughts on this?"

by the way we see dating now, it will change soon, and we will revert to a new calendar system, and refrain from using language not accustomed to our english dialects.

Therefore the names of days of the week, months, will change to english meaning (for english speakers / countries), and the dating system will stop, because there is no future the way one predicts futures if source reference points are miscalcuated, word or time and date stamps.

we cannot see a future, based on a reference point of gregorian calendar forces.

the way those of the present can see a future, needs to be redeveloped. our whole currency of ""langauge"" has so thwarted our attempts to predict and care for our lands and people or ourselves

that any langauge mislabling time and date stamps, can near miss all the good stuff, so even though some see and get it right, 

one mis pronounciation of a word can cause a change of choice patterns from memory, that as long as  someone is misguided my internet speak our future will be guided by whoever controls the source languages.
