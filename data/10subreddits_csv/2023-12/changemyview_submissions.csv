20,2023-11-30,CMV: Egypt was the most accomplished and influential African civilization,u/Seachili,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/187xyio/cmv_egypt_was_the_most_accomplished_and/,changemyview,"When the Cleopatra Netflix documentary came out, I saw a lot of racial anxiety over not just the race of Cleopatra but of the ancient Egyptians themselves. This led to many people saying something along the lines of “they don’t need to claim Egypt when Africa had so many civilizations which were just as accomplished” This post is not intended to debate the race of the ancient Egyptians or deny that Africa had other civilizations. I am merely stating that none of them accomplished anything comparable to Egypt or many other influential civilizations. The civilizations/cultural spheres I list are not the only influential civilizations/cultural spheres and I am not listing all of their accomplishments.

**Egypt**

It was independent cradle of civilization and  it stands out due to forming at the dawn of recorded history, contrasted to the many civilizations that existed in antiquity and beyond.

Independently invented a writing system that indirectly fathered  (via the Phoenicians) most alphabets used today

Architecture projects that have impressed the world for many millennia

Some of the earliest use of geometry and algebra

Significantly influenced the modern calendar

Influenced later civilizations such as Greece

**Mesopotamia**

This cultural sphere share many of these accomplishments with the Egyptians such as some of the earliest use of geometry and algebra and influencing later civilizations such as the Greeks.

The first cradle of civilization and had an influence on Predynastic Egypt

They had the oldest writing system. This includes the first work of literature, the Epic of Gilgamesh

Babylonians have even been shown to have used primitive calculus.

**Greece**

Majorly shaped mathematics as we know it today through the use of proof, axioms, and deductive reasoning

Shaped science with some of the first natural philosophers (Milesian school) and a precursor to the scientific method (Aristotle)

Discovered the connection between natural/physical laws and math. For this Archimedes is widely considered the first mathematical physicist.

Multiple scientific discoveries, including heliocentrism, the roundness of the earth, precession of the equinoxes, calculation of the size and distance of astronomical bodies, and the brain as the seat of consciousness.

**China**

Helped shape the modern world by inventing printing, gun powder, compasses, and paper.

Independently discovered/invented the method of exhaustion which they used to solve mathematical problems now solved by calculus.

First instances of drilling into the earth even mined natural gas with this technology.

Invented the first earthquake detection device.

Shaped the culture of much of East Asia through its philosophies (daoism, confucianism). Even what we recognize as Zen Buddhism is Chinese.

**India**

Invented the modern number system

Developed many new philosophers and new religions (Jainism Buddhism, Sikhism, and Hinduism are the most notable. Buddhism has spread over and influenced much of Asia.

Once again, this is obviously not an exhaustive list of influential civilizations/cultural spheres or a complete list of their accomplishments. Its purpose was to establish an idea of an influential civilization and why other African civilizations, besides Egypt, don’t measure up. As far as I know, no other African civilization can 'claim' mathematical theorems, scientific discoveries, schools of philosophy that influenced other civilizations and continue to influence the world, or a major invention that has shaped the world.All of this is a massive contributor to the racial anxiety surrounding Egypt."
57,2023-11-30,CMV: Biden would defeat Nikki Haley,u/dna1999,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/187yfrf/cmv_biden_would_defeat_nikki_haley/,changemyview,"I know everyone here is talking about how the polls show Nikki Haley leading Biden by 10+ points in the swing states, but I honestly think it's a product of her being an empty vessel more than anything about her. Biden and Trump both have clear, distinct negatives. As for whether those criticisms are fair, that's an entirely different question. If Nikki Haley consolidates the non-Trump vote or he gets disqualified by SCOTUS, I see three big problems facing her campaign:

1. She's more of a neocon, which the GOP base doesn't like. One thing Trump did right politically is he moved away from unpopular Republican positions on cutting entitlements and foreign intervention, and Nikki Haley is a return to that old position. She would probably lose PA, MI, and WI, then be even money for Iowa, Ohio, and NC. She would likely win back AZ and GA, then have an outside chance at VA, CO, NM, and NV. 
2. The MAGA-verse would likely want a full pardon for Trump for their votes, which would alienate the middle. She loses no matter what. 
3. Nikki Haley is known to be willing to say or do anything to get ahead. American voters responded poorly to the last woman perceived as ""power-hungry"" and expedient who ran for president. I don't think we've changed all that much since 2016. "
883,2023-11-30,CMV: Saying 'Yeah' isn't disrespectful,u/FormerBabyPerson,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18805hr/cmv_saying_yeah_isnt_disrespectful/,changemyview,"When I was younger I was in a group and we were having a discussion with the leader, an older guy. He asked me something and I said “Yeah” but before I could complete what I was saying he interrupted and said “yes”. I didn’t really understand what he meant but later he asked something again I said “yeah” and again he interrupted me saying “The proper term is yes. You should speak respectfully to people who are your elders. Do you say yeah to your mother” to which I replied “yeah. I’m not gonna change how I talk to make you feel better”.  
  
I’ve seen this happen a few times through my life both with myself and others. Saying yeah or any other way of speaking isn’t disrespectful. It’s just a way that a person has learned to talk and it doesn’t show respect or disrespect. The context of what they’re saying does. It’s like saying someone talking with an accent is disrespectful because it's not how you specifically want them to speak. "

48,2023-11-30,"CMV: All ""Religion is This"" Arguments Are Naive",u/Accurate-Isopod-360,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1880cnw/cmv_all_religion_is_this_arguments_are_naive/,changemyview,"Ever read an athiest or Christian ramble about why religion is either essential or idiotic? I see it all over this subreddit -- mostly people saying its a plague or inherintly destructive to society.

Religion is the belief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers, regarded as creating and governing the universe.

All squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares; likewise, all evil/stupid religious practices are religion, but not all religion is evil/stupid.

Religion has violated the rights of millions of women in the Middle East. Religion has also led to the formation of the Catholic church, a church with the love of money (the root of all evil, as stated in the Bible). 

At the same time, America's founding fathers built a system of goverment with the sole purpose of protecting man's inablienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. They did this not out of purely secular logic, but belief that our creator intended for such liberties be endowed within every equal man.

It turned out that this system was incredibly flawed; however, Religion has also inspired Martin Luther King Jr. to lead the greatest civil rights movement in American history. A civil rights movement based upon love and respect for one another. He is celebrated by pretty much everyone, regardless of faith, even though he derives most of his ideas and argument from God and other believers.

Some of the greatest scientists (like Albert Einstein) believed in a God; there is no possible argument that a creator (notice how I am not naming a specific religion or practice?) is somehow anti-science or anti-creativity.

Charles Darwin (the one who discovered evolution theory) believed in a creator, and yet, I see people use his ideas to disprove creation. The story of Adam and Eve isn't the only religious idea behind creation!

When I go to church every sunday, we pass out food to the homeless, sing together, and celebrate our love for one another.

It is an incredibly complex, abstract genre of ideas. Religion is so many things. It has been both the cause of awful wars, and source of break-throughs in morality. Some organized religions are cultish, others, open to anyone regardless of culture, race, sexuality, etc.

Many redditors preach their faith in various subreddits, and claim themselves more righteous because of their beliefs. Similarly, many redditors on this platform believe religion to be evil, stupid, an opiate of the masses, illogical, or pointless. They proceed to build an argument using specific religions/specific examples from religions without acknowleging its incredible complexity, variety, and nuance. 

Most arguments on reddit, with a ton in this sub, about ""religion"" creates confusion, hatred, and chaos because they fail to praise/attack specific aspects of specific religions.

Stupid example:
Lets say I'm at the gym and some dude on the bench press starts yelling at me because I asked for a turn. I dont then go on reddit and say ""men are bad because of toxic masculinity caused by testosterone."" Instead, I should say: ""roid-raging gym rats are annoying because of toxic masculinity caused by testosterone."" See how, by not generalizing, I manage to create an intelligent, rational, and approachable argument? It's still debatable, but not so confusing and vague that it comes off as hostile.

Religion is deeply rooted in almost all society and culture; It is not a primitive version of science; it should not be supressed and it should not be forced; It is not inherintly good nor bad, genius nor stupid. 

We need to stop treating religion like its an idea that's objectivley right or wrong.

However, the upper house, the Canadian Senate is wholly unelected. They are appointed by the Prime Minister, and serve until age 75. And there are not merely a rubber stamp, they wield real legislative power. The Senate does debate, reject and/or make amendments to bills passed by the elected House Of Commons([example](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/poilievre-calling-on-unelected-senate-to-immediately-pass-farm-fuels-carbon-tax-bill-1.6664093))

I don't know why the world considers Canada to be a full democracy in light of this incredibly undemocratic institution, probably because it is western and not particularly repressive, as well as ignorance of Canadian politics generally."

1,2023-12-01,CMV: It’s worth attending couples counselling after repeated cheating and lying before settling on divorce,u/MissInkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1884q5i/cmv_its_worth_attending_couples_counselling_after/,changemyview,"My (29f) husband (32m) and I have been married 3 years, together for 6. To cut a very long story short, he cheated on my one year ago. We worked through it and moved on, yet this week I find out he has again cheated with the same woman. 

In the immediate aftermath he deleted a number of apps where he was messaging her and also consumed huge quantities of porn on a daily basis. In the days since, he has redownloaded at least two of those apps, lied to me about it, and I don’t know if he’s messaging anyone. 

I had already booked a relationship counsellor before I found out he cheated again this week as he says he’s been unhappy due to lack of sex. In my experience, the lack of sex is due to my mental illness exacerbated by ongoing lying, lack of consideration or care for my emotional needs, lack of romance, etc.

I’ve already left our home to stay with my sister yet part of me wants to attend counselling to get a professionals perspective on both our sides. I can’t say whether I’m open to reconciliation if he ever showed any meaningful change or remorse for what he’s done, but I can’t rule it out. 

I feel this internal pressure that counselling and trying to make it work is what is expected of me and I would feel shame and embarrassment for proceeding with a separation. So, change my view. Is counselling and trying to “make it work” actually necessary when you’ve been hurt, or is it okay to separate without giving him a (another) chance for change?"
105,2023-12-01,CMV: The list of swear words is outdated.,u/LucidCunning,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1885f5m/cmv_the_list_of_swear_words_is_outdated/,changemyview,"First of all, I'm American. Please keep this in mind. I'm genuinely quite curious to hear the perspective from other countries, though.

I'm not even sure if my title is completely accurate, but I've been thinking about this lately. I was born in 1985, and I remember growing up in a world where saying, ""Shit"", ""Bitch"" and, ""Fuck"" was infinitely worse than saying the N word or, ""Retarded."" Considering that latter, your parents either used them at worst, or told you to be sensitive with words like that at best... but you could get soap in your mouth if you said the former group of words. (A Christmas Story vibes.)

The definition of swear words is hard to pin down, but ultimately does it not come down  socially taboo words that in certain situations, you should not say? They are words you feel naughty saying behind closed doors, because you should not say them. Or... perhaps instead are ""swear words"" a static list of pre-selected words that can not, and should not be updated even if in two more generations no one gives a shit any longer?

I feel like we've gotten to the point in our culture where our list of swear words is becoming archaic, and because nobody has ever thought the list needs a revision or an update, the words we currently deem ""swear words"" fewer and fewer people take offense to. There are quite a few words on the market these days (not gonna share all the others I know), that our culture has decided are far worse than the supposed king of bad words: ""Fuck."" (Probably the safest example I can give of this is the word, ""Cunt."" The two used be actually be debatable for the true worst swear word. These days ""Fuck"" has lost its potency while ""Cunt"" has not.)

I'm very open to debate on this. I'm genuinly curious how others view this issue. I find how our social climate is changing to be fascinating, and I'm genuinely curious how much more things will change in the next few decades, and what other words will become taboo.

I have a feeling that traditional swear words will continue to get more and more tolerated as times goes on too. At what point do we update the definition of swear words?"

1,2023-12-01,CMV: We should change the narrative on the term “Indian”,u/thatmitchkid,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/188a5u3/cmv_we_should_change_the_narrative_on_the_term/,changemyview,"This is referring to people otherwise called American Indian, Indian, Native American, Indigenous, or Native; not the people actually from India.

We started using “Indian” because Columbus was trying to get to India, hit land & was like “This is India, you’re Indians!”  To which they likely responded, “Umm, ok, what’s India?”  Somewhere shortly thereafter we discovered it wasn’t India at all.  Other countries started expeditions & colonization, “Hey, what should we call these people?”  “The Spanish called them Indian because they were originally looking for India when they found them, but it’s not actually India.”  “Fuck it, Indian works, let’s stick with that.”  And we did, for 500 fucking years.  How is this not an objectively hilarious indictment of white people?

Now when it comes to actual the use of the term, I’m not in the group so I don’t get a say but I listened to a podcast years ago where they said a plurality of that group actually prefers the term Indian (I can’t find it to link so feel free to show me I’m wrong).  At the very least, [there’s wide disagreement](https://americanindian.si.edu/nk360/faq/did-you-know#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20Native,preferred%20by%20many%20Native%20people).

Obviously, we should call people whatever they want to be called but I think if we change the narrative around this term we can take the sting out of it, or at least redirect it to white people.  If we change the narrative in this way, it would also serve as a regular reminder of how badly that group was dicked over because few, if any, groups in history had it worse.

Edit:  my view has been changed but I didn’t assign any deltas because the lack of agreement changed my view, not any particular user.  I don’t feel strongly enough about this to think I’m right when everyone says I’m wrong."
1,2023-12-01,CMV: Some People (Maybe Even a Lot) Have Genuinely Perfect Lives,u/NomadicContrarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/188ae00/cmv_some_people_maybe_even_a_lot_have_genuinely/,changemyview,"Hey everyone. 

So I (24M) will make this as quick as I possibly can, because this is something that's been affecting my mentality for the past 10 or so years (which unsurprisingly coincides with a lot of the feelings of inferiority that have been suffocating me). I know this post may be strange coming from a guy, but I needed to get this out there cause I've been holding it in for too long. Although I will be sharing only one example, I hope to take a lot of the insight that you guys (hopefully) provide and apply it to other situations as well.

It seems that over this past decade, I have come across certain people who seem to genuinely have it all. What do I mean by that? Well to put it simply, I mean that they have genuinely perfect lives without any real, or at the very least trivial, problems.

To give you a concrete example, there's this one Instagram influencer/blogger/entrepreneur called Mary Orton (though I'm sure a lot of you Americans would know of her), who I envy quite a bit and here's why. She was born into a really well-off family (both parents were lawyers), she's pretty attractive, got married at a prime age to an equally attractive and successful husband (27 going on 28). and is basically rich thanks to her being able to easily find her niche (blogging, influencing, and creating a pretty big app with her spouse). Not to mention her ease of being able to travel wherever and whenever she wants, having a nice big house, and getting to flaunt all of that on social media, which btw is where I got a lot of these feelings of envy from. I also expect her children to basically instigate such feelings in the less fortunate children around them, cause I know I certainly would have those feelings if I was in their age bracket. But in essence, it seems like she basically has no real problems in her life, and I could say the same for a lot of people like her who may not be influencers, but have many of the things I mentioned like (well-off, attractive, getting married at prime ages etc). Some of these people include the Romney family and the Robertson family, just to name a few more examples.

Even after deactivating all of my social media to avoid such triggers, that doesn't stop these feelings from coming up when I go to places like the financial district downtown and get reminded of how pitiful my existence is. Thus, I hope to hear your guys' perspectives on this so I can maybe start to try and view things a little differently, though I do expect myself to struggle quite a lot given how entrenched these views have gotten over this past decade."

1. muscles and size is all there is to fighting, or that
2. one with significantly more muscles and size can't lose to a person with less size and muscles

but that muscles and size (body mass and being tall) do help and give one an advantage.

Also, I acknowledge that

* skill and technique is a factor
* genes are a factors
   * Long arms, etc.
   * superior bone structure 
   * ability to not get knocked out easy
   * high pain tolerance
   * high energy levels
* strength is a factor
   * smaller guy can be actually stronger than a bigger guy, in which case I would think they would be more likely to win the bigger guy, if the bigger guy isn't a giant, but even then the size the other gay has is still an advantage for them.
* mindset is a factor
   * relentless smaller guy can defeat a massive and submissive bigger guy by the mere mental game.

I feel somewhat silly to even make this post, since I would think 99.99 % people already agree with this position, but because at times I still run into people who seem to be making the case that ""Being big and/or muscular doesn't help in a fight"" I put this out there as a CMV post, because I really want to hear their arguments.

Little background for me: I have worked in security (guard, bouncer, etc.) and I have seen and felt how big guys can just move smaller people around with ease and dominate them by just being massive.

So if you think that ""Being big and/or muscular doesn't help in a fight"" feel free to CMV on this topic."

1,2023-12-01,"CMV: People are so necessarily insane, that not to be insane would itself constitute a previously unrecognized form of insanity.",u/tolkienfan2759,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/188fu2l/cmv_people_are_so_necessarily_insane_that_not_to/,changemyview,"I'm going to start by dividing insanity into two categories:  insanities that assist us, in our daily tasks, and insanities that hinder us.  Insanities that hinder us are much more rare and unlikely.  Psychosis, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, etc etc etc.  
  
Instead of defining assistive insanities, I'll give three examples of insanities I think we all share, and you all can work out definitions for yourselves.  
  
1) We know how worthless we are, and yet we love one another, don't we?  Truly, madly, deeply.  
  
When I say we know how worthless we are, I mean that's why we felt it was OK for the US military to go to Iraq, back in 2003, and slaughter tens if not hundreds of thousands, creating numberless orphans, brotherless and fatherless families, and destroying the civic order that, if it had been a domestic issue, those in charge would have been loudly proclaiming the first freedom.  That's why we didn't rise up, when our government engaged in torture, and why we (in general) support the apparent right of our women to kill their children, if they're far enough prior to birth.  It's why, in city after city across this grrreat nation, we have allowed our city councils to make it illegal for homeless people to shelter themselves.    
  
Because we know that it really doesn't matter.  We know that if the shoe had been on the other foot, and if the Iraqis had had the badass military organization, and if they felt our president had been a bad bad boy, and came over here to rearrange things for us, that whoever was left when they left would make more, and it really wouldn't matter much at all.  
  
And yet, as I say, we love one another, don't we?  Again:  truly, madly, deeply.  
  
2) We know how dangerous we are, not just physically but emotionally, and yet we pursue one another avidly, don't we?  With the ultimate goal of getting as close as possible and, who knows, maybe ultimately making more of these worthless, dangerous beasts.  
  
I mean, we all learn in school that humans dominate the planet.  If T-Rexes were still around, we'd make them fetch our slippers.  We'd make them feel bad if they couldn't fetch our slippers.  And with regard to emotional dangers, popular music is full of it.  You can't get away from it.  A child of ten knows that when it comes to love, if your opposite number's lips are moving, it's probably a lie.  
  
And yet, again, we pursue one another with great energy, don't we?  We're dedicated, and intense.  
  
3) We know we're going to die, and yet that happy little drummer in our heads plays his happy tune, and we get up off the couch and get after it as though there were some point to it all.  As though getting up off the couch might, in some alternate universe, prevent our ultimate death.  
  
So much for the CMV.  What follows is going to be what I think the reasons are that we share these insanities.  I think if psychologists were to focus on insanity and its centrality to human mental life, as a way of structuring their work, they might make more progress than they have.  
  
I read David Funder's book The Personality Puzzle, not too long ago, and it was awesome.  He understands how difficult the field is, and he says what he thinks.  It's a very highly recommended introductory college-level text, in psychology.  
  
In it he mentions that expecting one grand theory of psychology to explain everything we want explained, about the mind, is like expecting a good toaster to also be useful when you want to shave.  (Or something like that.  I forget the actual analogy, but it was something like that.)  His point being that to make something that will toast your bread and also allow you to shave, every morning, would be pretty strange.  
  
And my own take is, but that's exactly what god has done with us, hasn't he?  (Assuming you have some faith, which I personally do not.)  That is why the bodies of animals are so variegated and different.  Every animal body has to do quite a few things that are not necessarily related to one another.  They have to eat; they have to poop; they have to breathe; they have to attack and defend, they have to run and hide; they have to find mates, have kids and raise them.  This is like having a toaster that also shaves you and that also gets you to work in the morning.  And that's why spiders and birds and fish and bears and people all have such variety in their bodily forms.  
  
And the mind and the body go together, don't they?  I don't think you could prove that the mind was in control; we certainly seem to believe that our minds ARE in control, and that may be an essential delusion, or it may be true, at least to some extent.  But for everything that the body has to do, the mind has to do something similar too, doesn't it?  
  
And so insanity really makes a lot of sense.  If our minds REALLY made sense they wouldn't be able to do ANY of those things well.  Insanity may be our most vital attribute.  
  
Just sayin'."
1,2023-12-01,CMV: Counting discrete units should start from the number two.,u/Tuvinator,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/188h3zh/cmv_counting_discrete_units_should_start_from_the/,changemyview,"Discrete being used to mean individual (and in context here, integer).

The simple point is that if you are counting items, you are never going to be counting if you only have one of said item. The one is always going to be present, you are only counting when #>1, so the one should be assumed.

The reason I am adding the discrete requirement is because you can add fractions to a discrete unit, and you might have 0 or more of said fraction, in which case 1 is not an assumed to always be present.

Places where counting starting with 1 is acceptable: 
Counting time in music: In this case the number of beats is not really an item being counted, but rather a positional indicator for when notes should come in.
Arrays in computers: 1 (or 0 depending on language) are positional indicators, not a count. As for loop counters, you don't want your computer making assumptions for you, so you need to define assumed things, including a starting at 1 for count of values."

1,2023-12-01,CMV: Overarching themes of ‘Mormonism’ are just simulation theory with a different vocabulary.,u/Trickypat42,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/188hocb/cmv_overarching_themes_of_mormonism_are_just/,changemyview,"I’m both a huge fan of cosmology and theoretical physics (all cutting-edge / exploratory science in general), and a fairly devout member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (ie “Mormon”). I really enjoy drawing deep parallels between typically divergent topics of science and religion because for me it’s a valuable way to introduce fresh perspectives that can strengthen or challenge my understanding, intuition and beliefs in each area, and generally promote more open-mindedness.

One such parallel I’d really like others’ takes on is the title above. To clarify my view:
- Simulation theory posits a crafted reality by advanced entities, which aligns with Mormonism in that both envision creative power, be it spiritual or technological
- Some simulation theory views include nested simulations. Mormonism (especially early periods) includes the concept of prior ""generations"" of gods and eternal intelligences. 
- Simulation theory (basically) posits the inevitable creation of our own, totally convincing simulated realities in the future. Mormonism asserts we all can attain God's creative capabilities.
- Simulation theory rests on technological capabilities to create more convincing simulated realities than we can today. Mormonism asserts there are manipulatable powers which can govern the universe that lie beyond our current comprehension.

I’m looking for discussion around and challenges to these and similar connections between Mormonism and Simulation Theory. Feel free to refer to other religious beliefs, or metaphysical philosophy as applicable. Please refrain from challenging the validity of either religious beliefs, or Simulation Theory, that’s not the purpose of this discussion.
Please do feel free to call me out on misleading inaccuracies, over-simplifications, or explain if & why any of these points are irreconcilable “apples and oranges”.



Some clarifications on my views and objective:
- I wholeheartedly believe in evolutionary theory, and I think it’s an important part of the connection here because I believe evolution does not negate creationary beliefs (happy to elaborate upon request)
- I believe in a relatively symbolic interpretation of many scriptural texts, as well as the inevitable fallibility of humans doing their best to convey learned truths in speech or writing
- What I think emerges from this is a lot of overlapping truth to be found across many faiths and traditions, but truths which often are misunderstood by others not of that tradition despite their similarities
- My objective is to help others see some of these overlaps, but also to avoid distorting other’s views just to fit into my pigeonholes and correct my own misconceptions along the way"

That aside I don't understand how comparing the power of characters from separate creative works makes any sense. To summarize my final point early, fictional works about superheroes are a refined version of children saying ""my power does x"" and ""that doesn't work because I block x with y"". This might make it sounds like I don't like these texts, but I really do, I'm just trying to generalize.

To understand what I mean if you are unfamiliar, check out the powerscaling subreddit.

Using an example to make my case:


Trying to evaluate who is stronger between, Saitama from One Punch Man to Superman from DC comics and more seems to run into many flaws. 

First is the assumption that physics are the same between each universe.

Second is the assumption that we have full knowledge of the limitations of each character.

Third is.... We just don't know how their respective superpowers interact. I know that OPM uses the idea of strength training plus limiter break as a rational for why Saitama is so strong. But how does that interact with laser vision? We've seen Saitama tank a few lasers, but what if Superman's is special. 

Which brings me to my final point. New chapters. 

If a new comic came out and had Superman beating everyother superhero/villain/wizard/etc in all of fiction at one time.... And a new chapter of OPM came out and had Saitama do the same thing, what would that mean? 

To me it seems obvious. Characters are as strong or weak as the story makes them. They arent abiding by some interwork logic that makes them all consistent enough to evaluate.

Which means that at best powerscaling between works of fiction is fanfic. 

All that said, powerscaling is a huge part of fandoms. I want to be able to appreciate it, but I can't, so please CMV."

JJK: Stands for Jujutsu Kaisen

So one of the gripes fans of JJK have are the deaths of the good guys, they don’t like it and feel it’s all for shock value, however I actually enjoy the ways characters get killed off and I’ll give reasons:

1. It’s realistic, in the job of being a jujutsu sorceror you’re not always going to come out alive, especially if you’re fighting special grades 9/10 you should be dead it’s a world consistency that I like, if we give other examples let’s look at Naruto: in the final arc of Naruto of the Main side cast o my one character dies, in what was a final battle arc only one character dies, it’s very childish in my opinion.

2. It keeps a balance, usually in series like this you have the bad guys getting mostly wiped out, while the heroes remain relatively unscathed, and no I don’t want the bad guys to win. It keeps up the image that this is an actual conflict, it adds more stakes to the story and puts it in greater perspective what will happen if the good guys lose. It’s effective. 

3. Logistically it makes sense how are you in a war or going up against thousands of like titan shifters for example and most of your main cast is still alive I’m sorry it’s stupid."
1,2023-12-01,CMV: Humor in mainstream culture is getting worse over time and will eventually fail altogether.,u/Storm_Duck,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/188p0qy/cmv_humor_in_mainstream_culture_is_getting_worse/,changemyview,"Over the past several decades, mainstream culture has gradually stopped producing novel humor and begun simply recycling it with more and more absurdity. We have started to reach a limit where content can't get any more outrageous while still making sense. I believe our appetites for humor will continue evolving and culture will not keep up. We will eventually stop finding anything in mainstream culture funny. Some examples:

\- Physical comedy has steadily gotten more outrageous and is now just losing appeal altogether.

\- Advertisements have gotten more absurd and nonsensical over time. Initially there was barely any humor, maybe a one-liner here and there (""Bet your wife would like *that*!""). Then they gradually began to use jingles, wacky animations, and bright colors. CGI added more absurdity and surrealism. Now every funny ad is an insane fever dream overstuffed with gags and content. They lean more heavily on celebrity cameos. This will all run out of gas. Can you remember the last time you laughed at a TV commercial?

\- Standup comedy is only getting more NSFW, and recycling the same bits about relationships and life stressors. There are exceptions, but getting fewer and fewer. Political comedians like George Carlin are basically extinct.\*

\- Most importantly, I believe ""intelligent"" humor in mainstream culture peaked a long time ago and has been slowly declining. In very general terms, humor started out overt, then became more ironic, then more subversive and irreverent (2000s to present), and now everything has to be both dripping with irony and also shocking in some way to make it into a movie or ad. Mainstream humor has always been more on-the-nose than offbeat or ""high-brow"" humor, but the overall cleverness factor has been on a steady decline.

I must stress, I am talking about mainstream culture. Yes, if you look in the right places, novel humor is still alive and well. But humor in the mainstream is stalling out and I can't see how it will improve. It's tempting to attribute this to our society getting dumber, as many people claim it is. But regardless of whether this is true, I think our appetites for humor are evolving (as they always have) and culture isn't keeping up.

*\*I believe standup COULD end up being the one exception to my main claim here, since it's an unfiltered medium for smart people to share smart, funny things. We could see a resurgence in high-quality standup even as comedy movies, TV, and advertising crash and burn.*"

Because the world is becoming more and more divided and polarized based on fundamentally different economic and political systems every day. The mentality of ""us vs them"" is becoming more and more prevalent even among many political and military leaders. And we are witnessing the side effects of this mindset every day. The catastrophic 'War on Terrorism' is one example. Putin's megalomaniac way of thinking and subsequent Russo-Ukrainian War is another example. The existence of third-world countries can greatly help solve this.

1. Changes that are possible within a certain country are highly limited. Most nations in the world right now are too bound to the existing economic and political interests. The recent war in Gaza is a perfect example of this. I do not support either the Israeli government or Hamas. They are both awful organizations that do not truly represent the citizens living there by any means. In my opinion, they are both heavily responsible for this war and for missing the opportunity for this conflict to stop since the 1990s overall. However, most Western, so-called 'first-world' countries supported the Israeli government from day 1. [More than half of the American voters called for a ceasefire in Gaza.](https://pro.morningconsult.com/analysis/poll-cease-fire-gaza) But only a handful of representatives support it. Why? I think the biggest reason is the long history of economic, social, and political ties between many Western countries and Israel. It is impossible to break this tie overnight. Even if we start to solve this problem by protesting, voting, organizing, etc. right now, it will take several years if not decades or centuries. A neutral third-world country can play a big role in making change. If even neutral countries oppose our opinion, many people might think that there may be something wrong with our approach right now. One famous example would be [Olof Palme's famous speech condemning the American bombing of Vietnam.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGm4es5rJnQ)
2. There are always more than two options to choose from. Third-world countries can make these different options more viable, stable, and realistic. I think right now, there are just two relevant options for countries of the world. One is the free-market liberal democracy in the USA and EU. The other is the authoritarian state capitalist system in China and Russia. Any other direction is mostly irrelevant. In other words, it is too easy to have a mindset like 'but he's our son of a bitch' or 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend' right now. If there are countries in the world that offer more diverse alternatives, we can avoid these harmful, dichotomous ways of thinking. And if we can discuss and experiment with more alternatives, it will certainly help the development of humanity overall."

1,2023-12-02,CMV: Dating as a young Gen Z man is pointless.,u/primalvigoni,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1890c7g/cmv_dating_as_a_young_gen_z_man_is_pointless/,changemyview,"NOTE: **I am NOT talking about the older part of Gen Z and I am NOT talking about generations older than Gen Z. I am talking about an extremely specific demographic of men. (No older than 24)** 

Dating as a young Gen Z man is pointless. Gen Z is literally the generation of social media. And we predominantly use more social media than any other generation (except for Alpha, since they’re now also called the ‘iPad kids’ because they’re growing up with iPads) 

[Gen Z are currently having less sex compared to previous generations](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/young-people-less-sex-than-parents-did-at-their-age-generational-shift-asexual/)

There are other similar sources that say the same thing. Gen Z are basically struggling to date. And there are a few reasons. Social media, dating apps and the pandemic. 

Social media has messed with people’s minds, especially younger people. Things such as beauty standards, body shaming, double standards, and the increasing misandry and villainization of young men *by younger women on social media platforms, (like Tik-Tok).* 

Toxic culture being embraced on social media (example, when girls ‘expose’ their exes for ‘being broke’ and not taking them out for fancy dates) 

Dating apps have completely fucked it up for young men. A huge chunk of young men are on dating apps and can’t even get a couple of matches. Whereas it seems older guys can get matches much more easily, because it *seem* like younger women would more likely get together with an older man since men their own age are considered ‘undesirable.’

Lastly the pandemic. Yes I know the pandemic has affected *everyone*, however in terms of dating for younger people, it has affected them because the pandemic has stripped away crucial years of social development for young people. 

This is why more young guys are willing to stay in and play video games instead of actually going out *because* they lack the social development skills that they would have likely learned in their crucial years if it wasn’t for the pandemic. 

And no, we can’t just learn social skills through YouTube if anyone thinks it’s “easy to learn”, because it’s not. We missed out on those years for **social development.** 

Dating for Gen Z is much different than older generations. Yes, the fundamentals are the same **however** it is unfair to compare Gen Z to any other generation. 

The silent generation and boomers never grew up with social media, millennials will never know what it’s like to work in the post Industrial Revolution and Gen Alpha will never know what MSN is like for Millennials. 

I bring this up as an important point to showcase how Gen Z *is* different when it comes to dating, and comparison regarding for every generation is redundant because *every generation grew up differently with a set of their own norms and culture.* 

Now let’s talk about the reasons why people date and get into relationships in very simple terms: Companionship, attraction, personal growth, marriage, sex/reproduction.

For Gen Z, if we already struggle socially and only have our own solitude, is there a need to look for companionship if we’re likely to get rejected? 

 If most women are age are into older men, what’s the point of putting in effort to ask out a girl if we’re likely to get rejected (based on probability), we can focus on personal growth by ourselves, marriage is out of the equation and we already aren’t having sex and aren’t/cant start a family to have kids. 

If a young Gen Z guy is struggling to lose his virginity or date, they can just hire some onlyfans creator who’d be willing to do the deed for $200. 

When technology becomes extremely advanced where there are actual robots or humanoids, I can see a huge majority of guys going to ‘date’ these robots instead of human women. There is too much hassle dating women for younhg Gen Z men (and I argue maybe even future generations) If a robot or humanoid can provide us companionship (or even sex of the technology is extremely advanced), there is no reason to date. 

Dating as a young Gen Z man is pointless. CMV."

I'm an older person that was raised back in the day when asking someone a question normally meant calling them or heading on over and knocking on their door. It seemed there was an unspoken rule that you didn't call/knock outside of ""daylight hours"" which, while maybe different from area to area, in my area we accepted that to be 8am-8pm.  It was just plain rude to try and contact someone before 8 am or after 8pm unless it was an emergency or you owed them money.

Fast forward 40 years and now digital communications has taken over and you can email, text, call, dm, make a social media post, etc. people at any and all times of the day. I think there are two disparate types of communication -- non-direct like social media posts and DMs and I think even email would be in this class, and the other would be more direct communication via voice/text/video call. In my experience, with the exception of text and phone/video calls, you need to tell your device to allow the application to send you notifications. However, as soon as you unbox your phone it is able to audibly notify you of incoming/missed text/phone/video calls with no additional effort from you.

Recent advances has given us the ability to turn on DND where you can automatically create a ""digital quiet room"" in which you essentially, in one fell swoop, opt-out en masse to all incoming communications for a certain time period.  It even gives us the ability to schedule it to turn on so we don't even need to remember to ""take the phone off the hook"" each day so you can just set it and forget it and reap the benefits in perpetuity. 

**CMV Reddit... is it OK now to send all messages, specifically text and phone/video calls, at any time of the day or am I trying to shirk my responsibility of consideration for others' (other's?) time and trying to shift the burden to the recipient?**

Back to my point, I have this view because I heard people saying that you should show your spouse your phone if you have nothing to hide. I disagree with this stance because privacy is an important thing to want. You should be allowed to not show your spouse your phone if your spouse also holds the same stance of privacy concern as you. However, if you and your spouse disagree with each other about privacy, then you should choose a new spouse.

To change my view, you should provide why it is not okay to not want your spouse to look at your phone."
13,2023-12-02,CMV: Automatic speed restriction sign recognition isn't advanced enough yet for how much trust drivers put in it,u/Finch20,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1893eqf/cmv_automatic_speed_restriction_sign_recognition/,changemyview,"New(er) cars often have as an option that they can recognize and display the speed restrictions signs to the driver.  This (to the best of my knowledge) works by having a camera look for these signs.  And it's pretty good at spotting things that look like speed restriction signs.  However what it isn't very good at is determining if that sign applies to you.  

An example: [this zone 50 sign](https://www.google.be/maps/@51.1063948,4.5208461,3a,75y,230.25h,79.26t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sjN44PinbKkNwCJjlCH3uLw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) has been turned to right for so long that google street view even shows it.  It still looks like that today.  That road is a 70 road (outside of a built up area without any other speed restriction => 70km/h).  Anyone paying attention will notice that sign and see that it does not apply to you even though it is in the correct spot (right of the road, kinda facing you).  It's clear that this sign has been twisted by (presumably) an agricultural vehicle exiting that side road and turning right.  You can also see the corresponding zone 50 end sign on the right (next to those electrical boxes).  Another indicator of this is that if you continue in the same direction of travel for a houndred or so meters you come across [this](https://www.google.be/maps/@51.1043993,4.5169365,3a,75y,258.84h,77.1t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sx1S7VXvnqIPKJr5r84ICCQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) 70 sign.  You never find regular speed restriction signs in a speed restriction zone.  However cars (my own included) do recognize that zone 50 sign and people who rely solely on that slow down to 50.  

Now this is only one example of a place where I've seen this happen numerous times, always with newer vehicles that are (presumably) equipped with sign recognition.  I'd show a few more examples but they are too close to where I live for me to comfortably share them on the internet.  And it's not just in my local area, I often encounter this when traveling further (by Belgian standards) away from home.  I'm also not the only one that noticed this, many of my coworkers also complain about this issue.  Those that have higher end cars that will automatically set the cruise control to the speed restriction also complain about things like upside down 30 signs (they are upside down to indicate that they do not apply) get recognized as 80 signs.  Even though they passed a regular 50 signs a few meters before.

Drivers rely too much on what their car is telling them, especially when they are in an area that they are unfamiliar with.  Yet this technology isn't on point enough yet to be relied on so much.  

Now why this CMV, I basically want to know if it's just Belgian road signs being poorly placed/managed (which is entirely possible, Belgian roads in general are [notorious](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/2ijw88/the_road_between_the_belgian_and_dutch_border/) for poor maintenance compare to our neighbours.  Is this different in other places?  Is this tech good enough in other countries to have an accuracy rate well into the 90%?"

1,2023-12-02,CMV: More women are attractive than women because it significantly easier to be attractive as a woman than it is to be attractive as man.,u/wettigingss,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/189592b/cmv_more_women_are_attractive_than_women_because/,changemyview,"It’s really simple. The characteristics that make a man into an attractive man and the characteristics that make a woman into an attractive woman are diffferent. 

For men, the things that make you attractive are mostly immutable and cannot be fixed. Broad shoulders, taller, strong facial characteristics, hairline, etc. all of these are things that when formed right make an attractive man. 

What’s important is that there isn’t anything that can help make a man more attractive passed a baseline. If a man is 5’5, he’s not going to ever be a 10/10 attractive man. If a man has a recessed jawline he will never be 10/10. That’s just impossible. Maybe he will be attractive to someone, but he will never be a physically attractive man.

For women, a lot less is about immutable qualities. Incredibly short women and incredibly tall women can be attractive. See Ariana Grande (5’1) and beautiful Zionist Gal Gadot (5’10). A woman’s bone structure can be diverse, there are features that are seen as incredibly unattractive on women that are seen as attractive on men. Larger foreheads (Rihana), bulbous noses (Megan Thee Stallion), I mean look at Anya Taylor Joy she’s very beautiful, but all of her facial features are unattractive. But they don’t matter. Why?

Makeup. That’s it. Makeup handles all the flaws that make women unconventionally attractive. Be it age, skin, discoloration, hairlines, facial asymmetry even those unattractive features can be mitigated with makeup.

So you may say, “well men can just do this too”. Well yes but no. Makeup can boost a man, but not turn a man who we’d all see as average or ugly into an attractive man. Makeup for men is an enhancement as it can’t do that much for those immutable qualities that need to be correct for a man to look good. Male models wear makeup, but it doesn’t make take them from a 6 to a 10. It takes them from a 9 to a 10

Sure with women there are other things like weight, but weight is (in the majority of cases) something within a persons control and it is possible to be in shape. This is also the case for both men and women so it (if we’re being generous as it’s much harder to be muscular than it is to be thin) equalizes it.

Everything else is out of mens control and within womens control. Any unattractive woman can be an attractive woman barring medical or health issues. The same cannot be said for men."

There are societies where its permisssble for men to have more than one wife. 

A quick Google shows that some places have more than one husband.

my point is. Where did we get this notion that humans are naturally monogamous? Why do some societies believe that their god created them to be monogamous. There's no evidence to suggest everyone is monogamous. 

I'm not arguing no natural monogamous people exist but that humanity as a whole, not every human will feel most comfortable monogamous"

No manufacturer in their right mind will accept unlimited liability for millions of autonomous vehicles, it's just too great an expense. **We need a human in the driver's seat to blame**.

The same is true for even company management. Let's say AI can do a better job than any CEO. The fact of the matter is that when something goes wrong, we want to punish someone. You can't punish AI. You can't ""fire"" AI. You can't ""fine"" AI. Humans are necessary to receive punish.

In such a society, the safety of women would be considerably greater. Women would no longer have to complain about men asking them for their numbers, or being followed, or stalked, etc. Women on dating apps would no longer have to complain about dozens of new men in their inbox every day. Women could go out walking at 2 AM in the morning with no danger.

A woman would also be assured that the only time anything 'romantic' happens is when she sees/meets a man she likes and she chooses that man. She wouldn't have to filter out hundreds of unwanted men in order to get the one man she likes. She would do zero filtering because there would be no men pursuing her. Instead, when she sees/meets a guy she likes, she can pursue him. This process would greatly cut down the ""static noise"" for women, for lack of a better term. It would also mean she doesn't have to constantly reject unwanted men, since having to reject someone can be an unpleasant task - but she is now relieved of that burden.

A lot of danger or trouble in society happens now because the physically stronger and more aggressive gender (men) is the gender that's initiating to the physically weaker and less aggressive gender (women.) If it were reversed, and instead the physically weaker gender were the one doing all the initiating while the physically stronger gender were passive, then it becomes a much safer dynamic.

I genuinely can't understand People that enjoy Tea.
Sure I drink it when I'm sick, but only reluctantly. If it weren't for the benefits of the ingredients I'd rather just drink boiling water, because that Flavour is bearable. 
Tea is just worse Water, or worse than anything other it could replicate. Like why would one want to just have tea on your desk and sip on it, when Water is easily Superior. Most people try to argue with it being easily made, when I can littlerally flick a switch to get water out of my faucet. It is also extremely expensive when compared to water, just to waste energy and money on tea bags. The Americans were right when they threw the tea in the Water, because Brits have the Worst tea by far. The Biscuits thex eat with Tea are also straight ass and don't make the Disgusting Flavour better. The only bearable Tea is Moroccan tea, which actually fits with their food. These productivity bums who give any health benefits to tea can fuck off too. Furthermore, the rendition of Tea in social media is also really annoying. You see those aesthetic girls with their tea like they're something special, when I know for a Fact that it'd taste worse than the Water in the Toilets of The subway in New York. I really wanna Know if someone can justify the hype behind it and why I should take my time to cook up Water."

Usually being described as something like racial prejudice + power.

Obviously, this is not what racism used to mean. It used to just mean racially prejudiced. However, I accept that the definition of words can change. 

Therefore, whenever I want to refer to someone or something being racially prejudiced, I will use exactly those semantics in order to remove any confusion. I will also use those semantics because I refuse to give power to such an abhorrent concept as the power of someone’s group identity being something relevant and significant.

I am considering the same thing for words like sexist, misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic etc."

I recently bought a book ""My Effin' Life"" by Geddy Lee and despite his initial willingness to perform in Poland, according to ""Wandering the Face of the Earth"", he kinda engages in unacceptable antipolonism. I always thought of Geddy Lee as a person of Polish heritage, so I feel obviously hurt by this.  


While I can understand there were Polish-made pogroms (e.g. Kielce, Jedwabne, Szczuczyn, Wąsosz, Radziłów etc.), I feel like there is that unacceptable trope of ""Poland being merely a perpetrator and being worse than Germans"".    


What the hell do you mean with this? I always perceived Ukrainians, Romanians, hell even Hungarians worse than Poles for Jews and the Jewish people unfairly hate us.  I can't agree with this, because my family was victimized.  


Hell, I'm scared and confused, since the dystopian times of Israeli-Palestinian war happening and majority of zoomers being in favor of Palestinians and yes, I don't approve of it, because of my not so positive opinion on Muslims. If I say ""I support Israel"", I'm gonna be double-demonized, not only for being Polish but for siding with a perpetrator and it gives me a brain cancer, metaphorically.  


Honestly, I don't care, since I'm a feminist and I hate this country's policies towards women, at the same time, a lot of Poles suffered terribly during the occupations and Germans, Russians and Ukrainians victimized them as well as parts of my family.  


Change my view, maybe I'm a dumb and biased Pole, after all, who got sold the narrative of ""angelic and ideal Poles"" and I'm so traumatized by this.

The first one was like a 9.5/10 movie and Across the Spiderverse was at most like 6.1/10.
 I rewatched the movie to make sure I wasn’t trippin,g but, yeah it didn’t get any better than I thought.

Here is every reason why I think this:

Very little action: Pretty self explanatory. There was like one fight scene the whole movie. Two including Miles running from all the other spiderman.

The movie takes every single thing less seriously: I seriously couldn’t tell if Miguel was supposed to be a serious brute or a himbo comic relief character, the writers clearly couldn’t decide for themselves. All the characters just say things, with no way for me to describe are just not funny and all in inappropriate places. The fight scenes in the first movie seemed like the participants wanted to win and would occasionally say a one liner. Now it seems each character is in contest to say the most unfunny thing possible and are just moving their bodies along the way.

It was not as realistic as the first movie: I get what people say. “It doesn’t have to be realistic, it’s a movie about people with spider powers.” But still, when I see the first movie where all the dialogue seems very down to earth and real, and relatively speaking, the action seems to coincide with our real world, it feels unbelievably insulting when all that goes out the window in the second movie. Dialogue is very fake and makes me roll my eyes and action is no better.

Political agenda: I understand the references were subtle, but they are still a political agenda nonetheless. They are unnecessarily crammed into the movie adding nothing to the story, only to sell themselves out to cheap politics. Makes me sick how little directors care about their creations, and are willing to watermark them with stuff like this. (This reason is not as important as the others but still a reason why the movie isn’t as good as the first one)

The movie being bad isn’t my problem. My problem is the people who think it’s good or think it’s half as good as the first one.

1,2023-12-02,"CMV: People say 13/50 to suggest black people are violent, but it's actually an example of how failed criminal justice in America.",u/Snoo3014,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/189dyiv/cmv_people_say_1350_to_suggest_black_people_are/,changemyview,"The old racist 13/50 statistic that black people make up 13% of the population but commit 50% of crime is actually an excellent stat on how the justice system allows white men to commit violent crime and not face consequences and shows how police are causing the ""rape culture.""  
  
First let's define what it is even saying. The full statement is, despite making up only 13% of the population, black people make up 50% CONVICTED PRISON INMATES.  
  
Rape for example: 27% of CONVICTED rapists are black men. As soon as you start looking at the police, prosecutor, and trial process however, the stats completely change.  
  
We don't talk about this, so numbers have to be pulled from peoples favorite topics: unprosecuted rapes, and black convicted criminal stats.  
  
Of rape victims only 16.8% of white women reported they were raped by a black man.  
  
74.8% of white victims reported that they were raped by a white man.  
  
https://bjs.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh236/files/media/document/cv0842.pdf  
  
The horror keeps going, only 50 of 1000 rapists are ever arrested and sent to the DA's office.  
  
https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system  
  
Those stats break down to 50% white, 27% black.  
  
https://www.rainn.org/statistics/perpetrators-sexual-violence#:\~:text=Perpetrators%20of%20Sexual%20Violence%20Often%20Have%20Criminal%20Histories,rape%20perpetrators%20referred%20to%20prosecutors%3A&text=370%20have%20at%20least%20one,who%20have%205%20or%20more  
  
So before we have a jury listen to the evidence and to decide innocence or guilt, 90% of white male offenders who even been reported have already gotten away with it. Where as 52% of black men who are reported by white women for rape go to trial.  
  
What happens when we get to trial? The backbone of fairness and evidence in our criminal justice system? Well black men are exonerated at much higher rates than any other demographic, 53% of the time. Where as white men only receive NOT-guilty verdicts 16% of the time the evidence is presented.  
  
https://innocenceproject.org/nre-national-registry-exonerations-report-2022-racism-criminal-system/  
  
So out of 1000 rapes instances of white women:  
  
13 black men go to prison despite being 11% of the population, and only 23 white men go to prison despite being 82% of the male population.  
  
HOWEVER, if white men were charged at the same rates as black men, they would be statistically OVERREPRESENT at 190 men per 1000 reported rapes.  
  
That would be EIGHT TIMES the amount of convicted white male rapists that are currently counted.  
  
So what is happening where all those instances of rape are not being charged? Well most people have heard of the backlog of UNTESTED rape kits. I wonder what race those kits are from if prosecutors are focusing on black men who are reported.  
  
https://www.endthebacklog.org/what-is-the-backlog/  
  
And guess what happens if you don't arrest and charge rapists?  
  
They continue committing assaults! An estimated 40% of rapists are serial, and 84% of all assaults are done by serial offenders.  
  
https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/252707.pdf  
  
So you have a criminal justice system that is arresting and charging black men and putting them in prison but is allowing white men to roam the country facing no consequences and continuing to rape victims and cause a rape culture.  
  
So the next time some moron says 13/50, point out that is because system actually arrests black men for their crimes, and we allow white men to continue committing them.  
  
Disclaimers:  
  
this is not justifying black rapists, they are in prison rotting where they belong.  
  
black women report rape at levels so low it's statistically 0% against white men, so white men who rape black women do not get reported and subsequently convicted at rates to even be calculable."

Don’t talk to me about family or resources, the government does not care and wants me to die, and my family wouldn’t lift a finger to help, and even if they did, their love and support is contingent on me following their religion, which I would absolutely rather die than do. 

Even if there was some other way, I DO NOT WANT TO BE HERE. I hate humanity. I used to be the one who could find the good in anyone, even to the point of defending people who have traumatized me and ruined my life. I don’t want to be optimistic and hopeful and kind anymore, I want to be DEAD. Life is worthless. I don’t want to be around other humans anymore, I hate them. Everyone is disgusting and evil, it doesn’t matter if they’re a “good person” (which I am firmly ideologically against. No good people. Only people who are less bad than others, but everyone has darkness and evil in them.) 

Life itself is also pointless, miserable, and basically torture. Good things and experiences don’t matter because you can only feel good about them when they happen. When they’re over, it’s either neutral, downright painful and triggering, or bittersweet anyways, because the rest of life is so shit that happiness only serves to hurt you more. 

This whole world is evil and disgusting and life is only pain and suffering for the sake of some stupid dogma. I don’t subscribe to religion, and no path in life interests me in the slightest. I’m just waiting until something bad enough happens that it pushes me to suicide or I’m allowed to die"

1. No one can be sure of that. How can someone promise something which doesn’t even have a clear meaning, because “being there for someone” is as vague as you can be, and with no time limit, such as “until death do us apart “. The minute your phone’s dead and you’re living your own life doing something else, you’re not “always there for someone”, because y the only person you are always there for is yourself, as it should be.

2. As I understand it, marriage is living for someone else, a commitment no one should make to anyone else than their pets or children who, literally, can’t live without them (at least for a good chunk of time for the latter) and that, hopefully (I am not talking about children being forced upon someone who didn’t want them) were chosen, because this means you submitted yourself to someone else’s will at this moment, which you might regret later, because you have a life outside of them and if you do not, you should, because someone can’t be your whole world, it’s even cruel to expect them to fulfill all your needs. You wouldn’t expect that of a friend, wouldn’t you ? And a partner is just THE friend,  not someone who is so special they get extraordinary social powers or something.

3. What if you or they make mistakes such as not answering their phone in a time of crisis or just forgetting an anniversary or a birthday ? Are you supposed to just ditch them because they didn’t fulfill the vow they made 28 years ago ? 

4. Why marry if so many people are unhappy in their marriage or divorce quickly ? It comes with so many risks on the social, financial and emotional aspects and is so chronophagic for something that, like most other relationships, is bowed to an ending?"
1,2023-12-02,"CMV: it's problematic when Americans claim other national identities as their own, purely due to their ancestors country of origin.",u/liltooter,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/189eyt0/cmv_its_problematic_when_americans_claim_other/,changemyview,"Trying to understand the American tendancy to say they are Italian/ Irish/ Scottish, even if they've never been there. How much of this is culture, how much of this is upholding damaging stereotypes of other nationalities?

So I know this could be a potentially touchy subject for some, but it's a topic that invokes a lot of different emotions from me, so I'd like to hear some genuine American opinions on this.

As a Scottish person, when I meet Americans that tell me that they are also Scottish I can sometimes find it a but frustrating. Context is key of course, but I've had someone tell me that they are Scottish ""too"" because an ancestor way back when came from here to America. Its then often met with the American spouting off dated and offensive stereotypes to show me how Scottish they are. 

I don't know how many times I've come across people talking about being from this Clan or the great great great great grandson of a Clan chief. Or people proudly perpetrating redundant perceptions of Scottish people, and feel entitled to do so because they are ""Scottish"". I just don't like it. Clan history is Scotland is one ancient part of it. God there's so much I can say on that but I'll move on.

I've got a few Irish friends and this seems to be an even bigger phenomenon for them. I think with the troubles and Irish suppression there seems to be more 'cause' to get behind, as well as the identity.

Now don't get me wrong, I can appreciate that America is a melting pot/ salad bowl culture. Your country isn't as old as mine, infact we have universities that outdate your nation. So I guess in that sense communities can retain identities in different ways. Plus a lot of immigrant communities from the old world have grown round where the ships would dock. People settled together with the people they left with. So purely down to those historical/ geographical facts, I get why there is no 'one' American identity.

I know that A LOT of immigrant communities experienced hardship, racism, otherism and were left to live in squalor. These immigrant communities worked hard to build sustainable lives for themselves. Forged careers and businesses that became iconic within America ie Italian food. Irish pubs etc.

I can totally see the relevance to identifying as Scottish American, Italian American or Irish American. Unique communities, with unique identities that are deserving of their own American label. I guess this would make 'American' an umbrella term? 

However, I genuinely find it problematic when Americans equate their ancestral identity as meaning they are entitled to identifying with the stereotypes of the homeland.

To use Scotland as an example. We are a very socialist nation. We have a very complicated national identity within the landscape of the UK. We face serious, and I really do mean serious, issues relating to drug and alcohol abuse. We have contributed to colonialism and we have also been suppressed. What it means to be Scottish changes drastically between the East end of Glasgow and the West End of Edinburgh. I believe my countries issues are often over simplified and over commodified on the international level. I just don't like it when people misinterpret what it means to be Scottish because they are viewing it through the rose tinted glasses of ancestral love.

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate it when Americans take part in our culture. We love that yous love us. I can't speak for other communities but I know across Europe, its widely accepted that its rude when Americans expect to be accepted as a part of the old countries communities. That we are expected to act excited when yous ""come home"", welcomed ""back"" so it were. It almost comes across entitled, that you assume you know us so well, when what you know has been passed down to you from generations.

This obviously excludes people who are dual nationality. Or are raised in 1st/2nd and in some cases 3rd gen immigrant households.

I'd also like to note that there IS a distinction between journeying to view the land of your ancestors, and coming to a country and expecting to be viewed as part of that community without little to no assimilation.

So enlighten me, is there more to this I'm missing?"

Well the way I see it, people have been arguing for years that superficial plot setups and tenuous allusions to Christmas in whatever the themes of Die Hard actually do truly make it a Christmas movie.

I'm not here to shit on anyone's preferences or Christmas traditions but I don't think my bar is particularly high to say that Christmas Movies need to be *about* Christmas. In my opinion, the Christmas setting of Die Hard is purely window dressing. Yes, the plot hinges on an office party that could only happen at Christmas, but that's just the setup and isn't relevant to the core theme of DH: a lone hero who's an ordinary man in the wrong place at the wrong time unexpectedly overcoming a dangerous threats through the power of sheer bravery and gumption - linking that part of the story to Christmas is honestly pretty weak and and argument made from a place of *wanting* Die Hard to be a Christmas movie, rather than a sincerely ""researched"" conclusion.

Keep in mind when you disagree with me, it's not the people who don't take this seriously and just think this is a bit of fun that I'm annoyed by - you do you. It's people who make this argument from their whole chest and make this a core part of their personality who are the annoying ones :)"

I often get asked “can you sue someone for X”, “can you sue someone for Y”, “am I at risk of being sued if I do Z”?

Yes. The answer is always yes. You can sue anyone for anything at any time. I can walk into my office, hop make an account on my jurisdictions e-filing system, and sue my mom for emotional damages because she told me that she didn’t like the pants that I wore to her birthday party within 20 minutes. Whether I will be successful in my claim or not depends entirely on the evidence of the case, how that evidence is presented and contextualized by the parties, and the prevailing jurisdictional case law authority on how certain aspects of the claim, the evidence, or the prospective requested remedy should be decided upon or viewed by the Judge.

This is a reality that I feel is often lost on people who do not understand what the civil justice system actually represents: an ability, a *right*, for people to voice their complaints to a higher authority and say “I was wronged. Here is how I was wronged. Here is my evidence. Here is who I was wronged by and here is the remedy that I would like from the court”. The system is meant to be, and designed to be, just. That’s why it’s called justice.

In my view, the vast majority of people who say “the justice system is broken”, especially when meaning to refer to the civil justice system, do not at all understand the justice system, its procedures, or what it aims to do. Despite criticisms that one may have of the system, the fact that it permits anyone to have a chance to plead their case and show evidence is a triumph."

He was not good. 

And I understand by the 2000s when he was still being turned to why it was important to highlight him not being any good. But it just feels like Kissinger sometimes gets put on this mythological level of villainy while others who were involved in the same crimes are not as damned for them with some honestly being allowed to float into abscurity. 

I am really really not posting this just to make my point. I think I can have my mind changed and see Kissinger as a uniquely bad figure, but to be clear I do understand he did awful things. It’s not about the scale of what happened in Cambodia for example that is really going to change my opinion here, just evidence that Kissinger is worthy of blame over others in the administration and military.

I sit in the back watching the cameras. We have a snack shop. 100% of the thieves from this snack shop, under my watch, have been black people. Just now, a black man stole from the shop, and looked me dead in my eyes as I walked out and tried to hide what he stole. I let it go. Then his daughter came and did the same thing. I let it go. I have every right to kick them out, but I let it go.

The percentage of the black people that do the right thing is much higher though. Most just move to the desk, and I appear within a second. That’s what most people do in general.

However, I still have to acknowledge that 100% of the thefts were by a black person. Wouldn’t I just be a fool to ignore that number? In my opinion, this is how a person starts to become racist. They run into negative experiences with a certain race, and realize it’s only ever with that race. Even though it’s not everyone, the nature of it only being that race makes them stand out.

And so it makes them start disliking the race in general. Almost expecting them to do something bad, because 100%…

In this way, racism is almost just a logical evolution of events. It’s hard for me to blame people for being racist towards black people when this is what I deal with."

That is, you need to learn to skate, just to start doing other things in the sport.

Figure skating and speed skating both centre around skating but are the only gal for the participant; the former to make an aesthetically pleasing routine, the latter to be as fast as possible.

The only other sports I can think of that require  learning how to move in an unnatural way is, interestingly, polo and water polo. That being said, polo and animal is doing the locomotion for you.

In order to participate effectively in hockey you have to become an excellent skater and use a variety of gross motor skills to move around. Then you have to use very precise, fine motor skills to manipulate an oddly shaped object at high rates of speed. A good hockey player is constantly using a variety of finger/forearm muscles to stick handle, pass, saucer the puck, shoot, and use their stick to defend.

No other sports that uses human power can matches the rates of speed hockey players achieved without the mechanical advantage of gears. One requires aerobic as well as anaerobic conditioning to be effective and don’t forget there is a physical component as well.

It’s a way men and women who would have been some flavor of college Marxist in the sixties, seventies and eighties get to savagely criticize the current world order by showing how it’s “soiled” by the the taint of slavery. 

That’s really all it is. Capitalism bad. Which isnt exactly a brave or bold stand to take in academia. Go onto Google scholar and see if you can find a history professor talking about the benefits of capitalism. You won’t find much. What would be interesting or brave would be a spirited defense *of* the latter. That would actually take some guts. 

But instead most authors go for the “recite brutal stories of slave treatment with some questionable theories on its connection to economic development for several hundred pages and then wait for glowing reviews” 

Oh and an added bonus if there’s a mention of “neoliberalism” too. They never define *what* capitalism is or *where* it comes from beyond that 

A.) it’s bad

B.) it’s tainted by evil

C.) we need to have some vague reckoning with it (the arguments for reparations usually come up now if the author has them)

You don’t own your ideas and creations like you do physical property. I am still against plagiarism as ideas are foremost in academic pursuits. I am also against digital piracy. But in the creative arts? Ideas and creations should be put into the public sphere for others to use if they so desire. If someone makes a creation that improves on someone else’s art, then so be it. Would we lose incentive to create art if people can’t profit as much from it? I suppose that might make me cmv. Would society be worse off without copyright and ip? Explain how. There is probably a good reason why the laws are the way they are so educate me: But I still think people would pursue creative avenues and we might have even better products as there is more competition and sharing of ideas. Tell me where I’m wrong.

For example, you should be able to play any music on a YouTube video. To me it seems silly and restrictive that you can’t. Creating a song doesn’t mean you get to decide where it’s played.

Is it unfair that someone can create a great product only for someone else to make minor improvements and profit off of it? Maybe? I still believe in regulation. I think the government and private sphere should make sure products that advertise their authenticity are being honest. Can people still profit off their intellectual creations without copyright and ip laws? Not rhetorical. That’s a legitimate question. 

It just seems like these laws are pains in the asses and it’s harder to see how they benefit society. But maybe we take them for granted? Things that seem to make common sense are often worse off with greater scrutiny. I used to have libertarian tendencies because I grew up as a loner and on first examination, those ideas make sense. But I’ve grown to see the value of government. I am definitely open to cmv on copyright if you can show me how society benefits from it. It just seems like individual creators and companies want to monopolize their profits and that shouldn’t be how it is.

I could perhaps see an argument that copyright preserves quality. But I believe consumers can judge for themselves which products are worth their money in a free marketplace. And again, I believe in regulation.

Although Friends is a very enjoyable series, Seinfeld is an intellectually and artistically much superior product, as well as much more original. 

It dares to touch on politically incorrect issues and is better written. At the same time, there are several Friends plots that are plagiarized from Seinfeld (as happens to Friends with HIMYM).

I actually see them supporting upzoning, demolishing smaller buildings, and building larger ones in their place. The developers actually do the physical construction. 

The groups you do see opposing housing are homeowners. They don't need to be landlords or developers. They oppose densification. They think putting things near them will increase traffic, even though the cause of traffic is that nobody lives near anything they can walk to.

Homeowners who only own and will only own one home actually have an incentive to oppose development because the higher prices will increase the value of their one and only home. Landlords and developers, on the other hand, have an incentive to increase development because even if it reduces prices they could still have higher profits with larger quantities built and rented. 

At the end of the day housing costs are supply and demand. Demand is just the number of people looking for homes, whether bought or rented. That won't change much. But what can change is supply, and the only people opposing increases in supply are groups of homeowners, not landlords or developers."

1. It depends on which kaiser , I've heard oakland and  santa clara are really good.

3. You need to advocate for yourself. Most PCPs will focus on Xrays... I have arthritis and I know ultrasounds and MRIs show tissue immflamation better.

4. Ability to email Drs. ; keeps a paper trail.

5. Because they're so many kaiser locations, if one location is fully booked,I just call the 1800# and book at nearby locations, and my health record is available.

6. Kinda of a CON. I notice a lot of DRs at kaiser tend to be educated in the West Indies or have degrees of there....

7. See #3, if you need surgery , maybe under kaiser system ur not going to be dealing with best surgeon or latest technology. This is where advocating mauve to go outside of kaiser may come in.

As far as I know, kung-fu is limited to hand-to-hand combat only. 

Even if it does resemble some techniques, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s kung fu. Kung fu is a real martial art that will ACTUALLY hurt someone.

My view will be changed when I am convinced that she actually performs kung-fu techniques. I didn’t see any."

this is a really hateful rant, sorry.
some facts/things:
1. i do not hate detransitioners for being detransitioners, as long as they are respectful im okay with them because, who are they hurting ?
2. i am someone who transitioned young, which is a bias i suppose

my reasoning,
most detransitioners i hear about are transphobic and actively trying to take away my right to transition, which makes my view of them mostly negative because i associate them with the anti-trans shit.
a lot of detransitioners shouldnt have received care, and the medical team supporting them should have known better definitely. but, them receiving treatment in general is a privilege that they (usually) made the choice to indulge in, they are responsible for their choices as it is very hard for many people to get treatment, and they were a part of the privileged few who can get treatment. 
im also jealous that they were able to transition quickly/hastily/at all, because i am someone who has been identifying as trans for over 4 years who has had a painfully slow transition. 
i can sympathize with  detransitioners feeling victimized because the medical system wasnt thorough enough, and that questioning your gender identity can be very stressful/hard, but that doesn't change my opinion that much.

please change my view. i feel sick for being so hateful and i dont want to be scum.

also, if this breaches rule D, i am so sorry, but i want to atleast see if i can post this because i dont really know where else to look for strictly help relating to opinions. and i saw some other posts about transgender stuff, so i was hoping that this could be like.. allowed. im so sorry if i broke that rule though."

I am also generally an awkward girl who doesn't seem interested in others, so even if I am not at school, people sort of treat me the same as if I was. I always think if it's maybe they have a bad feeling about me, and I don't view it as a negative thing, because I, as I said before, tend to not care about other people's feelings. That obviously reduced my social circle, and I obviously deserved it. I have other loner kids in my school who I also think are deserving of their social lives. One is described as very childish and annoying, one has autism and enjoys talking about the weirdest things, and one's discord bio is literally ""power without abuse is a game we lose"". 

I don't know if this is out of my own insecurities, but it's just hard to believe that someone who usually goes into a social space and doesn't have many friends, is actually a flawlessly perfect person. There must be something about them that people do not like, and a lot of people do not have the self-awareness to say so.

1,2023-12-03,CMV: AI has the potential to revolutionize our society as profoundly as the Industrial Revolution did,u/GladAbbreviations337,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/189ndkv/cmv_ai_has_the_potential_to_revolutionize_our/,changemyview,"The possibilities are simultaneously awe-inspiring and alarming, but like all technology, its impact depends on how we use it and our intentions.

It's vital to start engaging realistically with AI technologies without succumbing to either hype or hysteria. I want to offer a concise overview of AI's practical potential, particularly in reducing human errors and ensuring unbiased case handling. Used properly, AI supports, not replaces, humans.

Imagine a world where people focus on what they do best, leaving the dangerous, tedious, physically and mentally exhausting tasks to robots. Intelligent technology could foster a more socially and economically equitable and unbiased society, providing opportunities for all. Here, both hardware and software make it easier to prevent and survive diseases and accidents that are currently fatal.

Envision a world thriving in climate and nature, where everyone can support themselves and their families, even if they opt out of the conventional job market to volunteer, educate themselves, or simply take a break. They wouldn't strain public finances, thanks to the immense productivity and well-being gains from AI, ensuring enough wealth to share.

Or picture a world dominated by machines, dictating our lives. Human ingenuity and entrepreneurship replaced by programming and uniformity, constant surveillance by invisible technology, privacy a mere illusion, decision-making processes invisible, effectively sidelining democracy.

In this world, loneliness and alienation are total, as machines replace human interaction, and conflicts breed insecurity and misery, with vast populations jobless and income-less, rendered obsolete by AI. A world at the mercy of self-thinking weapons, capable of annihilation in seconds, beyond human control if they malfunction or fall into the wrong hands.

AI ignites passions, with optimists and pessimists painting utopias and dystopias, while most grapple with a mix of skepticism, fear, and fascination, wondering about AI's true implications. Are we headed towards a better world with AI, or speeding towards a robot-created doomsday?

The short answer: it's up to us. The more utopian future is likelier if we swiftly start using and developing technologies towards the scenario we desire.

Companies should explore AI's diverse types without waiting for regulation or dismissing AI as a passing fad, as was initially the attitude towards the internet.

Developing these technologies shouldn't be limited to a few or people with specific backgrounds. To realize their full potential, they must be accessible and useful to everyone.

Technological progress comes at a price. What sets humans apart from animals isn't just our use of tools, but our ability to conceive and create them, and communicate our ideas and techniques, spreading them quickly and widely without waiting for evolutionary adaptation.

Industrialization brought unprecedented welfare and health improvements. Before it, the average global lifespan was around 30 years, primarily due to high child mortality. Since 1900, average lifespans have more than doubled to over 70 years, with a corresponding decrease in child mortality and rarity of famines.

Our capacity to create and use technology has led to significant progress, but it has also depleted Earth's resources, posing enormous challenges. Technologies have contributed to these problems but are also part of the solution. We can't address environmental crises without massive technological development, including AI.

AI is defined variously, but at its core, it's a computer's ability to simulate human behavior in one or more areas, like image recognition, speech reproduction, or complex game strategies.

A renowned definition is the Turing Test, named after British mathematician and computer pioneer Alan Turing. He suggested in 1950 that if a human couldn't distinguish between a machine's and a human's responses in a conversation, the machine could be considered to possess a human-like intelligence.

AI systems can learn and make decisions based on data, unlike automation software, which follows fixed rules. AI improves over time, adapts to new situations and data changes, and handles complex tasks requiring understanding and analysis.

Early AI examples are familiar, like Siri, Google, and Alexa in our homes and smartphones, and Microsoft incorporating AI as Copilot in their programs. But AI's use extends further, including image recognition for rapid identification of animals on wildlife cameras, which frees up time for core conservation tasks. AI is also used to monitor poaching and illegal fishing and to analyze patterns in large data sets for energy savings.

AI represents the biggest upheaval since the internet, potentially reshaping population patterns, economies, education, work hours, political movements, and cultural norms and standards. It could fundamentally transform how we work and create value, bringing concepts like a four-day workweek and UBI closer to reality, challenging our tax system.

AI has the potential for significant changes, causing unrest and fear in some cases. Its ability to take over tasks traditionally done by humans leads to a ""human versus machine"" perspective. However, the greatest benefit lies in augmenting humans with machines, not replacing them. Companies focusing on task resolution rather than technology will see the most productivity gains, leveraging AI in collaboration with humans for better solutions for customers, citizens, society, and freeing up employees to focus on meaningful tasks requiring strong human traits like creativity, empathy, critical thinking, and strategic thinking. We should think ""human with machine,"" not ""human versus machine"".

AI will substantially boost productivity in both public and private sectors, alleviating chronic labor shortages while significantly improving service levels and reducing waiting times across various sectors.

AI's concept isn't new, appearing in myths and fiction like Pygmalion's Galatea, Hephaestus' golden women, or Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. The Dartmouth Workshop in 1956 is often considered the formal beginning of AI as an academic discipline. The earliest chatbot, ELIZA, was created in the mid-1960s, designed for active listening in therapy sessions. Despite its simplicity, ELIZA's interactions were perceived as meaningful, leading to the ELIZA effect, where humans attribute human-like feelings to machines.

The 80s and 90s saw the rise of machine learning, with IBM's Deep Blue defeating chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1996. IBM also developed Watson, used in healthcare to customer service and known for its participation in Jeopardy in 2011.

DeepMind's AlphaGo beat one of the world's best Go players, Lee Sedol, a game known for its complexity and requirement for creativity and intuition, traditionally human traits. AlphaZero, an extension of AlphaGo, can play multiple games and has rapidly surpassed humans and other game AIs.

Programs like Bing, ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Dall-E have brought AI to the general public, with new AI solutions constantly emerging to assist with tasks from creating PowerPoint presentations to diagnosing breast cancer.

Humans tend to be more forgiving of human errors than technological ones, partly because humans can apologize and explain. We generally understand other humans, but fewer understand machines and programs. High expectations of technological infallibility mean that when it fails, it fundamentally shakes our trust.

Human judgment is often unreliable, influenced by unconscious biases and assumptions. For example, studies show that Israeli judges were more likely to grant parole early in the day or after lunch. Blind spots in our judgment have led to practices like conducting orchestra auditions behind curtains and anonymizing applications or exam papers to reduce bias.

Human errors are often the cause of accidents like plane crashes, but digital technology seldom fails. AI is good at eliminating error sources and uncertainties affecting human judgment. This doesn't mean AI should always replace human decision-making, but when used correctly, it can ensure greater fairness and objectivity in decision-making in both private companies and public organizations."

I don’t think that the Revolution itself is what started these so-called ‘problems,’ but much of what has advanced after around the 1950’s or so, especially in regards to telephones and the Internet, has led to much more harm than good. The Internet, specifically, was a great idea at first - mostly relegated to academic and governmental information sharing, I do not think that the father of the Internet, Licklider, had any idea his invention would morph into what it is today - everyone and everything being connected to the Internet, and almost everyone (in the first world) able to be reached at a moments notice from anywhere in the world. At least for myself, I think less social media, more being able to get a phone call or text at any moment in time, has lead to a drastic decrease in mental health and shaped my brain chemistry for the worst as I’ve been exposed to phones and the Internet since I was born.

I think the legitimate ‘quality of life’ increases from the Industrial Revolution (medicine, plumbing, thermostats/AC) have been great, but the more ‘techy’ sort of advancements that are contained on a circuit board are terrible for what they’ve evolved into."

Some people might claim that Kissinger was good, such as for [improving relations between the Western Bloc and the PRC](https://time.com/6340967/china-pays-tribute-to-old-friend-henry-kissinger/) (although others may think this is a bad thing), [negotiating a compromise to end the Yom Kippur War](https://apnews.com/article/kissinger-war-palestinians-israel-hamas-mideast-e0d3d89e796d7a5b2bae230615987c1e), or [ending minority rule in Rhodesia](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=52973). But despite those, I would say that my following point still stands, namely that:

***Geopolitical realities make it inevitable that more Kissinger-like figures will arise***

Why do I say this?:

* The quest to secure resources is a major driving force of foreign policy, leading to things like the Western world's close relationships with the Gulf monarchies.
* Cosying up to the PRC goes to prove that we are naturally tempted to pursue close relations with countries that offer excellent economic benefits, even if it will come around to bite us in the future.
* Countries do not like having enemies bordering them, even if they've earned the resentment of said countries (such as Cuba having bad relations with the USA, Ukraine having bad relations with Russia, or Vietnam having bad relations with the PRC).
* Sometimes it serves national interests to push for peace if it means that you can get multiple allies who don't fight each other.
* ""[Nuclear peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_peace)"" or ""[capitalist peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_peace)"" may be responsible for the [reduction in wars and war deaths overall](https://vox.com/2015/6/23/8832311/war-casualties-600-years), but this just raises the stakes that diplomats have to work with, which encourages them to resort to underhanded actions like proxy wars and orchestrating coups.

To add to my point, what's to say that future generations will see our current diplomats just like we see Kissinger? For example:

* [People on this very sub claim that sanctions on Afghanistan constitute a genocide](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15rrvlp/comment/jwa8ric/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), in which case, wouldn't that mean that Antony Blinken is the Kissinger of the present day?
* Or if you want a non-American example, what's to say that Sergei Lavrov, with his role in Russian warmongering and [support for coups in Africa](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-08-26/why-is-russia-meddling-in-west-africa/102765352), isn't the Kissinger of the present day?
* Likewise, the wave of coups in Africa struck against French-backed leaders, which means that France can be said to have Kissinger-like figures too.
* And with rapidly fraying relations with the PRC, this only feeds the rise of more Kissinger-like figures who aim to serve to preserve their nation's power by hook or by crook.

Powerful countries will inevitably produce Kissinger-like figures all the time (for example, one can say that the Dulles brothers filled this role before Kissinger). Call it evil, cynical or imperialistic, but this is the reality we live in because powerful countries have the power to get away with greed and malice. Kissinger's death fixed nothing, because history shows us that it's in our nature that if we can get away with dishonest means to further our wealth and power, we'd choose those dishonest means. 

I am not trying to say that Kissinger was good. We may not be in a battle for capitalism vs. communism anymore, but the more primal rivalries driven by greed and imperialism are still with us. Anyone who's played a Paradox Interactive grand strategy game can understand the urge to act like (or even more cruelly than) Kissinger. This is why I believe that Kissinger is merely a product of the system, and that more figures like him will inevitably arise."

When you look at the West however; its subtle, poisonous, and far more dangerous. Here is why:

- We have been constantly fed subliminal messages throughout the years, which makes us believe these are our thoughts or wants. 

- We are constantly shown how the US is the hero in movies where the whole world is at risk of dissolving and the ""president"" along with the protagonist saves the day. These movies are shown worldwide and it instills the idea that the US is the good guy no matter what they do its for the ""people's good"".

- Corporations/News/ Media see you as a consumer; marketing tactics, consumer psychology have all been applied in their messaging. No matter how mentally strong you are; getting bombarded with cues everyday will cause you to give in. There is also peer pressure because everyone is being targeted. 

- Lastly, look at how our society and culture has shifted towards a certain direction and you can pinpoint the catalysts to achieve the objective. Look at the how and why to find the answers. Popularity of hateful representatives in politics is caused by a big play here that took years to cook. Degradation and loss of family values is also caused by a big, longer, and far more poisonous play that took longer to achieve. These two reasons may seem to be a natural occurence but to see for yourself how there was a certain influence; look at the narrative and media coverage when it comes to the latter. The media can be used for our own good when it comes to knowing the truth. Just look at the other side of what they say to know it."

In the case of the new Little Mermaid, the new casting actually makes _more_ sense than the original animation’s character. That’s because the original animation movie was already far removed from European settings, so it didn’t make sense for Ariel in that movie to be a red-headed white European girl either. In fact, _that_ Ariel was pandering to white audiences, which makes sense given the time period.

While the story itself is written by the Danish author H.C.Andersen, that story and its original setting are placed in the Northern European seas and islands. Denmark has a lot of islands and coastline, and is situated between North Sea and Baltic Sea.

As someone who lives in a Nordic country, I can tell you that there is NOTHING tropical or Disney-like about these seas. There’s absolutely no colorful clown fish or coral reefs. The animation movie is clearly been resituated in the Caribbean sea. I’ve read the original storybooks as a kid, old editions, and the illustrations look very different from the animation movie. 

Furthermore, all the music in the original animation is Caribbean too. If you wanted Ariel to “remain true to the Danish source material”, then I assume that you’d also want all the songs to be re-written to suit traditional Danish folk music as well. So something like this: https://youtu.be/wVx5RJojwnA?si=35SETwMXgaQ1SlY7

Unless you wanted to change the whole setting of the movie for the live action remake, to change the species of the animal friends, change the environment, and change all of the music, then the only thing that DOESN’T fit the Caribbian packaging of the Disney version is literally the ethnicity of Ariel. If you’re looking for coherence, changing Ariel’s ethnicity to fit the rest of the movie is the easiest and most logical solution.

If you just enjoy a white Ariel better, just say that. But I’m kinda tired of seeing all the “cultural” justifications of why she can’t be non-white."

1,2023-12-03,CMV: Getting Married After 29 Is (Mostly) Pointless,u/NomadicContrarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/189sdqe/cmv_getting_married_after_29_is_mostly_pointless/,changemyview,"**\*TLDR AT THE BOTTOM**

Hey again everyone. I wanted to say thank you to those who helped challenge my views in my last post regarding ""perfect lives"", as I found the many insights to be quite considerate of my difficulties around the topic and I think I may have actually started seeing some positive changes in my mind.

I was going to wait for a few more days before I posted this next topic, but after coming across a post yesterday asking a bunch of millennials (not one myself as I'm 24) when they got married after meeting their SOs, a lot of the comments made me feel like crap and seem to have reinforced a really deeply entrenched belief in my mind that set its roots almost 6 years ago, so I felt the need to post this today, as I feel like if I can change this view, then I could change a lot more about my life and future.

To put it simply I currently and firmly believe that getting married after 29 is pointless (unless in VERY specific conditions which are explained later in my post). Why do I believe that? Well here's some context. I'm mildly autistic (which might explain these very odd views) and have never had a relationship in my almost 25 years of living, no matter what I've tried to do (apps, clubs, classes, school, mutual friends etc). Almost 6 years ago, though, when I entered the second semester of my first uni year, one of my former friends mentioned how her sister and then future bro in law (both turning 23 that year) and I remember feeling depressed for the longest time. Even though they were only 4 years older than me, this was the first of many couples I would begin to resent for being able to experience what I deeply believe is ""proper romance"" considering they were together since 19 and then got married 4 years later. But I realize now how wrong I was to resent them, given the amount of people with even better relationships that would be getting engaged/married afterwards.

It seems ever since that point that I've come across many people (some that I know of and others that are friends of people I know) who got married or will inevitably get married at what I consider to be a prime age or as I like to say ""an age that actually matters"" which is 20-29, with the earlier being more prime/""better"". Some of the couples that have really reinforced the strongest feelings in me include a couple that got married at 20 and 21 (and had a child 11 months later), a couple that had been together since high school (went to prom and all that stuff) and got engaged at 25 and then married a year and a half later, both of whom are pretty well off themselves, and a colleague of mine who's been with her partner since they were 15 (both are my age) and will inevitably get married at a prime age. I could name a bunch of other couples that I feel reinforced these views of mine (considering that I have a pantheon of them in my mind), but that would require at least 5 posts so I won't do that. 

Regardless, as I've gone through these past few years trying all these different strategies to find someone only for them to not work out while seeing all these other people having the relationships I want, I feel like my views have become even more justified considering how justified they were from the beginning with regards to marriage being pointless after 29. Here's just some of the reasons why:

1) Biological clocks. Do I need to say anything more?

2) Not getting to grow up with your partner from a young age

3) Not being able to have older relatives at your wedding (or at least less likely)

4) Less time to spend with your future children, if you decide to have them

5) Having to constantly live with the fact that you only had average or below-average love. 

Now I'm obviously not blind to the fact that a lot of people get married after 29, but I do not envy those people one bit (in fact, I have a lot of disdain and contempt for them) unless they're filthy rich, which is the only one of the few way to justify getting married later in life. Considering that I won't be a filthy rich person given the field of studies (public health), then I feel like the only thing I can do is to get out of Canada (where I live) so I no longer have to be around all these happy people with perfect (or close to perfect) relationships. I also have forsaken my desire to have children not only due to the risk of passing on my autism (which I can tell you caused hell in my life), but also because it seems like there's no point when all these people get to do it properly as they got to have relationships from a young age.

I want to be clear that none of what I'm saying I feel towards those that are LGBTQ+ as they have their challenges with this stuff and their own ways of overcoming this, even if it is harder for them.  But for the vast majority of people, I can't get this idea out of my mind that one either does it right, or doesn't do it at all, and I unfortunately feel like I've crossed the point of no return where I'm going to have to be one of those people that shouldn't do it at all not just for the reasons I mentioned, but for many others as well. This is why I said getting married after 29 is (mostly) pointless.

And for the record, only one couple that I know of that got married and had a child at a young age got divorced, the rest of them are still doing perfectly fine.

**TLDR:** Getting married after 29 is (mostly) pointless because there's no point when others get to do it at more ""prime ages"" (20-29) and when there's basically no real benefits to doing it later compared to the benefits of doing it earlier."
36,2023-12-03,CMV: Narrative storytelling is fundamental to human cognition.,u/Fando1234,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/189t5xy/cmv_narrative_storytelling_is_fundamental_to/,changemyview,"I’d wondered for a long time why we are so drawn to stories, whether it’s Beowulf or the latest Netflix show. 

On reading various philosophers I find myself drawn to a theory that narratives are in fact fundamental to how we perceive the world.

Mathematician Stephen Wolfram describes the universe as ‘computationally irreducible’, that is to say if we look at a system (e.g a ball being thrown) I can’t possibly know the position of every atom, the exact friction of the air, wind speed, rotation, force etc. It’s simply too complex.

But this doesn’t stop me catching the ball. As wolfram puts it, we create a ‘narrative’ for how the ball will travel, based on the basic data we do have. 

I believe this can be scaled up, as we try and understand even more complex human systems, we create grand narratives to explain the rise and fall of kingdoms, economic recessions, world wars. Even though in reality the causes of the effects are far too complex to compute.

This is why we are drawn to stories that follow similar arcs - the heroes journey, Icarus, man in a whole. And contain recognisable character archetypes - the hero, villain, comic relief. 

These narrative stories give us pre packaged, the basic data we need to compute their fictional universe. And do so in a sufficiently novel way to amuse us. 

Mad theory I know. Thoughts?"

primarily wealthy countries such as the ones in EU... nobody is invading any EU country any time soon and yet countries in EU are spending more than ever on their military budget, like why... how about you focus all that fucking money on healthcare, public infrastructure, transport, etc

theres a huge variety of places the countries could be spending money on, rather tahn fucking military

no war is gonna happen, stop wasting money.

And before you say, ""b-bb-ut the military comes up with new innovations and improves technology"" yes military has brought new innovations to the world, however a lot of which sole purpose is to kill people. Some actually do benefit society and so we can still fund research into innovating technology, but just not for WEAPONS OF MASS destruction and shit like that.

Basically resaerch into benefiting society? good, research into killing people more effiicently? bad.

other counter points ive seen: ""bb-b-but russia"" you silly cunt they can barely invade ukraine what do u think they can do to EU, that also has the protection of USA.

EU could go entirely without a military and rely on USA for protection, and usa would still protect EU.

so EU would save a shit ton of money and invest in what actually matters

however, i think EU should still keep some military, just in case, but not an ever-increasing amount as thats unneccessary...

KEEP in mind an attack on ONE EU state is an attack on all, so combine the entire army of the entire continent of Europe as one and also could include USA army in addition. Now you realize just how stupid spending more money on military is.

THAT SAID, for poorer countries which are destabilized by internal conflicts and gang wars and shit like that, i can understand the need for military, understandable."

This is wrong. It's wrong to hold American Muslims accountable for what radical islamists do. It was wrong to hold American Germans accountable for what the Nazis did. It's wrong to hold American Jews accountable for the 10,000 women and children that have been slaughtered in Gaza.

But if you read subreddits like /r/jewish or /r/judaism, it's clear that American Jews have a mentality that: Everyone hates Jewish people, everyone is inherently antisemitic. It's pretty shocking that American Jews see themselves as the biggest victims in this conflict, and seem to not understand cause and effect and human nature.

Let's be clear: The vast majority of people are not *inherently* anti-Muslim. The vast majority of people are not *inherently* anti-German. The vast majority of people are not *inherently* antisemitic. 

It is a natural tendency of human nature that when a group does something bad, we tend to hold the entire group accountable, even though we probably shouldn't.

But American Jews seem to not understand cause and effect. After October 7, there has been one American Jew killed in a possible hate crime. After October 7, 10,000 women and children have been slaughtered in Gaza with indiscriminate airstrikes.

Are we supposed to feel more sympathy for American Jews than for all innocents being systematically slaughtered?

It would be wrong to hold American Germans accountable for what Hitler was doing in 1945. But if every day, all we heard was their victim narratives about how they're constantly under attack, they're the true victims, and everyone's anti-German... Most people aren't going to be very sympathetic until you start condemning the slaughter going on in Europe. 

My advice to American Jews: The fastest way to reduce antisemitism in the USA? Start condemning the state of Israel, and demand that the systematic slaughter of innocents stop. If Israel wants to target Hamas, they should actually target Hamas. "

At the end of the day they are basing it off the childs feelings. They don't have the right to impact a child's development, temporarily or permanently. The child does not have the mental capacity to understand or give consent to it. When they are intellectually and physically old enough sure. But never preteens.

In no other situation do we allow a young child's feeling's to dictate such things. We don't even let them eat what they want. And don't tell me this does not happen. In America 1400 kids have gone through this in 2021 compared to 600 in 2017.

I'll try to break it down into 2 parts, Risks and Responsibility then bring it to a conclusion

**Risks**

When it comes to sex women objectively have more risks than men in 2 main forms, the first being STIs. While both men and women can get STIs women are at greater risk for long term negative health effects such  PID and infertility. Along with that if a woman does contract an STI and is pregnant, the STI can be passed onto the child. This goes in the second form where women have the ability to be pregnant and bring a new life into the world, which will have an impact on them both physically and mentally. 

**Responsibility**

The argument could be made that since sex happens between 2 people both of these people have equal responsibility and I would agree with this, myself. Personally, I don't want children so I take on a lot of the responsibility when it comes to sex even when the woman may not. Even with the extreme measure I take I know there's still a .1% chance something may happen. The problem is that many men and women don't think this way and are very apathetic to the potential consequences of sex. Assume we were bringing together an uncaring man and an uncaring woman for a one night stand. The man can leave, free and clear, and not give it a second thought. On the other hand there's a chance that the woman leaves and finds out she's pregnant down the road and now. Since both of these people are uncaring it's likely that they may have done this numerous times, each time with the woman taking on the overall burden. 

Is the man just as responsible for the outcome as the woman? I'd argue yes. But because the woman is the one that will ultimately deal with the potential negative effects, the responsibility ultimately falls on her.

The internet has given us access to repeated visuals of entire communities being wiped out from flooding, over and over again.

Examples:  tornadoes in the midwest,  wild fires on the West Coast,   Canada,  Northern Europe,  Australia.  Volcanoes  and the toxic air they spew.    Dessert and drought and famine.

Yet we just keep rebuilding and rebuilding and it almost seems like we're in denial that we haven't actually succeeded in mastering the environments on this planet.

My post was even removed because it was apparently a ""troll post"". I'd be really interested in seeing the reasoning behind not agreeing with this statement so I thought I'd post this here) 

&#x200B;

So many people protest against the idea that video games cause violence and I don't understand why. I'm not saying that nobody should be allowed to play violent video games. Of course Violence is a questionable form of entertainment but if it used in a way that makes sense then I can see why people like it in some video games.  
  
But if you're going to let a 5 year old play GTA, of course they are more likely to commit real life violence. Exposure to Violence and letting the player perform violent acts leads to the brain treating it as normal and of course that makes it more likely to happen in real life. The argument ""exposure to something bad doesn't lead to the person doing these things"" is complete nonsense and has been disproven multiple times. The majority of dictators and terrorists have experienced violence on a daily basis in their youth, typically from their direct surroundings like their family. Victims of violent trauma are a lot more likely to commit violence themselves, that's just how the human brain works. And if it happens during childhood it's much worse.  
  
It's the same with children who behave aggressively towards others. Often their parents are drug addicts and act violent themselves.  
  
I am not saying that violent Video Games are in any way comparable to stuff like this, I'm just explaining why exposure to something bad does lead to the victim becoming more likely to be a bad person themselves. Of course if you let a perfectly sane adult play GTA nothing bad is gonna happen but exposing a child who isn't even a teenager yet to violence, even if it's just fictional violence, can and often will lead to this child becoming more aggressive as an adult and during childhood, making it more likely that they will become criminals or bullies.  
  
That is why age ratings exist: To make sure that only adults who already understand violence in media and can cope with it are allowed to play these games.

It just means that consent definitely does not apply to every country. 

Consenting requires one consentable mental individual . You can consent for yourself bc you are the only mental individual within yourself. You can’t consent for your brother bc you aren’t the only consensual individual within your brotherhood, since that would require your brother’s consent. 

Whether consenting for the common public , aka, the brotherhood, is possible, it’s complicated. It could be argued (even if I don’t 100% agree with it) that if the majority agree, let’s say two out of three brothers, they could make a decision for the whole brotherhood. This would mean a hypothetical truly democratic countries can consent.  However , not every country is truly democratic. The elite in many if not most or even all countries does not make decisions that align with the opinion of the majority of the population. Many of these countries have elites that comes from entirely unjust means. Why should this elite be able to consent for their subjects? 

 Practicality is a different issue, aka people just giving power to elites for convenience purposes. However, it does not make said thing make sense in principle. I also disagree with “it’s their issue, their choice” argument bc of this logic, but that’s a question for another post."

1) rich monopolies
2) poorer people trying to start a business they can live off of.

Group 1 has an enormous workforce. Lawyers, lobbyists, regulation compliance team, large marketing budgets, etc. monopolies are more capable of providing significant campaign donations to politicians so when they get voted in, provide friendlier treatment to said monopolies. Group 1 will often want to disguise these rules as visually appealing (with some nice marketing that makes it seem like it’s part of the public’s benefit). For example, maybe a restaurant monopoly will try passing regulation for the sake of trying to get cleaner and healthier food on everyone’s plates, with the bill’s fine print specifying many more guidelines to have to follow. 

Group 1 has historically also tried lobbying politicians to pass legislation on increasing necessary requirements at work, necessary to pass inspections (an example being the medical field where it’s extremely difficult to set up smaller hospital-like clinics and why health has become extremely monopolized). 

These laws make it *very* hard for small-money folks to enter the game because they must follow rules A-Z (with not a lot of money, resources) before even being able to launch their business, whereas the monopoly has this whole process streamlined. 

So we face the issue of small families needing much more upfront capital to get started which is a higher risk move in terms of being successful.

Deregulation will increase the opportunity for smaller folks to enter the game, but as a side consequence could lower the quality of the product. But that would simply result in the consumers possibly having to do a bit of prior research prior to doing business with these establishments."

And in the same way as that slogan, perhaps someone just means the South will recover economically or culturally or whatnot.

In exactly the same sense, yelling out a slogan about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict which is entirely consistent with the Hamas Charter, which originally included a quote about rocks & bushes yelling out ""a jew is hiding here, kill him"", is too ambiguous for someone to seriously claim it's not intended (at least when Rashida Tlaib & others say it) to threaten Jews w/ genocide.

The holiday, in its traditional form, revolves around communal activities: families and friends gathering, exchanging gifts, and celebrating together. This collective spirit forms the crux of Christmas. When someone is alone, particularly if they are non-religious, the rationale behind engaging in these traditions becomes questionable.  
For a solitary person without religious inclination, Christmas traditions like decorating a tree or preparing a special meal seem disconnected from their intended purpose. These activities are designed for shared experiences, creating a disconnect for those who are alone. Moreover, for atheists, the absence of religious sentiment further dilutes any remaining significance of the holiday. Without belief in the religious aspect of Christmas and without anyone to share the festivities with, the logical foundation for celebrating seems to evaporate.  
I posit that for individuals who are alone and non-religious, celebrating Christmas is an illogical action, devoid of the holiday's fundamental essence. It's akin to participating in a ritual stripped of its meaning. I'm open to counterarguments that might illuminate a different perspective or rationale for such individuals to engage in Christmas festivities."

7,2023-12-03,"CMV: Morality is learned, conscience is feedback understanding",u/Poetic-Journey,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18a0f7q/cmv_morality_is_learned_conscience_is_feedback/,changemyview,"Whatever put us here allowed for two things

1. A biological instinct:

- The instinct of fear 
-The instinct to survive
-The instinct to mate
-The instinct to thrive 


2. A Conscience.

I will elaborate:

There is, a general divergence between our biological instincts and our conscience.

Example:

I have in the past, out of my biological fear instinct, killed spiders, exterminated flies that infested my home.

I am now 31, and I have vowed never to intentionally take another life.

I actively rescue insects from the sidewalk like slugs and worms to ensure they do not get trodden on. I make sure not to cause any suffering or take life as I have LEARNED, that what I do to me I am potentially doing to myself, or in another way of phrasing it, I would not want to cause another sentient being any harm.

I find it interesting to understand now that at the age of 31, I have developed nothing but the purest of intentions for every single living creature on this earth. I have a guilty conscience from taking away the lives of creatures that I had no right to take.

I often say to myself that if I had a time machine, knowing what I know now, I would undo some of those decisions.

However, if I had a time machine, and had no ability to change those things, the same things would have happened.

So in a sense, I have learned that morality and the ideologies I am so firm in now, were not present for me at the time of dealing with a fly infestation or crushing spiders out of my arachnophobia.

I was unable to control my instinctual built in fear system that provoked me to kill those spiders. Ofcourse now, having learned why it's bad, I would never do that, and now I actively go out my way to save spiders and have overcome my fear of them through pure intention. That same instinct that keeps me alive when a lion tries to eat me is the same fear system that was activated when I felt provoked to kill those spiders in the past.

So I then say to myself, how should I view myself as a person? I am so firm and pure in my intention to be moral and now uphold the sanctity of life to the highest degree.. by all means I consider myself presently, to be full of only the purest of intentions. But these ideologies and morals I hold now do not coincide with the actions of my past.

I have therefore come to the realisation that morality is (generally speaking) learned, in my own experience, and have come to the realisation (in my own experience) that morality is where intelligence meets emotion.

How do you all view a conscience? How should I feel about myself... Personally I feel that I have notbing but pure honest intentions for every sentient being in all respects. I want everything to thrive and be content, there is absolutely no Ill will in my heart and hasnt been for many years since I learned for myself why I have no right to take another life. Yet clearly, I am that same conscious experiencer who once took lives out of fear.

So my question is how should I view myself as an individual given all of this?

Am I good? My unwavering ideologies and morals say now I am good, yet in the past, my actions, although fear driven, tell me I am not a good person, I have taken lives and I deserve terrible things to happen to me. I cannot understand how I should bridge this gap.

My final point about Conscience and morality.

I know for a fact, there are a huge number of children who we consider the most innocent amongst us, to have experimented with bugs in the past. We have all heard of the stories of kids putting a magnifying glass on an ant, or pouring salt on a slug, these things as cruel as we realise them to be now, are curiosity experiments for young children who have not yet learnt why they should not do those things. If our actions speak of who we are, then those children are the most sadistic evil beings alive..yet we don't judge them because they have yet to LEARN why it's bad to do those things. That the ant or slug, is essentially yourself. 

So in a sense, I believe conscience, is a learned feedback loop of understanding and observation of unnecessary suffering and the recognition of the sacredness and sanctity of ALL life... How then, should a child who has yet to learn this, reconcile his karmic debt for these actions that were committed through his curiosity? Is it action that matters karmically or intention? If it's action, then these children are writing their destiny before they had a chance to understand how the world works. If it's intention, their karmic debt cannot be negative for these actions. 

My argument is that morality is learned, and I base that on my own experience..as a created human being by a higher power. 

My question is how would you respond to this and do you view conscience as built in, or a learned ideological mechanism?  and if you factor in psychopathy as a psychological disorder, why then would a higher power allow for this  brain malfunction? 


How should I view myself, given all of this?

1,2023-12-03,CMV: It is Illogical For People to Criticize Sexual Themes in Art,u/yuriw99,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18a0qas/cmv_it_is_illogical_for_people_to_criticize/,changemyview,"I think there is a trend for the general public to claim that any art having sexual themes must be ""lower in value"" compared to art that does not have those themes. A big example is the relentless criticism Cardi B got for her song saying that because the song is vulgar, that means it must be bad. While I do not like listening to vulgar music, that is simply a personal preference, and I do not think an art piece being vulgar is correlated to it being ""bad"" or ""good"". 

As for my reasoning why this is, I believe the main purpose of art is the expression of human emotion. That is why so many movies, songs, books, drawings, have to do with love, war, appreciation of beauty, etc. So why is expressing desire for another human being not also a valid emotion that deserves to be expressed? Why is it ""normal"" for there to be a song like Taylor Swift's ""Red"", expressing her love for someone, or a song like Olivia's ""Good 4 U"" expressing her hate for someone, but as soon as a song is about lust and desire, it is suddenly considered ""weird"" and suddenly there is all types of finger pointing, stifled laughter, or ""what about the children"" talking points? 

While it is true that children may be too young to understand sex, it is the parents' responsibility to keep that content away. There are many tv shows, movies, and books that feature violence that is not appropriate for children either, but those are considered high value works (Death Note, for example) and are praised rather than having the same criticisms directed at it, which I find hypocritical.

In my opinion, people who criticize art by saying ""this is objectively bad and disgusting because it is vulgar"" only do it because of taste and are not logical in their criticism. I think it's fine if the general opinion is ""It's fine, but I don't listen to it because it is not my type of content"" but many people do not say this. I generally want my view on this to be changed (not completely, but to an extent), or at least understand the viewpoint from the other side, mostly because I know people with the opposite view and I don't understand them."

I disagree with conservatives on a great deal of issues, I disagree with the way progressives approach certain issues. But I also believe that, in most cases, the overall intentions of those two groups are good and Im sure they're completely right about certain things and I'm completely wrong and I don't even know it. 

But there are two groups that I do not feel this way about. First, white supremacists and Neo Nazis. Not only are white supremacists and Neo nazis fine with POC dying- including friends and loved ones who are POC- white supremacists and Neo Nazis  are fine with white people dying too if they are ""race traitors"" (aka if they're not white supremacists.) I am sure Neo Nazis and white supremacists are not only wrong, but a huge threat to humanity and the world. I'm not looking to change my view on that. 

The second group : Marxists and Communists. In conversations with Marxists or communists I've always had a hard time overlooking the fact that a huge number of innocent people would have to suffer and die for the kind of society they want to exist. 

And Marxists and communists will counter with ""but a huge number of people are suffering now,"" But the most vulnerable people who are suffering now will also be the most vulnerable if society is destroyed entirely. Almost nobody alive today will benefit. 

Future generations would only benefit if Marxists are actually able to build a better society than the one we have now. And this, to me, is another huge problem with Marxism and communism- there's no proof of concept. there's no proof that a society like that could ever work or would be compatible with humanity. And depending on the level of improvement, Democracy may get us to the same level or even further without so much bloodshed. On top of all of that, even if it could work and it wasn't incompatible with humanity, there's also a very high chance of ending up with a society where more people suffer if this one is destroyed. 

So, taking all of that into consideration, Marxists and communists are OK with innocent people alive today suffering and dying- including the most vulnerable and loved ones and friends- if it means we *might* end up with something like a Marxist or communist Utopia that would help the next generation,  assuming it's not incompatible with the post agriculture human race to begin with. I don't see how I could possibly respect that. I can just imagine a Marxist looking down at me as I'm dying in the street after somebody stabs me and coldly repeating the no true Scotsman fallacy. 

I have encountered ""quiet"" Marxists/communists who say this would only be a thing if people wanted it to be and that the majority of people would have to decide one day to take this route. Which is a less worrisome attitude to me,  but if they're trying to sell Marxism/communism to people so that day will eventually come, I still can't respect them. So it seems to me like the only way I could respect Marxists and communists is if I have no way of knowing they are Marxist/communist and they aren't deserving of respect in the first place due to their heinous dangerous views. 

But I'm open to changing my view!"

8,2023-12-03,CMV: Dating apps have destroyed humanity's ability to form health relationships,u/Iamnotafoolyouare,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18a3bd1/cmv_dating_apps_have_destroyed_humanitys_ability/,changemyview,"People complain about the dating apps.  
Apparently men don't get enough matches, and women get too many (but vast majority are ""low quality"").  


Dating apps set up a system in which you give a human a chance with the stroke of your thumb.   
Based on pics and a blurb.  
This is the foundation of superficiality and human beings are not wired to connect under such superficiality. This game is the foundation of instant gratification.  


Healthy connections (not necessarily chemistry) are formed through vulnerability (to emotional/psychological rejection/dismissal) and consideration from both sides. Stronger connections are formed through commitment. Dating apps are a platform for the opposite of committed connection.  


THE EXPERIENCE ON THE APPS

For example:  
If she swiped on you, and she knows she can replace you with another swipe, then there is no vulnerability for her (in her mind). She is also enticed into playing an instant gratification game that is meant to stroke her ego (how many matches can I get so I feel like I am desirable). Not all women will play this game.   
It's like going to a store ... but what to pick? So many choices and she doesn't need to make herself vulnerable so there is no connection, Just keep picking trying to get the better one. Why settle (to commit)?  
 Psychologically she will not be fulfilled. Until finally she picks what she thinks is the best (based on pics and societal unrealistic expectations of attractiveness), only this is the same guy other women are picking. And he doesn't want to commit to her because he has better options. (or he's a pervert, abusive etc. w/e).   
So it doesn't work for her and she plays again and gets the same result.   


In this game, you have to stand out. Take best pics, have the highest paying jobs etc. But also now you have to do more than just ""take her out for coffee in the first date"" if the other guys are going to ""buy her a meal"". But why would a guy who barely gets matches want to make himself vulnerable to being used for a meal? She can replace him with a swipe and just unmatch. She doesn't value him and isn't in the state of mind to form a connection (valuing him in her life). It's all a game. Plus, she is matched with other guys (doing the same) so the guy feels de valued.   


Then theres this guy,   
He barely gets any matches, then when he does get a match she might be unattractive, unresponsive (because she is speaking to all the other guys). He gets demoralized with the constant swiping and no matches. Some of them become perverted because they lost faith that they can match with a GOOD person, who actually wants to put in the committed effort to form a healthy relationship with them. (It took too much effort to get the few matches). So they pursue this instant gratification (try to find sex because there is no real connection to be had here, realistically). Especially, if she just ghosts him after the meal/date because she swiped on someone else.  


This game has gotten so out of hand; that people are distorting relationships in general. Now there are people who just want to ""casually date"" (no hookups..just ""casually date"") so of course they will ""casually date"" a bunch of people. People are being used for intimacy, companionship, money (free meals/dates). ""casually"". Then we don't want to make ourselves vulnerable so we are now having ENM/Poly. So we don't have to commit and make ourselves vulnerable to rejection/abandonment we can date many people who date many people....and ""ALLL LOVE ourselves different but equally"".  
People are struggling to form healthy relationships because of these apps. So now we're financially poor because of inflation and emotionally poor (""loneliness epidemic"") and both these things are signs of societal decay."

Benefits should only be for people who actually need it with additional support to get them on their feet so they can eventually make a living. Or for people who clearly can't work. There is no real help out there which enables people to be useless or criminals."

When the public pays premium to the insurance company, it expects the company to do two things: 1) collect money from everyone signed up for the policy and 2) pay out money to the few in need or had losses. (This is why insurance has ""leftist traits"" and why some conservative people do not like insurance.) However, it seems like the insurance company only cares about collecting money and forgets about the pay out part. Just like any other type of company, the task of the insurance companies is to make money and satisfy their investors. Hence, insurance companies ""waste"" money they collected on dividend, advertisements, marketing, etc when the money should have been spent on giving back to their customers. At the end of the story, we see insurance companies denying claims or refusing to give out fair payments. This ends up causing extra costs for the society as people are forced to hire lawyers, appraisers etc. All of this is caused from letting a private company to take care of a businese with ""leftist traits"" that I have mentioned."

I don't think she has the maturity or judgment to convince young people to do anything other than buy her concert tickets.

  
Harsh? Look the polls again. ""Biden moved ahead of Trump again"". That means it's neck and neck, which is ludicrous, and means her fan base isn't voting, despite her minuscule efforts. Yes, I say miniscule If the depot of Trump's crimes were understood by that base, they'd demand and make his incarceration happen through sheer weight of numbers.

  
What's she said about him?  In one so-called viral take, she only metions Trump in passing, and focuses on U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn.  So the media in this case gives her cover.

  
""Swift, however, has typically moved cautiously and hesitantly when it comes to the political arena."" is one assessment by Politico.  ""she remained exceptionally quiet on politics for years — including during the divisive 2016 presidential election won by Donald Trump.""  

  
During COVID she tweeted ""Donald Trump’s ineffective leadership gravely worsened the crisis that we are in and he is now taking advantage of it to subvert and destroy our right to vote and vote safely,"" Not exactly a call to vote for anyone else.

  
Again, it ain't happening. Fluff pieces in the media saying otherwise are a distraction.

1,2023-12-03,Cmv: Dating apps are a waste of time for average looking men,u/wanderinstarlight,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18a60jj/cmv_dating_apps_are_a_waste_of_time_for_average/,changemyview,"

I messed around with apps/sites for a number of years

I can tell you that the stereotypes are absolutely true

If you are an average looking man (5/10 being dead average for both sexes) you have a chance at landing yourself a decent 5 woman, but the odds are against you

The trope about online dating being a pussy paradise for Chad is absolutely true. A chad is a top 5% man, minimum 7 on the looks scale.

Chad has no problems using a 5 or lower woman for quick sex, but he has no intention of committing to them

Casual sex with Chad leads a very average woman into the delusion that she'll eventually find a Chad who is willing to commit to her. This simply doesn't happen, so these average women end up frustrated and bitter, they often take out this frustration on average men in the form of rudeness and rejecting in order to make themselves feel empowered

As an average man, you might be able to land an obese single mom if you put in some real effort. She's likely to expect you to pay her way and for her kid(s)

I tried online dating mainly because of social anxiety and the awkwardness that is now irl meeting scenarios

Actually online dating has always been horrible, even when it was web based and not apps. Anyone remember POF? All the services used to be completely free before the majority were swallowed up by the Match corporation. None of the platforms ever worked well for average looking men. A very long time ago I did some Chadfishing on one of the platforms. With online dating it really is all about looks. Trying to be friendly or funny by text mostly just looks pathetic if you aren't at least a 6 or 7.

So why do you average men continue on these platforms? You know what they say about doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result?

I'm worried that ads will increase to astronomical levels (I'm talking 50 ads in a 10-minute YouTube video, maybe 100), ad-blockers will be made illegal, or maybe even twiddling with the corporation's experience to make it become user-friendly will become illegal through some ultra corrupt lobbying scandal. I'm also worrying that subscriptions will pass $100 a month and won't stop or even the whole internet will be locked out by subscriptions or censorship, or free services will go extinct. I'm also worried that features will need to be paid on top of the subscription payment, and even most useful features will be removed like blocking users. (I know I'm going off on a wild tangent, but I can't help but the internet is absolutely doomed)

Although there's some action being taken against the evil, devilish corporations, I'm worried that isn't enough to stop enshittification from destroying the internet like Mad Max.

Once Feige pushed Perlmutter out, no one was left to stop Feige from turning Marvel into a girl brand.  And Feige succeeded.  Marvel is now primarily a girl brand,.

The problem is that the girl audience hasn't showed up. So now he runs a girl brand that girls aren't particularly interested in. 

To return to profitability and cultural prominence, Marvel should probably try and go back to being a boy brand like it was when it started.  That was partly the reason Disney bought it in the first place; they already had girl brands (Disney Princesses, etc) and wanted to expand to boys (Marvel, Star Wars).

1,2023-12-03,CMV: People who live in rural America should pay a tax akin to a luxury tax,u/DeltaBlues82,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18a7qk4/cmv_people_who_live_in_rural_america_should_pay_a/,changemyview,"CMV: People who live in rural America should pay a tax akin to a luxury, sin, or excise tax. To offset the specific pressures this lifestyle places on society opposed to a metropolitan/urbanized lifestyle.

The only two exceptions should be 1/ People who are diagnosed with a phobia, anxiety, or medical condition associated with urban life or 2/ People who need to live in the sticks because of their profession. Like farmers, park rangers, etc…

But the general premise here is that living in a rural setting vs a metropolitan/urbanized one is detrimental to society in a myriad of ways. And that should come with a cost.

It’s worse for the environment. Rural folks produce a disproportionate amount of GHG emissions when compared to their metropolitan/urban counterparts. They drive more and have less access to public transit. Single family homes use more energy and water. Denser populations concentrate land use and preserve more wild area outside human centers. Septic tanks and oil tanks are more detrimental than municipal sewer systems. And it’s much more efficient to deliver goods and services to people if they live in closer proximity to each other, as opposed to those spread out across the countryside.

Rural folk are on average more unhealthy. Putting a disproportionate amount of stress on the already overburdened healthcare system. I realize this fact may be counterintuitive to some, but it’s a supported by every study done on the subject. “But it’s healthier because there are trees and fresh air!” is a lame argument and you’re better than that.

https://www.cdc.gov/ruralhealth/about.html

Sparsely populated areas cost taxpayers more. 1 person living on 1 mile of road costs taxpayers more than 100 or even 1,000 people living along 1 mile of road. Hard infrastructure like roads, broadband, electric, etc… Cost more as people spread out. Intangible infrastructure like, police, fire, mail delivery… All these things cost more the less dense an area is.

Metro areas by and large subsidize rural livestyles. Metropolitan/urban areas contribute more to state budgets than they receive. State spending on roads, broadband, schools, and other public services in rural America is funded, in part, by the economic prosperity of our cities.

I acknowledge that some people don’t want to live in the city. And we all have a right to choose where we live. But because rural life creates a disproportionate amount of stress on society, that’s a right that should come with a cost. 

I also acknowledge that in some places, it’s cheaper to live in the country. And it’s expensive and often near impossible to just up and move. Finding a new job, coming up with first and last month’s rent… People and their families can’t just pack up and leave. That’s not how life works. So for a tax like this to work, it would have to be a phased rollout over a long period of time. 

If we concentrate our tax base and resources, and don’t need to subsidize rural life, then we can counter balance any increased cost of living and provide more of a safety net for people who right now can’t afford metropolitan/urban lifestyles. We can put more into education & infrastructure, reduce crime, and become more environmentally friendly."

Personally, what Bud light did was truly harmless and hurt absolutely no one except insecure transphobic pricks. There has been a wave of transphobia happening (at least in the United States) this past year and it is straight up embarrassing. There is a very real and very lively anti LGBT movement happening in the United States right now, we are better than this.

First dates are and should be mutual interviews.

They are also people who have to put on outfits, makeup or accessories, and travel to the location. Saying that they can ""make up for it by showing genuine interest in the conversation, walking you to your car, etc..."" Is pretty sad. If the date is going well and you're compatible, those things should be coming naturally. If you're not vibing naturally, why would you want to feel like you owe them (either with a second date that you pay for, or in a less pg way)? The bottom line is, I don't like it when people feel entitled to anything from me (sex, a second date, etc), so why would I act like I'm entitled to something from them? I don't think having unequal expectations and a sense of entitlement is a good way to start any relationship.

And the argument of ""the asking should pay"" is nonsense. Especially since majority of the time that rule benefits one gender."

Almost every police shooting video I've seen involved the suspect resisting arrest, running, grabbing the gun, fighting, etc. This is the entire and only reason they were shot. If they just complied and didn't fight, I find it hard to believe the police would just randomly execute them. 

Of course people love to bring up the few extreme outliers like Daniel Shaver and the woman shot in her home. I'm not dismissing them. Of course there is a one in a million chance you get shot on accident or the cop turns out to be a psycho. But outside of these cases, anyone with at least two brain cells to rub together can easily being shot by police."

America would also get an even stronger hold on the rest of South America. Europe is too concerned with Russia to raise any concern and are practically under the American thumb anyway.

Let's further assume that only the surviving progeny is immune to this virus. I am arguing that it would be better for humanity if the virus killed the men rather than the women.

Yes there would be problems short term with lots of physically demanding or male dominated jobs suddenly becoming vacant but similar to women in the British Empire during WW1 women can take over those jobs eventually. Armies worldwide virtually disintegrate and nations across the world lose the ability to effectively project power and supply any sort of long lasting military conflict. Humanity is forced to co-operate and work together. 

Conservatively estimating, the remaining man (average age of a person worldwide is 30) could father more than 100 children a year (he is likely to be fertile over a longer period of time and sperm can be extracted with little chance of complication unlike pregnancy). We could probably even pump him full of weird hormones to have him make more sperm but there is little need because in as little as 15 years or so his children will also be fertile and can begin to contribute. By the end of that man's life we would likely have stabilised our population and be well on our way to recovery.

On the other hand, if you lose most of the women there is an immediate ""Scramble for Africa"" as they have the most women of child bearing age and have no nuclear weapons to defend themselves from powerful conventional warfare. Lots of women would die in the invasions and tensions would be so high I would be surprised if we didn't all die in a nuclear exchange anyway. I don't think most women would even want to live in such a world but even if they did there would be a catastrophic population crash after a single generation (basically back to biblical times).

12,2023-12-04,Cmv: Pro Palestine activists are constantly spreading misinformation,u/Realistic-Razors,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18akybo/cmv_pro_palestine_activists_are_constantly/,changemyview,"“Indiscriminate bombing” “targeting civilians” “genocide”. 0.7% of civilians have been killed since October 7, this number includes Hamas combatants that have been killed (there’s 30,000 Hamas members so this number will rise) and Gazan civilians Hamas have murdered, not Israel. Considering Hamas uses human shields and have indoctrinated lots of Gazans that dying a martyr is the holiest death which means many are willing to be used as human shields, this is an extremely low death rate.


Israel sends multiple warnings in multiple different ways to get civilians of Gaza to evacuate to safety - roof knocking, dropping flyers from the sky, hacking into phones and sending messages, warnings on the tv, etc. Israel built a humanitarian evacuation route and escorted hundreds of Palestinians to the south (safety) to protect them from Hamas, who were killing those who didn’t want to be used as a human shields and were trying to evacuate.


Hamas stores weapons, fires rockets and builds underground tunnels in / around civilian apartments, churches, schools and hospitals making these areas legitimate war zones which is a war crime, any civilians who die within this area are LEGALLY (by the Geneva convention) blood on the hands of Hamas.


Some more misinformation: “Colonisers”. Jews are indigenous to the land of Israel, they were there before Palestine was “Palestine”. The history of the Jews and Judaism in the Land of Israel begins in the 2nd millennium BCE. They ended up in Europe because of violent riots and pogroms that displaced them from Israel. When they left Europe they RETURNED to their HOME land.

133,2023-12-04,CMV: Critical Thinking was never common among the masses nor commonly taught in Public Schools in America.,u/ChrisGodgetti,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18alsnu/cmv_critical_thinking_was_never_common_among_the/,changemyview,"It seems nearly everyone believes Critical Thinking was common among the masses, and was effectively taught in public schools to the masses, at some point in the past, and we have fallen from that utopia, and now, public schools teach nonsense, and the average American is completely incapable of Critical Thinking.

My view is that Critical Thinking was always relatively rare, and Critical Thinking was never taught effectively in Public Schools.  I attended Public School in the 70s and 80s, and was a Paraeducator for 4 years recently in a High Needs Public School.  I didn't see much Critical Thinking nor teaching of Critical Thinking, either time, decades apart.  Yet, then and now, much talk about how we no longer value Critical Thinking.

My view includes a belief that in the area that would become New England, around the founding of America, the average person believed in Devil Stones.  Each year, the frost would heave rocks from lower in the soil, and each year, these settlers would have to clear these stones away, and it was commonly believed that Satan himself (with help of lessor demons) placed these stones there to torment the settlers.

Yet, my view includes a belief that there were other people building ships and inventing printing presses, and postulating about planets circling suns.  And, there were people ***governing*** these Devil Stone Clearers, surely they Critically Thought about ***governing***?

Still, the constant chorus of ""Woe us, we used to value Critical Thinking, but now we don't."" and the fact that I haven't been here long, there's doubt.  Maybe 75% of the American population were Critical Thinkers in 1776, 95% by 1950 with it being taught in public schools, but then dropped off dramatically to 1.7% in 1952, I don't really know?"

This is obvious if there are still feelings involved on either side, but even if the breakup was amicable and you are no longer romantically interested in each other, there is no point because:

- if you broke up then there must have been some major difference, why stay friends? 

- it might make new partners uncomfortable and you should 100% prioritize your partner

Those who claim to be anti-zionists - but not anti-semites... What do they want, other than wishing to rewrite history? Do they think this is helping Palestinians? Because it's not. Do they want an apology from the youngest generation for the fact that they exist? That their ancestors weren't wiped out by the Nazis or in the Israeli-Arab wars?  
Because the current fighting in Gaza has sparked threats and attacks on both Jews and Arabs in general in the US, UK and elsewhere - precisely because of anti-Zionism and antisemitism.

And why do people care so much about Israel, and so little about Sudan, for instance? It seems to me that more attention on Sudan could (IMO) save lots of lives - between needed medical supplies and clean water.

Anti-Zionists / non antisemites: I'd like to understand your view, what you get out of it, how you separate yourself from antisemitism, and why you think anti-Zionism is important.

Unless you are marrying a woman with a competing claim on *your* title, the claim shouldn't rest on the non title holder anyway so their birth should be irrelevant to the claim.

We're not evolving; we're devolving, losing sight of the bedrock that has underpinned stable societies for centuries.

Marriage isn't just a tradition or a romantic notion; it's the goddamn glue of societal stability, personal growth, and generational continuity. The nosedive in marriage rates and the rise of ‘whatever-the-hell’ family structures aren't signs of enlightenment but a glaring testament to our collective ignorance and naivety.

To dismiss marriage as outdated is to spit in the face of its profound psychological, social, and economic benefits. It's not just a commitment; it's a fucking crucible for character building, a solid framework for nurturing kids, and a foundation for a stable society. The declining marriage rates, especially among the youth, is a red flag, signaling a disturbing shift in societal values – from meaningful, lasting bonds to fleeting, self-serving bullshit.

This 'mimetic desire' crap – the idea we mirror societal trends in our desires – is a flimsy cover for the erosion of one of our most vital institutions. The fading charm of marriage and parenthood isn't natural or progressive; it's a cultural fucking emergency. We are turning into a society that runs from responsibility and commitment, preferring temporary pleasures over anything with lasting value.

The dwindling relevance of marriage isn't something to celebrate. It's a dire warning of our cultural downfall, showcasing our pathetic slide away from deep, meaningful relationships. Real progress would be waking the hell up to the lasting importance of marriage and striving to reinstate its pivotal role in modern society."
1,2023-12-04,CMV: Most complaints about diversity in fantasy works is because it is not explained which makes it feel forced.,u/AntarticWolverine,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18apnui/cmv_most_complaints_about_diversity_in_fantasy/,changemyview,"If you don't want to read everything please still do read the bottom part where I outline what I do and don't want to discuss here so we can stay on-topic.


A lot of contemporary fantasy works still draw attention from medieval Europe and even when they don't most other areas weren't exactly making leaps regarding the rights of women and LGBTQ-people.

What most places especially lacked was the degree of ethnic diversity that we would see in a metropole today. Travel limitations ensured that seeing a Caucasian man in Beijing or a sub-saharan African man in London were both rare occurrences. This was not an European thing either. Pretty much all over the world diversity would be necessarily limited as far as skin color was concerned. Sure, if you visited Baghdad at its peak that would still feel like an amalgamation of peoples to the travellers of its day but nowadays we might consider it far too homogenous.

The diversity we see today (in the West at least because good luck finding it in Tokyo or Beijing to this degree) is a product of technological advancement, imperialism and a myriad of other factors.

Why not write a fantasy story where a similar explanation is given? 

Even back in the '90s The Wheel of Time series had gingers in the desert and it was explained as the world having been shaken and rumbled apart 3000 years ago. It also takes place on one massive continent and magic (and its school and political relevance) creates at least one institution that, by its very nature, will be multi-ethnically diverse. 

That is not necessarily the case in other fantasy stories.  Especially if they are medieval-inspired.

If you then force it anyway you risk creating an 'Avengers: Endgame girl power'-moment that just feels grating. I am referring to an infamous scene in the climax where all the heroines are combined in one shot that feels like the producers were just patting themselves on their back. 

A lot of people will instinctually point to the magic inherent in many fantasy stories as something that can explain everything so people shouldn't care. But honestly that's a very easy response to give that doesn't really adress anything. 
It suggests that fans don't require any method to the magic at all but many people may not want a story where anything goes. If a story has a unicorn on page 1 that does not create the expectation that that same unicorn might also be  able to time travel.

Sure, I can suspend my disbelief for a story about time travelling unicorns but not any story can incorporate that out of nowhere and it doesn't feel intuitive and can be immersion-breaking.

So you can give a magical explanation for it but if it is too heavy-handed, or feels forced or doesn't take into account how that might have impacted the history of the world then it is not going to feel satisfactory. Hence, why you barely see this approach being taken.

But instead it is often not explained at all. It is just done. This is also the case when it comes to LGBTQ. 

Let's take Lord of the Rings as an example. Tolkien did not have black elves. So what do we do? We could introduce a few black elves as a clear minority and explain that these are elves from the South. For some fans that'll already be stretching it especially if these elves have a prominent role but it can make sense in a world like that. 
However, suddenly deciding that the Elvish capital will have a significant black elf population will require much more of an explanation.

But I believe that, if this is done very well, it can actually silence some criticisms.




What I don't want to discuss are the merits of representation. Those are not at issue here. I fully support that. 

Believe it or not but I only made this thread because I loathe the argument that since fantasy fans accept magic they should just accept any and all things that aren't fully explained. 


I only wish to have a discussion about how diversity and LGBTQ acceptance were the result of a long historical process and that this is not accredited as such in a lot of media.

I'll also add that if historical works were too homogenous to be realistic and a product of their time in that sense, then I would even prefer having that be changed in a later adaptation."

1,2023-12-04,CMV: The Russian boycott by Western Companies only furthers Putin's aims.,u/souvik234,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18arlp0/cmv_the_russian_boycott_by_western_companies_only/,changemyview,"I find that the mass boycott by companies against Russia, such as Coca-Cola, Mastercard/Visa and Netflix to be counterproductive and will only embolden the Putin Regime by giving them ammunition.

I feel this way as Putin's current main narrative is to portray the Western countries as having a vendetta against Russia. This spans from him portraying Russia as being ""laughed out"" of NATO, to the present day of accusing the Western World of suppressing Russians in Donetsk and Luhansk,  supporting the ""neo-Nazi"" regime in Ukraine, and of an information war against Russia on the global stage.

A boycott by Western countries which deprives the average Russian citizen of things that they're used to, such as a drink of Coke at a McDonalds which they pay with their Mastercard Credit Card. This is only a small glimpse of what the average Russian has been cut off from. The Russian cut-off from SWIFT for instance, while well-intentioned to prevent Russians from gaining wealth, now means that Russians working abroad no longer have a convenient means to support their families at home. Several car manufacturers have stopped operations in Russia, which means with the absence of official spare parts, their cars are now akin to Iranian F-14s flying with salvaged parts. Universities suspending ties with Russian students mean that the Russians most likely to be turned against Putin's regime are now being sent back home.

The governments of the West would probably look at these and take them as an acceptable cost, given that in their minds it increases the probability of discontent within the people, and might put pressure on the Putin regime to change course. However, what these bureaucrats and politicians do not realize that this is having the opposite effect. This boycott is playing right into Putin's hands and allows him to portray himself as the savior of the Russian people from the evil Western powers and expand his propaganda control. This is basically, a less extreme version of the Morgenthau Plan for Germany post-WWII. 

The Western bureaucrats are also deeply mistaken in assuming that the people ""will rise up"" against the regime. People are afraid for their lives and those of their families if they protest. "

1,2023-12-04,CMV: Biggest allies of African-Americans will be Non-Hispanic White Americans in future.,u/BoredNiga,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18arq11/cmv_biggest_allies_of_africanamericans_will_be/,changemyview,"I've been thinking about this for a few hours and wanted to share it here for your opinions. Given that America's racial demographics are changing due to a mix of immigration and lower TFR (total fertility rate) among non-Hispanic whites, the closest ally of African-Americans are going to be non-Hispanic white people socially and culturally.  
  
Biggest source of immigration to USA is from Mexico but let's ignore Mexico for a second and focus on 2nd, 3rd, 4th biggest sources, India, China, Philippines. Although, these countries and cultures couldn't be worlds apart, one thing common among Indians (I am one), Chinese and Filipinos is **colorism**. These countries cultures practice colorism for centuries to the point that recent immigrants inevitably bring their prejudices to America that doesn't go in their lifetime. Now, even though USA has decreased legal immigration under Trump, I think this will inevitably go back up (like a sine wave you see in trigonometry) and we will get more of immigrants from these (or other Asian) countries. How will this affect Black Americans socially? Culturally?  
  
Socially: Indian, Chinese and Filipino immigrants (most, if not all) don't mingle with people from African ancestry that much, unfortunately (my anecdotal experience). Only ""mixing"" I have seen is in the Caribbean where there are a lot of Black and east Indian couples, but then they've been there since 16-1700s during the age of European mercantilism. This behavior might exclude black Americans from some races in terms of dating, esp in diverse cities as they wouldn't want to mingle with some dark-skinned person either due to prejudices or their parent's disapproval. For example, I have dated women from different backgrounds, when I was in Miami, two of my best relationships was with a Jamaican and a Latina, my mother didn't like it but my stepdad was fine with it since my step-brother is married to a white woman. Also, my mother came to America in 2011 and my stepdad as a teen when Reagan was the president, so recent immigrants will be more likely to be prejudice and there are way more recent ones like my mother then older ones like my stepdad. Professionally, this might affect black people in certain industries like in Tech, which has a sizeable Indian presence (I am Indian, and in tech lol).  
  
Culturally: This ties up very close to ""socially"" but few more points I'd like to add is that recent immigrants would be less inclined to be known of African-American culture and norms than white people. Even ""rap"", which is a derivation of African-American culture is considered """"white"" by people from outside USA because we (as in recent immigrants) still think America as a ""white country"". Things like these will only make differences enlarged within POCs in near future.  
  
Also, there might be an **economic** aspect too as some of the immigrants have a potential hiring bias and might even cause economic loss to the black community.  
  
So, overall, white Americans will be the biggest allies for black Americans because (1) they are both culturally similar in many ways. (2) Due to history and a lot of much-needed activism, many white people set any prejudices aside and mingle with black people, at least in big American cities. And, (3) White men-black women relationships (which are still not that common, but growing among my generation) will have a much bigger increase than any black person-POC relationships, again because of points I made. Not even Hispanic-Black relationships will be as many as Black-White relationships **due to colorism among Hispanics too (trust me, I have spent 5 years in Miami and two largest demographics there are Hispanic and Black).**  
  
Lastly, a few points I'd like to add is (1) most of this has been my anecdotal experience but then for a 24M, I am well-travelled (mostly on my parents dime lol) and I have been to a dozen countries and travelled all over North America (currently in Canada) so I have interacted with a lot of people from different backgrounds and found a lot of common traits. (2) Obviously, not all recent immigrants from these countries are like this, many are great too like my family, just that these issues exist and it is decently big enough for someone like me to notice it. Like, I could be oblivious to it but it is sizeable enough for me to take a note of it."

I know professional  therapists are meant to help those who deal with these particular issues in regards to attraction. 

But even if we don't engage in anything extreme, we still find those that are attractive... attractive. 

 Our brains inform us with these ideas that our lives would be better if we were in a romantic or sexual relationship with them

And once we realize there's a reason why we can't, it could cause disappointment and idealizing a reality that'll never come

My argument against that is that most parents don't teach these skills and young adults often have to learn things the hard way, which in this economy is often a financial death sentence.

A life skills class will be good for the economy because it will teach students most of the basic skills they need to live away from parents, not get buried under debt, and how to become happy, productive tax paying citizens. 

We should reduce the common core by 25%. That means math, English, history, 
 science, and electives should have their curriculum reduced by 25%.

For at least 90 minutes each day starting during a student's Junior year, they should begin a very calculated and planned our curriculum of life skill classes that involve hands on projects to demonstrate learning of said materials. 

The skills include:

Sexual education, birth control, STIs, safe sex, healthy pregnancy, child birth, etc. 

Financial skills (how budget, how to live within a budget, loans, credit cards, credit scores, interest rates, how college tuition works how to buy house, how to qualify for buying a house, etc) 

General life skills (how to create a resume/cover letter, how to apply for work, basic car repair skills, skills relevant to the area you live in, cooking, cleaning, sanitizing, staying fit, reducing weight, shopping for food) 

Critical thinking skills. It is difficult to define critical thinking but I think I developed the skills myself when I took a persuasion class in college. Students should learn the basics of persuasion by studying rhetoric of famous people, advertisements, and even tweets, understanding their argumentation tools, and be able to effectively evaluate an argument's effectiveness. They should also be taught how to identify fake news, biased sources, what reliable are sources in general, and taught not to believe everything they read on the internet. 

Legal rights. Students should understand what their rights are when police get involved, how to ask for a lawyer, what to say and not to say to the police depending on the situation, employee rights, resources available for those that get harassed, bullied, or sexually abused. 

If parents don't consent to their children taking this class, the student can get placed in a study hall class. Though I would be in favor of voting to override the rights of parents in this regard since most parents do not adequately teach their students these life skills (and often because they don't know these skills themselves, not because they are negligent). 

A lot of the issues are society has stem from young people having a lack of knowledge in these areas. 

I'm also open to the idea that these skills are so important that they should actually make up half of the curriculum for all of high school instead. 

I look back on the common core and I think that for most people, the knowledge is great to have in general but simply isn't useful for helping young adults figure out what to do with their lives. 

These life skills, which aren't taught by parents since most parents don't even know them, will allow young people to have a better understanding of their world and thus more control over their own lives, leading to a happier and more productive society."

I'm ready to change my view too if the counter argument is compelling.)  
I'm a 5'10"" Asian man in my mid-30s. I wanted to be taller, mostly because I wanted to dunk a basketball. But growing up, I always felt tall enough, at least among my generation. Also, I'm in a committed relationship. Height never bothered me that much.  
But I'm seeing so many, ""I'm not tall enough and want to commit suicide"" types of posts, especially among GenZ. Also, I just talked to a guy who said tall height is a form of superior genetics.  
Really?  
The ""Best"", most powerful people in the world are close to average or below average in height. I even think that if we were to take an Olympian view of intelligence, tall height could even be disadvantageous as valuable resources the brain needs to consume like oxygen and blood flow must be shared at a higher rate with other parts of the body like longer limbs and larger internal organs. I'm not saying tall or big people are dumb, I just don't think they can truly max out in intelligence, which is the real thing that makes humans dominant.  
Contention 1: Mammalian Evolution.  
An average gorilla, elephant, or rhino can beat the shit out of the strongest humans in a cage match. But in a natural environment, we own them. Humans are apex predators not because of our size, but because we are orders of magnitude smarter. We can't fly, so we build planes. We can't run fast, so we build cars. Though we fight each other, we also know how to collaborate like ants and build amazing shit that upstages our ancestors every single generation. We even own the ants and bees by creating the internet and building unprecedented social networks that can sometimes transcend tribal, cultural and linguistic barriers.  
Contention 2: Other humans.  
I see studies that ""tall people make more money and go on more dates."" But let's talk about max potential. Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Mark Zuckerberg, Jensen Huang, Lionel Messi, Jack Ma, Stephen Schwarzman, Edward Bernays, MLK, Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick, and Albert Einstein are/were all at or slightly below average height that wield tremendous wealth, influence, and or power. These are guys I quickly named out of my ass. I'm sure there are even more examples both now and from the past.   
Contention 3: Tall height == Good is corporate propaganda.  
Tall people are more visible. They're great to use as models, or CEOs and Presidents (people that must ""please"" a boardroom of actually powerful people, i.e. the board/government/brain-trust). They're mere symbols, i.e. that one's world leader is bigger and more powerful than the other. Yao Ming was used as a flag bearer for Team China's Olympic opening ceremony walk multiple events in a row even though there were better athletes because he symbolizes China's size and power. But that's about it. He's a great symbol (and decent b-ball player), but his height doesn't also make him someone that continues to advance the human species. The truly great people are the innovators and architects that influence how we live our lives, which have not had significant correlation with tall height.  
Contention 4: Technological Singularity.   
Increasingly, I believe how our faces are framed and how we communicate will matter more than our physical height. We Zoom and collaborate with people  remotely and don't need to physically meet anymore. Our influence might be defined by what is contained in a rectangular screen. Height should matter less than ever before as computers, smartphones, virtual avatars, and VR headsets(?) become extensions of the human body. Our face and the output from it matters most. Even that might be replaced.  
Contention 5: The future of genetics.   
Height is purely cosmetic. It will probably be among the easiest things to hack in the near future, either through gene-editing, growth hormone injections, or surgery. You can't become more intelligent or creative through surgery, at least not in a long ass time.   
Conclusion: If we select out short or average-height men and women, we might lose our architects, geniuses, and revolutionaries. We have to embrace a diverse gene pool not just in terms of race or culture, but also height."

Arguably Covid would not have been such a big issue if international steps were taken right from the beginning, but China covered it up and lied about it until it was too late.

Coverups are never a good thing for matters that can affect other people's lives, but countries have an interest in covering up their mistakes to save face, they should be punished so they are discouraged from doing so. Another example was Chernobyl, if there wasn't so much covering up of mistakes, it might not have been such a big tragedy.

My proposed punishment is economic tariffs, a fine, or similar economic punishment. A country would have to report and own up to their mistake or face economic setbacks. I think the punishment should be on a case-by-case basis.

Specifically for China, I think they should be punished through harsh environmental regulations. Currently they are the #1 contributors to CO2 emissions. This would solve two problems at once, set an example so other countries are less likely to cover up anything that would negatively affect the whole world *and* lower global co2 emissions at the same time. It would hurt China initially, but they would be forced to move to cleaner energy which would be a net benefit to the world in the long run."

No credible historian would ever agree with these intellectually weak arguments. For example, I saw the Yemeni civil war being called an anti-Yemeni genocide. If that's the case, most religious wars throughout history should be called genocides. The League Wars were *clearly* genocide in that case. It seems like it's universally accepted that the Russia-Ukraine war is an active genocide, when more civilians and higher rates of civilians were killed in the Vietnam War and Korean War, but we never talk about a ""Viet genocide"" or ""Korean genocide"". In fact more civilians died each week during the Korean War than in total in the Ukraine-Russia war in total. The Tigrayan and Amharic conflicts in Ethiopia were both widely declared undebatable genocides. If that's the case, literally every single civil conflict in Ethiopia for the past 80 years have been undeniably ""genocides"". Just about every single conflict in Africa in the past 80 years in that case can be described as a genocide. It just feels like pathetic, emotional virtue-signaling to make people feel better about themselves by using a stronger word. In reality, it's like a ""boy who cried wolf"" scenario, where they are literally taking away all weight that the word holds.

Here’s why I 100% disagree 

I’ll admit, depending on your mental illness, it can excuse certain actions, but not all. It could probably excuse certain behaviors, like hyperactivity, or certain tendencies. But, the fact that things like hurting others and committing crimes should be excused because people are ill doesn’t really make sense.

Why should we excuse them because their behavior? If someone was having a psychotic breakdown and started murdering others, everyone would want the person to go to jail. But when a depressed person does it, it’s suddenly okay? Last time I checked, murder is murder. Same with anger issues. Sure, you have them, but that doesn’t mean you can just go and harass others, especially if they weren’t trying to provoke you.

Mentally ill people are still humans. They may not be like other people, but they aren’t completely different. If a human commits a crime and they get arrested, the same should happen with a mentally ill person. 

These actions could also lead up to mentally ill people to more devious things and incorrect thinking.  This is because people have a tendency do something bad if they think they can get away with it. And a lot of times, if they’re allowed, they’ll do even more devious things. Realistically, these bad things will get these people into jail. I’m aware of that, but the fact that other people think someone murdering someone else is okay because of a disorder is, to me, insane"

Starfield as a game has a lot of plothole in the stories that are become pretty obvious if you think about it on even a basic level. One of the mysteries you solve in Starfield is what happened to earth and why it was abandon. Near the end of the game you figure out that >!a NASA scientist discovered one of the artifacts which caused him to meet himself from a paralle universe where he got the information to create a grave drive. He decided to get a group together to create grav-drive technology. What he doesn't reveal to the group is that he is aware that constant use of this technology is destroying earths atmosphere, shortening the habitability of the earth to 50 years. The decision is made to start transporting people off earth and colonizing them on other planets. At some point, the earths atmosphere collapses turning it into a wasteland and anyone who didn't make it out died. !<

But there's a major question that isn't really addressed: Why abandon earth? 

Grav drives are still one of the most advanced technologies when the game takes place, meaning most of the technology available to the player was available around the time they figured out earth was on borrowed time.

They had the resources to transport and build relatively large societies not only on comfortably habitable planets like Jemison, but also less habitable ones like Mars.

Many major landmarks are still standing 100 years later with no atmosphere and no upkeep.

In game, you can find and build on just about every planet, even those with extreme weather, pressure or atmosphere, including earth

So bringing all those points together it doesn't make sense to abandon earth. It would've made more sense to use the majority of resources to create large outpost on earth (Kind of like in fallout) while also investing some in colonizing planets with resources. Some people would be able to remain on earth with a logistical chain bringing in resources from other planets, while others would be able to colonize other planets and support those industries. 

I don't think this is something that's really made sense in a logical way in game. I'll give a delta for one of two things:

1. Using proof from the game, you explain why it makes sense that earth was completely abandoned.
2. You create a fan fic in line with the lore of the game that explains why earth was and continues to be abandoned with no plot holes"

A little more than 50% of the population lost a human right because of the electoral apathy in 2016. We also lost affirmative action, the ability to protect the environment using government regulation, 1 million Americans unnecessarily to Covid, a legitimized Supreme Court, and any chance of national unity for probably decades. Trump also enabled domestic extremism, deliberately stokes racial, political, and lbgt tensions. He praised dictators and literally threatens world order by upending defense alliances that have been in place since WWII to prevent another world war.

Playing Russian Roulette with the most powerful and dangerous country and military power to ever walk the face of the earth by enabling Trump, is a type of self sabotage so absurdly insane it’s un fathomable. You are sacrificing decades of human rights progress, environmental protections, and any hope of free and fair elections. He’s telling you what he will do. It’s also important for Americans to understand you cannot fight for the rights of others if you do not have them yourself. Something the lgbt community in Russia is being reminded of now.

I realize that there are a lot of people dying, some even have family members here in the US, but allowing grief and rage to ruin the future of 300,000 million people and endanger the world isn’t the answer. 

Also Biden is actually doing the best we can hope for in the current situation. I realize people want their politicians to be activist, but the truth is activist tactics make a shitty leader. He has accomplished more with diplomacy than condemnation. Did anyone think that we’d see any hostages released? Can anyone remember a military campaign in the Middle East where the lives of civilians was a concern coming out of the presidents mouth only a few weeks in? Can anyone name another possible candidate that has a plan to end the military offensive and guarantee the safety of Israeli citizens? 

Everyone wants easy, clean, moral answers. The fact that there aren’t any is probably one of the main reasons people are so combative about this issue. No matter what side you take you’ll end up defending something atrociously inhuman.

 Let’s be honest no matter what direction Biden moves, people are going to die. We could split Israel in half, give half to Palestinians, and there would still be a war the next day. War is the unavoidable outcome when you have divisions with so much hatred and bloodshed. 

Why should we destroy ourselves over an unsolvable puzzle? Will being morally right (in your own opinion btw) justify the horror you’d unleash? We are a democracy, which means we the voters are responsible for who we give such unimaginable power. Are you really that reckless? How can you justify damming us all?Change my view."

I have tried to setup calls with them since they live out of town but I always get a long story of how they are extremely busy since having kids, work etc. Now I do believe that adulthood comes with a lot of responsibilities such as fulfilling special obligations to children, keeping up with work, health, romantic and familial relationships. That's why I made it explicitly clear to couple of my friends that my expectations are very low. Just text me once in 2-3 months on what's new or how they are doing. I want to see that effort. I want to see if they can prioritize our friendship once in a while.  


They look at my instagram stories almost daily but not willing to initiate contact. They say that I am still a good friend but the actions don't align with the words. That's not, IMO much to ask. It would at max take 15 minutes for a text conversation spread out over whatever time it's comfortable for them. I am not asking for daily calls for hours. I straight up asked my friend go through your messages and tell me if she haven't texted or called anyone of her friends/acquaintances and she admitted to calling and texting other friends. So it's not about actual time/busy.  


After seeing this pattern when I am the one who is always asking what's new in their life, I got frustrated and just straight up cut off one friend. I told her that we tried to meet over five years and I was the one trying to initiate it and it was her that backed out especially at last minute, on the day of. I had to keep reminding her that hey, we are meeting tomorrow at this time. Five years is a lot of leeway.  I told this another mutual friend and she is saying that my response was very extreme and that she would never cut off a friend regardless of level of reciprocity.   


Without some form of communication how would the friendship continue? I am not getting information about their life changing events whether joyful or sad. This requires some effort from them to share with me. I want to be part of those to feel close to a friend. One friend keeps telling me that we need to meet and when I setup a meeting, I don't get any text back. Then a month later he texts me, can we meet tonight? I am like no dude, I can't meet on such a short notice. So I planned again and never got a response. I waited at the restaurant and ate alone.  At least four friends have done this to me. I know their deepest secrets, fears from when we were close. "

I don’t believe interracial relationships should be encouraged in any capacity, and not just in favor of one particular race. I believe caucasians should be with caucasians, hispanics with hispanics, etc. If I was only saying one race can’t mix with another race, I can see how that’s racist because I’ll be exclusionary to one race. I’m applying this to all races 

With that out of the way, I think there’s multiple reasons we should shy away from interracial coupling. A big one for me is culture, and how inherent that is to the race in question. There’s a certain beauty of a strong culture that is homogenous, and I feel like that applies to the certain physical characteristics that differ from race to race. I feel like it would be a sad sight to see the dilution of what I previously mentioned as time goes on.

Not all porn but the vast majority represent women as essentially a sex toy waiting for a man to penetrate them. Straight porn presents sex in a way that aligns with the male gaze. Porn is made FOR men and not women. Considering this, I would argue that, despite there being no women in gay male porn, it reinforces this view of women. Gay man have assumed the role of women in that the bottom is treated as a sexual object and a counterpart to the dominant top, being submissive. This doesn't come from an inherent feature of sex but rather a form of self-identification with straight men that gay men have transferred on to themselves. Men view women as sexual prey that are to be conquered and this view is the same in gay sex because of the issue of representation and socialization. I would argue that it is more misogynistic than straight porn because gay porn has the ability to queer our conceptions of sex, but rather opts to enforce the status quo. Straight porn is more limited because their audience is straight men that are not vulnerable to queering sex. When I say queer, I don't mean short hand for LGBTQ, but rather than resistance to normative structures in society. It is more misogynistic because they have the option to not present this sexual prey-predator understanding and could be movers in change."

My argument is weaker for people not planning to have children, but I do want children so I think that’s irrelevant."

The UN eventually decided that a Jewish state was a necessary endeavor which is all well and good, but the UN didnt have the moral authority to take Arab land and just decide it wasn’t Arab land anymore. Essentially, the UN Resolution 181 was legalized land theft, and as we know, land theft turned to expulsion of Arabs which is a big factor in the conflict even today.

The Israel Palestine situation on its own is beyond repair but hopefully we take the lesson that we shouldn’t establish new nations with the intent of expelling ethnic groups in that new nation’s territory, which seems easy enough not to repeat but it’s always good to make sure by looking at the past and intentionally avoiding our mistakes from then."

It's not just a bad idea; it's a clusterfuck in the making. We're essentially playing god without a damn clue about the hell we might unleash.

**Fucking Existential Catastrophe Incoming:** The minute AGI gets smarter than us – and it will – we're potentially signing our death warrant. This isn't paranoid fantasy; it's a looming, terrifying reality. We risk birthing something that could decide humans are more trouble than we're worth.

>*""But isn't risk a part of progress?""*

Hell no, not like this. There's a stark difference between taking a calculated risk and diving headfirst into an abyss. AGI isn't just another tech advancement; it's a Pandora's box that, once opened, could spell the end of humanity as we know it. Are we really dense enough to risk everything for this?

>*""Surely we can control or regulate AGI?""*

Control it? Are you fucking kidding me? AGI, by its very nature, will evolve beyond our control. Believing we can regulate it is as naive as thinking you can domesticate a wildfire. Once AGI surpasses human intelligence, all bets are off.

**Moral Clusterfuck of Epic Scale:** We're not just coding software; we're potentially creating a new form of life. What rights would this entity have? How the hell do we ensure it doesn't turn against us? We're stepping into a moral abyss, blindfolded and handcuffed.

>""Aren't ethical challenges part of evolution?""

This isn't about evolution; it's about moral recklessness. Creating a potentially sentient being without a plan isn't just irresponsible; it's downright dangerous. We're flirting with scenarios that could question the very fabric of our moral and ethical foundations.

**Societal Apocalypse on the Horizon:** Think about a future where human skills are obsolete, thanks to AGI. We're not just talking about job losses; we're talking about the total collapse of societal structures. Economic disparity? That'll be the least of our worries.

>""But AGI could create new opportunities, right?""

Opportunities for whom, exactly? The elite few controlling the AGI? Everyone else will be left in the fucking dust, struggling in a world that doesn't need them. This isn't opportunity; it's the fast track to societal disintegration.

Chasing AGI is like speeding towards a cliff blindfolded, hoping there's a bridge on the other side. The so-called benefits of AGI are a pathetic joke compared to the existential threat it poses."

Also, especially in a tier-1 cities as an average guy, dating is getting really really expensive. Going out to even a decent restaurants is something many are barely able to afford. As a young male, being in a relationship in your early 20s is basically an evolutionary ‘need’. We haven’t adapted to this new social hookup culture, or just being lonely. 

A quick Google search will show that sexlessness and being single is the highest it's ever been, for both men and women.  
Most guys I know are single and don’t have a girlfriend. Some of them are turning to replikas or some other form of technology to make up for their loneliness. If this continues, men are going to latch on to the next best thing- AI companions. They will be accessible to everyone, fulfil our emotional and maybe even sexual needs, and will even be a lot cheaper than actually dating a girl. "

6. Most families don't help you with your kids anymore. 
7. You don't get to spend much time with your kid because they are spending 40 hours a week in school and you are spending 40 hours a week at work so you are literally working just to stay separated from your child and this is normalized 😂. 
8. At any moment you can lose your job so being highly caffeinated, overworked, not having enough sleep because not only do you have to work 5 days at a desk, you have to come home and clean and cook and direct the entire household. 
9. You lose your sense of identity because you made the kid your entire life now you have no idea who you are outside of being a parent. 
10 . You will spend your entire life worried about another human being and feeling guilty and ashamed every time that human being doesn't behave the way you'd thought it would and you will try not to act like your parents but will inevitably act just like them because you didn't know how much having a kid would trigger you but still you will tell yourself it's all worth it to spend your life in a cycle of work, clean, take care of kids, and repeat because you don't know what else life is for 🥰"

I've lived in germany now for 6 years and middle eastern culture is completely incompatible with western ideals nor do they want to integrate. They have simply observed that they can etch out a living using western welfare systems while simultaneously enforcing their own culture because European countries as a whole don't want to push back lest they be called racist. No one wants that, so year after year, the cultural goal posts moves and next thing u know you have riots everywhere in france, Sweden had to call in their military, Italy is overwhelmed,  and one day the far right will take over and then the real racism will begin to surface.

They use it for essentially useless things like luxury cars or expensive clothes, which offer basically no practical benefit over a normal car/clothes. Yes, a sports car can go faster than a normal car, but since there's a speed limit on roads, it basically offers zero practical benefits.

This money, if used, could better the lives of millions in poverty. Rather than spending it to make one person happy, it should be used to better society and give education to people. I'm not saying that a person cannot accumulate wealth, and I know some billionaires do donate to charity, but a lot of wealth can be used to help others rather than remaining stagnant in a bank account.

1,2023-12-05,CMV: High School (Mostly) Defines You For Life,u/NomadicContrarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18baoek/cmv_high_school_mostly_defines_you_for_life/,changemyview,"\* **REASONS IN THE MIDDLE and** **TLDR AT THE BOTTOM**

So I'll admit, my last CMV might have been a little over the top. Although I feel like I may have gotten some alternate perspectives to think about more deeply, I ultimately deleted the post cause I think it was getting out of hand.

Nevertheless, some of the comments I got on the post showcased something more fundamental about my entrenched views about marriage and a lot of other things such as my goals in life. When I think more critically, I constantly think of my adolescence and young adulthood as a point that I think has truly defined me for life, due to the fact that no matter what I've done to improve my situation both socially and romantically, barely any progress has been made. I only have 6 real friends, which isn't even a ""squad"" of friends to begin with, most of the time it feels like an uphill battle to do stuff with them, and I still have never have had a relationship no matter what I've done. Not to mention my garbage career prospects.

To elaborate and reiterate: I'm 24, mildly autistic, have GAD and dysthymia, and I experienced a plethora of mistreatment/exclusion/betrayal in my adolescence and young adulthood due to my differences from others (differences that I certainly knew of but couldn't place a name on them due to my parents hiding my diagnosis for 5 years after I was diagnosed at 14). At this point, I still can't place the correct words on it, but it seems like there was a point in high school where my mind was not only irrevocably changed, but also seems to have defined me for the rest of my life, and honestly seems to be a point that (mostly) defines people for the rest of their lives.

Now here's WHY I say that:

1. I used to be a cheerful and optimistic person, even in the face of adversity, but at some point during my junior year of high school, that part of me seems to have become lost forever.
2. No matter how many therapists I've sought out (12 including my current one over the past 9 years), neither my mentality nor situation has improved. Hell some have even reinforced my feelings of resentment and bitterness.
3. Every ""squad"" that I've ever tried to integrate with since high school (6 of them) has been cliquey and closed off because I simply missed the boat on joining them at a younger age or wasn't ""good enough for them"". And because I couldn't find my ""squad"" at a younger age, my efforts to ""network socially"" (a concept that sounds great in theory but is basically impossible at this point) have been null and devoid of any results not just because people become closed off after a certain point, but also because they deem me to be ""lesser"" due to not having enough ""social status"". And this doesn't even include the many other people I've tried to befriend/date and it hasn't gone anywhere.
4. Going off of the previous point, at least in Europe and some parts of North America, it seems that you either find your tribe/partners by high school at the latest, lest you be screwed for life socially and romantically. Literally look at all the posts on any country sub you can find, and you'll see this pattern. 
5. When talking about others, it seems that all the popular people (jocks, ""mean girls"", prodigies etc.) from my high school continue to be popular and living the blissful lives that I envied them for back then (with their long-term relationships, constant socializing that isn't an uphill battle unlike me, successful careers etc.), whereas all of the not so popular people (including myself) continue to live the lives that I at best feel indifferent towards to at worst feel pity for them living.
6. As tempted as many of you might be to pull the ""if it smells like crap everywhere"" or ""if everyone is a jerk"" cards, I can assure you that I actually did try to improve my overall vibes and social skills and whatnot during my second year of undergrad (at which point it was probably too late anyways), where I tried to see the best in others and give everyone a chance, but after all the rejections and backstabbing that occurred from 2020 onwards it seems to only reinforce my thought that high school defined me for life. And no, COVID most likely had nothing to do with it, as even without it, people would most likely have done the same thing to me.

Now, I said ""(mostly)"" in the title cause I certainly know of a few people where they would have been considered ""losers"" in high school but somehow managed to, for example, find their tribe or their spouse afterwards or even a lucrative career, but based on the fact that these are a VERY small amount of people, I can only conclude that such occurrences are freak occurrences, and that for the vast majority of people, high school is very much a time that defines them for life, cause it certainly did define me and most of the people I went to school with.

**TLDR:** High school defines you for life because you either find your group of people/partners/career that you want to do, or you are screwed for life."

1,2023-12-05,CMV: There are only 3 reasons for being religious and these mean that religious people do not value logic or an objective truth,u/veganproteinshake,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18bbq7g/cmv_there_are_only_3_reasons_for_being_religious/,changemyview,"My view is that there are only 3 reasons for being religious. These are fear, childhood indoctrination and access to religious communities. The result of this is that people who are religious do not value an objective truth and critical thinking.  
  
Fear causes people to believe in anecdotes without any actual evidence to support the claims to truth that religions make. In this process, a person is first informed of a religion’s threat to nonbelievers, and then based on how much it scares them, decides whether to accept it. An example of this would be believing in Christianity because of the threat of hell for nonbelievers. They are told that they will go to hell if they don’t adhere to Christianity, and then reason that their safest option would be to believe in Christianity – except there is not much logic behind this. If we unpack this threat, we see that is anecdotal. No supernatural proof is given to validate this claim. The threat just scares them so much that they think following the religion to avoid this threat is the best course of action. The size of the unproven threat is just so big that they feel that they can’t risk it. Additionally, this is also not a rational reason to follow a religion, as there are other religions that have the threat of hell, like Islam, and these religions often do not allow for a belief in both. The religion one chooses will therefore be the one with the scarier version of hell. This reason is likely to affect those who are uncritical thinkers.  
  
Indoctrination, particularly in childhood, causes people to be religious as they take for granted the truth of the religion they are a part of. This is an effective method of converting someone to a religion as with the limited intellectual abilities of children, they are unlikely to be critical of the ideas given to them. If one of the first beliefs someone has is that if they question their religion they will be punished, they are unlikely to shed this religion later on in life.   
  
Access to religious communities is perhaps the biggest reason due to what these communities offer. This relates to the first-mentioned reason, fear, as the religious group may threaten outsiders. An example of this is people converting to Islam to reduce their chances of being targets for jihadists, or any other religious group that threatens outsiders with oppression or violence. These communities offer several benefits to outsiders who do not necessarily want to join because the religion has proof for being true. Homeless people may convert for food, lonely people may convert for friends, capitalists for access to a new customer base and politicians for more followers. This reason is due to the power which religions have garnered as a result of the first two reasons.   
  
If these are the reasons that people have for being religious, people do not follow their teachings because they are objectively true or the result of critical thinking. For the purposes of this argument, an objective truth refers to demonstrable evidence that equates exactly to the claim being made. One example would be if someone tells someone else about magic and is able to show it to them, too. I acknowledge that the human experience is unfalsifiably subjective, but also that there are certain things that those who aren’t mentally challenged can agree on based on there consistent demonstrability. For instance, the fact that humans need to respirate to live.   
  
In conclusion, people are religious because they are scared of stories which they have no evidence for, because their critical thinking was hindered by being taught these stories from a young age, or because being a part of a religious group benefits them socially, economically or politically.

If the child is of a different race, then obviously there is no need to have ""the talk"" since the child couldn't possibly not know.*

If a child is told from as early as they can understand that they were adopted (as opposed to the parents being the biological parents) then they will have less adjustment issues. They will have known all along, and it will have been their reality all along.

By contrast, it can be devastating when some well-meaning parents wait until the kid is in the teens or 20s (or even later) to reveal the news that they were adopted. The rationale that is often given is something like, *""Well, we wanted to wait until he/she was of a mature enough old age to understand, to break the news.""*

The problem with waiting that long to break the news is that by that point the kid has long built up a foundation of concrete assumptions - believing all alone that the parents were the real biological parents - and then, when they've lived with that basis/assumption for so long, you suddenly kick out the foundations from underneath them and make them realize that they'd been on the wrong assumption for 16, 17 or 20 years, causing them to question everything. That shocking news can crash them, especially considering that adolescence or young adulthood is often a time when people are dealing with many hormonal/stressful/tough-social issues to begin with.

The technology for digital BF/GFs is getting more advanced. Very soon we will have GF/BFs powered by Artificial Intelligence with virtual reality and other digital tools that are immersive enough to fill someone’s biological desires for an intimate or sexual relationship. I think this is a good thing for a couple reasons.  
  
1. There is a growing number of people that are lonely and unsatisfied with the dating market.  
  
 I believe that having an AI partner you can customize to your preferences fill this void would dramatically decrease resentment, suicide rates and extremism with these people.  
  
2. It would take away money from digital platforms and the sex industry that exploit the lonely and sex workers for profit.  
  
Industries such as Porn sites, dating apps, Sex workers, etc make billions of dollars exploiting people’s desire for sex and intimate relationships. These industries are often staffed with sex workers and in some cases children that are sexually abused and manipulated or forced in to sex work.  
  
I see something like a $60 AI Gf/BF simulator you pay for once and can add additional content through an open source modding community as a far better alternative to spending hundreds, in some cases thousands, of dollars a month on industries are rampant with sexual abuse on real people.  
  
3. People that want relationships with real people will still have relationships with real people.  
  
The option to date real people will not go away and there will always be people available that would prefer to date a real person. Even if this technology leads to a shortage of partners of a particular gender having multiple partners in a relationship is growing to be more socially acceptable.   
  
Those that are willing to lower their standards or compromise for a poly relationship will still be able find a real relationship. If not then the option to have an artificial partner remains.

1,2023-12-05,"CMV: Bad representation is representation. Fighting for ""Good"" representation, when done badly, is counter productive and can lead to ""No"" representation or more ""Bad"" representation",u/JustOneLazyMunchlax,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18be26g/cmv_bad_representation_is_representation_fighting/,changemyview,"So, I may not be as articulate as I'd like, and I'd love to ask if you can bear with my ramble as I try to make sure my thought process carries through.

I classify the desire of ""Representation"" as the desire to see your likeness in some fashion, within media, in the hopes of relating to said image or character, and thus using it as a form of relief, inspiration or other.

So, you want to see yourself. You wanna see people like you. As well as wanting this concept shared with others.

It's a bit vague that, but I hope you get what I mean?

Now.

I believe we can seperate representation into two categories.

Who you are, and what you look like.

I believe there is a distinct seperation between these concepts, and each of them comes with its own desire to be represented. Its all good and well that you empathise with a character, but you also want to actually *see* yourself to some degree, no?

I am **all for** wanting representation, and I'd love to be in a world where there was more of it. **But**, there isn't representation as people would like it, and I believe that the methods people employ in pursuit of that, are somewhat counter productive to the end goal, and may actually be making it more difficult, and so it may take longer to ever reach that state, if compared to them just sucking it up instead of trying to force things.

I'll try to break this down into several things, to really convey my thought process.

# Bad Representation

So, bad representation I'm going to separate into two groupings.

**Limited Representation**

""All depictions of X are like Y, and this is an issue.""

This is an argument that is relatable, I understand it. What limited representation you get, may paint a bad picture. If most say, Black roles, had them as criminals, is that not propagating the stereotype that black people are criminals? Not right.

So what's the solution? The solution is to have more representation with diverse roles. Right? You'd think so. Then [this happens](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxwBxPz_95cvjP6KRnbJ-_JAhkCNEu9mvO?si=mqaA5Eaes0c2FfHk). To quote for anyone that doesn't want to see the clip, this is from Russel T Davies, the writer of Doctor Who, on a character known as Davros, who is a Space Nazi.

""There's a problem with the Davros of old, in which, he's a wheelchair user **Who is** evil, and I / A lot of us had problems with that, of associating disabilities with evil.""

Yes, we had a space nazi who was missing the lower half of his body, and existed in a ""Mobile Life Support Machine"", and they decided to retcon that and give him his legs back, remove his prosthetic eye in favour of real ones, basically undo all the injuries he experienced in his youth, and made him a stereotypical caricature of ""Evil Nazi"", because not doing that apparently meant that we associated disabilities with evil.

To me, this is an extreme reaction. The solution to lacking representation, is MORE representation, not removing them.

And yes, Space Nazi, I get it. But this is a character that has accepted themself and used their genius to make a point in the world, that itself can be inspiring for people in a wheelchair, only the real person in a wheelchair uses their genius for good, because they're not insane.

**Constant negative Representation**

This is a follow up of the previous one, but it's focusing more on the ""There are pretty much only depictions of people like me in negative ways.""

So, whatever group you consider yourself, imagine this group is only ever the villain.

Well, we all need to appreciate that, whether its how you think or a limitation on your body, limitations do exist that may prevent certain people from taking on certain roles.

Examples.

James Bond versus Johnny English.

If you are MI5 and you want a master spy, you probably seek to take someone who is physically fit and able, and train them, right? How much sense does it make to take someone say, in a wheelchair, or overweight, and make them into a master spy? It works in Comedies like Johnny English, but in a serious film, it would require a degree of suspension of disbelief.

Now, that doesn't mean we can't use them in that role. Instead of James Bond, we say, make them the Tech person. Then we do a twist movie where the spy dies in an attack and they end up taking over because nobody else is around. Thus, we have a movie where a non-typical person can be in a serious role that you wouldn't normally expect. But how often can this happen? How many movies can we do that fit this?

Also, some things are just easier to do with villains.

When you are from a marginalised group, people who are discriminated against, bullied or mistreated... It's so easy to use that as rationale in how a character goes off the deep end to become a villain or an antagonist. I don't even need to justify it, ""This character was born different and they grew to hate it"" etc.

Overdone? Perhaps, but you get that it's easier to just use that, so you don't have to try to find another rationale to justify it.

That's not even including that some people are just difficult to make as heroes.

Myself? I'm an Autistic individual who doesn't experience emotion the same way others do. My own mother used to think I was a psychopath because I wasn't particularly expressive. Guess what? Almost every character (And there aren't many of these) that I have related to, have been villains / antagonists.

Because turning someone with my personality into a hero is difficult, and most of you normal thinking people may struggle to empathise with them. Whereas, its easy for someone with my personality, apparently, to be a villain.

so I have come to terms with it. Oh, you can write GOOD characters designed off of individuals like me, but I expect them to be incredibly rare.

**Inaccurate or Unrealistic representation**

This is largely my least liked argument. To fully explain this, I'll use Black Americans as my example.

I find that some people seem to take the experiences they've had; Racism, Discrimination, Prejudice, Oppression, Poverty etc. They take all of these, and combine them together into ""Black Identity"". Any black character, to them, has to embody all of these things.

I can't say how prevailing this idea is, but it exists at least in a small degree. But it leads to what they call ""Racial Identity"" where culture, background and everything gets lumped into ""Race"".

And they begin to fail to empathise with characters that hold ""Portions"" of them.

In my mind, they should be able to empathise with characters of any race or sex, who have had similar things happen. 

Of course, a character that embodies most / all of your experiences would be lovely and maybe life changing. Yet every person is unique and different, and you can't replicate that.

This logic would mean that characters like Carlton Banks from Fresh Prince, could not exist unless they are a main character. Because if you aren't explicitly seeing their battle against prejudice (The few times it happened), then it doesn't happen, and despite the fact that characters like him do exist in reality, it gets shoved into a ""Token black person"" or bad representation, because apparently most black Americans do not find themself in that specific person.

I say this, there is more to a person and character than superficial things. While I understand the desire to see yourself, as much as possible represented, that doesn't mean that anyone who ""Kinda"" matches you but ""Doesn't fully"" is bad representation. They can just be representing someone else.

# Sensitivity readers

A group of individuals designed to read an authors story and inform them of any sensitive or offensive topics.

A novel concept. I've seen some people describe them as a ""Tool"" an author should use.

I don't like them.

Why?

Because offense is taken, not given. What metric do they use to determine what is or isn't offensive? They're going to use the subjective take of a subset of the population, without any real basis on it. In fact, they're equal parts protecting an author from twitter hatred as they are preventing certain groups from being represented because they have decided that type of representation is ""Harmful"".

One writer said to me, ""You dont have to listen to them"", and I counter with this:

I once designed a romance story about a transgender character who was hiding away, pretending to be cis. I got told I was fetishizing and sexualising trans people by writing a trans character who could ""pass as a cis woman"" because ""Real trans women dont look like that""

I was 20 something and after being told that, I ended up scrapping the story.

I saw a 15 year old white kid enter a writing community and briefly talk about how his story has a Moon Goddess who is black. He barely got to talk about her before the writing community warned him that he had to be careful about that, and when he said she was beautiful, was warned that doing that might constitute ""Fetishizing"" black women.

He ended up deciding that her ""Race"" was more cosmetic, given she was a Goddess and didn't come with any ""Black Culture"" and thus decided to make her white, even having the art redone, because he was too afraid of making his ""Perfect character"" offend and upset people.

I've seen other authors talk about their experiences with transgender characters, and how portraying them is difficult because different sub-sets of the trans community have different stances, like how some want the character to be explicitly stated on whether they've had certain surgeries or not because that apparently factors into their ability to relate and feel represented by them.

# Research

""You shouldn't write an X character without sufficient research.""

Okay, how should I research? Lets return to ""Black"" characters. Can I research them in Africa? France? Britain? Oh, American? Okay. East versus West coast. Poverty stricken or middle class? Upper class? Which specific subset of people am I researching? How much is enough research?

Okay.

Now I want to have a Mexican character too... Oh, I need to research them as well...

With each minority I include, I apparently need to research them as well.

# Conclusion

Ultimately, a lot of writers I see fall into two camps.

One side doesn't care and writes what they want.

The other settles for avoiding writing about anything sensitive, because non-representation to them, is better than doing it badly. This to me, is why we have less representation than we could have.

It's easier to just ""Not specify race"" and ""Leave things open to the reader"" than to have explicit exposure to minorities as side characters, because doing so runs the risk of bothering people in any of the above ways.

And making them a main character? Apparently there's too much ""We could do it wrong.""

I personally feel, that if you simply made your desire for a relatable character more known.

If you put your money and time to characters you found more relatable.

Say, pool a community's money into organising a context to encourage writers and creators to do MORE for your community in terms of representation, is better than criticising anyone who you feel ""Hasn't done you justice"" when it comes to representation.

I think bad representation can still do a lot of good, in terms of letting people still see themselves, to any degree, and may even inspire people to want to do it better in the future.

But I believe avoiding ""Bad representation"" is contributing to why there isn't as much representation as we wish.

And the goal of making a ""Representative character"" that meets a sensitivity's readers checkbox will lead to bland characters that aren't characters, because they're made to appeal to ""As many individuals as possible.""

Here's my suggestion:

1. Immediate ceasefire, nothing can move ahead without one.

2. Hostage negotiations. Israel and Hamas need to come to the table and negotiate the release of all hostages, the ones captured on Oct 7th AND the ones held under administrative detention in Israel. Remember that many in Israel are being held without charge, they are hostages too.

4. Security guarantees for Israel. Of course, Israel will be rightfully worried about another Oct 7th attack, so there should be a DMZ between Gaza and Israel, and increased security _around Gaza_ to protect Israelis.

5.  Release aid and supplies into Gaza so that Gazans can rebuild their livelihoods again while cutting all Hamas lifelines by bringing the PA into Gaza. Make sure all aid and supplies either go through international organisations or PA. With sufficient aid and time, Gazans will no longer rely on Hamas for their needs but on other organisations, weakening Hamas' support and relevance in Gaza. The blockade also needs to be lifted so that there's economic activity in the region.

6. Remove all settlers from the West Bank and convert all of West Bank into Zone A or B. Eventually, all of West Bank should be converted into Zone A. This is a move that Israel must make for any hope of peace. The injustice in the West Bank is a great source of anger Palestinians have towards Israel. If it's not done there's no chance for peace.

7. Initiate a peace process again. The goal of this process is to eventually achieve full Palestinian statehood within '67 borders. How that process looks I don't know but Israel should give up more of what they want than Palestine because it's Palestine running the risk of ethnic cleansing, not Israel. Palestinians need security guarantees more than Israelis need them."

162,2023-12-05,CMV: I think the existence of God is unknowable.,u/Geolib1453,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18bgaur/cmv_i_think_the_existence_of_god_is_unknowable/,changemyview,"As the title says, I believe the existence of God is unknowable, which makes me an agnostic. I have been looking into the issue of the existence of God and I have noticed either 2 (or 3) types of proving that God exists and these are as follows:  
1.  Arguments for god's existence that end up being debunked/don't actually prove what they try to prove  
Take for the example the ontological argument, which states that God is the greatest thing we can imagine, i'd not be great for it to not exist, therefore it must exist, which can be refuted by simply replacing God with anything, like a floating island full of riches or a world where everyone lives in harmony, Just because i'd be better for X thing to exist, doesn't mean that it does exist. Or for example the cosmological argument (at least for Aquinas), which states that physical things exist now, which means that something non-physical had to bring them into existence and that something is God. But, this doesn't prove say the Christian God, that non-physical thing could just as easily be the universe, this argument just doesn't prove God.  


2. Arguments for god's existence that rely on unfalsifiable hypotheses (in the vein of say the Invisible Pink Unicorn, or the Flying Spaghetti monster or Russell's Teapot)  


An example of this would be the theological argument, or at least how some like to reply to counter-arguments to it, with this argument saying that nature looks designed, therefore it has to be designed and defenders of God usually say that is because of his omni-potent and he made the world in a way that aligns with his omni-benevolency. But why do rabbits have tails that hunters can shoot at them? Why do hurricanes, floods exist? Why do we have blind spots in our eyes and other bodily imperfections, among other things, while some say that this is because we got punished. But if he did indeed have his omni properties, we couldn't have done the first ever sin and why would a very good God create creatures that didn't share this goodness? Also, it is likely that the Adam and Eve story isn't even real and is just myth, Evolution, not creationism is the theory most grounded in scientific evidence. Although, a conclusion that can be drawn is that there is a God that is not within the bounds of space time, that does not care about us just because he is morally gray, he is everywhere and everything, or many other things that just make his existence an unfalsifiable hypothesis that just doesn't satisfy anyone, like heck it just makes the belief in him as legit as believing in the Flying Spaghetti monster.  


3. Oh faith cannot be argued for or against, you just have to look for it yourself (fideism, the Leap of Faith)  


Some, like Kierkegaard say that faith ain't something that should be grounded in reason, its like a Leap of Faith in Indiana Jones, there is a big deep gap between the two cliffs and he (Jones) can't jump over it, but there is possibility that there is one, a 50/50 one. Keep in mind though, this is possibility. Heck, there is a 50/50 possibility for anything, the probability may as well have been 1% for there to have been a tiny bridge and there may have been an even slimmer chance for him to have made onto it and heck is Indiana Jones really a good example? Heck, the course of his character is determined by a God technically, that being the film's creator, but whatever. The Leap of Faith exemplifies the absurd source for meaning in this cold, meaningless universe that will most definitely not succeed, as Camus said (yes, I do believe in absurdism). The fact is, even if faith is something that does not rely on reason as per fideism, it still doesn't solve the issue of God. If he is beyond our space-time realm, he is everywhere and everything etc., cannot be detectable, smellable, tracable, he doesn't care about us or his creation and whatever other properties we assign to him then there is to be no difference between a God and no God at all and even if we were truly under such God and not under just a universe and not some being, which we don't know then the absurd still exists but that's a whole other topic.  


Still, I am willing to have my view changed, whether it would be to fully dismiss God or to somehow bring me back to him, like basically the goal is to fill this hole of unfalsifiables and bring it, the truth to me so that I can have a clear position on this once again.

I believe this because when someone inherits a disability such as downsyndrome it has two negative effects, firstly it effects that person, with a disability they are not able to live life in a way that they may like and they are extremely restricted in ability, it also has a impact on the rest of society as disabilities that are inheritance put a greater stress on the health system. Paticurally I think that eugenics are important due to the ability of the health system, currently the health system is able to allow someone who would have never gotten old enough to have kids only a hundred years ago to now live for years, this is obviously great however it means that natural selection no longer is occurring at all causing more harmful traits to enter the gene pool easier. Thus I believe that eugenics are a humane, safe and effective way to provide a artificial version of natural selection to remove harmful traits. 

I obviously don't think eugenics should be used for other things such as particular skin color eye color or height"

My boss is a woman and she constantly nags me at Target, whereas my male manager is much more sane and understanding.  When it comes to relationships, men are disincentivized to approach women today because they make fun of and paint men as creepy for asking them out thanks to MeToo.  Then women complain about where all the good men have gone.  Well, this is what they asked for.  They scared off the good men which made their exposure to the men who treat them like shit more likely.  Then when they get dumped by the toxic assholes, the decent men that get a chance tolerate all their past traumas with exes and hookups because if we lose that woman, we’re destined to be single for a longtime. Women have no scarcity when it comes to sex and intimacy which allows them to be absolute pieces of shit.  There is no humbling of women like men go through when they get rejected.  Millions of young men have become depressed, isolated, and want to drop out of society all because of the culture women have created in the past few years.  I believe society will see the ripple effects of all this misandry soon when men either kill themselves, rape women or go on mass shooter rampages. None of these actions I condone.

Additionally, I argue that this reasoning should also apply to the personal choice of using self-harmful drugs. At a minimum, these drugs should be considered on the same level as alcohol, which is widely accepted despite its potential for harm. While alcohol's widespread use and cultural integration may partly explain its statistically significant impact for garming non consumers, it's misleading to claim that alcohol is less harmful than some illegal drugs like marijuana or hallucinogens to those not directly consuming it."

However I want to let you know that it doesn't justify incels misogyny. I agree with what they say, and even though I am opened to debate and mindchanging, I am currently 99,9% certain about this mindset, as I have plenty of arguments and evidence. But having plenty of counterarguments could indeed open my mind.

I will try to use as less subjective opinions as possible, trying to be, objective and logical, easy to check the facts. Lets start with my point of view. First of all, we need to awknowledge the fact that women get approached or get attention way easier for women than for men. Now, if anyone wants to disagree to that, you can go r/askwomen in posts talking about it, and you can see women complaining about even getting approached every week. Now go get and ask men about it, and you will see that unless they are very pretty, they probably havent even been approached in his own life.

And not only that, but on dating apps it is even more noticeable. You can easily check their statistics and you will find the huge difference between attention in men and in women. Some people will reject dating apps idea, but still, as I mentioned, in real life it kinda happens too.

Well, my point is; if women get approached by many men and can get approached by many more even easier, it means that all of these men have competition. If a woman gets approached by 10 men, she is not going to choose the worst one (understandable), and some of those men are even relatively pretty.

My first point is simple, for every woman you approach, if you are ugly, there are several men prettier than you (and probably smarter, richer, etc, if you are in a very bad situation) already talking to her. This is kinda comparable to economies, and there's no reason to think it isn't. Like ""offer and demand"", if a product is very abundant, its value diminishes. Do you think I could easily sell an opened, dirty Coca-Cola can in a supermarket for $35 to anyone when there are many of clean, new cans around for $1? It is not very different.

Many people say ""women are drowning in salt water, and men are in the desert"" comparing both of their opportunities in dating. If you are the dirtiest drop of water in all that, it doesn't help. Some people use this analogy, probably without realising how they admitting that.

And guess what, it makes sense, because it is how life and evolution has been working, probably since the very beginning of sexual reproduction, and there is no logic to think that we are casually the only species in the world unlike it. Peacocks dance to impress their female counterpart, and if they are pretty and dance good enough, the will be chosen. Male monkeys have to fight each other for the only female monkey, and only the strongest one wins. And it could be due to the fact that female species have the highest risk with reproduction, as they are the ones who get pregnant and probably have to deal with the baby.

Because denying that, is also even denying natural selection, which in this case it is due to especifically sexual selection. Men bad genes are wiped out by not being able to attract women, and only the most suitable ones win.

Indeed, some ugly men will probably never be able to be desired by a woman. The ""there's always someone for everyone"" is actually an empty platitude that actually doesn't make sense to believe, because male species not ever finding a mate is really common, and also it is not as uncommon in humans as people believe (men don't go out there admitting this. You can easily see on Reddit men on their +50 who are virgin and never had a relationship).

Now, I will anticipate some of the responses I will get. I know you will, so if it is any of those, either elaborate it more or not say it.

""I know a man who has many partners and is very ugly and..."". Well, if she isn't a golddigger or it is not a one-sided relationship, then I am very certain that those guys you see are not the youngest generations. When marriage used to be more popular (people over 35 or so), each partner got someone and as we are a similar number of each sex each person got partnered. However, with poligamy and its super easy way to find it nowadays (Tinder, Badoo and others relationships) the vast majority of men are going for relationships with the top best men. Yes, a few selected men are with nearly all of them so that there are very few women left. If you were wondering how could it be possible for men to be alone being the same number of each sex, that's the reason (and all I said + dating apps statistics are a proof for that).

And if you are going to call me ""hateful"" or things like that, not to even comment. I don't dislike women for that, actually, if anything it would be men's fault, as pretty men get laid with ugly women, making it impossible for the ugly men to compete. Also, this is all about all the information I have found, and honestly it is not sexist to write a recopilation of all my arguments and sources for others to see and tell me what they think. Questioning things is always great."

I will try to focus more on the issue of pressuring young people to go to college rather than the politics of college financing, college affordability, financial aid, and student loan debt, but will still touch on some of these topics because they are related and needed to provide context. For the past two decades and possibly now, a slew of teachers, guidance counselors, and parents have been pressuring high school students to go to college because ""they will never be successful if they don't have a Bachelor's degree"". Now, I am not anti-education nor do I think college is a scam (in most cases, excluding for-profit colleges and some overpriced private non-profit colleges for obvious reasons), but I do think that teachers pressuring teens and young adults to go to college and ""not to worry about what life after college will be like regarding employment and student loans"" is doing more harm than good. We have two generations of people (Millennial Generation and Generation Z) who have significant populations of people who racked up significant and some cases unmanageable student loan debt due to hear the classical spiel that goes like this...

&#x200B;

>""College graduates on average earn more than mere recipients of a high school diploma. College is worth it and student loans are good debt, they are an investment in your future. Invest in you, and don't worry about what repayment would entail when taking out the student loans. If loans are going to help you, then that's what you need to do. If you don't go to college, you will never be successful.""

I honestly think that we as a society need to rethink how we make sense of higher education, getting the most out of it, and making more responsible decisions about paying for college so that even younger generations (Generation Alpha, Generation Beta, etc.) do not find themselves in a similar place that Gen Y (Millennial) and Gen Z are currently in when it comes to employment and student loans. When I was a senior in high school, teachers were encouraging me to go to college after I finish high school and while that is all good in general, some teachers told me to go to college at all costs, even if it means taking five or six years to graduate, even if it means going deep into debt to pay for college, or even if you get a job that is not relevant to your major. I am honestly getting tired of hearing this spiel over and over again.

&#x200B;

The Great Recession of 2008 was a harsh metaphorical storm and rude awakening for the College Class of 2008 and 2009. Graduated in a bad job market, usually have large student loan debts, and having to cope with rising living costs, these recent grads at the time had to make tough financial decisions after college that they did not anticipate when they were a senior in high school. This includes...

* Live with parents after college graduation.
* Delay saving for retirement.
* Delay saving for a down payment on a mortgage.
* Delay saving for a car.
* Delay getting married and having children.

Among other important financial decisions that benefit the economy just because they went to college. Now, this is where it sucks for the college graduates. Nobody forced them against their will to go to college nor were they forced to take out student loans. Life comes with risks that we cannot easily predict in hindsight, but many of these young people did what they did because their parents, guidance counselors, and teachers pressured them to go to college and said that they will never amount to anything without a Bachelor's degree. Now while it is increasingly true that some level of education beyond high school is needed to be gainfully employed and generally successful in the 21st century economy, **more college graduates are employed in jobs that only require a high school diploma**. Plus, they incurred massive debts due to the rising costs of college. This debt does not go away if you don't complete your degree program, are unsatisfied with your education experience, cannot find a  job, or even (in most cases) file for bankruptcy. This is absolute trash.

&#x200B;

Our youth deserve better than this. They got the college education, but they are not reaping the benefits they were ""promised"" in high school. Many of these Millennials and Zoomers have to accept having to cope with a lower standard of living compared to their parents or grandparents generation. And it all started from the over-hyped propaganda that college is ""always"" worth it and that you ""MUST"" go to college ""at all costs"". The reason why this pissed me off so much that I have to make a post on this subreddit is that I was raised and taught to believe that an education is ""the great equalizer"" and that we should trust what admissions officers, guidance counselors, parents, and teachers have to say about college not knowing that these people may have ulterior motives or an agenda and that they are dealing with impressionable teenagers and young adults.

&#x200B;

These people need to be held more accountable about their claims and high pressure tactics to get young people to go to college ""at all costs"". College is not right for everyone, and even when it is right for a high school senior, it would behoove the student to pursue scholarships, grants, work-study, and other cost effective means of pursuing a higher education. Now, I am not made at the attractive women who got into U.S. News and World Report top 100 National Universities like Yale, Duke, Stanford, MIT, and Harvard, but pressuring ""everyone"" to get into the best ranked and expensive degree programs is harmful and should be replaced by something more practical to the individual needs of the student.

&#x200B;

I had teachers tell me that ""you cannot be a student without a student loan"" and ""you WILL have debt so might as well get started at 18 with some federal student loans"". I was able to prove them wrong. I was able to win a big scholarship along with some smaller scholarships as well as grants and work-study and a tuition waiver that allowed me to pay my way through an in-state public university for undergraduate without taking out a single student loan. I am so happy that I did not take out loans for college because it offered me so much flexibility after graduation that wouldn't be possible if I have the typical $27,000 in federal student loan debt. But I digress. Trusted adults need to be honest and not have ulterior motives or agendas when talking to teens about going to college.

I accept society as it is and will adapt whenever it applies to me but I personally feel women have a leg up on relationships and sex. Simply because they have so much value when men basically have very little to give. So they often start with disadvantages.
So the obviously solution is to found out what women want and what they need and the biggest reason why it is so hard to get these things is because you need to date more women to get them.
Confidence, humor, sex game, conversation, emotional connection, etc. Is what can be acquired through dating women. The hard part is you have to find women when you absolutely nothing to offer them and hope they accept you. Which can be very fustrating. Not impossible but indeed very hard.
When you're guy you have to know how to please women and know exactly what they want because they don't like to tell you what they want, just expect you to just know. It's like playing Dark Souls on a slightly harder setting with absolutely no tutorials or HUD. You're basically going in blind. - u/taken250  Nowadays girls have ridiculous expectations and standards for guys that it’s hard for most men who are short, have small dicks, and don’t look as good or aesthetic enough for these modern day girls it really hard out here for men and I don’t think people see that."

By negating most of their former reproductive duties.,u/Puettster,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18bpd3g/cmv_feminism_has_won_in_post_christian_societies/,changemyview,"The capitalist society exploits manual work multiplied by productivity in order to aquire more capital for the capitalists.   
This meant in the world war that women had to leave their reproductive obligations in order to work in the factories to produce more wartime goods.   
This cemented the biggest win for feminism. 

Women historically were bound by their reproductive abilities. Not only the production of kids in order to expand the systems capacities, but also nurturing them in a nurturing environment, mostly maintained by their housework.   
This was upheld for long time through christian natalist values.   
Capitalism lead to them having to work less in reproduction, as convenience in household items improved. The productivity lead to women being able to nurture themselves more, which in return meant that they could work in jobs post war that improved their social standing. Which resulted in them having leverage to deny the social norm of creating huge amounts of offspring.   


Women don't (yet) have equal rights, but by denying reproduction they managed to ""suicide bomb"" the system into either turning into a different one, or facing the last collapse.   


But the evergrowing capitalist hunger for growth led them looking elsewhere. Most of the production process and reproduction process has been outsourced and globalised. And societies where women are not able to deny the reproduction will continue to shoulder the global economy. 

This is also means that citiziens of industrialised nations get collectively elevated into a faux-capital class, where our welfare is the conclusion of the expanding capitalist machine.   
BTW: This leads to two things.

1. immigration to earn the capitalist privilege 
2. the dying of socialist movements in the industrialised world, as people don't feel the true material implications

What are possible conclusions out of this idk.   


But pls change my view. Also sorry for my english, I am not a native speaker.

1,2023-12-05,CMV: Going over the speed limit - speeding - is not inherently dangerous; reckless or ignorant driving is.,u/Sevuhrow,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18bt02k/cmv_going_over_the_speed_limit_speeding_is_not/,changemyview,"Note: This is written from an American driving perspective, so it may not match up with how laws or views of driving in other countries work.

My view is that speeding is not necessarily a dangerous act - nor even one that should be harshly enforced - as much as reckless driving is. I understand that ""reckless driving"" is a pretty vague term, so I'll elaborate on my title here.

In my view, reckless driving is the real cause of accidents, which speeding may be a part of. This doesn't mean that speeding itself is necessarily dangerous. For example, it would be reckless to go 30 or more over the speed limit in a residential neighborhood where the speed limit is, say, 20 miles per hour. This would put you at 50 mph in an area that usually has narrow roads, obstructions, kids/animals that might dash into the road, and foot traffic. This would be reckless, thus speeding would be dangerous.

However, adapt this to a highway situation, and going 30 miles over a speed limit of 70 is not necessarily dangerous. On a freeway, everyone is going fast - so much so that going slow is often more harmful than matching the speed of traffic. In some areas (Miami comes to mind,) going the speed limit is actually *too slow* compared to the speed of the cars around you, so speeding is a safer maneuver than going the speed limit, as your slow speed will impede the flow of traffic and put you at risk for an accident.

But it's not as simple as residential vs freeway. It's also important to take into account traffic conditions and the density of cars on the road. For example, I would frequently take an interstate connecting my state to reach the other side, and it would be rare to see more than 0-3 cars at any point in time. In this case, it is not at all a danger to go vastly over the speed limit. It is a long, flat road designed for high speeds, with no surrounding woods (thus, animals,) or curves to present any danger. 

The last example is similar to the Autobahn in Germany, which often does not have speed limits at all, except in residential or risky areas as outlined above.

However, if you take that interstate example and apply it to a busy, winding road, then it certainly is risky to be going over the speed limit. You will have to be weaving between cars and taking sharp turns to navigate the road's curvature. In that case, speeding is dangerous.

So, CMV that speeding is inherently dangerous."

It is easy to use a man as a means to an ends as they are easier to find and to have sex with and once you are having sex the man thing just goes away as really most of the sensation is the same.

Significant reform is needed.",u/BrutallyPretentious,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18bz75e/cmv_us_police_have_a_useful_place_in_society_but/,changemyview,"Hello everyone. I'm a fairly progressive guy and I wanted to get some input on this topic. 

A reductive summary of my political philosophy is: ""everyone should be allowed to do anything they want to until it harms someone else or puts someone at a great risk of harm"". 

I don't hate cops, but I do dislike they way they are used in our society, and that is the focus of the post. 

My main points - based on my personal experience - are as follows: 

1: There is no standard. 

As a former military member I was subject to the [UCMJ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Code_of_Military_Justice), an additional set of rules I was obligated to abide by because of my privileged (and tax-funded) place in society. 

While I understand that police departments are governed by state and local law because they are not federal organizations, the fact that we're still debating policy regarding body camera usage and use of force is embarrassing. 

If a couple million military personnel can abide by the UCMJ, a couple million cops can turn their fucking cameras on. 

Civil cases where the footage ""goes missing"" or the camera ""wasn't on"" should be automatically dismissed. 

2:  Inconveniencing the public without adding to the general welfare: 

In short, nobody cares if someone drives 62 in a 55 or drinks when they're 19 years old. Fining people for these ""offenses"" is a net negative for society for two reasons:  1 - Everyone will continue to do it anyway and 2 - You're punishing people for something that did not harm society as a whole. 

All this does is lower public trust in and appreciation for the police forces. 

3: Blatant hipocracy and lying. 

Back to MIPs, how many of the cops handing out those tickets waited until their 21st birthday to drink? Additionally, how many of those cops will tell people they can decline a breathalyzer in an implied consent state, conveniently leaving out that doing so means a 1 year license suspension and an arrest? 

Again another bad look for the cops. Drunk driving isn't okay, but neither is blatantly misleading the people you're supposed to be protecting. 

4: Enforcing laws simply because they are laws is a bad ideology.

""Police don't interpret the law, they enforce the law.""

This is a ""good"" concept only because the alternative is worse. Enforcing a law because ""It's the law"" is what lead to cops spraying black people with fire hoses during the civil rights movement for the ""crime"" of sitting next to a white person at a restaurant in the south. 

No, it isn't a 1-1 comparison to modern times, but the *mentality* is the same, and that is a cause for concern. 

Any argument that the mentality isn't the same is an argument that police interpret the law rather than enforce it. 

5: Enforcing a bad law is often actively harmful to society. 

How many people are currently in the US prison system for non-violent weed-related offenses? Does it benefit society for those people to be locked in cages, surging on tax dollars, when they could be working? 

Additionally, if a cop catches me using magic mushrooms to work on my drinking habit, does it benefit society for me to be thrown in jail for trying to better myself? 

If you're a cop, it doesn't matter. The substance is illegal and therefore the person is a criminal. The social cost of enforcing the law doesn't matter because ""it's the law"" is where the thinking stops. 

TLDR: The police forces should not be used for victimless ""offenses"" like 7-over speeding tickets, MIPs, and non-violent drug possession crimes. Instead they should be focused on emergency response, domestic abuse, reckless/drunk driving, etc."

I am a kind and ethical person, and genuinely care for and work for my teams.

I have only ever put someone on a PIP when my intention is to terminate. I will always give them every opportunity to meet minimum requirements, and pride myself on thinking creatively to help people to feel happy and accomplished at work. I manage managers, and it is an absolute must that they support and care for their people, and I push them hard on continuously developing their leadership skills, and creating a positive and genuinely supportive team identity.

I am of the firm belief that any manager that puts someone on a PIP, only to then have the person improve, has a lot to answer for. All coaching, training, adjustments, support, and information regarding consequences should have been given way before going the formal route in my view - what could a PIP possibly offer that couldn’t be offered prior to it getting to that?

When I put someone on a PIP, I hit it pretty hard and fast (with care to reduce as much damage as possible), but I leave no uncertainty and make it very clear by my suddenly super professional language and documentation of every issue that there is no chance of “passing.” This pressure has resulted in every employee I’ve ever had on a PIP resigning. I know what I have to do, and it is my responsibility to protect the rest of the team from the negatives of poor behaviour/performance, so I make the choice (as unpleasant as it is) and get it done.

People feel like shit while they’re on PIPs. I watch managers give mixed messages and drag the process out, with confused people not knowing what’s happening - this I feel impacts not just the employee on a PIP, but the broader team that has to deal with any associated discomfort.

Do everything in your power to help people improve, have their success and wellbeing as your number 1 goal, check yourself and ask for advice to ensure you’ve done all you can, then make the decision and rip the bandaid off quickly…am yet to hear an argument that has convinced me that this is not the best way to go, but am once again checking myself."

I was probably part of the last generation that mainly watched tv when they were bored since internet was new and not readily accessible. And I didn’t know it at the time but our childhood was really filled with a lot of amaizing content, Cartoons like Samurai Jack, Dexter, Dragon Ball..etc you know the famous ones and even some obscure ones that were filled with creativity and charm like Code Lyoko, Megas XLR, stuff that had been forgotten about today that is leagues better than what the kids these days watch. 
In the 2000s, you opened up the tv and you caught Kung Fu Hustle or Lord of the Rings by accident. I ask kids these days what movies they like, if they watch any films at all it’s just the latest marvel movie.

Sometimes you are bored and you are forced to watch the adult stuff like Top Gear, News, Politics, Documentaries by Nat Geo, some dramas but they all had a bare minimum level of quality and food for brain that is lacking these days, prsented by taleneted, charming, well spoken people. My heart really goes out to these kids who spend their 3 to 7 years watching cocomelon and tiktok trash and their 7-12 watching trashy videogame streamers with no personality or charm just playing videogames all day and doing trashy challenges, kids seem to have a parasocial relationship with these e-celebs that is quite sickening to me.

And the talking points I'm gonna criticize are talking points that I believed in and parroted at some point, and have since been convinced that they are poisonous and wrong.

There's a big thing about ""social construction"" that a lot of liberals harp on about. And...it's true! There's nothing wrong with the term ""social construction"" except that the majority of liberals seem to believe that this term somehow *excludes* biology, which is of course foolish.

For example, race is a social construction. That's true. The concept of race is a made-up one. In America, black guys are just called ""black"" as opposed to South African, West African, Haitian, etc for example. Black of course tells you...virtually nothing about a human being and so categorizing everyone with a dark complexion under this racial category is effectively useless in trying to categorize anything deeply biological except melanin production and everything associated with that. There simply *is* more variation within a race than across it and we simply *should* treat everyone as individuals and systemic racism simply *does* exist on a deep unconcious level.

And yet, it is clear that human beings are ***not*** equal. That you could group human beings into certain populations. That these populations could be substantially different, and that differences in outcomes *absolutely* have a genetic component. Virtually every trait has a genetic component. And btw it makes no sense to think of a trait as 50% environment and 50% genetic or something any more than it makes sense to think of freshly baked pizza as being 50% brick oven or 50% heat.

I have a sense in talking with most liberals that human beings are some kind of special creature for which we don't have instincts, we don't have talents, we're all blank slates and evolution as a concept of explaining biological change and differences stops being applicable above the neck.

To my knowledge, there have been virtually no Ashkenazi Jews in the 100m dash. Yet, no one goes around suggesting that there's some kind of innate prejudice against Jewish people in the 100m. Virtually all of the best sprinters in the 100m dash are of West African Descent. It doesn't matter what country they are from. It's pretty uncontroversial to suggest that there is a strong genetic advantage for this cohort. Yet, if you were to suggest that Ashkenazi Jews have an advantage genetically in the intelligence department you would be immediately shouted down as a racist. 

After actually reading Charles Murray's book ""the bell curve"" and seeing the reaction of liberals to it and the reaction across college campuses to it, it immediately made me feel deep-seated disgust that we couldn't have a dispassionate discussion about it and vigorous debate. Instead this guy was toxic poison to everyone. In no way am I suggesting the bell curve gets everything right, it almost certainly doesn't, and quite frankly I don't agree with any of Murray's politics. I think the conclusion he drives from his data is horribly off the mark...yet there is nothing wrong with his data as far as I can tell. Data isn't racist.

So, in short I think Liberals should stop pretending human beings are blank slates. They're not. Human beings are *animals.* Intelligence is a real thing, intelligence varies across individuals, and it also varies across populations. It is almost certainly a nuanced, complex phenomena interconnected and inseperable with genetics and environment. We should look at the data dispassionately.

4,2023-12-06,CMV: Gaza death toll numbers are generally reliable,u/GoSouthCourt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18c5111/cmv_gaza_death_toll_numbers_are_generally_reliable/,changemyview,"The[ Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-officials-15000-likely-killed-in-gaza-since-start-of-war-5000-of-them-are-hamas/) ran a piece yesterday saying that IDF officials said that 15,000 likely killed, of which 5,000 are Hamas agents. This, alongside another piece by [ynet](https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/b1oigmnxa) a month ago reporting that an Israeli senior official believes 20,000 have died, and[ a piece](https://thehill.com/policy/international/4301551-gaza-deaths-likely-higher-than-cited-us-official/) reporting that US officials believe the death toll in Gaza is likely ""higher than being reported, shows that the death toll [reported](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/hamas-says-gaza-death-toll-over-16000/) by Gazan health ministry, just over 16,000 now, is _generally reliable_. 

Regarding the deaths of women and children, [UN has reported](https://www.careinternational.org.uk/news-stories/70-of-those-killed-in-gaza-are-women-and-children-care-warns-the-un-security-council/#:~:text=A%20staggering%2070%25%20of%20the,based%20violence%20in%20overcrowded%20shelters.) that ""70% of those killed in Gaza are women and children"". 70% of 15,000 is 10,500, which means about 4,500 adult men have died. Gazan health ministry [reports](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/hamas-says-gaza-death-toll-over-16000/) that about 73% of all deaths are women and children. This is consistent with the pattern that Gaza death toll numbers are [historically reliable](https://www.vox.com/world-politics/23940215/israel-palestine-gaza-hamas-death-toll-war-fatalities-verified-count-conflict). It appears that this IDF official is counting all adult men as Hamas fighters, which is consistent with what the [US has done](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html) in the war against Al-Qaeda, so this explains the ""5000 Hamas fighters"" that is widely reported.

Now, I'm sure people will quote the hospital blast story or how on certain days children's death toll is higher than the overall death toll to dismiss the death tolls. I do not deny that this figure is inaccurate and at times unreliable, but it's unreasonable to expect Gaza health officials to count deaths reliably in a war zone. I mean, even Israel had to revise their death toll from Oct 7th from 1,400 to 1,200. It's difficult for governments to calculate the death toll precisely amidst the chaos, but I don't see any reason why we should doubt Gaza's numbers any more than numbers reported by other governments in times of crisis. Their numbers are preliminary estimates and useful for tracking the devastation over time."
2,2023-12-06,CMV: We should be extremely skeptical of anything that's told to us about nutrition (almost to the point of not believing most of it).,u/midwestboiiii34,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18c5h2k/cmv_we_should_be_extremely_skeptical_of_anything/,changemyview,"I have this view because I believe the following things are true: 

1. The nutrition pyramid was complete BS and was told as a complete truth for many years.
2. Large companies fund A LOT of the research done on nutrition.
3. People on a lot the ""fad diets"". I.e. keto, carnivore, etc. experience a lot of benefits.

This is mostly coming from the fact that it's upsetting how hard it is to eat a clean diet with how much crap there is in all of our food today. There's a ton of contradictory information everywhere which makes it extremely difficult for me to believe most things I'm told on nutrition. This coupled with the fact that we were all completely oblivious to the food pyramid BS that went on for so many years and that a ton of food research is funded by the food companies themselves, makes me not want to believe any of the science out there about nutrition."
1,2023-12-06,CMV: Eric Cartman deserved a better fate than what he got in the South Park Post Covid ending,u/Kpatmckenzie,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18c5kvz/cmv_eric_cartman_deserved_a_better_fate_than_what/,changemyview,"I am not happy to what Eric Cartman got at the ending of the post covid episode and I believe he deserves better and here’s why 

1. Throughout the history of South Park in every episode where Cartman is up to no good he always gets his comeuppance. Evidence for this is where when Cartman mocked God, the Boy was struck by lighting gravelly injuring him. Another Example of this being is when he mocked breast cancer and gotten the shit beaten out of him by Wendy. Cartman has also been getting what he deserves what happened to him was just overkill. 
2. Cartman literally worked hard and improved himself in his Rabbi life. He became a better individual while the rest of South Park mostly changed and remained miserable. It is ridiculous that Cartman strives to be better than suddenly it all gets taken away from him just like that and he ends up like a homeless bum that’s sad.
3. If Cartman is really gonna end up like a Homeless bum then 99% characters deserve to end up as a Homeless bums too. Wendy a popular character had orchestrated a teacher to be shot into the sun which is just insane. It’s unfair how Cartman ends up with the bad future while kids in the show who’ve done bad things too. Don’t give me that excuse “Eric has done worser things” each character has done bad in the show and should in theory get their comeuppance too. 
4. Eric is actually fucking tragic the boy was constantly shit on by Kyle and the other kids who were was repeatedly mocking his weight. It is even said by Pip that Cartman was relentlessly bullied by the other kids before he became the bully. 
5. Eric is constantly reminded by the town by how much his mother sleeps with other men. The poor boy even watched his mother get proboned by a plumber which is just fucked up.
6. The entire town of South Park lies to Cartman on who his real father is they just told him that some random Denver Bronco player is true dad when it took years to tell Cartmans real father was Jack Tenorman.
7. Cartman made the ultimate sacrifice to fix his happy life and family to fix their friendship only to end up w homeless bum I’m sorry but that’s totally unfair."
271,2023-12-06,CMV: American political labels are just a form of fandom and religion.,u/DougieSlug,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18c63sf/cmv_american_political_labels_are_just_a_form_of/,changemyview,"As I've gotten older, I've been been through numerous political cycles. I used to wrap myself under the label of ""liberal"" and seek shelter. I felt like I was assigned my list of enemies and issues, and then I endlessly debated them on the internet. I bought all my liberal books. I watched all the liberal shows. I found my tribe like a sports team and spent time trying to score points 

After awhile, I feel like the goal post just randomly move around.

I joined the ACLU when I was 18 to fight for absolutist free speech, but it seems like the issue flipped to the other side.

I was called a radical leftist for supporting Howard Dean, and now he is considered centrist trash.

I supported the original ""Feminazi"" Hillary Clinton, and now she is considered centrist trash.

I did the whole Bernie Sanders thing, and now young Leftists on Twitter call him sell-out centrist trash.

I wasted almost a decade debating against George W. Bush and Neocons, and with the snap of a finger, 2023 conservatives discarded them like trash.

I live in Michigan where Kid Rock and Donald Trump are considered conservatives.

Politics seems like one big opposite game. If Russia invaded Ukraine while Biden is President, you see soft support by conservatives for Putin.

I ultimately believe that if people want to participate in the political system, a greater emphasis should be on working on intellectual honestly, instead of falling into some political label. No one is willing to concede anything while taking shelter under a label. There is no way a binary system can solve every issue. The answers must be a mixture of both sides at times."
134,2023-12-06,"CMV: Poor people need certain things like refrigerators, smartphones, internet access, and used cars to survive in modern America and should ""treat themselves"" once in a while if they can afford it.",u/Prudent-Reporter-400,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18c6c27/cmv_poor_people_need_certain_things_like/,changemyview,"So, I watched a video by this YouTuber called Lauren Chen who used to be called by the pseudonym *The Roaming Millennial* who made a response video to this feminist and trans activist named Riley J. Dennis about ""poor people deserve nice things once in a while and should not be constantly struggling"". Lauren is a libertarian who leans right and at the time of the video was skeptical of the efficacy of welfare programs. That said, she responded to Riley's original video.

&#x200B;

So Riley in her original video makes this argument.

&#x200B;

>""So I have this controversial opinion that poor people deserve nice things every once in a while. I do not think that poor people do not need to be constantly struggle to survive. I do not know why this is controversial, but here we are.""

I partially agree with this statement from Riley. Poor people should not be constantly be struggling to survive and to pay the bills and I say this as an adult child of a single mom who does not have a college degree. I wish that poor people in America and other countries can achieve a basic standard of living without struggling to survive with their needs. But unfortunately, we do not live in that ideal world, even though we have made strides in combating global and national poverty.

Where I disagree with Riley is that I do not think **anyone** **deserves or should be entitled to** nice things once in a while. Luxuries are nice to have and it can suck when you cannot afford a luxury, but treating yourself is not an entitlement nor is something anyone deserves just because they are alive and breathing. If you want to have nice things and to treat yourself, you need to have surplus income and that is something many poor people lack.

The libertarian Lauren Chen making the response video to Riley actually agrees with me on this on that part but then says weird stuff like how ""you do not **need** a refrigerator, or a smartphone, or home internet access, or a used car to survive in modern America"". This is strange to me because there are arguments to make that fridges, smartphones, internet access, and used cars are essential to have to survive in modern America. You need these things to apply to jobs, move from place to place in cases where biking and public transportation is not practical, get the news, apply for government benefits, correspond to emails, fill out documents, access information to make informed decisions, etc.

&#x200B;

Lauren said in the case of smartphones and internet access that you can always go to the library to access information on the internet if you do not have the means to buy a laptop, smartphone, or home internet access. But the COVID-19 pandemic changed that. Many people needed to apply for unemployment benefits, severance, SNAP, TANF, Medicaid, rental/mortgage assistance, and other government benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic and many public libraries were closed to prevent the spread of the virus. So many people had to wait months to get their benefits due to not having a laptop/desktop, smartphone, tablet, or home internet access. It was then programs like the Emergency Broadband Benefit and Affordable Connectivity program that provided affordable home internet access during and shortly after the pandemic. The pandemic widened the digital divide because more of life was being done on electronic devices and financially underserved groups were largely left behind during the pandemic.

Also, many public transportation services had to be temporarily discontinued due to COVID-19 to prevent the spread of the virus. That made affordable transportation less accessible for poor people and thus made having a used entry-level car more of a necessity than a luxury. Lastly, while you do not strictly need a refrigerator to live and breathe, in modern America and other developed nations in the modern world, it is very difficult to secure food without spoiling if you do not have a fridge. What constitutes a want and a need can vary on the location and time period and things that were once considered luxuries like healthcare, education, a car, a fridge, internet access, etc. are now being considered necessities due to changes in the economy.

Now onto my next point, Riley said in her original video that ""the government should not be morally dictating the lives of welfare recipients by drug testing welfare recipients and restricting what can be bought with SNAP, WIC, and TANF benefits. I disagree with Riley on this one as the government has a moral duty to ensure that taxpayer money is not being squandered by welfare recipients. If a welfare recipient wants to spend their limited income (with their own earned money) on lobster, steak, or hot food, then that is their prerogative. However, SNAP benefits are funded by the taxpayer and should not be fungible like regular money."
1,2023-12-06,"CMV: People who treat stuff like loli hentai anywhere even close to actual real CP and other forms of exploitation, don't think those things are wrong for the right reasons in the first place",u/CABRALFAN27,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18c6jkx/cmv_people_who_treat_stuff_like_loli_hentai/,changemyview,"So, as someone in the Anime community, I pretty often run into arguments about lolis - To the uninitiated, a ""loli"" is an Anime character who, regardless of their canonical age, has the physical appearance of a little girl (""Shota"" being the boy version) - and specifically the sexualization of them. It's true that it's relatively common for loli (And, to a lesser extent, shota) characters to be sexualized, and even hentai (Drawn porn) of them isn't uncommon.

A lot of people (Both haters and those who are otherwise fans of Anime) deride those who make and enjoy stuff like that as pedophiles, and it's pretty clear from the disgust and vitriol involved that they don't just mean that in the academic sense (That is, people who are attracted to prepubescent bodies/behavior, which might be true), they're legitimately viewing the people in question in the same light as they'd view actual child molesters. That always strikes me as ridiculous, since the fact that it's a fictional character being sexualized instead of a real child prevents the two from being anywhere even close to the same moral *league*.

My logic is pretty simple; The reason stuff like CP and other forms of exploitation/sexualization of minors is wrong is because the child in question is too young to consent to that sort of thing, and is therefore being harmed. Therefore, if there's no real child involved, then, all else equal, there's nothing wrong with it. Even if loli hentai would be CP if the character in question was real, the fact that they're not real makes all the moral difference.

Now, that part isn't the view I want changed/challenged; It's not one I'm uncertain about in the slightest, and I can't really imagine an argument that *could* change it. No, the view I want challenged relates to the people who don't follow the above logic, who *do* morally condemn loli hentai on the same level of CP.

To my mind, the only reason one would do that is if they think my logic doesn't cover the reason, or at the very least, not the *only* reason, CP is actually wrong. The only other reason I can think of to condemn CP that would also apply to loli hentai is that, rather than thinking about the victim, or lack thereof, the person's main concern is that they're grossed out  by the idea of being attracted to prepubescent bodies/behaviors in the first place.

Of course, needless to say, there's nothing wrong with being disgusted by that concept, but that disgust is not, in and of itself, valid grounds for moral condemnation. On top of that, if it's the only, or even just the primary, grounds on which you're condemning CP and other forms of real child exploitation, then I don't think you're giving nearly enough weight to the actual victims themselves.

To explain my logic as to why I don't think personal disgust at a concept is enough to condemn it, I'll use the example of something else in the hentai... Community, for lack of a better word, that I myself personally find disgusting; Vore. Again to the uninitiated, vore is a fetish revolving around the idea of being swallowed whole and digested, with some people liking the idea of being swallowed, and others liking the idea of doing the swallowing. When I first heard about the concept of vore, it turned my stomach, no pun intended, and although it doesn't quite squick me out as much as it once did, it's still not anywhere close to my cup of tea. Still, though, not once did I ever morally condemn those who like vore, and certainly never on the same level as those who partake in actual real cannibalism IRL. 

The logic is exactly the same as with loli stuff; It's so victimless, it's not even a crime in my eyes. In essence, no harm, no foul, and if anything, equating it to situations where harm *is* actually being done is extremely disrespectful to the victims thereof. The only reason I can see to equate real crimes to fictional fantasies about the same subject is if you're operating primarily based on how much the subject in question triggers your squick factor, and that's not a good basis for your morality.

So, that's my argument, in essence. There are definitely parts of it that I'm open to changing, and there are a few different avenues of attack you might use that I see potential in, but it's my understanding that trying to railroad counterarguments like that is considered bad form on this Subreddit, so I'll leave that up to all of you. 

One last thing I will say, though, is that, if you're looking to engage in good faith, insinuating that the people you're arguing against are pedophiles, let alone actual sex offenders, or otherwise defending them, is a good way to shut down all constructive discourse and end the conversation in a hurry. We all agree that the exploitation of real children is wrong, let's go from there."

According to an article, ""At least 453,000 workers have participated in 312 strikes in the U.S. this year"" ([source](https://apnews.com/article/labor-strikes-us-uaw-kaiser-hollywood-9c3d6d63c70078f1dd769ccadc81a06b))

 Many are in high-impact and highly prevalent fields that provide a lot of benefit to society, and we really should advocate and elevate these people up. I'm talking about teachers, nurses, social workers, the public sector, etc. with a big emphasis on teachers. Strikes in this area made (in comparison to Hollywood) little to no noise this year, but were pretty major, including ""75,000 Kaiser Permanente workers walking off the job"" at one point in the healthcare sector. 

There's other roles that are high impact and highly prevalent, but typically without a high level of  societal benefit. Think like fast food workers (Starbucks, etc), retail, etc. Strikes in this area made some noise, especially with Starbucks - but it's not uncommon to see people a little less supportive of these workers. ""You're just a barista"" etc.

&#x200B;

Then there's roles that are fairly niche, lower impact, and without societal benefit. Yet, for some reason, this one was the biggest strike of the year, with the most vocal support, resounding across the internet - especially Reddit.

**The Hollywood Strike.**

The poor movie script writers choosing to pursue a career in the creatives, living in the HCOL modern cities of Los Angeles and New York... somehow garnered more support than works in objectively worse situations financially, occupationally, and personally. I feel like I am missing a piece to understand WHY the internet cares so. damn. much. about HOLLYWOOD strikers?

I would argue that that is not actually going to happen. There would be *some* increase in scoring, yes, but it wouldn't be the drastic explosion that offsides-rule-supporters say it would.

The main reason is that defensive strategies would change to accommodate the rule change. With offside being taken out of the equation, the offense can pass more deeply and aggressively, yes, but the defense would most likely cope by using sweepers more, and positioning their last line(s) of defense more in the rear than they do today. Goalkeepers might become more Neuer-like and play sweeper-keeper more often. The defense would also practice man-marking more. In fact, it would probably become common practice for the defense to have a sweeper in the rear at all times whose job would be specifically to cut off long-range pass attacks.

Most people who claim that getting rid of offside would lead to an enormous increase in scoring are assuming that offensive strategy will change but somehow defensive strategy would not. That would not be the case. With any rule change, *both* offense and defense will significantly change the way they do things.

403,2023-12-06,CMV: Dating is objectively harder for men than it is women and women’s refusal to concede this one point is annoying,u/wettigingss,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18cacyg/cmv_dating_is_objectively_harder_for_men_than_it/,changemyview,"I’m not one of those guys that thinks women live life on easy mode. Of course they don’t and I would say on a macro level, men are more privileged than woman. However I think one of the few things women have over men is the ability to get dates, find a relationship and have sex and any combination of the three.

So I will start by pointing out when you’re talking about struggling with dating, for women it’s struggling to find mister right. Even the average looking woman gets male attention and typically it’s just not from the men they want. When they go on dating apps, it’s more of that with a twist. They see “Mr. Right” who’s typically the hottest looking guy on the app and there’s no guarantee if she’ll match, but there is a guarantee that she will have to swipe through a bunch of perfectly normal guys who just aren’t the hottest man on the app.

For men, it’s a desert. No attention, no likes, no anything unless you are exceptionally good looking. The funny thing is, for anything else that is a social gathering this same logic applies just at a smaller pool. Bars, clubs, parties, etc. if you are not one of the more physically attractive men, it’s not going to happen anywhere as easily as it would for the average woman.

Men are also the ones risking rejection. Many women like to say they face rejection too, but it’s not really much compared to what the average man does. In my experiences in trying to get a number, just a number, it took 40 no’s before 1 yes. You could not sit here and tell me that the average woman would have that same record or even close to it.

When it comes to sex, I’m not even going to get too into the weeds. A 5/10 woman can hookup with a 7/10 guy any times she wants. A 5/10 guy is going to have to fight to hook up with another 5/10 woman. Women sleep up but date across, men sleep down but date across.

Lastly I want to talk about the main rebuttal I hear, “it’s dangerous to date as a woman, they could be raped or killed” and while I understand women’s fears here and they are valid, that’s not a dating issue. It’s a woman issue.

A woman is more likely to be raped by a friend or by a family member than someone she’s going on a first date with. That fear women have is more about existence as a woman than it is about dating.

A parallel would be like me saying “well it’s harder to date for men because I’m more likely to be a victim of any violent crime ranging from assault to murder with the only exception being rape. So it’s harder for me to date because stepping outside is more risky.”

Either both of these statements are true, or they’re not since they’re not a result of dating."

In almost all developed nations, fertility has fallen below replacement levels. This is a significant threat to future generations well-being, the stability of society, and individual happiness.

The problem is not that young people don’t want kids. In fact, [polls](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2023-01-17/young-americans-still-want-same-number-of-kids-just-not-right-now) suggest that young Americans want between 2-3 kids, the same as their parents did.

I would like to highlight two obstacles that prevent families from having kids even when they want to.

1) The first is financial. Kids are expensive, and it takes a much longer time for adults to become financially stable compared to previous generations. 

2) The second is biological. A woman’s peak reproductive years are before the age of 30. After the age of 35, fertility rates drop precipitously. 

The peak reproductive years highly overlap with the most important years of career advancement. Depressingly, women are often forced to choose between pursuing financial stability through education and career, or starting a family.

Families could pursue IVF treatment later in life, but this treatment costs between $10K-$30K for one round of treatment in Texas. These treatments are often not covered by insurance policies.

I say, why can’t people have both financial stability and children? One solution is to expand healthcare policy so that public insurance will pay for the fertility treatment of all women.

This policy will give families more time to become stable, and also free families from the financial burdens that are involved with IVF treatment, so they can spend that money on actually raising their kids haha.

Israel has a similar law in place where infertile women - married or single, regardless of sexual orientation, up to the age of 45 - can have fully paid fertility treatment for their first two kids. 

Israel has the highest fertility rate in the developmental world while also hosting some of the most educated and career-oriented women in the west. They do this despite living in one of the most expensive places on the planet.

Israel’s high fertility rate cannot be explained by religious customs because even secular Israeli Jews have higher fertility rates than the rest of the west.

This high fertility rate also cannot be explained by cultural norms. Because Israel’s fertility rates are higher than Jewish fertility rates in other western nations, much of which have better daycare, parental leave, and other family-oriented policies.

I have been thinking about this issue because I am a PhD student who came from a large family of 10 siblings. My fiancé is also a medical resident from a large family. We would like to have kids of our own, but we would be in our mid 30s before we finish our training, get into our careers, and be more stable before we begin trying for kids. I am surrounded by like-minded, smart, successful colleagues who are facing similar difficulties as well.

What do you guys think of this idea? I am open to understanding different perspectives and revising my ideas."
1,2023-12-06,CMV: It is safer for an individual to drive slightly faster than the traffic around them compared to the same speed or adhering strictly to the posted speed limit.,u/Kinder22,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18cbcdt/cmv_it_is_safer_for_an_individual_to_drive/,changemyview,"I once saw a graph which I have been able to locate again for years. I regret that I can't cite it here, but it has in part colored my view. I do believe there are negative consequences if my view is wrong, so I am very open to being corrected. That said, I've thought about it a lot, so this may not be an easy CMV.

Since I can't cite the graph, I will describe it by memory. It was a comparison of incident rate as a function of the speed differential between the two vehicles. The graph was U shaped, but surprisingly, the trough of the U did not center on 0 speed differential. You'd think it would be difficult to have an incident when you are going the same speed as another vehicle, but in fact the lowest incident rate was something like +5 mph. My assumption is that when 2 vehicles are going the same speed next to each other, there's an increased risk of one merging into the other.

\[*Adding: after I typed this post, I was able to find similar but not exact graph to what I remember. See* [this document](https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1529&context=all_theses)*, pages 12 and 14. I have not read the paper.\]*

My takeaway from this was that, on an individual level (obviously this wouldn't work if you convinced everyone to do it), it is safer to drive marginally faster than most of the people around you. From memory, on the graph, anywhere between 0 and +10 MPH had a lower incident rate than 0 MPH.

My rationale deals with where your attention is focused when you are driving - on the road and obstacles in front of you. Yes, a good driver will routinely check mirrors, but even then, they aren't (and shouldn't be) spending nearly as much time looking behind as looking ahead. Further, mirrors are an imperfect view of what's behind, both because of the limited field of view and the possible distortion.

By driving faster than most people around you, you encounter more vehicles from the front than you do from the rear. Now I'm not talking about driving faster than *everybody*, or driving excessively fast, just driving a speed such that you seem to be gaining on people more often than being passed by people.

This should not change the way that you check your mirrors. I'm excluding the possibility of this influencing a driver to change their driving habits for the worse, focusing more on the front than they normally do.

I'm also not talking about weaving in and out of traffic or tailgating. These are dangerous practices that obviously increase your chance of incident. I'm a staunch believer in passing on the left, and only going around on the right when there is plenty of opportunity.

I'm assuming good road conditions. Slick or icy roads obviously call for slower absolute speed, as does heavy traffic.

If road conditions are favorable, such that you can easily position yourself away from all traffic, then that is preferable and you might as well maintain the speed limit if that allows you to maintain a bubble for yourself away from other traffic.

To summarize, my view is that it is safest for me to drive at a speed where I am passing the majority of the traffic at a moderate rate, roughly +5-10 MPH, so that most traffic I encounter is in front of me where my attention is focused."

Despite upper Egypt stretching down into Sudan, I am sure they had some black populations like the Kushites but they were never by any means a majority.

That leaves the old kingdom remaining. Of which I am much more open to hearing about."

* You mocked them for being angry.

My view is that if you mock or insult an angry person and they attack you, you are partially responsible for being attacked. However, the attacker still gets most of the blame because it was their responsibility to get away from you if you tried to mock or insult them.

1,2023-12-06,"CMV: The Dynamics of Social Perception Sex Disparities After Puberty""",u/bigfailtosociety,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18cds0j/cmv_the_dynamics_of_social_perception_sex/,changemyview,"From the transition of sea creatures to land animals to the human experience of puberty, evolutionary processes often involve adaptation to attract suitable mates. As secondary sexual characteristics emerge during puberty, communication dynamics undergo a transformative shift. Individuals who may have engaged in light-hearted behavior before may now be observed meticulously adjusting their walk, talk, and actions, all in an effort to avoid leaving a negative impression on their crush.  
  
It is essential to recognize that, while both genders work hard to maintain social status and cultivate healthy connections, a notable difference exists in the natural inclination to impress the opposite sex. Regardless of physical appearance, there is a higher likelihood that someone will find a girl attractive. A girl may choose to be alone by preference, whereas a boy of the same age might struggle to find companionship in a class of 45 students.  
  
Illustrating this point, a recent incident shared by a friend, who serves as an assistant teacher in a college, highlighted the contrasting experiences of students in the same class. He encountered a group discussing a girl who, being introverted, was feeling depressed due to receiving lower marks in a subject. The students were perplexed about approaching her, given her introverted nature. After managing to connect with her, they discovered the underlying issues, and she eventually found solace in sharing her feelings.  
  
In another instance during a Viva session, the teacher learned that a male student with the lowest marks had recently lost his mother. Despite facing this tragedy and taking an exam during the funeral, the student remained optimistic about the future. When my friend asked if the class knew about this, he revealed that no one talked to him, and he felt all alone. He also gave a presentation alone in a different subject because no one wanted to make a project with him as a partner. It's not like he is weird or anything; he is just normal. There isn't any single issue under which they can mask their isolation for him, like racism, language barriers, height differences, or different societal statuses. This stark difference in societal responses to the two students, both facing challenges, is emblematic of the distinct expectations placed on individuals based on their gender.  
  
In conclusion, societal attitudes often differ significantly based on gender, with boys facing challenges being perceived as normal, while there is a collective effort to support and uplift girls experiencing difficulties. It is crucial to recognize and challenge these ingrained stereotypes to foster a more equitable and understanding society."
18,2023-12-06,CMV: Poe's Law is less of a law than a guideline. It is easy to make a parody of an extreme view that will not be mistaken for the real thing,u/notsuspendedlxqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ce21q/cmv_poes_law_is_less_of_a_law_than_a_guideline_it/,changemyview,"According to TVtropes, [the core idea of Poe's Law](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw) is that a parody of something extreme can be mistaken for the real thing, and if a real thing sounds extreme enough, it can be mistaken for a parody (all because parodies are intrinsically extreme, in case you haven't noticed it). 

Some people take Poe's Law as fact. While it can't be denied that there are some people who take some works of parody to be sincere expression of belief, in my opinion this rarely happens. The vast majority of the human population do indeed possess the ability to differentiate satire from sincerity. It's far more common for regular people to act as if most folks lack this ability, so they can boost their own self-esteem. Average media literacy might not be great, but it doesn't take a literature professor to recognize that a parody is indeed a parody.

While Poe's Law does apply in certain situations, I believe that numerous works of parody will never be mistaken for sincere expression, by any member of the audience. 

A couple of caveats to my view: first, I don't consider criticizing or critiquing a work of parody to be an example of Poe's Law in action. Parody, like all other media, is not above criticism. If the audience disagrees with the parody, but nonetheless understands the author's intentions, that is not Poe's Law. Even if the audience fundamentally misses the point of the parody, the fact that they realize it's a parody means Poe's Law doesn't apply. If the intentions of the author are unclear or complicated, then I do not consider that to be an example of Poe's Law. "

From the 300km range of my older model s, I'm lucky to get more than 150km of actual driving. Most renters aren't in a position to charge at home, so we're dependant on external charging, and have to plan around that, making the gap between rated ranges and real ranges an enormous problem, leading a large potential for being stranded.

I get that big range numbers look good, but when those numbers aren't reachable without being towed, it leaves a lot of people looking to go back to ICE, as well as paining everybody around them from even considering electric.

So the testing should be done so that if driven carefully, a car can hit the range on long trips, even in winter. Even on mountain roads  (assuming the start and end elevations are similar)

Real range, guaranteed.

Nobody is buying the lightning because how much the range is impacted by towing. Sure that's true for diesels, but you can fill your box with jerry cans or a tidy tank, and then fill up in 2 minutes tops.

1,2023-12-06,Cmv: Biden doesn’t deserve the left’s vote,u/epstein_funko_pop,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18cfj7d/cmv_biden_doesnt_deserve_the_lefts_vote/,changemyview,"Full disclosure: I am a communist. Marxist Leninist pinko tankie scum. Anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist, etc. 

Ever since Israel’s response to the October 7th attack by Hamas, which has resulted in thousands of Palestinians killed, most of whom are civilians and children, there has been a specter haunting the liberals of the United States. The specter of anti-Bidenism. The countrywide solidarity marches for Palestine have shown that for many people, accepting the status quo of unending financial and military support of the apartheid ethnostate of Israel is no longer acceptable. Many leftists, Muslims, and even liberals feel this way. Many people have drawn a red line at supporting a candidate who willingly facilitates a genocide (or at the very least ethnic cleansing, I’m not here for a semantics argument over the extent of Israel’s atrocities), and the response from the “vote blue no matter who” crowd has been one of panic and increasingly desperate justifications.

Ive seen people saying that in a race between Hitler and 99% Hitler, I’m morally obliged to vote for 99% Hitler. That in a race between Mussolini and Hitler, they would be seriously concerned if I did not vote for Mussolini. That maybe Biden is supporting a genocide, but Trump would support a genocide even harder. When I respond to these (admittedly well thought out and compelling) arguments that I am not swayed, and that my vote is conditional upon an US-enforced ceasefire in Gaza, the vitriol in return is spastic and predictable. I am told that Biden has to support Israel, because he needs to appeal to the centrists. Biden has to be moderate, because he needs to appeal to the centrists. They never inverse their own argument and say that Biden has to be left-wing to appeal to the left wingers. This issue is a microcosm of a more general argument around Biden and the democratic party.

Why should I unconditionally give my vote to a candidate and party that continually makes concessions to the right wing? My firm stance is predicated on the following reasons:

1) Israel is a client state of the United States, and without US support, could not sustain themselves. Biden could negotiate a lasting peace today by threatening to pull support. This would be unheard of/political suicide/abandoning our ally? Don’t give a shit, it’s true.

2) Israel exists primarily as an intelligence outpost for the Western powers. Biden himself said “if Israel didnt exist, we would have to create an Israel to secure our interests in the region”. This realpolitik garbage does not compel me. 

3) Genocide and ethnic cleansing are bad. There are Palestinians alive today who were pushed out of their homes during the Nakba and became permanent refugees. West bank settlers routinely displace and murder Palestinians in the west bank to this day.

4) Orange man bad - The idea of a Trump victory does not scare me enough to compel me to support genocide. Oh, Trump will be worse on this issue you say? How? He will… continue to completely, unconditionally support Israel, just like Biden? Wow, that sure is scary.

Project 2025 you say? Yeah that shit seems pretty terrible. Explain how voting in Joe Biden will prevent the next Republican president (the pendulum always swings) from enacting those same policies. It will just be Project 2029.

I am fully convinced that policy wise, Trump is a fairly typical conservative president, and what offended liberals most about him was his debasement of a revered office, his lack of decorum. Speaking of policy, Biden is closer to Trump than many democrats will admit. He’s building the wall guys. He’s a neoliberal war hawk, and his economic policies are milquetoast and insufficient to protect the US working class from the crumbling of an empire and economic system that is long past it’s dominance, it’s day in the sun. Fascism is on the rise BECAUSE of deteriorating economic conditions, not because half the county is brainwashed by some mastermind ex-reality star. At the end of the day it will be socialism or barbarism, and the democrats would rather let us limp arthritically into the latter than give up capitalism.

Ultimately, if liberals believe that electing Biden is so important, but that he shouldnt be forced to make any real leftward concessions, they should spend their time appealing to independent centrists and never Trump republicans, because im sick of hearing about it."

Unlike media, news, youtube and tiktok videos, and people in general says, hard work, studying, trying to improve yourself will not make you a succesful and/or rich, it is luck what determines if you are or not those things.  


We dont decide where we are born, our appearance, our gender, our talents (which are also luck), our parents, our personality, and plenty of other stuffs. If you are born in a 3rd world country you are far behind people that are born in rich countries, do you really think that a kid born in Nigeria has the sames opportunities as a kid born in Switzerland? No, right? Same goes for someone who is beautiful against an ugly one, a talented versus a non-talented, etc.  


NOW, lets take some examples of succesful and rich people and see if it was luck or hard-work:  


Gisele Bundchen, the most succesful model in the world: she was born in countryside of the south Brazil, a model scout found her and hired her in a model agency and suddenly her life changed, was it hard work? Did she study and worked really hard to be a model and be beautiful? No, she just had luck to be born beautiful and had someone recognize her.  


Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Lewis Hamilton and any famous person in sports: It is talent, which also is luck that led those being what they are now, you can pick 10000 kids and try to replicate them, none will be the same, it was a series of factors that led them being the best in what they are now, having luck to have talent and someone to recognize.  


Elon Musk, the richest man in  earth: ok, sure he was born in a poor country (South Africa) but his parents had an emerald mine and were millionaire, so even if he was born in a poor country he had opportunities to study and work abroad, if he was an average south african, do you guys think that he could be the Elon Musk we know today? Do you think he planned each step to be a billionaire and having giant companies? He had luck, same as any billionaire today, none of them knew that they would be as rich as they are know, pick Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, etc, all of them made something and boom, billionaire.  


Musicians in general: luck and talent, same and everyone above, having a good voice is not their merit, there 192012192109201920192 people that sings and play instruments but just 0,00001% become succesful, not because of hard work but luck.  


Lastly, i saw a video in my feed of instagram a guy interviewing people with nice cars in USA, asking how could someone have a car like theirs, and their answer was the most cliche thing: ""work hard"", ""study and you will have one"", really? Just that? Say that to a poor guy in India, Nigeria, Brazil, Bangladesh, and see if that will work.  


So, to not extend myself this is my opinion, i've never seen someone having this opinion so i decided to open your guys minds, sure, you are free to argue and prove me that i'm wrong, but please come with arguments but not swearing and ad-hominen, thanks.

1,2023-12-06,CMV: Large numbers don't exist,u/Numerend,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ch9ub/cmv_large_numbers_dont_exist/,changemyview,"In short: I think that because beyond a certain point numbers become inconceivably large, they can be said not to exist.

The natural numbers are generally associated with counting physical objects. There's a clear meaning of 1 pencil or 2 pencils. I think I can probably distinguish between groups of up to around 9 pencils at a glance, but beyond that I'd have to count them. So I'm definitely willing to accept that the natural numbers up to 9 exist.

I can count higher than 9 though. If I spent every day of my life counting the seconds as they go by I could probably get up to around 10^(9) or so. Going beyond that, simply by counting things I accept that it is possible to reach a very large number. But given that there's only a finite amount of time in which humanity will exist (probably), I don't think we're ever going to count up through all natural numbers. So if we're never going to explicitly deal with those values, how can they be said to be ""real"" in the same way as say, the number 5?

The classical argument I am familiar with uses the principle of induction: for every whole number *n*, it's successor *n+1* can be demonstrated. Then that successor can be used to find another number and so on. To me this seems to assume that all numbers have a successor simply because every one we've checked so far has one. A more sophisticated approach might say that the natural numbers satisfy this principle of induction by definition (say the Peano axioms), and we can construct our class of numbers using induction.

Aha! you might say. 

But again, I'm not convinced, because why should we be able to apply this successor arbitrarily many times? We can't explicitly construct such large numbers through induction alone. I can't find a definition that doesn't seem to already really on the fact that whole numbers of great size exist.

Finally, I have to recognise the elephant in the room: ridiculously large numbers can be constructed using simple formulas or algorithms. Tree(3) or Grahams number are both ridiculously large, well beyond my comprehension. I would take the view that these can be treated as formalisms. We're never going to be able to calculate their exact value, so I don't know whether it is accurate to say they even have one.

&#x200B;

I suppose I should explain what I mean by saying they don't exist: there isn't a clean cut way to demonstrate their existence, other than showing that, hypothetically, you could reach them if you counted a lot. All the arguments I've heard seem to ultimately boil down to this same idea.

So, in summary: I don't understand them. I think that numbers of sufficiently large scale simply aren't on a scale that we can conceive of, so why should I believe they exist?

I would also be convinced if someone could provide an argument for why I should completely accept the principle of induction.

PS: I would really like to hear arguments for the existence of such arbitrarily large numbers that don't involve even potential infinity."

i understand that more diverse opinions lead to better care, and i agree! but if you are not picked when providing care, go for jobs that are in the field but are not care providing. 

look into the history of gynaecology. look into todays rates of violence. women have a right to w choose whatever sex of provider they want, and right now, that’s mostly women, so there are mostly female gynos. end of story. the rest just seems like entitled whining to me. it’s so weird to want to be in a situation so badly where you are not wanted. your disappointment is immeasurably less important than someone’s mental safety. 

tldr: male gynos disappearing makes sense and i don’t know why it’s a bad thing

I acknowledge the potential for their joy and happiness but I believe that these ultimately neutralize each other. However, choosing not to have a child eliminates the prospect of their happiness and suffering entirely. This sounds a lot better, I feel like loving something truly is to really think about them, even letting go of something you never had in the first place.

Perhaps my view is like this because I’m suicidal and the thought that my mom gave birth to me and I’ve turned out to be like this has to do with it. I don’t want kids, even if they have a good life, if I have them, I’m giving them a chance for it to go a bad way. Everyone should no longer have children, the human race slowly dies out, with no violence needed. I know animals suffer as well, maybe we can help them too."

1,2023-12-06,CMV: automotive controls are primitive and ill-concieved,u/SeriousSatisfaction8,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18cjiz6/cmv_automotive_controls_are_primitive_and/,changemyview,"The automobile started based on the idea of a bicycle, where you controlled the brake and acceleration with your feet only, and hand used for steering.  In the more than a century since then, cars have evolved a lot, but the hands are still used primarily for steering, while the feet / one foot is used for forward motion control. 

There was a time, with vintage cars where both feet were required, the left for gear change, the right for brake and acceleration, but modern cars ditched the left pedal in favour of finger paddles, or automated gears. Today most drivers' left foot hangs limp while the right does all the work, and your hands are free most of the time, except whilst turning corners or parking (some new cars even park for you).  By contrast, modern jetliners are far more complex to pilot but don't use pedals for most operations, only for yaw (left and right banking).

It would be good for car manufacturers to switch foot control completely to hand pedals, and do away with pedals -- in EVs for example, there are no gears and controls are all electronic, so there's no reason for a physical pedal.  Braking and acceleration require fine motor skills that your ankle movement does not naturally possess, but your fingers are very able to accomplish with ease. Why don't new cars switch over now that technology has offered the chance to improve ergonomics and safety?

As Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David said, it was a show about nothing, which meant no fulfilling story arcs or character development. And they only got a one-year sentence, which is quite fitting for them, except maybe George, who is responsible for the death of his fiancé and felt no remorse at all. George even asks in the first half of the finale ""Why would we want to help somebody?"" which Elaine concurs with, which says a lot about them. I know they were the main characters and their fans loved them, but that doesn't mean they deserved a happy ending, when almost every episode of the show ended less than happy notes for the four characters, which could provide an argument that the finale was completely following the tone the show set. Fans will also point out how they thought the finale may have been poorly-written and inaccurate to the real-life court of law, but that is far from the only instance where the writing of Seinfeld wasn't accurate to real-life. Fans are still salty on how the show ended, but I don't see how the four characters deserved a better ending than what they got."

1,2023-12-06,CMV: Humans are a horrible,u/TheKillerJoke12,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18cl6vx/cmv_humans_are_a_horrible/,changemyview,"Point 1: Humans are horrible to each other.  
  
Humans do many horrible things to each other from murder, abuse, torture, etc. All a Human needs is a slight difference in appearance, view, gender, etc for them to justify any harmful action they commit. Even Humans who think of themselves above this, still treat others differently based on outward appearance.  
  
If Humans are this bad to themselves, how do you think they treat other species of Earth?  
  
Speaking of other species, Humans seem very quick to monsterize other species for little things. Spiders are creepy and thus should be burned. Wolves eat livestock so they should be hunted down. That one movie has a scary shark so they all should die. Humans will literally cause the extinction of whole species because they inconvenience them.  
  
Point 2: Weakest and Strongest links  
  
The Weakest links of humanity can do very questionable actions due to their circumstances. A married partner cheats due to feeling neglected. A parent threatens the other so they don't lose custody of their child. An addict stealing from others to get another fix, or even a kid killing their abusive parent.  
  
All these examples share one common thing. Humans's bad actions cause other Humans to do bad things.  
  
Now look at the strongest links, the Humans with the power to improve the lives of their fellow man. The judge is found to be accepting bribes, racist police shoot someone down, an influencer scams millions from fans and gets away, and politicians promote harmful new laws.  
  
I think looking the the weakest and strongest links of Humanity shows a lot about Humans in general.  
  
Point 3: But Not All People!  
  
When I debate with my pals about this they argue that not all people of said groups are like that, and I agree. However, when you look at good examples of said groups I find things like this. The judge shuts down a nonsense trial, police stop a murderer, an influencer exposes a scam, politician blocks a harmful bill. 

Good Humans stop the actions of bad Humans. The problem is that good examples are rare and most of the things I find or experience are Humans making other Humans' lives worse to better their own. And isn't generalizing a group by the actions of the few something Humans do all the time?  
  
A woman was assaulted by a man so beware of all men. A man had everything taken from him due to a false rape accusation, so don't trust any women. A small portion of a group did something bad so they all must be bad. Hell! Humans don't even need to experience something bad happen to them to condemn a whole group! Humans have killed and tortured sharks because of a movie that wasn't even accurate!  
  
Speaking of animals, Humans seem very quick to monsterize other species for little things. Spiders are creepy and thus should be burned. Wolves hunt livestock so they should be hunted down. That one movie has a scary shark so they all should die. Humans will literally cause the extinction of whole species because they inconvenience them.  
  
Humans seem fine using this line of thinking, all until it's their group that is being judged.  
  
Point 4: What about the good?  
  
Yes, the good Humans do, the good they only do for themselves or to make up for their past horrible actions.  
  
Humans are replanting trees! After Humans have cut down countless forests resulting in major environmental damage.  
  
Humans are saving the sharks! After Humans killed countless of them for their fins.  
  
Humans are researching ways to help fight climate change! After Humans fucked up the world's climate, after denying it happened for years, and only doing it to save themselves.  
  
Humans responsible for a major scam are caught! After scamming millions of others Humans who are most likely not getting their money back.  
  
I'm not saying that these actions shouldn't be praised. But it doesn't change the fact that Humans as a whole do horrible things and only try to fix it afterwards.  
  
Point 5: Aren't you just being pessimistic?  
  
Maybe, but is it really being pessimistic if Earth is quickly turning into a shit show because of Humans? The thing is Humans are social animals meaning they tend to follow the crowd no matter how horrible the actions they do. It only takes a single bad Human to gather others to do horrible and selfish things. And doesn't it say a lot about Humans that it's the worst of them that tend to become leaders? Leaders who tend to gather support that would defend them no matter what horrible action they do?  
  
Is it being pessimistic when even the actions of the average Human make the world a worse place?  
  
Point 6: What do you mean about the last part?  
  
The average Human does things that they think aren't causing harm but due to the sheer amount of Humans doing it results in major long-lasting damage.  
  
How would one vote change the result? New Leader bans life-saving operation.  
  
I don't produce that much waste. Humans produce enough garbage to cover states several times over, toxic materials get into the environment, and more garbage is being thrown away than Humans can clean up.  
  
How much harm can some online trolling do? Breaking news: Teen commits suicide due to harmful online bullying.  
  
TLDR: The future of Earth looks bleak and the reason is very clear.  
Humans are a horrible species."

I started using Apps and they're extremely hateful towards men and present them as inferior for whatever reason. 

Specifically, I see many conversation around dating divulge into ""well men rape/assault women"" as a catchall for any complaints or comments men have in regards to the dating market or traditions even when it's irrelevant.  I get it this is a problem. But too often I see people pulling this card in the most illogical and demeaning ways not because they actually care about addressing the problem but more as a 'gotcha'. 

There's a difference between being cautious and treating every man as if he's some kind of predator. The latter is misandrist and I think it needs to be better addressed and condemned. Hate breeds hate and it's crazy to think that it would ever be possible to stop misogyny while accepting misandry.

Most of the other overhyped technologies follow the same pattern.

The recent hype has been by and large due to ease of access and the network effect, which leads the layman to assume advancement has been made in the space over the span of months and not years. This hype and lack of understanding gives the false impression of rapid progress, not profound advancements happening in the space within the past year or two. Not that those aren’t happening, they’re just not the focus of the hype and are actually kinda of having attention being taken away from them."

Hollywood could make woke movies that are actually good.  Instead, they give us remakes of beloved classic films but make changes to bring them in line with current social sensibilities.  The reason this happens is because nostalgia is always a commercial success, and thanks to acquisitions and mergers, we have too few studios competing.  Without as much competititon, studios tend to go with what works and that's nostalgia.  Low competititon encourages laziness and a sequel or remake is the easiest way to make the most about of cash with the least effort.  That's why sequels and remakes dominate the movie theater right now.  If Hollywood would get back to telling new stories instead of trying to milk everyone's childhood dry, a lot of the complaints people have would go away.  That's not going to happen though until people just stop going to see these movies.  The big studios don't care if the films they are producing are actually good.  They care about the money."

My logic is that what goes up must come down, and that I should ""quit while I'm ahead"". I love living, and for that very reason, I want to end things on a high note. I don't see the logic in letting life take me when there are so many chances of me going out in extreme physical or emotional pain. 

I have seen multiple therapists, and am currently paired with a fantastic psychologist. I have recovered from depression, and am on an antidepressant that works for me. I've just been accepted into my dream college and was given very generous merit aid. I've had a lot of success career-wise as well. Literally everything is going right in my life. I'm doing more than fine, and I love being alive, but that is the point at which my thinking seems to just fall apart. 

I like my current position in life. I'm generally accepting of change, and yet for some reason I don't want to go to college, I don't want to have a job, I don't want to move out, and I sure as hell don't want to go into debt. I don't want to do anything. Don't get me wrong, I love doing things, but I never truly *want* to do them. 

While I do feel guilt about the impact my death may have on my loved ones, I'd be dead, so I wouldn't be able to care anyways. I'd miss out on a lot sure, but again. Dead. What would I care? The method I want to use is almost instant and wouldn't even be painful, so I have no period of regret or pain to fear. 

I know I'm missing something here. I know my logic is flawed, because everyone says that suicide is never the answer, and survivors always say they regret their attempts, so there must be *something* wrong with my train of thought. 

TLDR: I love being alive, and for that very reason, I want to ""quit while I'm ahead"". I know this is flawed logic. I don't know where the flaw/s are. Again, I apologize if this is not the correct sub to ask this in, so please redirect me to a different sub if necessary."

153,2023-12-07,CMV: People taking offense at comedy is based on the assumption of malice more than the joke itself.,u/European_Goldfinch_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ctj0e/cmv_people_taking_offense_at_comedy_is_based_on/,changemyview,"There are numerous forms of comedy  and some comedians choose to tell what would be described as 'riskier' jokes. A lot of the most famous comedians that have ever lived fall into this category, the very essence of their comedy is taking something dark and somehow making light of it, the better executed the joke is, the more intelligent and thought out. For example, I'm brown, I've had and still do suffer from eating disorders, I'm bisexual, amongst other things that are fair game for comedy. Hearing a brilliant joke about an eating disorder is not offensive to me but extremely freeing, it's like taking a day off, it is my opinion that dark comedy is wonderful because of this.I'm not saying my way is the right way but I struggle to understand people who cannot laugh at themselves.

Take jokes with a racial angle for instance, you tend to find that if someone telling a joke actually is racist and has the intention of malice, the less effective and intelligent the joke is, it feels lazy because it lacks a wider perspective, than if you can tell a great joke despite not sharing the sentiment. Bullies tell jokes at your expense where the desired outcome is someone feeling negative about themselves or upset, a comedians desired outcome is shared laughter.

Of course there are instances where comedians have genuine prejudice, take Bernard Manning for instance, a lot of his jokes were racist and he later admitted in a documentary that he is racist saying that quote ""he does not like \`Asians, blacks, Chinks and Australians."" By comparison if you listen to Mannings comedy to say Chapelle's his jokes are more in line with a bullies as afore mentioned, the desired outcome is still shared laughter but with an underlying agenda where it's at the expense of others. To be honest I can't appropriately articulate and pinpoint specific indicators that make it more apparent to the audience that a comedian means the harmful things they say but they are there.

Taken from his Wiki page: The writer and performer Barry Cryer said when Manning died: ""The thing about Bernard was that he looked funny, he sounded funny and he had excellent timing. It was just what he actually said that could be worrying.

Admittedly it's complex but outrage in response to a number of stand up comedians in recent years have felt unnecessary with accusations carrying very little weight, I find a lot of people who have posted about the offense they've taken are people who are perfectly okay with the same level of joke being told about anyone that doesn't involve them, which is hypocritical to a large degree. There is also the all to many instances where people have become outraged without watching the comedy set itself and either hearing it second hand or watching a small snippet banded about online. Therein lies my view of people assuming malice.

The current comedian under fire is Matt Rife, I have seen so little of his comedy admittedly but from what I have seen he's quite funny, not hilarious in my view but certainly quick witted when doing crowd work, I saw the joke because of the angry response it had got and I have to say....I don't get the response, it's one thing to tell a dark joke on stage about domestic violence it's another to campaign for it, the amount of posts on you tube alone about it would make you think he took a woman on stage and planted her one in the face. It is now assumed that he essentially advocated for male violence against women...from one joke."

Humans in general have terrible memories.  Our memories are unreliable and they often alter as we age and if not recalled they fade away. This is why when we often think about our past we might see them through a rose colored glasses. There might've been many painful moments that we've erased subconsciously. Our minds often rewrite our memories and ""recolor"" them. A little Google search will confirm this.

Our minds are bad at memory, yes. But that's only because we don't recall them. Anyone reading this is likely to have 15+ years in school and University. You likely remember very little after all these years. VERY LITTLE. What was the point? 

Now, you might say that maybe it's not really worth remembering everything we learned. Which could be true. It might not really be useful to remember the laws of thermodynamics. 

But, what if you could remember ALL that you studied? If you could retain all that knowledge that you acquired wouldn't that make you a richer being? I don't see how it could do any harm. 

Alright, you might still say that it doesn't add much value to your life so it's not required. Which is a fair argument.

Even if you think that spaced-repetition should still be taught to everyone. Everyone should understand that this is how we humans learn. Rote-memorization is completely useless. You could be studying or working in any domain ranging from medicine, history, programming or art. Having a system to capture everything you learnt and then accessing them periodically is crucial to learn. 

Let me illustrate how I learn anything. Write now I'm learning programming and UI/UX design. I take notes on concepts that I learn on Onenote. If I've learnt something new I go revise it as frequently as every 3 days. After 2-3 weeks I revise them periodically every Sat. And after a month or two I come back to them on a monthly basis or only when required. I organise all my notes into pages (main topic) and sub pages (sub topic). Whenever I need to search for something I simply type a keyword in the search bar. Onenote searches through ALL my notes for that particular term and highlights those words across all the subpages. This lets me revisit my notes easily.

Humans in general have terrible memories.  Our memories are unreliable and they often alter as we age and if not recalled they fade away. This is why when we often think about our past we might see them through a rose colored glasses. There might've been many painful moments that we've erased subconsciously. Our minds often rewrite our memories and ""recolor"" them. A little Google search will confirm this.

If Palestinians in the West Bank resist, even violently against these illegal operations, they would be completely justified. And the people who give funding that is being used to force people from their homes and pay for weapons are funding terror."

1,2023-12-07,CMV: Races do not exist but 'black' does,u/m4nu,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18cyx0i/cmv_races_do_not_exist_but_black_does/,changemyview,"Race is scientifically arbitrary. It was created by some guy named Linnaeus who did wonderful things for taxonomy, but he extended it and created five categories for race - white, red, yellow, black and monster. We sort of picked it up and ran with it, but these differences aren't scientifically valid. They're based on a single observable feature - skin color - but not much else. Genetic variance within races is just as varied as it is between races. A man from Ghana and an Aborigine from Australia have little in common genetically even if some guy on the street would call them both 'black'. Same with an Inuit and a Quechua, or a Scot and a Syrian, or a Korean and a Tamil. Race doesn't exist, but ethnicity does.

Black has two meaning in the US - it refers to a race, which does not exist, and an ethnic group, which does. Black became an ethnic group during the 17th to 19th centuries, in a process of ethnogenesis. Music, culture, and yes, genetic mixture from breeding, led to the creation of a black ethnicity. A Nigerian immigrant to the US is perceived as black [race], but he isn't black [ethnicity]. White folks tend to have the luxury of remembering their actual ethnicity. A black American calling himself black is equivalent to an Irish American calling himself Irish - not an Irish American calling himself white. 

You can say ""I am proud of being Italian. Italian pride.""

You can say ""I am proud of being Black. Black pride."" 

These are equivalent to each other - but both are not equivalent to saying: ""I am proud of being white. White pride.""

**CMV: There is no contradiction between saying it is OK for black folks to have pride in their heritage and 'black pride' while also saying that having racial pride is stupid and that race does not exist.**"

Russia is a nuclear power. Hamas is not a nuclear power. Israel is a wealthy country. Ukraine is not a wealthy country. Israel has already pretty much taught Hamas a lesson. Ukraine is struggling to hold on. The stability of Europe is far more important to the US than the stability of the Middle East.

31,2023-12-07,CMV: I'm watching the Young Thug RICO trial and so far I haven't seen anything from the state that justifies this case,u/TheBeaarJeww,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18czhs1/cmv_im_watching_the_young_thug_rico_trial_and_so/,changemyview,"I'm watching the entirety of the case, I'm on day 5 right now. So far I haven't seen anything from the state that makes me think that Young Thug should get anything close to 120 years in prison.

I think Young Thug's defense team did a great job in their opening remarks explaining the business that Young Thug is in. He's a very successful, grammy winning musical artist. He's got no prior criminal convictions, a clean record... A lot of what I've seen the state allege that Young Thug has done so far are things that I would consider ""nuisance crimes"". Things like traffic violations, drug possession, etc. Given Young Thug's age and wealth I don't think it's unusual for someone in that position to do nuisance crimes like that, a lot of young successful people do the same, Justin Bieber for example.  


The song lyrics and social media posts that the state are pointing to are part of Young Thug's public persona... Rap is the most popular genre of music in the world and like it or not the stuff that Young Thug is saying is part of that business.   


I don't doubt that there are people out there from Young Thug's neighborhood that have said stuff like ""Oh if we kill this guy how much do you think Young Thug will pay us? He really wants this guy dead.""  
That doesn't mean that Young Thug knows those people, that he approved of any criminal activity, etc. When someone makes it out of the hood there's all kinds of people that are going to try to attach themselves to that person or get money out of them... Where is the evidence that Young Thug approved of any of those things? The state has access to all of Young Thug's financial information, where is the evidence that he's paid anyone to do any criminal acts because I don't see it.   


I think the state has been very unfair on how they're interpreting a lot of statements made by Young Thug. One example being the social media post """"YSL rule the world kid. 24m on a n\*gga head, y'all just start bringing me money."". The state seems to be implying that this is a call to violence from Young Thug, like he will pay 24 million dollars for someone to be killed... This is a post about Lil Uzi Vert having a $24 million diamond implanted into his forehead...  


Anyone familiar with this case care to explain to me what I'm missing? If Young Thug is out here killing people or paying for people to get killed then yeah he probably should go to prison but I don't see any evidence of that so far."
106,2023-12-07,CMV: The rise is right wing politics is because progressives have failed to provide a vision for the future.,u/Fando1234,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18czr67/cmv_the_rise_is_right_wing_politics_is_because/,changemyview,"What were previously considered ‘far right’ political parties are now becoming mainstream across Europe (1) and the US. 

In the U.K. a right wing alliance called Arc recently filled out one of Londons biggest venues (the O2 arena) with series of talks, hosted by Jordan Peterson. 

Love it or hate it, this movement has a clear purpose and vision. This is laid out rather well in their promo video here: https://youtu.be/PtVDQ4hKH-g?si=kEpIZpA5mCOl-UAv

At its heart, this message directly rejects many narratives of recent liberal politics. And seeks to replace this with something they view as more positive. Focusing on ‘western values’, western identity, traditionalism and optimism for the future.

This is in stark contrast with the predominant narrative of the liberal left. Which sees the west as an evil, imperial, colonising force. Institutionally racist, a societal Venn diagram of intersectional oppression, a zero sum game where one groups gain is necessarily another groups loss. All headed almost inevitably towards a climate disaster of our own making. 

As a left leaning voter myself I can see a lot of truth in these gripes. But summed together they do not provide any form of vision for the future that people can vote for. 

This could perhaps explain the rise of LePen in France, 4 consecutive wins for Conservative government in the U.K., Trumps continued popularity in America. Where the focus is on “taking control” and “making America great”.

If the liberal left want to win back support, they need to focus less on prophesizing doom, denigrating their own countries and chastising the masses for mortal impurity. And more on building a positive narrative for their own country and it’s people. 

Ultimately the left needs a clear, positive vision for the future. Until it has one, the rise of the right will continue.

So, I'm not at all sympathetic with the ""incel"" cause or whatever that is. Many say very hateful things that should not be said, many act violently, etc. As far as I undertstand it, those that most fervently identify with the term, skew towards hatefulness.

My general impression is that they're, for lack of a better word, ""losers"" in a sense. The bottom of society etc. And because of that, I feel a great deal of pity for them. I think this sense of having ""lost"" and the judgment they feel is probably somewhere at the core of their hatefulness, and I think the media and people generally who use the phrase as a putdown, do ***absolutely nothing but aggravate the problem.***

If you're going to hold a view analogous to ""society's ills are systemic in nature"", which is a view that I hold, then making fun of someone for being an incel is the worst possible thing you could do. If your understanding of the problem is that people, almost always men, who can't get laid because they're almost always some combination of poor/ugly/weak/awkward/antisocial and we decide these things and decide that they're bad because of some combination of genetics/environment/evolution/society/blah (and I really don't mean that as an insult, more a statement of fact) that's a horrible thing to do! 

Instead, the problem should be viewed dispassionately, in one sense, and compassionately in another sense. But never, passionately hateful in retribution, which is how I see this group treated.

What would change my view on this? I suppose it could be argued that such an approach is necessary or utilitarian in some way, or that my view of it is just totally off. "

I’m saying this for a couple reasons:

1) I feel it is the best use of their time because why keep them somewhere they won’t learn anything.

2) keeping them in a conventional setting is a waste of resources and a burden to the other more academically inclined students.

I do agree that the education could be revamped for all students, and perhaps most students don’t get a lot of use from 12 full years of school, but I feel that it can be argued either way for high performing students so that argument doesn’t really do much here. Severely underperforming students though I feel there are no two ways about it. You can cmv by convincing me that even incredibly unintelligent and underperforming students learn and retain useful knowledge from a traditional school setting past junior high when compared to the resources required to teach them and the strain it places on teachers and other students who would more significantly benefit from education."

I’ve been a social outcast almost my entire life.  I was picked next to last in gym class and only have one true friend from school.  I wish my parents would just admit I was bumped on my head as a child because that would probably explain a lot.  Everyone tries to say that “you’ll find the right woman, there’s someone for everybody” or “sex isn’t that big of a deal.”  I call bullshit, most of the time these people have never had problems attracting women.  It’s like a rich person telling a poor person that money doesn’t matter.  

Plus there just doesn’t seem like a solution to fix being an incel.  “just be more confident” yeah how can I be confident when the only intimacy I’ve had with women is through porn.  Fixing up your style and trying to be more social won’t work if you’re short and balding.  Slaving away at a 9 to 5 will either attract single mothers that want a guy to be a provider or a woman who wants to settle after having her fun with hookups and casual sex.  

Being a resentful incel is a normal reaction to the culture we have today.  I believe hoeflation is a real problem and it is causing more men to not participate in society.  This phenomenon will only get worse as online culture gets more normalized and mid tier women believe a 6 foot, $100k salary a year man is normal.  This will cause America to become a polygamous society where women share the same men, leaving most of as lifelong incels.  It’s already happened to me and I feel like I’m not alone."

This planet functions on an operating system (like a computer) that is designed so that the strong members of every species will survive and the weak will perish. This system is inherently cold and devoid of compassion. Mother nature cannot be compassionate toward the weak memebrs of any species or the system fails to function as intended.

The entire purpose of the circle of life is to make sure weak life forms do not survive long enough to reproduce, because if they did, they'd weaken their species. Sexual attraction, especially with mammals, works similarly. We are attracted to strong and healthy genes and we reject weak ones. (Our genitals simply respond, we do not control this.) Males compete for females and the female is aroused by the male that wins because he clearly has the best genes to reproduce with.... because he won. Breeding with the loser wouldn't strengthen the species as much or worse, it would weaken it. Our sexual instincts are in tandem with mother nature's intended purpose for our species, our compassion is not, despite it vital importance.

Humans have hijacked the entire system with our compassion. Now we can preserve the lives of our loved ones with weak genes and they can go on to reproduce. While morally and ethically I believe this is the right thing to do, the conseqences of our compassion is that members of the homo sapien species who would have never reproduced in the past are now reproducing and passing on their weak(er) genes to newer generations.

In essence, we are all rebelling against Earth's operating system now. We are rebelling against mother nature. We can see it all around us: Humans aren't nearly as strong as they used to be. Sickness and disease is rampant and without modern technology, hundreds of millions of humans who, **according to mother nature**, should be dead, are now breeding.

I'm not making an ethical or moral case. Compassion is important. I simply see the inevitability of our compassion to be a slow erosion on the strength of our human genes. If trends continue, our species is going to continue to get weaker and weaker, and I don't know how to resolve this dilemma. 

Eugenicists have an answer, and that answer is in tandem with the operating system of the planet, but it's not a moral answer, nor an ethical one. (Mother nature is clearly not moral, nor ethical.) My ""sympathy"" for eugenicists simply stems from the fact that I cannot argue that they are \*not\* in tandem with how the operating system of the planet functions for every other species. Their whole platform is, ""We do it like mother nature does it.""

And the person loves it and feels better. I think that's great and genuine.

But i always find compliments in other situations just odd and self-serving. Because i've seen so many times where someone gives a compliment, the other person is uncomfortable but is forced to say thank you. Or gets shamed when they don't thank them. Like what?

Isn't giving a compliment about making the other person feel good? Why is it so bad when they are uncomfortable with a particular word or compliment? Why not ask what they like to be complimented on? Or what they would like to hear? And if they don't like compliments, then don't give them any?

When things like this happen, it seems to be all about the other person. How they are so upset they weren't validated, rather than wondering(or concerned) about why the other person is adverse about that specific compliment?

\-Maybe the person has been traumatized by being love-bombed?

\-Or they feel invisible pressure to live up to that expectation?

And if the person puts themself down, and you want to help them out, start out small. Talk about which compliments makes them feel uncomfortable and see if there's one small thing you can praise.  And if the person is insistent on not being complimented on ANYTHING, just leave them alone? Because just forcing and shaming someone into accept a compliment anyway seems weird and a violation of their boundaries and autonomy even if the intention was good.

Can someone give me an alternate perspective on this please? I feel like my perspective is too negative and harsh.

Grocery stores, pharmacies and other large chains still accept it but in my experience very few bars, restaurants, movie theaters and other businesses accept cash. I used to think since it was “legal tender” businesses had to accept it but they don’t. 

Are there non-illicit transactions where cash is preferable or does cash really have less spending power and therefore less value today?"

That's basically what the Bible is. Christians claim it is the infallible word of God, God's chosen method to talk to us. So, of all methods God could use, He chooses a book that's countless years old, has been translated many times, whose authorship is suspect and questionable, whose content's meaning is highly debatable (is it literal or metaphorical? etc.), and whose text can be twisted to support a hundred different political, religious, social and national agendas.

God could have simply spoken to everyone directly with an audible voice.

He could have spoken to each of us with something like telepathy, direct thought communication with us.

Instead, God chooses to use a book whose reliability is about as dubious as that of an old parchment pirate map pointing to X for hidden treasure.

When I debate this topic with others, they bring talking points like “Common Sense” gun laws, which either already exist when I ask them to specify, or it doesn’t address how that particular common sense law would have prevented anyone from committing mass murder. 

They also make arguments for emulating how other countries control guns. (UK, Canada, Japan). While at the same time saying they don’t want to ban guns. I find this contradictory because those countries have guns banned. So if you make that argument you’re essentially arguing to ban guns. 

I wish more gun control advocates would be honest with themselves, with everyone else and admit they want guns banned. Instead of using mental gymnastics of “common sense” gun laws.

I started using Apps and they're extremely hateful towards men and present them as inferior for whatever reason.  
  
Specifically, I see many conversation around dating divulge into ""well men rape/assault women"" as a catchall for any complaints or comments men have in regards to the dating market or traditions even when it's irrelevant. I get it this is a problem. But too often I see people pulling this card in the most illogical and demeaning ways not because they actually care about addressing the problem but more as a 'gotcha'.  
  
There's a difference between being cautious and treating every man as if he's some kind of predator. The latter is misandrist and I think it needs to be better addressed and condemned. Hate breeds hate and it's crazy to think that it would ever be possible to stop misogyny while accepting misandry.

If men don't want to be treated like predators they should stop raping people  
  
Treating a whole group a certain way based on the action of a few is prejudice. Men are also not a monolith  
  
If you're not a rapist than you shouldn't be insulted since it only applies to them

French bulldogs in particular are genetic disasters to me. Every single one I’ve ever met sounds like they struggle to breathe even shallowly. Not to mention their poor eyes. A study published in 2021 by VetCompass concluded that french bulldogs were at a significantly greater risk for a whole host of health issues compared to other breeds. Their entire existence is pretty much just misery and suffering and yet people continue to spend an upwards of 5k of these dogs. People that purposefully go out and purchase french bulldogs are partly at fault for this breeds long suffering and current genetic standing, by keeping them in such high demand even though they are horrifically bred.

Let's be real, these parents had to know this would happen. Almost everyone's been to school and knows how these things go.

They should do everything to make sure their kid isn't tied to their past job.

If everyone's so aware of this, why aren't we calling out the parents responsible for putting their kids in this situation?

17,2023-12-07,CMV: There will NOT be more two-way players like Shohei Ohtani in professional baseball in the foreseeable future,u/Soyuz_1848,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18dei66/cmv_there_will_not_be_more_twoway_players_like/,changemyview,"Reason 1: Two-way players often have a short career span. Ohtani just got injured in August and won't pitch again until 2025. So he only has three highlight years (2021, 2022, 2023) in MLB and that's very short for a professional player. Maybe 2025 and 2026, but he'll be 32 by 2026 and will start going downhill. 5 years is still very short for a professional baseball player.

Reason 2: Playing two-way makes no sense unless you're elite in both aspects. If you're an average hitter and average pitcher, you'll be extremely valuable if you improve your hitting to All-Star level, but if you insist on playing both ways and remain average in both, no team will want you as a core player, you're just another utility guy.

Reason 3: Playing two-way requires the player to immerse themselves in baseball, give up the personal and leisure life, have minimal socializing, just like Ohtani which is incredibly difficult for a culture like the US. For playing two-way you have to double your training time and that leaves you very little free time if at all, although it's different groups of muscles. 

Reason 4: Two-way means two-risk. If you pitch too hard and tear your UCL, you won't hit for another 4\~6 months. If you bat too hard and tear your oblique, you also won't pitch for a few weeks. No one wants a player with double injury risk unless they're elite at both sides.

Reason 5: Playing two-way is very inflexible given the current baseball rules. There are only the following viable two-way strategies:

a. SP+DH like Ohtani but it requires you to be elite at both

b. SP+Position Player, but it requires a longer interval between starts as it's more tiring to field than DH. Basically you need another SP guy which negates your two-way advantage.

c. RP+Position Player/DH, but bullpen pitchers need warming up, and you end up running back and forth like Ohtani in WBC finals. You can't do this every match in a long season.

d. SP/RP + Pinch Hitter, but pinch hitters only appear once per game and not even every game. So you're nothing more than a good-hitting pitcher, not a real two-way player, as your bat has very limited influence.

Reason 6: The success rate of two-way player is too low. Managers are simply reluctant to risk a huge bust in their best prospects. Rather have a sure All-Star caliber player than risk turning your top prospect into an ordinary utility guy. "

In the song Who let the dogs out, the lyrics state that, “A doggy is nothing if he don’t have a bone”. While in a metaphorical sense, there is an argument to be made that a doggy, without a bone, may lack purpose. Say, what is a policeman without a bad guy? What’s a teacher without a student? 

You get the drill. 

A bone to a doggy is sort of the pinnacle. Most doggies are going to prize a bone. A bone, is food. Food is a dogs lifeblood. A bone is also primal. Dogs have a special and deep relationship to their bone. No other animal takes such glee in running hiding and burying their bone quite like a dog does. Only to retrieve the bone later, as a sort of ancestral game that only the dog and its bone participate in. 

 When I posed this question to my son however, I was struck by the simplicity of his response. What is a doggy if he doesn’t have a bone? His response: a dog. 

It might seem glib to respond in such a straightforward manner to a question that plunges deep into the goals and aspirations of a dog. But in another way, in a deep way, a dog is a dog, when it does not have a bone. A dog offers its doggyness to us. 

A dog has its own character, its own essence. It offers companionship, loyalty, and its own rich perspective. It sees the world at large as its own giant bone. Chasing its own doggy dreams, and once caught playfully toying with them, and securing them, only to loyally return later to play again. Think of you as its master. A good dog, will continually engage, come, go, and come back again in an endless metaphorical game of fetch. 

So while the song Who lets the dogs out argues that a doggy is nothing if it don’t have a bone, I reject this position. While a doggy without a literal bone may lose something, something deep even, it still offers so much and lives its own life with or without a bone. 

Have I missed something important here? Is there a perspective to the age old argument that a doggy is in fact nothing if he don’t have a bone?"

and

Through consistent discipline, children learn about accountability and responsibility for their actions. They understand that certain behaviors have consequences, both positive and negative, and develop a sense of responsibility for their choices.

they still humans believe it or not

and such acts only dehumanize them further and lead to discrimination against a group of humans that should have same respect as an individual human would have,

idk why this is an unpopular opinion, but humans are humans, whether roma or not, they are individuals and deserve respect and not to be dehumanized solely on the basis of them being roma"

Im burnt out and I barely have enough money to put away. People that somehow come up with money and find ways to get approved for some kind of financial aid every month, or year is impressive and we need to just stop judging them.

Some of it is brutal. Most of it is hidden and systemic (who gets hired and promoted).

There is discrimination against East Asians. Some of it is the black on Asian violence you see on TV.  But most of it again is hidden where Indian educators discriminate against East Asians by singling them out in school between Kindergarten and College.

East Asians discriminate against brown people and black people. Some of it is blatant like suspecting black customers of stealing. Most of it is done silently, by purposely avoiding black and brown communities, and they do not get called out in the same way white flight does.

DEI programs at companies are disproportionately run by black executives and focus on BIPOC, a term that has come to exclude brown and East Asian people.

Chinese and Koreans and Japanese are in a three way hate triangle.

East Asians look down in Southwest Asians and consider them second class.

And so on.

The white majority rightfully gets called out if they do similar things, but minorities are able to fly under the radar. 

Unfortunately, it’s a huge problem that will and currently already does create winners and losers."

Walmart has a bad reputation where it pays its employees low wage, have poor working conditions, and inadequate healthcare. As a result, Walmart has been sued by approximately 2 million employees worldwide. approximately 160,000 to 200,000 people who were forced to work off-the-clock, were denied overtime pay, or were not allowed to take rest and lunch breaks. There has been plenty of discrimination and harassment. 

Target in the other hand, pays a dollar more than Walmart, has a better culture and better benefits. There are more Target locations in cities where it don’t have Walmart such as New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, etc. I’ve heard Target employees happier than the ones at Walmart

I can’t find anything negative about Target that is similar to Walmart regarding working. So, that’s how in my view Target is better to work than at Walmart. Change my view."

We, alongside the rest of the EU have a pact with the current Lybian government: we fund them and in return they block a part of the migrants that come through their borders. The problems arise when the funding goes to groups(DCIM) that operate concentration camps of immigrants, where they are tortured, raped and killed. They contact the families of the immigrants with videos of the abuse, and demand a payment  for their release. This isn't something that is hidden, and is instead accepted by the general public as an effective anti immigration measure. No government wants to personally oversee these camps, as on the outside they promote a facade of defenders of human rights, but they also don't want to make the camps more in line with their morals, despite being their main source of income. I personally never see protests or other such events organized against this practice, demonstrating that many europeans are at least neutrally accepting and at most fully endorse it. We, the european population, silently support our government doing these atrocities because we believe that they aren't going to affect us in the slightest. I believe that if we saw some consequences for our governments actions, we would push for change and elect leaders that are also more humanitarian. So, in an hypothetical future, where the international community does take these camps in consideration, shouldn't the people that silently endorsed these practices from their government be also held accountable in some way?"

Before I start, I’m not just randomly choosing features that I consider masculine, I’m defining masculine features as features that you can use to differentiate male from a female. For example, facial hair is a masculine trait because men have facial hair so that’s a feature that differentiates a male from a female.

1. East Asian men have much less body hair/facial hair than any other race
2. East Asian men have more neotenous facial feature 
-less deep eye socket, making brow bone less prominent (male objectively have deeper eye socket than female)
-East Asian men tend to have weaker jawline and smaller mouth (might be due to diet though)
3. East Asian men are shorter and skinner on average
4. East Asian men have shorter penis on average

Although, there are a few masculine features that are most prominent in East Asian men like having a larger skull. Change my view"

Thus, my problem with this particular practice is a couple things.

#1 It is unjust to yourself to not speak up if you disagree with someone else. Let's say a random guy to you and me, Sam, wants his partner to make him a sandwich every afternoon of every day. He 'feels' like this should be a thing. If our initial, internal reaction was of disagreement, I don't understand why people would advocate to validate Sam's feeling here. Say you disagree, and then let that take its course.

#2 It is extremely ingenuine. Once again with another example, let's say we're talking with a coworker who regularly complains about not getting any favors or promotions at work. But at the same time, they are visibly, obviously lazy. Do we validate their feelings? What if this is not a coworker, but a spouse? Do we validate our spouse in this moment?

The whole practice seems completely useless with no rhyme or reason on how or when to even practice it. Validate here but don't validate there. Validate today but not tomorrow. Validate most of the time but not all the time.

In essence, I think the whole thing is just some weird, avoidant tactic from those who can't simply say, ""I agree"" or ""I disagree"".

If you want to change my view, I would love to hear about how the practice is useful in and of itself, and also how and when it should be practiced.

EDIT: doing a lot of flying today, trying to keep up with the comments. Thank you to the commenters who have informed me that I was using the term wrong. I still stand by not agreeing with non-agreeable emotions (case by case), but as I’ve learned, to validate is to atleast acknowledge said emotions. Deltas will be given out once I can breathe and, very importantly, get some internet.

EDIT 2: The general definition in the comments for validate is ""to acknowledge one's emotions"". I have been informed that everyone's emotion are valid. If this is the case, do we ""care"" for every stranger? To practice validating strangers we DON'T care about is hypocritical."

I am a kind and ethical person, and genuinely care for and work for my teams.

I have only ever put someone on a PIP when my intention is to terminate. I will always give them every opportunity to meet minimum requirements, and pride myself on thinking creatively to help people to feel happy and accomplished at work. I manage managers, and it is an absolute must that they support and care for their people, and I push them hard on continuously developing their leadership skills, and creating a positive and genuinely supportive team identity.

I am of the firm belief that any manager that puts someone on a PIP, only to then have the person improve, has a lot to answer for. All coaching, training, adjustments, support, and information regarding consequences should have been given way before going the formal route in my view - what could a PIP possibly offer that couldn’t be offered prior to it getting to that?

When I put someone on a PIP, I hit it pretty hard and fast (with care to reduce as much damage as possible), but I leave no uncertainty and make it very clear by my suddenly super professional language and documentation of every issue that there is no chance of “passing.” This pressure has resulted in every employee I’ve ever had on a PIP resigning. I know what I have to do, and it is my responsibility to protect the rest of the team from the negatives of poor behaviour/performance, so I make the choice (as unpleasant as it is) and get it done. I should also note that a PIP will never come as a surprise to anyone when I’m responsible for it, as it is just the final stage of a process that they’re well and truly involved in - I communicate kindly and clearly, and am quite transparent generally speaking.

People feel like shit while they’re on PIPs. I watch managers give mixed messages and drag the process out, with confused people not knowing what’s happening - this I feel impacts not just the employee on a PIP, but the broader team that has to deal with any associated discomfort.

Do everything in your power to help people improve, have their success and wellbeing as your number 1 goal, check yourself and ask for advice to ensure you’ve done all you can, then make the decision and rip the bandaid off quickly…am yet to hear an argument that has convinced me that this is not the best way to go, but am once again checking myself."

First off dreads originate from African regions dating back thousands of years and hold a religious and cultural significance, furthermore Buddhist, Christian and Hindu religions wore dreadlocks. Moving forward in time vikings adopted this hairstyle and at some point through time most cultures/ethnicities used this hairstyle. So dreadlocks aren't just subject to black culture there subject to most if not all cultures. I dont believe that someone shouldn't be allowed to have a hair style because it's part of someone's culture. Just earlier I saw people hating on a white woman for having dreads saying cultural apropriation this cultural apropriation that but if u look at its definition cultural appropriation is HATING or MOCKING the culture for what they chose to wear and I think that's wrong. Cultural apropriation is  RACISM and a white woman wearing dreads isn't racist its accepting all cultures."
1,2023-12-09,CMV: Lying about virginity if asked is completely justified,u/nyr04776,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18eaygy/cmv_lying_about_virginity_if_asked_is_completely/,changemyview,"As anyone knows, few words attached to a man have the same effect as ""virgin."" If you happen to place that label on yourself, both men and women will usually be polite to you about it, but their treatment of you will be noticeably more cold, distant, and ""alien."" There are countless stories on the internet and real life about how a dating connection might be going very well, but when the topic of (nonexistent) past experiences is broached, the other person's interest freezes like water in a fridge. To avoid this treatment, I believe that if you are a virgin as a man, it is absolutely acceptable to lie about it if the other person approaches the subject, and below I will explain why I currently think that way.  
Some caveats first: this argument applies mostly to men in straight dating contexts, especially casual ones, although it can also apply to platonic contexts as well. It may also be applicable to women to some extent, and also in the inverse case where the social environment shames them for not being a virgin. This also applies only if the person is asked about virginity or past sexual history through a direct question or clear hints: if the person volunteers this information, I no longer consider it justified as it is no longer a defensive response.  
First of all, it is rude to ask anyone about their sexual past unless *maybe* they know and trust you very well. No one owes anyone information about it--doesn't matter if you just met at a party, doesn't matter if you're on the golden anniversary of your marriage. How do people think it's appropriate to ask something so private and emotionally fraught to someone they barely know? If you get asked a disrespectful question, you shouldn't feel bad about giving a disrespectful answer. (And if you're thinking about dodging the question or stating you aren't comfortable with it, forget it--if everyone else she asked gives a straight answer, she's very likely to assume the worst.)  
Secondly, none of the rationalizations for people's kneejerk reaction to virginity actually hold water. He'll be bad in bed? A high schooler could understand the basic methods for making sex pleasurable for a woman with a few hours of studying. No woman wants him? There are a million other possible reasons why he might be a virgin: maybe he had nowhere to meet women he was attracted to. Maybe he had trauma. Maybe he had untreated mental illness or medication that killed his libido. Maybe he was raised in an extremely sex-negative household which made him unable to approach women without shame (though I already said trauma). Many of these things are uncomfortable to discuss even with one's closest friends and family, and therefore ***no one owes you an explanation about them.***  
Thirdly, safeguarding one's social reputation is important for anyone. As discussed before, virginity after a certain point is one of the worst stigmas for a man's social and dating life that don't have anything to do with antisocial behavior. How can one trust someone to not share such damaging information with all their friends if things don't work out?  
Finally, there is a certain double standard between men and women when it comes to not telling the truth in these contexts. Essentially every single woman lies all the time about ""having a boyfriend,"" etc. etc. to not have to deal with immature men who can't handle rejection. What's wrong with men also lying in order to not have to deal with an unjust stigma that also comes from a place of immaturity?"

When I confronted two of them, they said that they are fine living on welfare alone, without a job, since they don't have enough money for university and don't want to risk with taking loans. Coincidentally, these people have almost no hobbies and no future plans. This leads me to believing that if we want an educated population with more individuals and less ""gray mass"" then we should make high education more accessible. I believe that cutting welfare is the best option, since if we put aside disabled people and people with hard life circumstances(e.g. single moms) then welfare breeds laziness and kills ambitions.
Note: Saying that having an educated population is not an important goal/not a goal worth achieving won't change my view."

I have lots of issues on my mind that I need help sorting out

I have intrusive thoughts and issues of overthinking. Thoughts based on either immoral or illegal actions fill my mind whenever I'm at home chilling.

My mind keeps finding random loopholes to justify whatever actions it's trying to make me do based on these thoughts

And I hate it because it seems like they're right sometimes, when I know it's wrong on the long run

I also have an immense fear of being obsessed in something or someone that doesn't reciprocate connection or results.

 I've been rejected by someone romantically before, and instead of leaving it at that, i continue being friends with them out of obsessing over having any sort of connection that'll compromise for their intial rejection. Which didn't work on the long run

I fear that I'll find someone else who I'll have the same or similar scenarios with wear my mind is solely focused on them and only them

I think it's because my mind feels like it has to attach and stick itself  to something in order to continue it's processing. Or else it'll feel lost and empty

I know that some of the best ways to deal with this is engage in hobbies that'll satisfy me. I love creating art. I have been for a long time. 

But I don't feel motivated, nor am I disciplined enough to make art because I don't feel like I'm at a comfortable position in my mind

Basically i feel more motivated creating art when I don't feel like I have any responsibilities or obligation to anything else other than art. 

But I'm an adult, so ofc I have lots of responsibilities

I need advice on how to deal with all these situations. Therapy is a viable option and I'll definitely consider it. But I just want some of your input"
1,2023-12-09,CMV: Misinformation is often better viewed as a symptom of deep societal problems rather than their cause,u/Ill-Valuable6211,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18eckdg/cmv_misinformation_is_often_better_viewed_as_a/,changemyview,"When that’s true, interventions like debunking and censorship are unlikely to help – and might make things worse.

The central intuition driving the modern misinformation panic is that people – specifically [other](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14614448231153379) people – are gullible and hence easily brainwashed into holding false beliefs. This idea is wrong.

People are [discriminating and suspicious learners](https://www.amazon.com/Not-Born-Yesterday-Science-Believe/dp/0691178704), if anything placing too much weight on their own views relative to those of others. Persuasion is therefore extremely difficult and even intense propaganda campaigns and advertising efforts routinely have minimal effects 

To many commentators and social scientists, this fact is difficult to accept. If people are not gullible and persuasion is difficult, what explains extraordinary popular delusions and bizarre conspiracy theories?

This question rests on a confused but widespread assumption: that the truth is always self-evident and desirable, such that false beliefs can only arise from the credulous acceptance of misinformation.

But first, the truth about complex issues is not self-evident, and people interpret the world through intuitions and interpretive dispositions that are often pre-scientific. To overcome these inclinations, they must encounter and trust reliable information.

However, a minority actively distrust mainstream epistemic institutions (e.g., science, public health, mainstream media), which causes them to reject reliable info and expert consensus and seek out content - often wrong - from counter-establishment sources.

And second, humans are not disinterested truth seekers. Much misinformation arises from factors such as affective polarisation and anti-establishment worldviews, which create widespread demand for content that demonises outgroups and elites.

Factors such as institutional distrust, polarisation, and rationalisation markets imply a picture in which misinformation isn't something that happens to the mass public but rather something its members are complicit in producing.

When that's true, standard technocratic tactics for dealing with misinformation – such as prebunking, debunking, fact-checking, and censorship – are unlikely to be effective, and censorship specifically is likely to exacerbate the problems it aims to address.

If so, what might help? First, rather than investing so much into preventing the gullible masses from being brainwashed into holding bad ideas, it is far more important to win trust in institutions, including by [making them more trustworthy](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/sm3vk).

[Institutional distrust is often understandable and sometimes justified.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/15/this-is-why-some-people-dont-want-to-get-the-covid-vaccine)

More broadly, policies should aim at addressing the social conditions that make people avid consumers of misinformation. Intense polarisation and steep social inequalities create an inevitable demand for hyperbolic narratives that demonise outgroups and elites."

Before I start, I’m not just randomly choosing features that I consider masculine, I’m defining masculine features as features that you can use to differentiate male from a female. For example, facial hair is a masculine trait because men have facial hair so that’s a feature that differentiates a male from a female.

1. East Asian men have much less body hair/facial hair than any other race
2. East Asian men have more neotenous facial feature 
-less deep eye socket, making brow bone less prominent (male objectively have deeper eye socket than female)
-East Asian men tend to have weaker jawline and smaller mouth (might be due to diet though)
3. East Asian men are shorter and skinner on average
4. East Asian men have shorter penis on average

Although, there are a few masculine features that are most prominent in East Asian men like having a larger skull. Change my view"

There is discrimination against East Asians. Some of it is the black on Asian violence you see on TV.  But most of it again is hidden where Indian educators discriminate against East Asians by singling them out in school between Kindergarten and College.

East Asians discriminate against brown people and black people. Some of it is blatant like suspecting black customers of stealing. Most of it is done silently, by purposely avoiding black and brown communities, and they do not get called out in the same way white flight does.

DEI programs at companies are disproportionately run by black executives and focus on BIPOC, a term that has come to exclude brown and East Asian people.

Chinese and Koreans and Japanese are in a three way hate triangle. East Asians look down on Southeast Asians and consider them second class.

And so on.

The white majority rightfully gets called out if they do similar things, but minorities are able to fly under the radar.

Democracy is force, it's nothing more, or less, than a stronger majority making rules and using coercion/weapons to force those rules on a weaker (smaller) minority. As such, it's incompatible with anarchy by definition, which follows:

Anarchy is a form of society without rulers. It is primarily advocated by anarchists who propose replacing the state with a stateless society based on voluntary free association. These institutions or free associations are generally modeled to represent concepts such as community and economic self-reliance, interdependence, or individualism. In simple terms anarchy means 'without rulers' or 'without authority'. 

An-Soc/Coms love to say that anarchy means no hierarchies but that's false. ""No hierarchies"" would actually be ""anhierarchía"" not ""anarchy""

Change my view. I think there might be a theoretical example of a collectivist commune that relies on unanimous consent (probably Kropotkin based) but has one ever existed? However, any an-soc/com collective that uses less than unanimous consent and democracy is an oxymoron."

In a capitalist society if I owned a piece of property in downtown L.A. and wanted to open Montanarchist's brothel/ saloon/ weed- bar/ long-pork BBQ joint I would just build it, with my own hands, maybe sculpting giant penises on every corner, hang a sign out front and begin voluntary transactions with other individuals. With the current system I would have to get permits/ give bribes and beg for permission and most certainly get turned down. Even if I did bribe enough councilmen to get to build what I wanted, as soon as I tried selling a shot of my homemade absinthe, a joint, Jamaican jerked thigh, or piece of ass I'd be thrown in jail. Property rights and free market?

The US means of production are controlled by the state.

Politically favored companies get bailed out from the consequences of poor business decisions and inefficient operation instead of being allowed to naturally fail.

Even in day-to-day operations some companies are propped up via government intervention and others are driven out of business by government intervention. Here are two examples:

A US solar panel manufacture will receive numerous generous grants and other government handouts.

A US cigarette manufacture's product is taxed at more than 100%

Less popular, but also wide-spread opinion #2: false allegations of rape are wide-spread 40-50% of allegations are false.  
Searching for research gives variety of works supporting both #1 and #2. But in fact we can't know how many allegations are false unless we have some mind-reading truth detector device.  
What determines rape is consent. Not the fact that victim fought, how she (or he) was dressed, sober or drunk, married or not. Consent for sex is typically not recorded. Even physiological reaction like being wet or having an erection are not an indication of consent.  
It is possible to determine:  
 \*  Whether presumed victim and perpertrator were in same place  
 \*  Did they have sex  
  \* Are there signs of fighting and traumatic forced penetration  
  \* Drugs and alcohol in blood  
If 1, 2 are true and 3,4 are false were are in the ""he said, she said"" zone. It is very difficult to be sure who is lying, unless there is confession from one of them.  
\---  
So what are possibilities?  


1. So there are a lot of SA that are not reported at all. Of course these are rape but not FA.
2. Then there are reported but not to police, post in social media, or complaints to college bodies. Not properly investigated at all. Some unknown portion of false allegations are here and they cause harm, but are not counted in research.
3.  Allegations reported to police, they can go different ways:
   1.  Ignored. Both real rape and false allegations are ignored. Typically not counted. Real rape and FA can be here.
   2.  Investigated and dropped or ruled not guilty. Some are false here, but there are false negatives, real rapists can get away due to not enough proof
   3. Investigated, ruled as guilty. But there are some false positives. Innocent people sometimes go to jail.

&#x200B;

  
Out of huge dataset research of false allegations prevalence only account for 3.2 and 3.3, sometimes 3.1 and of course these numbers contain some mistakes (false negatives, false positives).  
2 and 3.1 is difficult to estimate even approximately due to no investigation, but these cases leed to a lot of viral stories.  
1 is often mentioned by feminist research telling how huge is the underwater part of iceberg of unreported rape.  
\---  
TLDR:  
So it impossible to correctly estimate the real rate of false rape allegations.

""Keep going"" doesn't mean ""keep suffering.""

Sometimes, ""keep going"" means resting. It means asking for help. It means feeling your feelings.

Even in tough times, there's beauty. ""Keep going"" reminds you to find that beauty. It says, ""You're strong enough.""

""Keep going"" isn't about ignoring darkness. It's about knowing it's there and believing in the light. It's about taking care of yourself, so you can rise again.

Let ""keep going"" be kind, not harsh. Let it help you heal, not hurt. You deserve rest, love, and a brighter tomorrow."

This plan outlaws lgbtq expression, describing it at pornography. 

This plan also “reallocates” illegal immigrants and DACA recipients nts to “detention centers”. 


Now the abandon Biden movement is a movement to cause Joe Biden to lose the 2024 election, driven by Muslim Americans, and backed by millions of other Americans, so that the status quo of candidates is changed nationwide. 

But here is my view,  which I really want someone to change. But I don’t see Biden getting back into the white house in 2024. He has lost massive amounts of support this year, due to the Israel situation and the massive amounts of people who are now refusing to vote for him. 


Biden won marginally in all of the important states. But now he’s lost around 30% of his support.


I believe I agree with the reason for the movement, we need to change this “lesser of two evils” situation.


That being said, I don’t think this will work. I think trump will still win, but as he said, he will go after his political opponents and the “leftist vermin” in the country. 

Meaning there won’t be a democracy anymore. Meaning the new “status quo” will be worse the. What we have now.


Meaning we won’t save Palestine, nor will the lgtbq, minorities, and women have their rights anymore in the USA. 


So to reiterate, my view is that the Abandon Biden movement, though well intentioned, will actually just lead us into a conservative dictatorship."
1,2023-12-09,CMV: It’s more productive for the pro-choice argument to shift focus from when a human life begins to justification of ending a human life in the womb.,u/SirIssacMath,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18eimmu/cmv_its_more_productive_for_the_prochoice/,changemyview,"Many of the pro-choice arguments I see seem to be centered around whether an embryo/fetus is a human.

From a scientific/biological perspective, I'm not sure an argument could be made that the embryo/fetus is not a human up until a certain amount of time and I've seen studies where from a biological perspective you can define an embryo as a human.

According to the American College of Pediatricians, human life begins at fertilization, or conception. This is the biological view that 95% of biologists agree with.

Let me know if I'm off-base on this presupposition.

I think that the pro-choice debate can become more productive if folks acknowledge that an embryo and a fetus are human beings but woman's bodily autonomy supersedes the right for the unborn child to life. Then from there the debate can be shifted towards the cutoff point.

1,2023-12-09,CMV: If the US Became Isolationist There Would Be No Lasting Damage to the US,u/HyShroom9,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ej1hu/cmv_if_the_us_became_isolationist_there_would_be/,changemyview,"This includes cutting almost all government spending on the military. I think that the US should turn inward and fix its sociopolitical problems, and use its money for ten or twenty years just to fix its domestic issues. Spend nothing on the military. Nothing bad would happen to the US, because they could just *explain* to the rest of the world that if they were attacked on domestic soil, they would make the human race extinct and the planet unliveable for a thousand years.

The US should stop being a police state for a couple decades, and once domestic problems are fixed, we can go back to being a military superpower. As long as we have a nuclear arsenal and aren’t attacking anyone else, noöne could really attack us, except for terrorists, who could be handled by the remaining token military left behind. Terrorists are usually religious and probably wouldn’t care if the world was blown up anyway, so they’d have to be handled by traditional means.

When someone has an injury of any kind, they are usually told to rest before dealing with stressors again, *even though they will again be strong enough to deal with them*. In the same way, we need to fix our wounds as a country, before we can start policing the rest of the world, *which we would do again*. We wouldn’t abandon the world forever, and the EU could handle it for a couple decades. Not forever, but for a while. The time for American exceptionalism is passed, for now. We’re not exceptional. We cannot handle our own domestic issues, and so we have no moral high ground.

In short, if you can change my mind that full thermonuclear war wouldn’t be enough of a deterrent to stop war against the US when the US would basically have no military, then you can change my mind on this matter. I do not define terrorism as an act of war, or we wouldn’t have a word for terrorism, but that’s a whole ‘nother CMV. If anyone wants to CMV on why this idea isn’t necessary, I’m also game."

That being said, I am open to hearing stuff on the other side because I think some of these pro-Palestine protestors may have good intentions when supporting ""Free Palestine"". So I have heard stories on the mainstream legacy media about an ""explosion of anti-semitism in the United States"" after October 7th. There was this ad from this website [https://www.standuptojewishhate.org](https://www.standuptojewishhate.org) that stated that anti-semitic hate crimes have increased about 388% since October 7th and the people at r/Palestine argued that the ""Zionists are spreading misinformation about hate crimes against Jews and accusations that pro-Palestine protestors are harassing and threatening Jewish people"".

&#x200B;

I have some sympathy to the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank but some liberals are accusing Israel of being a ""Terrorist state"" and ""committing genocide against the Palestinian people"". I honestly find this language inflammatory and inaccurate. Sure, Israel has killed Palestinians as collateral damage, but the IDF didn't mean to do this on purpose like what Hamas did on October 7th.

&#x200B;

My main gripe is seeing pro-Palestine supporters chanting ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"" because they are basically advocating for the dismantling of the State of Israel. Also, there have been cases of these pro-Palestine supporters threatening, harassing, and even killing Jewish people during their riots. I do not get all of this hate for Israel and Jewish people masqueraded as Palestinian liberation."
1,2023-12-09,CMV: Trying an internet break should be required before diagnosis of certain mental health conditions,u/Ok-Platform-9469,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ejr2l/cmv_trying_an_internet_break_should_be_required/,changemyview,"Disclaimer so I don't get misunderstood: I don't judge or hate people with mental health conditions, and I believe proper treatment should be accessible. I also believe the mental health conditions I mention here are real-- just in some cases, the effects of internet overuse can be confused with the symptoms of an innate health condition.

This is gonna sound like a complete boomer rant, and I guess it kind of is, but I think it's got some merit to it.  I think there's reason to believe that excessive internet/screen use can be destructive to mental health. [Doctors agree on this](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-screen-time-can-slow-your-childs-development). I mean, there are forums out there devoted solely to triggering members' eating disorders, self harm behavior, etc. Even on a less direct level, we have flashy, short-form content like TikTok that can shred attention span, forums like 4Chan that allow hateful/dangerous views to foster by providing anonymity, photo sharing sites like Instagram that normalize unattainable beauty standards, and plenty more. I don't think it's much of a reach to assume that overuse of sites like these can exacerbate or even spark mental health conditions (or at least, symptoms resembling them). 

I've also experienced the positive effects of reducing screen time on mental health anecdotally. For a long time, I experienced the symptoms of ADHD (obsession, careless behavior, trouble focusing, time blindness, etc.) to the point it negatively impacted my life and I considered seeking medication. After taking steps to reduce my screen time, though, nearly all these symptoms disappeared. One of my friends did the same and saw a similar impact. When I worked at a tech-free camp for kids one summer, I saw issues with focus, body dysmorphia, eating, etc. greatly improve or even completely disappear by the end of the session. 

I believe attention span is a muscle that can be trained, and that it is entirely possible to get addicted to dopamine. Your brain will adjust to be okay with not being constantly entertained, but you need to give it the opportunity to do so. Also, the messaging a person sees online (about the certain way a person should look, about how beautifully tragic it is to be depressed, about how scary the outside world is, etc) is very easy to internalize-- and removing that messaging is the first line of defense against allowing it to get into your head and cause something serious. 

To keep this debate simple, let's focus just on ADHD, though I think there are plenty of conditions that this could apply to (DID, anorexia and social anxiety also come to mind). [ADHD diagnoses are on the rise](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/timeline.html) and I doubt it's entirely due to greater awareness or breaking stereotypes about only young white boys having ADHD (though this progress is a good thing). I think that before being diagnosed or receiving a prescription, a patient should be asked to take a one-week break from the internet to see if that can alleviate the ADHD symptoms. It doesn't have to be anything extreme-- just limit video games/TV to an hour or so, don't use social media, and only go online intentionally and for a certain task. If that doesn't do the trick, the symptoms are likely due to biological factors and treatment is appropriate. If it does help, the troubles with focus are likely not due to ADHD and can instead be managed by limiting screen use. "

Also a lot of homes in my neighborhood are owned by corps who just rent them. So in a way these may not be offered for sale.

  
In a normal economy this would be corrected by builders offering more supply of new homes. But mortgage rates have gone up so much that most buyers are simply priced out (monthly payment compared to 2019 is almost 2.5 times for similar homes). "

All indications are that if he is, we’ll be dealing with someone determined to be a dictator, with a clear plan, and few to no guardrails.  The federal government is likely to be weaponized in every conceivable way against anyone who opposes trump.

They’re currently vetting 54,000 extremist loyalists for these jobs, using AI to do it.  This is certain not to end well for the country.  Trump’s flat-out said he’ll be a dictator “on day one”, and it’s been reported by multiple sources that he plans to use the Insurrection Act (which may not be reviewable by courts) to make the U.S. military his own private Gestapo—deploying them domestically to violently crush peaceful protesters, occupy blue cities, and persecute the media and political enemies.  Does anyone seriously think he’d have any compunction about seizing voting machines in the next midterm election to prevent Dems from winning (the way he tried to in 2020, but was talked out of it by people with more restraint, none of whom will be around next time)?  I know many previous elections have claimed, rightly or wrongly, that “democracy is on the line”—but in this case, a clear and detailed picture is showing us exactly how it obviously is.

Are left-leaning people ok with trump using the FBI and other alphabet agencies to lock up journalists and anyone who opposes him, on a scale never before seen here?  Do they care about what could happen to DACA recipients, LGBTQ people, or Palestinians here (whom he’s threatening to deport for their criticism of Israel)?  Do they think Congress (which is likely to be controlled by his lackeys if he wins), or a judicial system stacked with right-wing judges, will be willing to stop him—or even able to enforce its decisions if he ignores them, the way his role model Andrew Jackson did?  Do they think life will somehow just go on as it has been?  Do they think it’ll be no worse than last time, despite the lack of guardrails or any need to exercise restraint for the sake of reelection?  Do they see him promising to “root out” the “radical left vermin” and think, “Oh, it’s fine; he doesn’t mean me?”  In fascist regimes, leftists are often the first up against the wall.  Why do so many left-leaning people seem to be ignoring the clear historical parallels between this and fascist catastrophes of the past?  And why do they seem unconcerned about what would happen to Palestinians (or for that matter, Ukrainians) if trump is allowed to get power again?   
Whenever I bring up the danger of trump’s incipient fascism in debates with people who say they won’t vote for Biden, they seem to either wholly ignore it, or dismiss it with the facile, evidence-free claim that it’s just a “bogeyman” invented by Democrats (despite many of the sources being trump’s own words and his current and former employees.  Even trump’s former DHS chief of staff and former Defense Secretary, among many others, are warning about it).  Maybe this is just my experience, but I have yet to hear anyone who says they won’t vote for Biden offer any kind of practical plan for how to deal with the fascism that’s likely to result from letting trump win.  
Call me crazy, but I thought leftists and progressives opposed fascism.  So why do some seem so entirely blind to the danger of clearly rising fascism in this country?  Are they truly unaware of it?  Can they really not pay attention to more than one thing at once?  Is there no way, \*at all\*, to oppose current U.S. foreign policy, except by selling out all our rights and enabling a fascist with an even worse foreign policy?  And if the outcomes are likely to be worse at home and abroad, how can enabling trump be helpful to either Palestinians or the anti-fascist cause?  
I’m not so much interested in arguing, here, about whether people should vote for Biden.  I’m also not interested in hearing overly simplistic, propaganda-laden declarations like, “Oh, I just can’t vote for genocide,”—nor in debating whether that’s even an honest term for what’s happening.  If you’re a left-leaning person who won’t vote for Biden, what I’m looking for is a detailed explanation of what your \*practical, concrete plan\* is for stopping or limiting the damage done by a trump dictatorship, along with the fact that SCOTUS would remain in right-wing hands for even longer into the foreseeable future, as a result of empowering him.  (In your response, remember that protests are likely to be crushed by the military, and future free elections are also in doubt).  How does allowing him to win provide anything resembling a viable path to a better future?  
And for those whose answer is “accelerationism”—meaning they want to encourage a brutal dictatorship and all the suffering it’d cause, because they think it’d spark an armed revolution—I’m looking for \*practical\* solutions, so miss me with that theory, unless you can show how it’d be a \*practical, viable and effective\* course to take—one that’d actually \*reduce\* suffering, compared to electing Biden.  If you can’t show that convincingly, you’re just ineffectually fantasizing as far as I’m concerned.  Same thing if you advocate voting third-party and expect sufficient numbers of people to somehow suddenly join you—unless you can show how that’s a \*practical\* plan to beat trump, it’s not a valid response to my question.  
So how about it?  Do anti-Biden leftists \*only\* oppose the current carnage in Gaza, and they’re fine with anything trump might do domestically, or overseas in the future?  Or do they also have a \*practical\* plan for stopping fascism that doesn’t involve electing Biden?  I’m genuinely curious.  When I’ve asked people this question previously, I occasionally get a verbal shrug, or dismissal without any backing, like I said—but I usually just hear crickets.

So there is this transgender activist named Jazz Jennings who transitioned at the age of 5 back in 2005 and she publicly documented her gender transition journey on TLC. Basically, in season 4 and 5 of *I Am Jazz*, she got the bottom surgery, but due to never going through male puberty because of hormone blockers (Supprellin), her penis and scrotum never developed nor did she develop a libido or an ability to have an orgasm. Because of this, her surgeons had to use an alternative procedure involving the peritoneal lining of her abdomen to create the neo-vagina. She had some complications, but eventually those were resolved.

She identifies as pansexual, but she says that her libido is very weak and she has never experienced an orgasm. Now as a bystander, I feel a bit bad that she may have a difficult time enjoying sexual activity due to the nature of her early gender transition, but I know that gender affirming care is lifesaving for many transgender people. But I wonder if trans women like Jazz are able to enjoy sex after being hormonally suppressed at such a young age. I know this is about sexual matters and while it is sensitive and does not pertain to me, for many trans women who transitioned so young, would they feel any positive sensation during penetration? Would they have a healthy libido and ability to orgasm? Will they be able to have a healthy sex life?"

It does however seem to me that basically doubling the supply of labor must make each laborer less valuable based on the law of supply and demand. I don't see how it could be a coincidence that the 1970s, the decade when women really got into the workforce alongside men en-mass, was also the decade wages started stagnating. It also doesn't seem like a coincidence that a middle class life was achievable on one ordinary income before this shift but now requires two incomes.

I posted this last night but fell asleep and didn’t respond to comments in time so it was removed. 

I have seen this in quite a few places and I think it’s wrong to continue to perpetuate. 

Voting for a third-party candidate reflects diverse ideologies and unique individual values. 

It signals a demand for more political choices, challenging the dominance of major parties. 

Attributing third-party votes to benefiting one major party oversimplifies complex voter motivations, often driven by dissatisfaction with the existing political landscape. 

The winner-takes-all perception doesn't fully capture voter intent, which can be a strategic call for broader representation. 

Ultimately, supporting third parties contributes to breaking the duopoly we have and is fostering a more representative democracy."
876,2023-12-09,"CMV: The criticism of Hitler's paintings as ""ugly"" is not based off of the quality of Hitler's art itself, but rather, the critics' dislike of Hitler as a person.",u/SteadfastEnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18enrh2/cmv_the_criticism_of_hitlers_paintings_as_ugly_is/,changemyview,"You would be hard pressed to find a single art critic who holds a neutral or positive view of Adolf Hitler's paintings; they near-unanimously criticize his paintings as *ugly, lacking talent, lacking merit,* etc.

Now, whether one likes Hitler's paintings or not is entirely subjective (you can Google them for yourself and see what you think of them. Most of them are sketches or paintings of buildings, architecture, mountains, scenery, etc.) But I can't help but suspect that the real reason Hitler's art is criticized so heavily by art critics is because they are afraid of the political consequences of saying anything remotely positive about it, especially in the era of social media and cancel culture.

To put it another way, if, say, Barack Obama, Greta Thunberg or Martin Luther King Jr. had painted those **exact same** paintings - or if you showed Hitler's paintings to some art critic without that critic knowing who the painter was - I strongly suspect those same art critics would either hold a neutral/noncritical view or be praising the paintings/sketches as *artistic, beautiful, well-drawn,* etc.

1,2023-12-09,CMV: Having Children in the U.S. is Unethical,u/stinkpot_jamjar,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18enyv3/cmv_having_children_in_the_us_is_unethical/,changemyview,"Two things before I start:

1. I specifically said U.S. because that is where I live and the culture I’m most familiar with.

2. While I believe, at the moment, that having children is unethical, I also believe that regulating anyone’s ability to reproduce is unethical and almost always reeks of eugenics. I do not support state or federal restrictions on reproduction based on identity, disability status, or any other form of social difference.

3. My reasoning does not include arguments about “over population,” as that is largely a myth that is used to justify and normalize a scarcity and competition-based economic model where actually-abundant resources are distributed unevenly. There is enough food for everyone. It’s just not being divvied up fairly. 

Here goes:

I am a 35 year-old woman who is questioning the ethics of having children. 

My first reason for leaning towards the belief that having children is unethical is due to the social and political climate. In the U.S., that means persistent social and economic inequality, staggeringly high cost of living, political instability that looks a lot like the early stages of fascism on paper, gun violence and the rise of school shootings, for-profit healthcare and unequal access to education & so on.

Next would be the literal climate. By all scientific accounts I am familiar with, climate change is going to significantly reduce the quality of life for everyone except the ultra wealthy. My 10 year-old and 13 year-old nieces struggle with climate anxiety and it’s so sad and frustrating to see.

After that is the philosophical reality that creating sentient beings without their consent when you know they will suffer is morally dubious. “Wanting children” is not a sufficient justification for bringing a human into the world. Wanting “your own” child, when that refers to biological relatedness, is not a sufficient justification for bringing a human into the world, *especially given the sheer amount of unwanted &/or adoptable children and teenagers that already exist*

Penultimate point is that of technological “progress,” social media, surveillance, and AI. While understandably skeptical that my fear of the effects of these things is partially due to my age and the existential crisis of cultural change that comes with aging, I do think that there are objective troubling consequences, seen and unforeseen, to our “because we can we should” approach to technology and it’s implementation. First of all, I’ve seen Terminator lol. Second of all, I see the negative effects of unfettered access to information via social media that haven’t been and can’t be reasonably mitigated by tech literacy like misinformation and the “post truth” turn, doom scrolling and witnessing the suffering and destruction of others with no social or political context in which to alleviate it, the punishing and unrealistic beauty standards propagated on TikTok and IG, and more.

Finally is the issue of genetic inheritance and mental illness, &c. I come from a family with significant mental health issues, and I myself struggled with a substance use disorder (clean since 10/3/12 luckily), and am still struggling with an eating disorder as well as other psychiatric diagnoses.

Knowing as I do the heritability of these things, and knowing as I do that while it’s not nature *versus* nurture, it’s nature *and* nurture, the risk of consciously or subconsciously passing on psychological or psychiatric problems gives me significant pause. 

Please help me understand what you think are *good* reasons for having children and why it’s *ethical* to do so knowing what we know about life and society."
228,2023-12-09,CMV: Major League Baseball is ruined by having no salary cap,u/BearsGotKhalilMack,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18eomn4/cmv_major_league_baseball_is_ruined_by_having_no/,changemyview,"To those who aren't sports fans, in most leagues, every team basically has a certain amount of money they're allowed to pay players, with huge fines on owners if they overspend. The idea of the salary cap is to support what's known as parity; the idea of a fair and balanced league where every team is at least relatively competitive. Parity is needed in sports so that the games are worth watching, and bad teams aren't doomed to always stay bad while the rich get richer. Parity makes it so that winners are truly decided by coaches, players, and what they can accomplish on an even playing field. 

Enter the MLB. Whereas most sports have a salary cap, the MLB does not. There is a tax for spending more, sure, but that hasn't stopped the richest owners in the league from simply eating that fine in order to pay better players. As it stands right now, the New York Mets spend $350 million a year on their players, while the Oakland As spend only $56 million. Whenever there's a mega talented player, you can usually assume that they'll sign with an already-loaded team, and still get paid more than if they went to a relatively poor team. The outrageous differences in these team salaries furthermore make it so that you can easily predict who will be the top teams each year. No sense in rooting for a bottom-feeder team when the team they'll need to beat pays 9x more money for better players. 

Basically, not having a salary cap is stupid and bad. It ruins parity in the league, makes certain teams rigged to win from the start, and highlights a big flaw that I have with the MLB."

I am under the impression that this is an open debate subreddit for changing minds no matter how controversial the topic - per the sidebar. 

Homosexuality fits the contagion model. 

Not the usual “social” contagion model, but a physical contagion model. Obviously kids who learn about homosexuality don’t magically turn gay, but childhood exposure to the nature of homosexuality does, then often this behavior is repeated. 

According to a [review](https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/homosexual-molestation-childrensexual-interaction-teacher-and-pupil) conducted upon 19 different studies, it is found that “Those who practice homosexual acts are **at least 12 times more apt to molest a child sexually**” and “teachers who practice homosexual acts are between **90 to 100 times more apt to involve themselves sexually with pupils**”. 

Although I recognize that this review (and the aforementioned studies) are nearly 40 years old, I have ran my own study. I did this as many studies outright give different conclusions for a number of different reasons.

I created a Grindr account with the intention of blackmailing pedophiles for money. I used pictures of myself when I was (very obviously) age 13 and informed predators that my parents said it was alright for me to experiment with my sexuality. 

Unfortunately, there were so many predators - not simply in volume, but demographically- ***43.6% of homosexual men on Grindr who viewed the profile of a 13 year old boy attempted to hook up with him.*** It worked so well that my initial attempt to get some side cash failed, as I was getting too many messages to keep up with. Within the span of an hour or two I had roughly 100 something men trying to fuck a 13 year old boy. 

As to the causation of homosexuality, apx. 46% of male homosexuals report being molested. I’d like to type more but iOS reddit is buggy as hell."

1,2023-12-09,CMV: Biden is highly unlikely to win a re-election,u/AdeptPrinciples,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18eqt93/cmv_biden_is_highly_unlikely_to_win_a_reelection/,changemyview,"
Preamble: I will be assuming his matchup is Trump. I’ll argue why Biden will probably lose then I’ll address anticipated counter arguments. I will establish by “highly unlikely”, I mean less than 35% chance which is highly unlikely by the standards of the nominee of a major party.

**My Arguments**

First let’s establish the pedantic point that Biden has a higher chance than any President of the past 50 years of simply dying before he even gets there. I’m not saying that’s a probability or likelihood, but it does add to the likelihood of him not winning re-election of course. 

When it comes to policy and everything else, I am going to try to argue based on perception and trends in electoral politics. The point here who isn’t the better option morally or otherwise, but how the electorate perceives matters or will perceive things come election time. 

Economic polling is terrible and that bodes ill because presidential election winners always poll better on the economy.  Traditional markers of economic health are high according to some. I’ve noticed a sea change in the media where they do not talk about an incoming recession to the same extent. Maybe they’re right, maybe they’re not. It does not matter. Biden’s economic polling is in the toilet and I do not see meaningful momentum to mitigate it regardless of what the graphs or job reports say. Some Democratic talking heads seem to want to bully people into liking the economy. Regardless of whether or not they are correct, I cannot believe that will be effective. Even if wages are increasing, inflation is cooling, I highly doubt those changes will pick up fast enough to help Joe out come Election Day. 

He is quite old. You can say Trump is only a few years younger and you would be right. You can say Trump has brain farts or seems to be losing it and you may be right. However, the age problem just does not drag him anywhere near to the same extent. Trump’s strange appearance and manic energy serve as an effective makeup to cover how old he actually is. But it is a broadly shared sentiment that Biden is too old. Most in his party do not want him to run. If the age question is in the air at all for 2024, it will hurt Biden more. Period. 

Biden has 2 unpopular foreign policy episodes under his belt. He never recovered his popularity after Afghanistan. How he’s handling Gaza, regardless of whether he is right or not or if the situation is fundamentally unfair, is hurting him. This is hurting his popularity the most within his own party, including and especially demographics that the democrats put in their column: Muslims, young people, etc. It’s worth noting that the voting age Muslim population in Michigan, Georgia, and other swing states is considerably more than his margin of victory in 2020. You can say Trump’s policies would anger and upset these people more and you may be right. But you cannot run a purely negative campaign and there’s a limit to the “lesser of 2 evils” you can run. 

Arguments that Trump would be just as bad on issue X or even worse are almost always made from those who are determined to vote Democratic no matter what. I am in that demographic myself and I can admit that it’s fully cope. Candidates, democratic ones especially, need enthusiasm. Biden’s approval is in the toilet with the young, Muslims, black people, and Latinos. 

Lastly, third parties are more likely to draw from Biden than Trump. Third parties disproportionately eat out of incumbent support. I do not know how well RFK Jr will do, but I believe he will eat more from Biden than Trump. Republicans voters are more enthusiastic and loyal to their candidate. Some recent polls have shown more support for RFK among Trump voters, but the right wing media machine has turned on him now and they will make clear that RFK is closer to a democratic than republicans on most issues. His medical and vaccine positions are the one exception but COVID issues have lost a lot of salience and will continue to do so. I doubt Cornel West, the Green Party, No-Labels, etc will do especially well but every vote counts in swing states and they will draw mostly from Biden. 


**Anticipated Counter Arguments**

*“2022 was supposed to be a red wave and the GOP has not been doing well in elections since”*

That is true. However, we must remember that Biden and the Democratic Party are not the same entity. The problem is not with democratic policies per se (except in Gaza and a couple other cases). The democrats over-performed in spite of Biden. Senate candidates, governors, etc mentioned Biden and had him campaigning with them as little as possible and that was on purpose. 

Furthermore, Democrats are now the party of high propensity voters. They are growing in the suburbs and among the college educated and those in both columns. Those are the people most likely to vote in these elections. They are most likely to be outraged over threats to democracy that Republicans pose (or at least they think they pose, again I’m trying not to be partisan or get into the weeds here). Midterms and special elections are often very different beasts from generals. Obama won twice in convincing fashion. It did not stop the democrats from getting annihilated on the congressional and state level. I think this dynamic is happening in reverse with Biden and I foresee that going into 2024

*”Trump is facing criminal charges”*

True, but none of these indictments have stopped him from gaining in the polls. His cases are public knowledge and everyone remembers J6. Yet Trump continues to lead in most polls. I will concede that a conviction or imprisonment would severely hurt Trump’s chances, but that is a big If. Furthermore, if Trump is out of commission then the GOP will replace him with a more general election viable candidate who will definitely crush Biden. Haley is the only one on the GOP debate stage that has gotten any momentum in recent months and donors are flocking away from DeSantis to her. So it would most likely be her and I cannot imagine a situation where Joe beats her if she somehow becomes the nominee. 

*”Biden has the incumbency advantage”*

Incumbency is null, if not a disadvantage, when the economy is poor. HW lost with a mild recession while incumbent and his approvals never were as bad as Biden’s. You can argue that the US economy is doing strong, but most don’t feel that way and I highly doubt there will be a turn around soon. 

*”Dobbs”*

I will admit, if anything will save Joe, it’s abortion or Trump being imprisoned (or crying and audibly shitting himself on the witness stand for the entire nation to see). 

However, Trump has already backpedaled on this issue. He’s recognized it as a mistake and even though Dobbs is a result of his actions, it’s uncertain if the electorate will see him as a Christian zealot the way they see Pence or other Republicans. 

That’s it. CMV"

Disney movies with gay characters or queer couples aren’t any more “inappropriate” or less child-friendly than straight characters and couples just so long as both don’t go beyond kissing. First-term abortion is objectively *not* murder because the fetus at that point in time is scientifically not alive by *any* definition of the term seeing as how it’s not a fully formed organism and doesn’t even have half of it’s organs yet - it’s less alive than even an amoeba cell and surely no one sane would object to the “murder” of that would they?

The “Don’t Say Gay” bill and the overturning of Roe vs Wade aren’t based on any factual or universal scientific evidence, it’s not any more damaging to little kids to expose them to chaste LGBT content than to straight content, there is literally no meaningful difference between the two if we define “inappropriate for younger audiences” to mean sexually explicit or suggestive content and/or graphic violence. A fetus is not scientifically alive until it’s a fully formed organism with all it’s organs intact and that only happens at the 5 tor 6 month mark, therefore conservatives attempts at pushing the censorship of queer kids romance and outlawing of abortion altogether on the general public is not founded on the universal values of not exposing kids to inappropriate content they can’t handle or being against murder, but their own *religious* beliefs on what constitutes “inappropriate subject matters” or “murder.” It is attempting to push their religion on the general American public and that’s not okay because it’s in direct violation of the First Amendment.

We already have objective criteria in place based on science for what constitutes as “not suitable for general audiences” and “the definition of a living organism/murder,” once you go beyond that and try to change those standards you’re entering into religious territory and the First Amendment is freedom for religion *and* from religion. You can believe whatever you want to believe regarding the “wrongness” of homosexuality and how it shouldn’t be taught to children or that life starts at conception in the privacy of your own home, what you have no right to is *enforcing* those beliefs onto the general public."

I could understand if a Kindle is priced below ₹5,000, but when Kindle prices surpass ₹13,000, ₹17,000, ₹21,000, and ₹28,000, it seems crazy to me. It's just marketing, man. If you already own a tablet or iPad, there's no need to buy a Kindle.

Some might argue that it's easier on the eyes, but I believe not buying it is a mercy to your pocket. Simply lower your tablet/iPad brightness and turn on monochrome settings to simulate a color space, making it easier on your eyes.

If Kindle were a more affordable alternative for students to study books, then I could get behind the idea. However, even the cheapest Kindle in India costs ₹9,999, while the Samsung A7 tab is priced at ₹9,499, which I believe is a hundred times better than Kindle based on utility. This is what happens when we create a society that values pretentiousness over utility. No Kindle should cost over ₹5,000; that should be the maximum cap."

Recently, I was in a very large second hand bookshop. I went to the ""mysticism"" section, and out of curiosity took a dusty book with no name on the cover from a back shelf. I recently finished reading all of it. Its name is apparently ""The Haunted Mind"" by Hungarian writer Nandor Fodor, a beginning of the 20th century ""Parapsycologist"" - an investigator of the paranormal through the use of Psycology. This was a very interesting read, because like myself, he was a skeptic. He travelled around the world, and even met with Freud. He was also once a head of the London Institute of ""Psychical Research"". In the book, he just shares his experiences with Mediums, alleged Ghost stories and more paranormal phenomena. In some cases, he proves that it was fraud. In others, he actually can't, and he never rules out the possibility that they could be real.

Despite being an extremely scientific person, she refuses to use it. I've always sneered at that fact, and told her I am SO certain God or paranormal don't exist, that I can do 100s of Ouija boards and nothing will happen. And EVEN if something will, who says it will be malicious or bad? Who said spirits ALWAYS have ""bad intent""? How did she reach that assumption? Horror movies?  
\---  
We've recently passed near a ""Tarot/Psychic Readings"" shop on our way home. My partner wanted to stop there and get a tarot reading. I decided I also wanted to get one.  
The reader told us both some generic statements, and also some extremely particular statements about our futures, almost all of them though were positive and fortunate in nature.  
At some point my partner left to do something, and I was left alone with the reader. She told me that I have a lot of ""dark energy"" and sadness, that differs from the dark energy my partner has, and that she can offer me a ""cleansing ritual"", which takes about 9 days, in order to make it disappear. It would be a 2-part ritual, a week apart between sessions.  
As still being influenced by the book, I decided to agree to it with an open mind - as in an agnostic approach. For the first time in my life, I am actually going into something that completely opposes everything I thought I believed in. To makes things worse, I feel super guilty about actually spending money (and not a small amount) on it in the first place. I am still conflicted about the validity of such an act. I doubt any normal person could actually walk into a such a reading/cleansing, and say ""nope, I'm not spiritual and I do not an inner world"" or ""nope, I am extremely happy, I literally have 0 problems and 0 self doubt"". Everyone doubts, everyone has highs and lows, so what makes the statements of this reader any truer to me than to anyone else?

I want you to try to persuade me into believing that I cannot have a one-sided opinion on the lack of existence of ""mystical things"" only on the account of them being ""absurd""."

Palestinians overwhelmingly support Israel simply not existing anymore. Palestinians as a whole are not “Pro-Two State”. For some weird reason I can’t explain, this is not obvious to the far left and far right wing Americans who somehow agree on being pro-Palestine. 

If tomorrow everything pro-Palestine Americans got what they wanted and Israel withdrew all troops. There’s an almost zero chance another Pro-One State Palestine offensive that resulted in 1,200 israel non armed citizens being murdered would not happen again. And for some reason, disconnected pro-Palestinian Americans would have surprised pikachu faces when that inevitably would happen.

Being Pro-Palestine will not stop these constant genocides happening against both Israel and Palestine. It’s simply only supporting what’s viewed as the weaker genocidal faction. Which is silly considering Iran/Yemen/Lebanon/basically every Muslim Middle East country is waiting in the wings till the USA isn’t looking to aid Hamas in not only equipment/money, but their physical troops as well.

As far as what the USA has specifically done by supporting Israel, what other choice was there. Our government intelligence knew prior to October 7th that the singular non-Muslim state in the Middle East had multiple countries banding together and supporting Hamas, and were combat ready to join Hamas against Israel. The USA genuinely speaking had 2 choices. Watch Hamas and multiple other straight up countries and proxy-fighter Muslim  countries commit genocide against Israel, and wipe Israel off the map, or park aircraft carriers next to Israel to deter that from happening, and try and diplomatically force Israel to not genocide Palestine as much as they can. Obviously, like every American should, I too also wish they were doing a better job at that 2nd step too.

To say that the USA should not have parked an aircraft carrier to deter neighboring countries from invading Israel is legitimately pro genocide of Israel citizens. There’s really no other way around that."

They were generally super left wing and authoritarian(as in if you don't agree, leave or be harassed).

4chan is where all of the people who hated Tumblr congregated and started a hate campaign against all of the stuff that was very ubiquitous on Tumblr. They were generally libertarian and either right wing or centrist.

I spent a lot of time on both from the ages of 12-16 and loved my time on both. I never bought into neogenders or otherkin(which was seen as equally real to neogenders and trans on early Tumblr) but a lot of the people I was interacting with definitely did. I felt like I was very rare as a lefty on 4chan but I loved the offensiveness of the platform.

When Tumblr chose to ban porn all of these left wing activists that had created new language to describe the world from their left wing ideology went to twitter and started interacting with journalists and people in power. This led to the spread of this Tumblr ideology in the real world.

The people of 4chan started creating memes that were against this Tumblr ideology (even starting some wars against tumblr) and that led to the rise of the online right wing and the rise of trump. 4chan is open to anyone from any side but generally they are purposely offensive for the purpose of upsetting people who are easily offended.

So yeah I believe that the current culture war is almost entirely 4chan Vs Tumblr ideologies. Most people involved in the culture war have no idea that their ideologies were created by these two websites."

1,2023-12-10,cmv: We as humans have no autonomy over our own lives.,u/Mockington6,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18f1ror/cmv_we_as_humans_have_no_autonomy_over_our_own/,changemyview,"Here's a thought that has been cropping up over and over in my brain lately, I'm interested in seeing what others have to say about it. Here's how it goes:

While we may think that we are able to freely make decisions, and determine the course of our lives, in truth we have no control over that.  
That is because, every decision we make, no matter how conscious, can ultimately be led back to factors which we had no control over.

Here some examples to illustrate:  
We may choose to follow our passion in our lives, for example to become a singer because we love music, and to us it may seem like thereby we choose to do the thing we love. But actually, why would we love music so much that we want to make it our carreer? Ask anyone why they are passionate about the thing they are passionate about, and I don't thing anyone will tell you that they just decided to do so. We may be passionate about music because we had an experience in our childhood that inspired us to go down that path, it may be because we connect it to certain memories, and because we are genetically inclined to have a knack for it.  
Or, if an addict chooses to get help and try to beat it. Why do they decide to that? Either because it is hurtung them in some form, or because it is hurting someone else, not because they want to change for the pure sake of itself. And if someone decides not to do something about their addiction, even if it hurts them or someone else, that is because they did not have experiences in their past, that make them care enough about such things. Care for oneself and or others needs to either be ingrained from birthed, or be teached at some point. If neither of those things happened, and therefore it is not in their capacity to fight to beat addiction, that is not because they are fault, but because they just did not happen to have such experiences. And if someone does have the capacity to fight addiction, that is not because they actively decided to have that, but because they happened to have had experiences which made them develope it. Anyone would stop themselves or others from hurting, if they had the mental capacity to do so, some people just don't.  
And even if it is not about helping yourself but accepting help from others, the same logic applies. To accept that help, they would need some reason that ultimately is out of their own control, if not, no one would bother.

Obviously you could come up with any kind of internal reason like ""They want to have a better life"" or whatever, but even then, the question can be asked, why they want a better life. Because they have seen the success of others and want to replicate it? Sure. But what makes them want to replicate that success? Or maybe they want a better life because they aren't happy with their current one, in which case you can do the same thing, and ask why they aren't happy with that. And you can keep asking such questions, until you inevitablyend up at some circumstance that was outside of that person's control, and that methodoly can be applied to any action we take, which makes me conclude that in reality we do not have control over our lives, but are purely made to make the decisions we make by outside factors.

So far at least. I hope I have explained my point well so everyone understands it, but if clarification is needed I will of course give it. And of course I would be happy to hear any thoughts which might refute my hypothesis.

And just to clarify, the question whether the hypothetical fact, that all we do is decided by outside factors, is good or bad, is not part of that same hypothesis. While I do have my own feelings about it, someone might just as well not care if it is true, and enjoy their life nonetheless, and that is completely valid to me."

From time to time I kill time by watching shorts on YouTube. Lately I've come across a lot of anti-abortion content. This is usually done by preachers, who most often say that a homosapien embryo is a homosapien and killing a homosapien is an objectively bad action (there is no need to explain that since a person believes in God, he is a moral realist(correct me if I’m wrong)). Since I am a nominalist, I think that the homosapiens argument is not something solid, because (yes, maybe someone might take this to mean that I am a disgusting person) I don’t think that anything without a brain can be considered a person. But still, I’m interested in another point in the thoughts of these preachers and the people who argue with them, I don’t understand why I haven’t come across a situation where these preachers were asked the question that I’m going to ask in this post. Perhaps one of you will point out where exactly I am wrong. 

The point is that if morality is objective (for now let’s ignore the fact that even if it is objective, and there are moral laws, you can always simply say: so what? It turns out I’m violating a moral law huh so? (for example, the same will not happen with some physical fact - you will always break yourself if you go out the window from the 25th floor and fall on the asphalt, while you always have the possibility of killing a person even if it violates the moral law) then you probably (preachers say so) are obliged to strive to live in accordance with these moral laws. And now the most interesting part begins: we have premises: 1. if you see a child (let’s add tension since most value the lives of children most of all, it seems to me) drowning in the river and you pass by without doing anything, then you are a bad person (on an intuitive level, it seems to me that most moral realist(and all these preachers) would agree with this statement.) 2. If, by saving this child, for example, you don’t make it to work and don’t earn a certain amount of money and don’t have lunch because of this in a restaurant and don’t cook from the cheapest ingredients to feed yourself, you will do the right thing, it is intuitively obvious for me that if you do otherwise you are committing a terrible act considering the fact that you are a moral realist. 3. Living in the era of awareness, we know that every day a certain number of people die due to hunger, we know that there are a large number of different funds that help these starving people. 4. When you buy any food in a restaurant, you buy a product that is more expensive, although it may be of higher quality than the cheapest one on the market, you are actually choosing not to save a person but just to go to work. 5. You are a bad person according to your own system of objective morality which you are obliged to adhere to. What can you answer to this? What am I wrong about here, if I am wrong and how should such a question be answered, for example, by these preachers or how would you answer it? 

P.S. Of course, it is worth adding that I realize that it is not at all important who the person is who makes any statement purporting to be true or false for the fact of the truth or falsity of that statement. The fact that preachers are bad according to their own moral system cannot affect whether their statements regarding abortion are true or false with the premises they introduce according to their moral “facts.” But in any case, this can act as self-defense and a way of humbling such preachers.

P.P.S. Everything I've written can be extended to a larger number of people - most of all moral realists. But I'm interested in those who shout the most - these preachers, so the main target is them

P.P.P.S. English isn’t my native language so if you have so questions which can appear due to misunderstandings what I meant feel free to ask me and I’ll elaborate."

The ruler had/ has a child for the specific purpose of ""keeping it in the family"". While not as common in mordern times many family businesses continue the practice of procreating for prosperity. These children where/are indoctrinated via a strict education and social apparatus to become the next ruler. E.g Blue Blood private schools and getting internships at select jobs 

The average person before the 20th century usually had lots of children due to a lack of reproductive education and high infant mortality. Not to say that some didn't have kids due to social, economic and cultural practices E.g Kids to help around the farm. But overall people just had kids because the  reproduction urge is a part of being human. With various religious then adopting various reason on why you should have kids. In this view religion didn't tell people to have kids rather it tried to explain why people have kids 

However in the 1920s to 1940s this took a sinister twist under various ideologies, notably  facism and communism. People where told to have children not for personal reasons but because the state needed people. Thus human reproduction became a tool of the state to achive its goals E.g Increasing soldiers in Facist Germany or making workers in the USSR 

In the mordern time ( 21st century) most people; with the exemption of extremist parts of the world, in both developed and developing  nations have access to some type of contraception. Therefore the desire to have a child is a personal one. Resulting in new ideologies to justify why you should have a child. These mostly are focused around a particular group maintaining or gaining a numerical advantage. One in particular the reason I actully wanted to make this post; that of economics. The state is telling people have more children to create workers to maintain the economic advantage of  various nations. This not only dehumanizing to the child ( now a part in a economic process) but to the parents as their function is now just reproduce 

There are also racial elements to this as most political movements are doing this out of fear of being ""replaced"". Which means these children are born to maintain ""racial purity"" which is similar to the ideological madness of 1920s facism. 

The solution would be immigration of willing people leading to multiculturalism. Furthermore children born from love rather than an obligation may have a better home"

I am hoping that somebody can explain to me why I am incorrect

This film currently holds a 53/100 (indicated mixed to average) on Metacritic, based on 23 critic reviews. This aggregate, to me, is enough to state that it is not critically acclaimed. On a side not, it received a 66% on Rotten Tomatoes, far from 'acclaim.'  
  
Currently, I am being rapidly downvoted on Ask Reddit for saying that the Blind Side is not critically acclaimed. The main, and only counterpoint, is its Oscar recognition. Sandra Bullock won the Oscar for best actress. I do not think this is indicative of the response to the film as a whole. An actor can play a great role in a bad film. The two are mutually exclusive. It was also nominated for best motion picture, which I think is a better reason. However, I do not think that this is enough to say the movie was 'critically acclaimed.' We'd be able to call some pretty bad movies critically acclaimed if we looked at positive reviews from 1 or a couple outlets, rather than the larger aggregate.  
  
I believe I am correct, but my 100 downvotes would state otherwise. I would like for people to articulate to me why I am wrong, because currently most responses have been colorful ways of calling me an idiot. Thanks."

2,2023-12-10,CMV: The Game Awards should drop the Best Sports/Racing category,u/FMecha,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18fc97u/cmv_the_game_awards_should_drop_the_best/,changemyview,"[Opening reading,](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-best-sports-racing-category-is-an-insult-to-both-genres) and (primarily) in response to Forza Motorsport '23 being regarded as an undeserved winner of The Game Awards' Best Sports/Racing category.

---

At issue here why I thought as in the title is that sports(ball) games are generally seen as disposable; they're annual in nature with expectation you buy new ones every year - what they have to offer for the awards if they're generally the same game every year? The incentive of making sports games that does something else (e.g. extreme sports) is also generally not there either, regardless of if they're gunning for the TGA or not. 

Additionally, the state of current racing games is currently seen as stagnating (I had a CMV about the genre in the backburner after seeing [Raycevick's video about the subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVry84ACu0k) - there has been numerous copycats from parts of the racing game community too), with the games generally feeling the same both in content and types (either a GT-like, an annual motorsports title, an ultra-hardcore simracing title pandering at the tryhards, open world festival racers, or yet another quick drift game), no matter if it came from a small or major developer.

---

For reference, in 2022, the nominees were:

* GT7: Winner by default, *very rough* year one (though not as bad as Forza '23) to say the least.
* F1 22: Annual motorsports title
* FIFA 23 and NBA 2K23: Annual sportsball title
* OlliOlli World: Literal who indie title (this one is 2D skateboard game, for the record).
* The snubbing of Grid Legends was also a topic.

In 2023:

* Forza Motorsport '23: State of the game regarded as bad according to the racing game community; also regarded as a ""by default"" winner given brand recognition
* F1 23: Annual motorsports title
* EA FC 24: Annual sportsball title
* Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Flew under everyone's radar (except for those who played the first game), apart from DLC practices
* The Crew Motorfest: Mixed opinion from the racing game community - generally good I suppose, but idk if they think it should have been a deserved winner over Forza '23."

Can someone give me evidence to the fact unconditional love actually exists on a human plane?  


The common argument is a Mom-Child but I can easily refute that because the Mom only LOVES her Child because IT is HER CHILD (A condition in the sense of ancestral(or familial) attachment so no, It's not unconditional. Why would the Mother love the Child in the first place if not BECAUSE of a CONDITION.  


And with that, I've probably just pissed off everyone but can someone give me an actual example?  


Because the very idea of love without conditions destroys any chance of love existing in the first place. You can't love something without me being able to trace and attach a condition to it because in that sense, you've be able to love objective nothingness - which in itself is a paradox because to have Objective Nothingness, you would have to have Objective Lovelessness because Non-existence cannot co-exist with an Existential/Abstract Concept.  


Unconditional Love only Exists when it's From a Perfect Being (God) but I'm not here to debate that.

Monogamy stemming from romantic love is a farce. Men and women both fantasize and desire other people. It’s not really special that people stay in monogamous relationships out of loyalty, because if your partner really loves you, they’d want you to indulge your fantasies.

Further, depriving yourself of others you find attractive is an act of self-denial, not love."

Some might call it degeneracy, but how do we define degeneracy without clinging to a dogmatic religious perspective? In my view a relationship should encourage maximal happiness and minimal harm. And between consenting adults, where’s the harm in being a cuck? In fact, a man predisposed to such behavior is harming himself by not being himself. In actuality there probably should be (and would be) more self identifying cuckolds if not for the stigma attached to being one.

396,2023-12-10,"CMV: As a person on the autism spectrum, it is valid for someone to not date a person with a disability due to concerns of baggage and burnout associated with dating a person with a disability",u/Prudent-Reporter-400,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ff9s9/cmv_as_a_person_on_the_autism_spectrum_it_is/,changemyview,"So I am a man on the autism spectrum and while I never had a woman reject me because of my diagnosis, I know that there are some women who do not want to date a man with a disability *that has nothing to do with societal prejudices and biases against people with disabilities*. Now there are people on YouTube who made videos back in 2016 stating that if you are not attracted to or do not want to date a minority because of something related to their status as a member of a minority group, then you are somehow hold prejudiced views against that group of people and have implicit biases instilled from a society that doesn't fully embrace diversity and inclusion.

&#x200B;

Now while I concede that there are **some** people who never want to date a person with a disability either out of implicit biases from an ableist society or the person outright hates people with disabilities, most people who do not want to date a person with a disability do so because they do not want to be burdened with the hassle of caring for a person with a disability.

Disabilities come in all forms and can be physical, mental, or both. Being in a romantic relationship with someone means sharing your life with another person and when it comes to disability, that often means the able-bodied partner is adversely impacted by their disabled partner's disability. Some people do not want to deal with the baggage of being a partner and a caregiver for a person with a disability, or having to deal with social awkwardness, communication issues, and mental health problems. Now, there are some nice people out there who do not mind dating a person with a disability, even if it means being a caregiver and having to live with their partner's disability. 

That said, there are some SJWs (social justice warriors) who feel the need to shame people and call them ""ableist"" for not wanting to date a person with a disability. Dating is a personal choice and nobody is entitled to a date, regardless of what minority group they are part of. Being a caregiver for a person with a disability can lead to ""caregiver burnout"" and anxiety. Those are valid concerns and reasons not to date a person with a disability. I know it is not fair that some people do not want to date me because of my autism, but it's their prerogative and I would rather find someone who is fully willing to date me despite my quirks than deal with someone who is being a poor partner and is dating me out of fear of being called a bigot and being canceled on social media for having ""ableist dating preferences"".

Again, there are always haters who choose not to date people with disabilities out of outright hate, but not all people are like that. Concerns about caregiver fatigue and the time spent caring for a person with a disability is a valid point not to date a person with a disability that has no basis in ableism and bigotry."
436,2023-12-10,CMV: Afrocentrism is a growing problem that needs to be publicly addressed in the school system,u/quinnbyal,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ffduw/cmv_afrocentrism_is_a_growing_problem_that_needs/,changemyview,"Particularly African-Americans, I’m seeing this start to pop up all over my social media and real life. I understand where African-Americans come from when they say they weren’t taught about African history, empires, and world changing events, so they feel left behind when compared to how other societies and empires are taught in America; particularly Britain, Rome, Greece, China, Egypt, and the Aztecs even, but this Afrocentrist idea of “they were all black before the modern people invaded and stole from our black ancestors” is becoming increasingly problematic social media issue and seeping over into real life. 

This all may seem out of the blue but as an Italian man, I’ve been seeing that “the original Italians were black” popping up across my feed, after seeing countless “the Greeks were black”, “the Egyptians were black”, “the Chinese were black”, “native Americans were black”. 

After getting into the classic instagram comment argument, the common argument is that, at least for European people and societies like the Greeks, Italians, and even the British; claiming that since Western Hunter Gatherers were darker skinned people than modern European populations, that these African-Americans can claim these people and societies as their own despite not being genetically, linguistically, culturally, historically related to them in anyway.

To sum it up. I think that this needs to be addressed either by better education on who these people, societies, and empires were and their modern descendants, and that sub-Saharan societies, people, and empires need to be better taught in the American educational system to combat against “claiming the next best thing as our own since we don’t know our own”. I was called racist by countless people for my argument about this but I do not believe that a people completely unrelated to my country and my culture can claim my country, my culture, and my history."

1,2023-12-10,CMV: I think my ESE social skills teacher from middle school did a good job at helping students with autism like me to adjust to society.,u/Prudent-Reporter-400,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18fg6yw/cmv_i_think_my_ese_social_skills_teacher_from/,changemyview,"So in middle school, I was placed in a special ESE or Exceptional Student Education course where for three years I had to learn social skills in a class session with 7 or 8 other students on the autism spectrum. In class we had ""Problem Solving Journal Entries"" where have to write down in our class notebook about how to properly handle a complex or difficult social situation. We then verbally share our journal entries. In addition, we would often go to field trips as an attempt by the ESE teacher to get us students to socialize with each other as well as to learn life skills. But there were some things that I noticed that may be controversial nowadays. 

&#x200B;

First, when it came to managing autism through learning social skills, my ESE teacher told us that ""neurotypical students learn social skills as second nature, whereas many children and teens with autism require manual intervention to learn social skills"". Also, when I was in the class back in 2007, the teacher occasionally played videos from Autism Speaks, a disability advocacy organization that has garnered controversy in the past due to various things, mainly placing ads about how ""autism is a burden"", and ""to find a cure for autism"". Many autistic people on Reddit and many of the autism subreddits dislike Autism Speaks and instead support the Autistic Self Advocacy Network or ASAN. I think it was an issue with the times and many special educators and therapists who see clients on the autism spectrum now know this is in 2023 and if they are aware of the controversy, avoid talking about Autism Speaks.

&#x200B;

Then we had to learn what was ""socially acceptable behavior"" and that some of the students in my middle school ""Social/Personal"" class engaged in behaviors that were ""unexpected"" such as a student having an obsession with Nintendo characters, a student flapping their arms, and another student making exaggerations all the time in class. The times where the ESE teacher called out some of our behaviors as ""unexpected"" may rub some people with autism the wrong way due to concerns of ""policing behavior"" or ""pressuring teens with autism to socialize, mask their autism symptoms, and ""pass"" as neurotypical. The next annoying thing is that in most cases in class, the teacher talked a lot about autism and it annoyed my mom because she did not want me (her son) to obsess or focus on their disability, race, gender, or sexual identity as the most important part of who you are. I know that there are some minorities out there who really get into the identity politics spiel and talk so much about their identity when it comes to race, gender, sexuality, and disability. I personally wanted people to treat me normally and not focus too much on my autism diagnosis, but in the Social/Personal class in most cases, most of what the ESE teacher taught about was about autism, how to manage it, and the teacher even got us the students to read books and watch movies in class about people with Autism such as *Temple Grandin*, *Mozart and The Whale*, and *Look Me In The Eye.* 

&#x200B;

Honestly, the most I have heard and learned about autism outside of my occupational and speech therapy sessions in 1st grade was in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade in that ESE class. Now, if someone with autism wants to center their whole identity to their diagnosis and eat, breathe, and sleep autism representation and advocacy, be my guest, but I just want to function normally in society, contribute back to society, and succeed. I honestly do not see the point in those social skills classes."

**Why I think so?**

1) **Corruption**
   - Deeply ingrained corruption cripples progress.
   - Almost feels like corruption is second nature in India.

2) **Religious Tensions**
   - Often exploited for political gain, causing instability.
   - Politics revolving around Hindu-Muslim issues rather than development, transparency, and accountability.

3) **Primary Education (Up to 12th Std)**
   - pathetic and dilapidated conditions govt schools & colleges are in. 

4) **Poor Quality of Politicians**
   - Lack of qualified and visionary leaders.
   - I'm honestly tired of hearing about Hindu-Muslim Masjid Mandir, Pakistan, and all this.
   - No accountability & transparency.

5) **Compromised Institutions (Non-Independent)**
   - Investigative agencies dancing to the tune of the ruling party (CBI, ED, IT, etc.,) doesn't ensure accountability & transparency.
   - They fail to keep frauds, corruption, and malpractices in check.

6) **Growing Population**
   - Rapid population growth strains resources.
   - Adds pressure on job creation and infrastructure.

7) **Job Opportunities**
   - Employment challenges due to population growth.
   - Need for sustainable job creation strategies.

8) **Bureaucracy and Red Tape**
   - Complex and bureaucratic procedures.

9) **Slow Judiciary (Justice Delayed is Justice Denied as we all know)**
   - Overburdened and slow legal system.
   - Delays justice and hinders business operations.
   - Again leads to accountability problems.

10) **Brain Drain Problem** because of some of the above-mentioned issues

11) **Spineless Mainstream Media** - Doesnt speak truth to power,expose shortcomings,criticise and ensure accountability from elected representatives.


If I had to choose one reason out of all these, I think it is religion and religious extremism that hurts the country the most. Especially those poor and uneducated/illiterate people."

Lazy can mean the number of different things: When it means tired, that is something that can be addressed. Other times people are ""lazy"" because they are in fact depressed. This has a completely different solution than simply being tired. So in this case the word ""lazy"" is just not specific. Other times, the word lazy is used to refer to people who are in fact overworked. In these circumstances, it is often employers in corporations who are trying to manipulate the workforce and the word lazy is a scapegoat for them. Lastly, sometimes the word ""lazy"" refers to people who are just truly unmotivated. For these people, I still don't see how a pejorative will help them in any way.

While Egypt is not responsible for Israel's actions, and only has limited if any influence on Israel, Egypt is responsible for their own actions. Egypt is the only country besides Israel to border the Gaza Strip, and supposedly cares about Palestinians. 

Letting Palestinians leave would (and would have) saved many lives and make the provision of basic water/food aid actually feasible. 

Some seem to object to this on the idea that it helps Israel commit ethnic cleansing. Palestinians are very aware of the possibility of ethnic cleansing, given the Nabka and Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Many people living in Gaza are refugees from the Nabka or their children/grandchildren. If they leave in fear for their lives, it's not like they aren't aware of the risk not being able to return. Some will want to flee, and some will want to stay. But those who want to flee can't, because Egypt kept its border completely closed.

The choice of whether or not to risk your life to protect your home should be a choice made by the people actually at risk of death and of losing their homes, not by foreign governments or anyone else. 

While the unwillingness to help refugees isn't unique to Egypt, it is still an immoral thing. And in this particular instance Egypt has a border with the Gaza Strip unlike any other country not currently invading the Gaza. "

Admittedly, I didn't have the courage to ask at the time why she is like this, largely because it isn't my business, but this just isn't exactly normal in my viewpoint. I always have embraced the mentality of having diplomatic relationships with those who you don't necessarily want in your life, because what is the good in burning bridges with those who have done no harm to you? I will define severing ties or burning bridges as essentially removing someone from your life and treating them as someone you don't know, disregarding all the past you've had with one another. 

Flash forward many months later and she has essentially severed ties with me out of nowhere, for no reason, even though we were super close and had a great bond. I cannot understand why people do this other than the fact that they are extremely inconsiderate and are just terrible human beings.

People fail to see the human on the other side. We almost all mean well and we all have faults.

1,2023-12-10,CMV: Cost of living in the USA has a lot to do with quality of life increasing over time and credit infrastructure,u/Bigtimeknitter,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18fk0j5/cmv_cost_of_living_in_the_usa_has_a_lot_to_do/,changemyview,"I've had this thought for awhile. Please tell me what I am missing, or your additions! Thank you!

THESIS: Living in the USA is more expensive today vs the 1860s (civil war era just as a reference point) because our expectation for quality of life has improved drastically, as well as credit infrastructure. Some of these additional expenses are items you can ""opt in"" to, like say, if you really wanted you could not use the air conditioner. Others, like medical advancements and cost of construction cannot be avoided or mitigated. 

OPT IN ITEMS THAT IMPROVE OUR LIVES, BUT ARE MORE EXPENSIVE

Convenience items: Basically in say, the 1860s, in America, we didn't have plastics and disposable things for convenience (causing people to buy things with more frequency AKA more $$$). An example is I can buy a frozen dinner and then microwave it when I get home. Of course that is more expensive than buying fresh, but it saves me a lot of time.

Produce / Globalization of Food: Now we can purchase produce that is ""out of season"" which is shipped internationally, so we can have pineapples whenever. That is a benefit of living today, however, that inflates the cost because it must be transported long distances.

We Carry Around a Computer: Literally we can look up anything we need to online from a smartphone.   This is a huge benefit. Access to others and assistance at any location, as well as the net which has important maps and detailed information, is incredibly helpful.

Temperature control: Robust heating and cooling were less reliable / controllable, so people had things like transom windows. Opening windows to cool a house costs nothing, though it wouldn't always work the best to keep the house cool. Today we can keep a house cool using an AC unit, which costs more because we must use electricity to do so. Again, our quality of life is better, therefore, things are more expensive even before inflation or other financial factors like our robust credit infrastructure driving price increases related to borrowing demands. 

MANDATORY EXPENSIVE BENEFITS:

Medicine: Medicine was less effective for many diseases and was pretty rudimentary. Now, we have gotten really advanced. It logically tracks that a crazy robot surgery with no scars would be a lot more expensive than a person doing the surgery with only alcohol to numb pain a la wartime style. In the 1860s the life expectancy was almost 40. Today it is around 79. 

Construction costs and building codes: There were far fewer building-code style laws, and in some cases building materials were harmful. The addition of building codes usually increases the cost of things, because they are usually made in efforts to mitigate a safety risk and would not be elected otherwise. Therefore, things are more expensive to build and develop because they are safer.  As a result of this, I see investor capital building ""luxury"" apartments and not developing cheaper places. (I think there are other factors contributing to the expense of construction, litigation included, which are not outlined here but I would like to hear anyone's additions.)

Credit infrastructure: America's credit infrastructure allows people to borrow funds for purchases or investments. That's awesome. However when more people can buy stuff, the price goes up. Related to quality of life, that means generally if you have some credit, you will be able to get out of a pinch if you find yourself needing some additional money for a short term. This is an improvement to our lives because it leaves people less worried, and less likely to maybe go hungry because they are between paychecks and had an unexpected expense.

SUMMARY:

Today, we live like royalty compared to the 1860s. We can order food from anywhere to be delivered. We will live twice as long. **We will be incredibly safe in buildings and are unlikely to get very sick from the place we live or its furnace(s), or die in a stupid fire in that building.** Our buildings are more comfortable and kept at the perfect temperature.  We have credit and should have less worries if we need short term funds than we would in the 1860s. We can eat a pineapple out of season (I don't even know when their season is!). People are dissatisfied with the expensiveness of living today but forgetting that we are paying out the a$$ for all the above items which do improve our lives tremendously."

The planet is on fire and more and more of the Earth's resources are being plundered by our civilization at an exponentially growing, unsustainable rate, while pollution and species deaths are at their worst and the planet's [concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/) is the highest it's even been since the *Pleistocene era*. Hurricanes, floods, droughts, and other climate disasters are growing worse and longer every year and with greater frequency. 

Methane is being released into the air from underwater clathrates at alarming rates, the Greenland ice caps and West Antarctic ice sheets are melting 50 YEARS ahead of schedule, and we are on the brink of triggering self-reinforcing climate feedback loops within the next several decades, such as ocean warming, which will only accelerate the rise of Earth's average temperatures by 2C or more according to the most *conservative* estimates by the IPCC. 

We have produced so much waste and pollution as a result of industrial activity and our society of overconsumption that microplastics are beginning to be found *everywhere*, from our bodies, to the bottom of the ocean, to the air we breathe. Worse still, endocrine disrupting chemicals that have leeched into our food supplies could be responsible for the present [male fertility crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_infertility_crisis) across much of the Western world, and increasingly in other countries. 

In the last 40 years alone humanity has lost [a third of its farmable/arable land](https://www.sciencealert.com/the-world-has-lost-a-third-of-its-farmable-land-in-the-last-40-years) to soil depletion, soil infertility, and destructive farming practices--a trend that is accelerating and will create mass food insecurity for our ballooning human population in the future (oh, and we're running out of water too). Even more terrible, the Amazon Rainforest (i.e. THE LUNGS OF THE EARTH) [is about to turn into a savannah](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/05/amazon-near-tipping-point-of-switching-from-rainforest-to-savannah-study) because of rampant deforestation, forest fires, and resource exploitation-- and should this happen, it would push the Earth past one of its many tipping points, bringing its dying global ecosystems past a point of no return. 

Unless new oil reserves are found relatively soon, the IEA and some scientists have claimed we have reached the era of [""peak oil""](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230726-an-experts-guide-to-peak-oil-and-what-it-really-means) and will see irreversible declines in oil production as oil becomes more costly and difficult to extract due to the scarcity of easily accessible oil reserves, which is catastrophic for a civilization that still largely relies on fossil fuels for everything from energy to medicine and transportation (this would not be an issue if we actually transitioned to renewables or nuclear power, but there are too many entrenched political and economic interests who don't want this to occur). 

In spite of **all of the above**, humanity has utterly failed at reducing or severely curtailing its fossil fuel usage (since doing so will cause energy prices to spike and for society to crash and burn), and nobody with any actual political or economic influence is doing anything or has done anything to really improve our situation. Instead, most people either deny or ignore what's happening with the climate, or are actively making the problem worse, especially the rich elites going around on their private jets, and lying, conniving, evil, omnicidal, ecocidal fossil fuel conglomerates like ExxonMobil (whose higher ups [KNEW about the dangers of fossil fuels and climate change 40 years ago, but lied to consumers anyways with misinformation and fake scientific studies](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/)). BlackRock is also culpable, holding the assets of most of the world's fossil fuel companies, including the vast majority of the world's oil fields-- yet, despite this atrocity, nobody blinks an eye. 

And the cherry on top of all this is the absolute JOKE of an event that is COP28, which has somehow managed to be even more disappointing, ineffectual, embarrassing, and disgusting than the failure that was COP27. Not only is it being held currently in Dubai, UAE-- one of the world's largest benefactors from fossil fuels, but the Arab moron chosen to lead the entire fucking summit has **denied the existence of climate change, called environmentalists insane, and is an oil executive clearly in the pocket of the fossil fuel lobby and the petro-conglomerates, bought and paid for by oil shills to attend the event, grandstand and say a few words, then go home like all the other oldhead world leaders and do nothing.** 

**Barring some miracle or amazing discovery of free energy that will finally move us away from fossil fuels, humanity is poised to plunge itself into an ecological, environmental apocalypse of its own making. The planet is becoming UNINHABITABLE for more and more people around the world, and things will continue to worsen until all hell breaks loose in the decades ahead.**

1,2023-12-10,CMV: There is nothing immoral about feeling schadenfreude,u/soursauvignon,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18fmm07/cmv_there_is_nothing_immoral_about_feeling/,changemyview,"Schadenfreude refers to feeling pleasure from others' misfortunes. My view is that it is not morally wrong to feel schadenfreude.

The main reason is that it can never be morally wrong to feel a feeling, and only actions can be morally wrong (or right). 

* Consider for example the recent collapse of FTX, where a lot of people lost a lot of money. 
* If you felt schadenfreude at this event (perhaps because you personally dislike people in crypto), I think that you did not do anything morally wrong at all. 
* But if you took action to express that schadenfreude (like by posting gloating memes on social media) then it is possible that you did do something morally wrong (or right).

Other good examples of schadenfreude-inducing events include the Titan Sub incident, and economic collapses in certain unpopular countries. For all these events, there is nothing wrong with feeling schadenfreude.

Counter-argument 1: I have heard some people counter-argue that ""you would never admit to your friends that you are feeling schadenfreude, therefore feeling schadenfreude must be morally wrong"". This is not a good counter-argument because keeping something secret does not necessarily mean it is immoral. For example, in conservative societies, many homosexuals keep their sexual orientation a secret from their families because they fear moral judgment, even though there is nothing wrong with feeling attracted to people of the same sex. Similar reasoning goes for schadenfreude.

Counter-argument 2: I have also heard the counter-argument that ""schadenfreude tends to lead to behaviour that is non-empathetic/spiteful/etc, therefore it must be morally wrong"". This is not a good counterargument because there are many other feelings that also tend to lead to wrongful behaviour, but we do not consider the feelings themselves to be wrongful. For example, feeling anger tends to lead to violent actions, but we do not generally think that anger itself is morally wrong (only the violent action is morally wrong)."

I just want to say it's really dumb to ask non American people to name states while excluding some of them. It's similarly if someone would ask you to name 3 countries in Asia and excluding all, but Bhutan, Myanmar and East Timor.

It would, obviously, prevent more people from getting awful conditions which would probably be kinda objectively better for everyone. It would also increase adoption rates (somewhat) since instead of bringing in new kids, the ones already without a family would get one. I, honestly, don’t see it as being that shitty for the genetically disabled since there are already other people that can’t have kids anyways and in preventing the disabled from passing down their diseases, it kinda makes humanity better as a whole. My brother has this theory that because people are so coddled today, the “defects” of the human race are becoming much more prevalent, and that the many problems of today could be attributed to that; concedingly, though, that applies more so to the stupid humans rather than the genetically disabled. So I guess it might be better to cleanse stupidity (if not for the relatively enormous difficulty of such a thing). Perhaps my fears of inheritable genetic conditions are overblown and they should retain their freedom to procreate, but i only see benefits from a policy of forced sterilization. I assure you I am not some Darwinist Nazi (im a libertarian—which is contradictory but I’d be happy to explain—socialist if you can believe it) and maybe I’m just a misguided young fellow.

My knowledge is mainly centered about scientific knowledge, though I'm not a scientist either, more of an enthusiast that follows quite closely the fields of basic science (mainly physic, astronomy and in a lesser extent, biology), and engineering since two decades. That's why I come to this CMV, because I suspect there's plenty of flaws in my thinking and I'd like to understand other's(and possibly more knowledgeable) perspective on the matter.

Secondly, I think I have to define what I mean by ""Capitalism in its current form"" for clarity, because I've seen many online discussion around capitalism bog down to endless debate about definitions, which can be fascinating but may not be the point of this CMV.

Capitalism, as far as know and have been educated upon by various (non in-depth) sources has the following core principle in its current form :

* Private ownership of property and mean of productions.
* Those who do not own mean of production can earn a wage through labour, working for those who do own means of production.
* Freedom of the consumer to choose whatever they want to buy, granted they are rational agent that will choose in their own interest.
* A decentralized marketplace to set the price of goods, services and give investment opportunity : the stock market.
* Private entity can, and should, strive forward larger profit.
* Freedom of competition : private entities can compete in the market to offer lower price and/or better quality products, or innovate.

Those last three point support the following concept : the existence of the capital. The capital is different, though related, from the basic concept of currency or money that largely predate it : the capital, in a healthy capitalist economy, ***must grow***, which differentiate it from just ""the sum of money people/organization have"". If it doesn't grow, and stagnate, it fails. (I'll be honest and say this point, while important in the construction of my view, is also the one I'm not so sure to have properly grasped)

&#x200B;

Now, to my view : Capitalism, in its current form, is fundamentally unsustainable and will fail. This is not an observation based on ethical or moral principle, though to be transparent I have a lot of those with Capitalism, they are not the point of this view. I'm not even *wishing* for it to fall, because systemic collapse bring a lot of pain. This view come from the following observation :

1. Growth of the capital and wealth never has been decoupled from material consumption of goods, and I don't think it's physically possible to really decouple it since every action, every good and every service that can be sold , loaned or produced require an underlying industrial infrastructure that, as optimized in efficiency as it can be, will always produce waste. There are physical limit on how efficient a system is, and there will always be waste and a part of the material consumption that will never be re-usable.
2. Humankind become larger and larger until it will hits the stabilization population at around 11 billion human^(1), and each and every single human has larger and larger expectation about their own material comfort, that a Capitalist society pretty much succeeded to bring on large scale.
3. There is no way, in my  observation, that the material comfort brought by a capitalist society will ever be less seductive than a more sustainable, and obviously more restrictive, lifestyle. People that have already access to this comfort want to keep it^(2) and people who do not have access to it want to reach it, for good reasons. And Capitalism is the quickest and easiest way to achieve it in a short timescale, albeit a very inefficient and wasteful way to do it ; more so, its inner working encourage individual to reach maximum profit in a minimum timescale.
4. Earth is a closed system with limited resources, and most of the resources that support modern lifestyle are in smaller quantities than we suspect them to be : rare earth, certain mineral, clean water, oil (that has to be phased out for climate reason anyway), etc.
5. Therefore, from point 1, 2, 3 and 4 put together, come the conclusion that there are physical limitation that care fundamentally incompatible with capitalist unlimited growth.

Recently, Capitalism, in light of the physical limitation observed in the last half-century, has rebranded itself with a Green Capitalism coat of paint that don't do anything to address the underlying problem that unlimited growth, meaning unlimited material consumption growth, is unsustainable. I think that this point isn't much contentious when you look at Earth as an isolated system, but I've often seen the argument that there's plenty of ressources up for grab in our solar system and that we'll replace oil and wasteful product through innovation, therefore : ""don't worry, we'll make everything electric and mine asteroid and we'll be fine"".

I'm not sure if I'm overly pessimistic about that, but I for sure am under the impression that this argument rely on a naive optimism over our technological and logistical capabilities as a species.

While there are plenty of private and public endeavour to prospect the feasibility of it all, we're not there yet ; I'd say we're not even sure it's feasible in the first place. It often ignores the absolute logistical hell that represent bringing ressources from space to Earth, or manufacturing in space, in a scale large enough to sustain the world industry, and the energy (and material) cost that come with it.

The timescale of feasibility of space exploitation (which is, in my opinion, the only possible solution to keeping the material growth going) is way longer that the timescale of actual resources depletion and ecological/climate collapse that stem from the very industries that support the capitalist economy.

And this economy has grown out of this ""miracle substance"" that is oil in a way that is so deeply rooted in its very inner working that phasing out of it is not possible without a drastic cost in material comfort in short or even medium term. And mind you, I'm not necessarily talking about fossil fuel, because we certainly are doing progress in that regard (it pushes the bill to other resources, like rare earth and minerals anyway), but plastics. They are so fundamental to our way of life and the modern capitalist economy that we don't like to think about it too much ; and it's not even taking into account the plastic and microplastic pollution that is being more and more considered to be a catastrophe on a global scale in matter of health and biosphere. And there are no alternative to large scale plastic production as of now and nothing to see on the horizon, for the exception of some fringe bioplastic that are not suitable for industrial scale and poses their own set of problems AFAIK.

Those kind of hope (space exploitation, phasing out of oil quickly, keeping our level of comfort while not depleting resource or hitting planetary limit) rely on the belief that the century and a half of incredible growth we had as a species is the norm, not the exception. That innovation will, inevitably, find a solution, when there is no indication that it's a rule of existence rather than an incredible bubble of history we've been lucky to live through. That consumers will find reason in being less consumerist and producer will see the light and accept not producing as much waste in research of greater profit at any cost, despite the fact that both have every incentives to not do so.

tl;dr : In my view, Capitalism, as an economic model, is not compatible with scarcity both in its systemic inner-working and in its cultural norm, and scarcity is on the horizon.  Therefore, capitalism is becoming obsolete and will fall (albeit a slow death I suppose) when it cannot sustain its own growth anymore. We should acknowledge that and prepare (not in the bullsh\*it survivalist way mind you, but as a society, and civilization), to lesser the suffering that come from a collapse of an economical system that has become one of the central pillar of our civilization ; either by thinking of some alternative (and, for anyone wondering : no, I don't think it's communism, not by a long shot) or some deep transformation of capitalism that make it fundamentally sustainable on long term... but would it still be capitalism, then?

^(1:This is not an anti-overpopulation trojan, I have no fundamental problem with the Earth being inhabited by 11 billion people, or more. It's just an observation.)

^(2: It's not a critic or a shame, I myself live in material comfort I'm not ready to give and I perfectly understand people who don't want to lose any.)"
1,2023-12-11,CMV: Young men should focus on themselves instead of giving attention to young women.,u/primalvigoni,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ft0y6/cmv_young_men_should_focus_on_themselves_instead/,changemyview,"NOTE: This CMV is based on observations of social dynamics, *so not a lot of data will be presented.* The way to CMV is to explain to me about how my view on social dynamics is flawed and I’ll try my best to award deltas. 

People from older generations will come up with an argument that there is nothing wrong with young men dating in their 20’s when social dynamics have changed in the past 5 decades. 

Generally speaking, women receive more attention from the world compared to men. 
This can be argued in different ways. Such as:

- Women are more likely to get emotional support from their support systems (eg. Mental health)

- Women getting tons of matches compared to men on dating apps.

- Women getting tons of likes on social media. 

- Women are more likely to get support after being victims of crime compared to men, *where usually people just brush it off.* **Examples such as how male victims of sexual assault would be dismissed or told to suck it up or they are lucky they got ‘laid’, whereas women will immediately get support for being victims of crime.** 

- Women getting approached by men a lot more than men getting approached by women (this shows that women are likely to be more receptive of **positive attention** compared to giving attention to men) 

[Theres even a *theory* about how young girls get more attention from their parents, specifically fathers due to their manipulation’ for attention.] 

[There has been a rise in sexlessness in Gen Z](https://www.psychologytoday.com/sg/blog/the-myths-sex/202209/generation-z-is-missing-out-the-benefits-sex?amp) and more men are labelled as ‘Incels’ in very derogatory manners despite a very small number of them being **actual Incels** (like *Elliot Rodgers, who is by definition what an incel actually is since it’s such a derogatory term*) 

There are also arguments of how “why should women have sex with average men when there are better options.” 

My main argument: 

So why should young men even bother giving attention to young women when young men have become villainised by social media and by women themselves? (this includes Reddit) 

Why should young men actively pursue dating young women when we can focus on fostering an abundance mindset, working out, making more money and focusing on friends and family? Why give women any attention at all when we get none? 

In comparison, dating is *almost* pointless, as dating apps that were designed to match people, are actually just businesses that hope to make as much money as possible from desperate men. Dating apps even use cummy ways such as botting and even having their staff catfish men. (yes that’s actually a thing) 

Young men should focus on ourselves instead of showing or giving any attention to young women. Young women already get **A LOT** of attention from society, perhaps it would be better if they got less of it and they’d have less of an ego, or acting like ‘women are the prize in dating / relationships.’

3,2023-12-11,CmV: AI Usage in Learning is Detrimental to Effective Early Education,u/Andy_Razzmatazz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18fu5th/cmv_ai_usage_in_learning_is_detrimental_to/,changemyview,"I've been thinking a lot about the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in classrooms and homes, and I'm not entirely convinced that it's a positive development for effective early education. While I understand the potential benefits, I can't shake the feeling that AI might be doing more harm than good—change my view! 

Note I'm not going with an uncompromising stance with this—keyword ""Early"". I believe that AI should only be introduced to students once they have mastered the basics of learning (similar to students only starting to use calculators after mastering the basics).

  
Loss of Personalized Learning: One of the touted advantages of AI in classrooms is personalized learning experiences. However, I'm concerned that this might lead to a loss of the human touch in education. Teachers have the ability to understand and connect with students on a personal level, tailoring their approach to individual needs. AI, on the other hand, might struggle to truly understand the emotional and social aspects of a student's learning journey.  


Overreliance on Technology: With the increasing integration of AI, there's a risk of overreliance on technology. Students may become too dependent on AI tools, hindering their ability to think critically and solve problems independently. The balance between technology and traditional teaching methods needs to be carefully maintained to ensure students develop a well-rounded skill set.  


Privacy Concerns: The use of AI often involves collecting and analyzing vast amounts of student data. This raises significant privacy concerns. How can we ensure that this data is being handled responsibly and ethically? Are students and parents fully aware of the extent to which their information is being used, and do they have a say in it?  


Inequity in Access: Not all schools have the resources to implement AI technology effectively. This raises concerns about creating a digital divide between schools that can afford advanced AI tools and those that cannot. How can we address this issue and ensure that all students, regardless of their economic background, have equal access to quality education?  


Unintended Consequences: The use of AI in education might lead to unintended consequences, such as reinforcing existing biases or limiting creativity. As algorithms drive much of the decision-making process, there's a risk that diverse perspectives and unconventional thinking might be overlooked or suppressed.  
I'm open to hearing different perspectives on this matter. What am I missing? Can someone change my view and convince me that the increasing use of AI in classrooms is, in fact, a positive and necessary step for the future of education? "

3,2023-12-11,CMV: You have no right to complain about Modern triple A gaming if you're also part of the problem,u/Big-Golf4266,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18fuobp/cmv_you_have_no_right_to_complain_about_modern/,changemyview,"Time and time again i see this trend. It INFURIATES me as someone who definitely sees the triple A gaming space as a space that is decidedly going downhill. What trend? well ofcourse the trend of triple A studios releasing mediocre games people complaining, then buying the next game, then complaining some more, then buying the next one, then continuing to complain.

Triple A studios would not be able to operate this way if you simply stopped purchasing their product, but for some ungodly reason i see people constantly complaining about games like starfield for example, and then following it up with ""i hope elderscrolls 6 is good"" Like SERIOUSLY this is quite LITERALLY insane...

for reference, fallout 4 came out, i was disappointed. I havent bought a single bethesda game since, why you ask? As some political statement about triple A studios wiping their ass with consumers? well i mean they are doing that but thats not why, its because i employed a tactic called I WAIT FOR REVIEWS. You dont even have to read them, just wait to see how the game is recieved and THEN make your purchase. Its INCREDIBLY simple.

but back to the point, i mean if you wanna keep wasting your money on games that we all know are going to be disappointing, underdelivering and basically forever trapped in 2010 (this isnt just about bethesda, this is the state as i see things with pretty much any triple A studio nowadays bethesda is just an example) thats fine by me, but to continuously complain like you have some ground to stand on when you are literally the one funding this shit show? Thats crazy... if you complained about halo 4, then bought halo 5, then complained about halo 5, then bought halo infinite and are now complaining about halo infinite, then WHY in gods name did you continuously buy these products without vetting them first? 

if you want game studios to actually put some fucking effort in, they're not going to do it if they can still make buckets upon buckets of money with half the effort half the budget and half the development time... 

it baffles me that for the past 10 years at least its been the indie games pushing games forward. It shouldnt be the studios with the least money, the smallest teams and generally the hardest times that are making the most ambitious games with the most amazing stories and the greatest innovation... now i know that triple A studios are ALWAYS going to play it safe, because ultimately once you hit triple A status the people in charge of decisions are simlpy out to maximise profits which means diluting the game experience and appealing to the widest possible market, i mean thats quite clearly what happened to bethesda as can be seen when you go back through the games in reverse order and they get more and more complex and in depth. 

And im sorry to say but whilst these companies are at fault, whilst they clearly arent giving people creative freedom that NEED creative freedom, not giving developers the time they need, slashing budgets and generally rushing everything the blame also lies on the consumer, because it works. And again, im not necessarily opposed to this. I havent felt the need to buy games in the Triple A space for around a decade because indie game studios year after year have more amazing tools at their disposal to make it easier for them to produce better and better games, the problem i face is when im constantly listening to people bitch and moan about call of duty 985 being a shit game when call of duty 30-984 were also shit. Stop buying them, if it s a bad game, just dont mention it... if you stop acknowledging the game stop buying the game and just move on to better games these studios wont be able to do this forever.

based on the numbers these games get in sales followed by the number of people who play them rapidly dropping off its clear that a large number of people buying these games are hate buyers... buying the game knowing its shit just to complain about it, and thats just dumb because at the end of the day triple A studios could give 2 fucks if their game is the lowest rated game on steam, if it still made them a fuck ton of money, they're just gonna go straight to developing the next pile of shit for you to lap up."

A typical TikTok feed will have something to divide you (abortion, guns, Israel, etc) because it will send your friend/family an equal and opposite video.

3. Global warming coverage and reproduction. Constant bombardment of doom and gloom, convincing our kids NOT to have kids. Meanwhile China pumps out more waste than anywhere and has instituted a MORE kids policy 

4. Poison plastic and microplastics shipped in almost every product China sends. China bans most of our exported food because it’s so full of chemicals. 

5. Purchasing real estate. China and Chinese investors own 383,934 acres of US land. You aren’t allowed to buy any land or real estate as a non Chinese citizen. Chinese buyers comprise our largest group of foreign real estate investors 

6. Half of chinas oil imports come from the Middle East. They have deals with every us enemy country and “terrorist” regimes around the world. 

7. Breakdown of the US family and work structure. Social media says ‘Go be an independent woman with no kids. Go be a man who doesn’t work. Telling kids don’t have kids - this is the opposite of china’s focus on family and work ethic. 

8. China donates millions to our politicians, who specifically never get anything done. Chinas government rows In the same direction and has solidly since Hu Jinatao left. 

9. China has a larger influence over what Nike, Sony, and Hollywood produces than middle America does.

Many asians (including but not limited to Chinese, Vietnamese, Pakistani, Afghani, etc) should be included in affirmative action. These groups, although called the ""model minority,"" were subjected to horrible imperialistic policies, wars, slavery, and bombings for over ***300 years***. Many of these groups have horrible disadvantages and should by all rights be included in affirmative action. You can't just make a catch-all category called asians and call it a day. Many of these people, including many of my friends, have living relatives that were deeply tied with the Chinese opium trade, subject to indentured-servitude by the British Raj, used as slave labor for cash crops, and used human bodies as goods to transport across the colonies. If you are learn about history to any degree, the absolute depravity these groups suffered is just as bad as the Atlantic Slave Trade many of you learn about in school if you're American.  

In the same vein, you can't make a catch-all category called Black/African-American and call it a day. Many people of African descent who make it higher education are often of Nigerian descent, and enjoy extremely high levels of wealth and privilege throughout their entire lives. You cannot group these individials with Black-Americans or Afro-Caribbeans who have been systematically discriminated against and had their (very recent ancestors) subjected to brutal chattel-slavery. In fact, I would go even further and say there should be **an ever greater push** for Black-Americans and Afro-Caribbeans to be favored by affirmative action; often times in higher education schools pick up those of Nigerian descent over Black-Americans/Afro-Caribbeans, despite the fact the former group should not be favored by any metric due to the socio-economic privilege they enjoy. 

HOWEVER, all of this is not at all absolute and I alluded to it earlier - socioeconomic class should also be VERY considered. I'll use Nigerians as an example again. Although most Nigerian immigrants to America belong to the cream of the crop of educated people of African origin, there are Nigerian immigrants who belong to lower socio-economic classes who are abused by their countrymen as servants in the modern era, and were used as either indentured-servitude or outright slave labor in the very recent past. Clearly groups like the Igbo were holding hands with European powers and often were **active** participants in the slave trade, subjecting other ethno-groups to horrendous mistreatment. The same can be said on the basis of religion, with religious persecution of animistic faiths as one example. In all this, socio-economic class should absolutely be factored in when weighing who needs affirmative action: this extends to all other groups including asian.

In an ideal world higher education would look at race, personal history, socio-economic status, religious persecutions, and personal struggles (whether it's due to gender, sexual orientation, or other catogorizations). I guess above all else my personal gripes are that I wish affirmative action was better tailored by individual rather than the catch-all tactics we often see. The reason I'm writing this post is because there have been a number of people that told me affirmative action cannot be useful in any way and should not be brought back, and it boggles my mind to hear this when I've just listed above so many reasons ***why*** it should be used and ***how*** it should be used. Even in the ideal scenario I've conjured up, many people have told me affirmative action should still not exist. Regardless, I'm confident in my stance. Change my view."

However we have seen basically none of that.  I think taxing the rich would reduce wealth disparity, reduce inflation, and lower the deficit, and would be overall a boon to the US economy at large, and that Dems have totally failed to implement any laws to do this in spite of their promises to do just that.

I am not necessarily talking about anything like the 90% taxes like we've seen historically, or even necessarily a ""wealth"" tax.  Even something like increasing capital gains tax to match income taxes would be reasonable, and increasing the top brackets / creating new brackets for people making 10s of millions.

To clarify my points: taxing the wealthy:

A. Would reduce the deficit

B. Would reduce inflation without taxing the poor/middle class

C. Would reduce wealth disparity and many of the negative symptoms of it

D. Could be implemented in a reasonable, measured way

E. Is something the Dems have routinely promised and failed to deliver, and these days they fail to even bring up the topic

F. Fiscal policy is extremely important and the Dems are at best clowns and at worst immoral in failing to address it.

At the risk of getting away from the subject, I would also argue that many of the topics Dems focus on pale in comparison to the importance of good fiscal policy, and Dems pander with social issues instead of fixing economic issues that would have magnitudes higher benefit to the poor and middle class they claim to champion.

I would also argue Trump failed by slashing taxes during a booming economy prior to the pandemic.  The Republicans are obviously don't even pretend to want to raise taxes on the wealthy, which is why I didn't bring them up.  Although critical of the left, he intent of this post isn't to be pro-Republican, as they appear to have an even lesser chance of implementing much needed beneficial fiscal policy than the left."

I meant to make it more understandable, but it detracts from my point. Let me rephrase: If switching the demographic group makes it bigoted, then it was bigoted before the switching too. I used ""sound"" because a lot of people can instinctively recognize some forms of bigotry as bigotry but are blind to the exact same reasoning with just a different demographic group swapped in. I used ""sound"" because, these people blind to bigotry again some groups, they will think ""hey, if you switch the demographic groups, it SOUNDS like bigotry"". As a matter of fact, it IS factually bigoted in both scenarios, both before and after the switching - the ""sound"" was purely relating to the ability of people to recognize bigotry as what it is.


For context, I am a gay, black, Senegalese man. I was born and raised in Senegal, then went to university in France and now I live and work in the USA. The observations that follow have all been made in the USA or online in US-centric spaces.

I have personally witnessed a staggering number of times when someone makes a statement that, if made about women/queer folk/PoC, would be decried as abhorrent and bigoted, but since it's made towards men/straight folks/white people is considered ok, even funny and ""progressive"". There is a whole genre of ""humor"" (and multiple big subreddits dedicated to it) about mocking heterosexual people; I have seen PoCs straight up saying that the opinion of a white person is invalid purely because they are white, etc. Generally, those attitudes seem to come from an utter lack of empathy towards those demographics and every time I see it, I cannot stop thinking that the ""progressive"" people acting in this hateful and discriminatory way would themselves happily be MAGA if they weren't themselves PoCs, queer or women. It is the exact same mindset, casual cruelty and refusal to see ""the other"" as a human being that I see in the worst ""traditional bigots"", just with the demographics switched around.

To get ahead of people pointing out systemic disadvantages: Yes, I know that, in the US of A, white people have more institutional power, men are generally better paid and better considered in the workplace, and het people's human rights are largely secure compared to queer people's rights. All of that is correct. However:

- It does not excuse interpersonal hatred or discrimination. Plainly, if you are hateful towards someone you do not know purely because of their birth-assigned characteristics, you are a profoundly terrible human being, NO MATTER what systemic forces are in place. To use a fictional example that won't lead to people jumping at my throat while refusing all rational discussion: Take Scar from the anime Fullmetal Alchemist. He is a survivor from Ishval, member of a racial minority that was slaughtered by the richer Amestrians. Scar's reaction is to go on a murderous rampage during which he kills, among many others, two innocent Amestrian doctors who were healing Ishvalans on the battlefield, then he tries to murder their even-more-innocent underage daughter. Just because they have blonde hair, which is a sign of Amestrians. Scar associates the entire demographic group with evil people (due to trauma, and he has every reason to), yet his blind hatred of all Amestrians IS wrong, because there are many innocent Amestrians.

- The systemic issues present in the USA are really only present in the USA. I have lived on three different continents, including Africa. I have been told time and time again that ""white people have all the power everywhere"" and that ""there is not one place where PoC are systematically advantaged."" I am strongly convinced that those arguments are born from extreme ethnocentrism from Americans who are not even aware that there exists a world outside of the USA. In MOST countries in the world, white people are a minority, and while they are often seen as a ""model minority"", they don't have more power in my native Senegal or in China or Japan or India than Asian-Americans have in the USA.

- The systemic issues in question, even if only look within the USA, were not born by accident. They are the result of the fact *the majority of the population held bigoted beliefs* for long enough for those beliefs to become ""mainstream"". That's really all it takes. If the ""white people are all trash"" and ""kill all men"" mentalities were to become more popular, they WOULD absolutely shift the systemic imbalances to cause systemic discriminations against white people and men respectively. I'd argue that, on a small scale and in some specific contexts, this is already happen. 

In brief: A person who negatively judges and/or treats all members of [demographic group] just because they are members of [demographic group] is a hateful bigot, NO MATTER what that [demographic group] is. White, Black, Asian, Native American, male, female, gay, straight, pan, asexual... all of them, without exception."

I've always found this fascinating because that's the only kind of debt that you don't need to have. No one chooses to have medical debt, obviously that's something out of your control. Housing is a basic human need, so mortgages are understandable. Even if you don't have a mortgage,  you have to budget for rent in all your future expenses. Even credit card debt can be out of your control if you find your self in a tough spot with no other way to pay for life expenses. 

But no one talk about cancelling those. Just the student loans. Student loans aren't necessary if your goal is just getting a degree. Pell Grants are over 7k now. In state tuition is between $6-9k. You can stay at home, commute to class and come out with no debt. This isn't appealing to people, because people want ""the college experience."" Which is great, but at that point your debt isn't for education. It's for a lifestyle. When you go out of state for school, you pay for your education, housing, food and disposable income with student loans. You're essentially paying for 4 years of life with debt. Doing that at any point in your life will cost you six figures, not just college. 

A college degree means you're going to earn on average a million dollars more than someone without a degree. Only 12 percent of the population have student loan debt. People who go to college are far, far more liberal than those who didn't. Student loan forgiveness essentially amounts to a massive handout to a small, extremely partisan, more well off demographic. It would be a bad, regressive policy on it's own. But factoring the fact that you don't have to take it on to get A college degree, this is an extremely selfish policy goal."

I’m speaking in the heteronormative sense in this case.

Even with a prenup, things change and ultimately the decision is left for the judge to decide. The requirement of lifetime alimony payments, splitting of retirement accounts don’t make it a good deal overall. The chance of financial ruin for both parties is high the longer the marriage is.

I don’t see the reason for involving the state to such a high degree, division of assets and spousal support payment can be astronomically high and payments cannot be deducted from taxes making it even worse.
I don’t believe marriage is bad, I believe the laws surrounding it are and the overall risks of marriage making it a bad decision to make for most people in todays day and age.

It’s very easy to get married but extremely hard to get out of it.

Legally I think a marriage contract is a risky and terrible decision that has a high chance of ruin and is a disadvantage to men. When things are great it’s awesome, but that’s a 50% at best.

You'll often here someone say 'only the top of the top make the amounts that are worth it,' which is simply untrue. 

People say spending 500k on a degree, in any field, is ludicrous. I disagree. If you pursue dentistry, you will be making 150k-250k as an associate dentist right after graduation. Before the comments: ""That is not true! Dentists in my town make only 80-150."" There is a reason why dentists who graduate move immediately to a densely populated city like NYC, LA, or Miami, because that is where the money is at. They also tend to move to states with zero or very low income taxes, such as Florida and texas, or Alberta in Canada. Let us assume you continue at 150-250 per year (pre-tax): you will be debt free within 5 years of grad (which is usually at 22-25 years old). Meaning that by 30, you will be making upwards of 150-250k, debt free, on easy mode to becoming a millionaire. Not to mention, most dentists hit 400k yearly salary by their 10th year of practice. This same thing applies to all of the other professions I mentioned. So if, these degrees are a surefire way of becoming a millionaire in your thirties, who cares if the cost to get there is 400k, 500k, or even 1m in loans? 

Fun fact, you could come from the lowest socioeconomic background but be approved for a 500k professional degree loan (like MD or DDS) in an instant, because the bank KNOWS you will have no issue repaying the loan with MAX interest post graduation. "

Which is being ""smart"" means you can pick up things quick and ""stupid"" means you pick up things slowly. So you can/do have situations where people are very knowledgeable but aren't ""smart"" and even sometimes ""stupid"".   


What I believe is happening when someone thinks ""most people are stupid"" is the ""curse of knowledge"". This is a phenomena where people have a cognitive and unconscious bias where we underestimate how easy a topic is and have difficulties comprehending how others can't understand a certain subject.   


Where most of us see this affecting our daily lives is when we have a teacher/professor that acts surprised that their students aren't picking up such ""basic"" ideas. Mean while their failure rate for the class is extremely high. So the way I see it is we are those teachers but towards other people in our daily lives. In fact as a programmer I see this A LOT, people are incredibly rude to others who are learning. They genuinely forgot how brutal it was to learn (I knew them as they learned) and think of others as stupid for not understanding what they already know.   


Honestly where I think a lot of this comes from is ego, I think many of us have unchecked egos and think we are smarter than others. Here are some stats to back up my statement: 65% of Americans believe they are above average in intelligence (This is from the National Library of Medicine).   


There are many more reasons why I believe this, but those are some of my main points. I think the average person is very capable, because if they weren't society wouldn't function. I honestly believe that we tell ourselves these kinds of things to justify having people beneath us, doing jobs that ""only the average person should do""."

I am not aware of how university course plans differ between countries. 

In the US, you are legally required (specific requirements differ between states) to take a certain number of credit hours of “core concept” classes in order to obtain a bachelors degree. Core concept includes classes that generally are not related to your degree, such as history, English, economics, government, arts, etc. 

The most common argument for the presence of these courses in university degree requirements is that it creates well rounded individuals. Having citizens that understand how to write, how government/economics work, or some history of the world is certainly beneficial to society, and I am not refuting that claim. But why is it being taught in universities and colleges? 

Going to college/university is not legally required of you. If it is of such a great importance for people in a society to study these topics, why is it not required for everyone? I.e. why is this either not taught in public school, or why is the time  already spent studying these topics in public schools not sufficient?

If we either eliminated these classes or moved them into public (if they don’t already exist there), we could see students currently getting their bachelors coming out with the same field-specific knowledge as those completing their masters degrees. This would overall lead to a more skilled and experienced workforce and likely benefit society. 


Furthermore, everyone I’ve asked who is either currently studying in universities or has in the past remembers nearly none of the content from these classes, myself included. To name a few recent classes, I have take. US history I & II, US Government, English Composition I, and Ethics, and I genuinely can only recall MAYBE 5% of the material from each of these classes. Taking these classes has made no noticeable improvement in my life so far, and I don’t have reason to believe it will in the future. These classes were a waste of time and money, and I feel it would be far more beneficial if I could have spent that time exploring aerospace engineering further."
1,2023-12-11,CMV: The Modern Left's overt defense of antisemitism is logically in line with their values,u/RemoteCompetitive688,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18g2fx7/cmv_the_modern_lefts_overt_defense_of/,changemyview,"I want to make this clear right off the bat: Israel has overtly legally enshrined discrimination and has been overtly targeting civilians. Israel deserves criticism and condemnation and it is not in any way shape or form antisemitic to criticize Israel 

However; its very clear that Hamas's actions (which are overtly being defended by the left) targeted innocent people, not the IDF, not members of the government, just random innocent people 

It is very clear based on recent news and shockingly obvious by the congressional testimony of Ivy League schools that Jewish people as a whole, people who have never lived in Israel but just happen to be of a certain religion, are being targeted over the actions of Israel. 

Many people find this surprising. It is not. It is entirely in line with the left's values. 

As a descendant of Irish and Eastern European immigrants that came to the US in like the 1900s, I have overtly had the blame and responsibility for colonial actions by other countries 200 years before I was born laid at my feet. I have seen news agencies overtly defend the killings of Boer farmers in South Africa who were born long after Apartheid. I have overtly seen the left argue that people in Ireland need to accept policies to atone for western imperialism that they had absolutely no part in. 

The rhetoric around decolonization from the left has been overtly ""Everyone of a certain race/religion bears responsibility for all actions of that group"" for a long time. It is not surprising at all, it is entirely in line with the rhetoric around decolonization that a Jewish person from Brooklyn would be blamed for the actions of the IDF even if they've never set foot in Israel.

It is a cornerstone of leftism that everyone of a certain group thats been labeled an ""oppressor group"" deserves to suffer on account of its actions. People have been sounding the alarm over this rhetoric for a long time and the only way this could be surprising is if you haven't paid attention. 

Their claims of tolerance have always been a cover for the fact that they are mostly focused on intolerance towards groups they believe are acceptable targets. Racists have always had a reason why the group they hated was an appropriate target. The modern left in so different from any of these "
461,2023-12-11,CMV: most current forms of protest are more about feeling seen than making actual change,u/sammyslug13,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18g2qo9/cmv_most_current_forms_of_protest_are_more_about/,changemyview,"I think that protesting has recently become more about being seen protesting and feeling like you are with like minded people that agree with you and less about actually trying to change things.

I will use a few examples,

I recently saw some animal rights protest at a horse racing track with posters and signs trying to get people to stop going to the races. I think this was a silly protest, who was going to change there mind about what they were going to do having already driven there and paid for parking and possibly already bought tickets. 

The COVID protesters were another big example to me, like who believed that a few angry people hanging out on a street corner were going to stop state level vaccine mandates. The mandates decreased over time because that is how they are supposed to work and people screaming at street corners were like toddlers through a tantrum for attention.

Last and I think the worst is some of the current environmental protest. Closing a road or gluing yourself to a highway will not stop massive multinational corporations from doing business. And if you think that the politicians will change their mind about oil from a few protests your an idiot. The earth liberation front did more for environmental activism than just stop oil ever will."

1,2023-12-11,"CMV: The Russo - Ukrainian War, stretching back to 2014, is almost entirely the result of American failed foreign policy.",u/birdquailbird,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18g3kxa/cmv_the_russo_ukrainian_war_stretching_back_to/,changemyview,"How did the war in Ukraine start? In 1990, the USSR died, leaving the successor states with Russia being the largest and the “spiritual successor” of the ussr. This, along with Putin’s opinion that the breakup of the USSR was a tragedy, along with the rhetoric of Russian propaganda people today, leads alot of Americans to believe that Russia is hell bent on conquering all of Ukraine, and will then move on to the Baltics and Eastern Europe, and that Russia / Putin’s ultimate goal is to recreate the USSR.

However, I really don’t think that is a realistic goal nor is it Putin’s goal at all. To start, if Russia really wanted to conquer Ukraine, it would need a million + troops, which it just doesn't have. Not only would it need to conquer Ukraine militarily, then it would have to pacify the milllions of ethnic Ukranians who hate Russia. Not so easy. To then move further East, Russia would have to attack NATO and start WWIII, all the while occupying Ukraine and mobilizing further millions to hold ground in the Baltics or Poland. In the meantime, if we haven't all died to nukes, the USAF would be using all their might to pound any advance. This idea that Russia wants to, or is able to, conquer all of Ukraine and then move further East is just unrealistic. 

Let’s view how the war started from a Russian POV. 

1991 - the USSR collapses, Russia is basically dead

1999 - NATO expands, adding Poland, Hungary, Czech Rep, Russia makes it clear that its unhappy but it’s too weak to do anything

2004 - NATO expands, adding the Baltics and friends, Russia makes it clear that it’s unhappy but it’s too weak to do anything

2008 - NATO says it will add Ukraine and Georgia, and Russia makes it absolutely clear that this is line in the sand that NATO cannot cross. The goal of adding Ukraine into NATO / EU was essentially to create a liberal democracy right next to Russia, which was / is unacceptable to Russia, and they made this clear in 2008.

“General Yuri Baluyevsky was quoted as saying that Russia was considering the possibility of taking military and other steps along its borders if the two countries became part of the organization.”

""Russia will take unambiguous action toward ensuring its interests along its borders,"" he said. ""These will not only be military steps, but also steps of a different character.

In 2008, it was not only the Russians who thought this was a mistake. Merkel and Sarkozy both opposed adding the two nations to NATO, both citing concerns of destablization and future conflicts. Russia itself makes it clear - we will take military steps to make sure Ukraine cannot join NATO. We just ignore this warning though. 

It is a common view in the US that Ukraine should be allowed to join NATO if it wants - it is a sovereign nation that should be allowed to choose. However, from a Russian POV, Ukraine joining NATO is clearly a red line and I don't understand why more Americans can't empathize with this view. NATO was an alliance made specifically to counter the USSR, and now with Russia being the spiritual successor of the USSR, NATO is essentially now an anti-Russia alliance. It is not hard to imagine why the Russians would not want such an alliance right on their border, even though now they have the alliance on their border in Finland - but that's not as great of a concern to them. More important would be members right on their Eastern border. Why? That terrain is suitable for an invasion. It's flat, not as cold, and has a much wider frontier. And it's the terrain that historically was used for invasions into Russia.

Imagine for a second that the US lost the cold war and is a shadow of its former self. The warsaw pact now stretches from Spain to Vladivostok, and the most recent nations were added in the 2000s. Now in 2008, the warsaw pact wants to add Canada to its membership, under the justification that Canada is a soverign nation that wants to join and thus has all the rights to join. Now, it's not hard to imagine that the US wouldn't simply sit back and let this happen. In 1962 we almost started WW3 because the Soviets put nukes in Cuba. 

This leads me to my main idea. All nations, Russia included, are first and foremost interested in their survival as a nation. In the US, we don't really think about this too much because we are essentially uninvadable and invincible. We thought about this in 1962 and almost started WWIII over it. But now, in our hubris, we can't imagine what it's like for a leader to be concerned with the survival of their state. In contrast, Russia is geographically and historically invadable - maybe not easy to succeed, but geographically it's easy land to invade, unlike America. Every invasion of Russia has lead to enourmous casualties, not only for the invader but mostly for Russian civilians. With this historical background, it's even easier to see why a Russian head of state would be wary and concerned about his nation's surival. In WWII the USSR lost 20 million civilians. It's only natural for a leader of the successor state to be wary of anything like that ever happening again. 

As Americans, it would again be easy to dismiss these Russian concerns. We would never invade Russia. We are a benevelent hegemon. Well, Russia does not see it this way, North Korea does not see it this way, Iran doesn't see it this way, nor should we see it this way if we just take a look at our activities from 1950-2000. We are not a benevolent hegemon. Russia has every reason to be afraid of the most powerful nation on Earth having an anti-Russia-alliance member on their doorstep. 

All this brings me back to my point. All of this bloodshed in Ukraine is the direct result of failed American foreign policy. We thought we could continue adding members to NATO and that Russia would do nothing about it. We were wrong. In our hubris, we assumed they would just sit back and take it because they were too weak to do anything. In 2008, we try to add Ukraine, and Russia says - this is the line in the sand, we will respond to this, this is unacceptable. We say OK I don't believe you, you didn't do anything the last two times, and we try to move forward. In 2014, Putin launches a limited incursion to make sure Ukraine can't ascend into NATO. Then now Putin launches a war, suddenly we are too weak to seriously help Ukraine in what matters (artillery), because during the period from 1990-2016, we were the sole hegemon on Earth and we didn't care about artillery, we only cared about aircraft and PGMs. We can't give Ukraine our planes - enough to make a difference - , because we need those planes to take care of our (more important) commitments in the Pacific, which is where our focus needs to be now. We can't give Ukraine artillery, because we don't have enough shells and it's not as easy as just plopping down a new 155 mm factory. 

In my view, all of this stems from our failure to empathize with our enemy. We can't imagine what it feels like for a Russian stateman to be in his position, so we don't, so we don't foresee that adding Ukraine to NATO was in fact a serious red line that shouldn't have been crossed unless we were militarily prepared to defend it. Well since we didn't foresee any of this, we aren't military prepared to defend it without massive sacrifices to our other global commitments, of which we already have too many with too small of a military to cover all of them."

I also strongly disagree with the notion to compare these novels with books aimed at explaining sexuality in a more medical matter.

I WILL also say that I do support allowing age appropriate books with LGBT characters, and having age appropriate material regarding LGBT people.

your partner is having (possibly unprotected) sex with you because they feel safe. because you both agreed to only have sex with each other, therefore you would both be clean. when you cheat, your exposing your partner and risking their health. and (imo) using them sexually, because you know if they knew what you did they would not be having sex with you. 

if a wife cheated on her husband, slept with him afterwards, and gave him aids. did he consent, or was he tricked because his wife omitted the fact she could have disease?

i don’t see how that’s much different than tricking someone into sex with you under a fake guise. maybe “sexual assault” isn’t exactly the right term, but it fits under that umbrella."

When I say Sexism, I mean the acknowledgment that certain societies have culturally made a distinction between the 2 genders, and this distinction is neither targeted to harm or prefer any gender over another, at least not on purpose. It just tries to show that ""Sex/Gender"" has an inherent meaning to certain societies to begin with.  
\---  
When I grew up, as a man, I was considered pretty much ""feminine"". I liked things that society associates with ""femininity"", and dislike things that society associates to ""masculinity"". I didn't play soccer at school breaks like the other boys, I didn't have a group of male friends, and I liked romantic movies and TV shows about vampires. I was also thin and had wavy long hair for a time.  
Growing up in a society with ""Sexism"" meant that I had felt that there is a distinction between male and female to begin with. Otherwise I wouldn't have classified myself as ""feminine"". This led me to develop a certain defense mechanism, in which I ""own"" my femininity and just classify myself as one. At the end of the day, all I secretly wanted was to be as manly as people I view as such. This dissonance has caused me a lot of anguish as a teenager, but I hid it behind a veil of what I supposed was “femininity”. On the surface, I was a strong believer of gender equality/liberalism, and I was adamant about it. I mocked men who acted “according to their gender”, but that was ultimately from a place a jealousy.  
When I met my nowadays partner, my views on equality actually brought us more harm than anything else. Society expects, in a heterosexual relationship, that a man act a certain way to his female partner. The stereotypes say that a man needs to pay, bring presents, drive, protect his partner physically and emotionally from external threats and be stern and strong inside.  
Because I was neither of those things, and on the surface even against the fact that I have to play their role on purpose, my partner was hurt in the process. I didn’t have emotional tools to support her, or the inner strength to protect her and be confident, as described by the stereotypes. It didn’t even occur to me that she might want a gift or a token of appreciation at the dating phase, and that it is the “role of the man” to court.  
It took me years, but the more confident I became, and the more I played the role of the “man”, the happier I was, and the happier she was. She is an independent career woman, and yet It doesn’t contradict that she likes to play the societal role of the “female” in the relationship, and is attracted to the idea of the “male” role in the relationship, and even the ideal of a “male” in general.  
I realized that if I had just devoted myself from a young age to trying to become “manly” instead of being antagonistic and defensive to the idea, I might have picked up some values which would have made me happier and more fulfilled much sooner. It would also have avoided the strifes at the beginning of my relationship.  
My resulting opinion was that it is true that society has stereotypes and unrealistic standards about the 2 genders. However, it doesn’t mean it’s bad. More often than not, I recognize that people in a society which has this “Sexist” distinction, actually enjoy playing the role that was given to them by society. Is it bad that society expects men to “be strong”?, is it bad that society expects women to “be gentle”? For some people - yes, it hurts, and it’s not ok. People should act according to how they want to whenever they want to. But for others, it’s exactly what attracts them and what motivates them to be better people.  
I’m going to make a generalization about western societies, and it is not supposed to trigger anyone. I think you need to be realistic when it comes to what actually IS, as opposed to an ideal equal society. The generalization is that in our society, doesn’t matter if it’s inherent or from education, most men like to be “treated like a man and act as a man”, and most women like to be “treated as a woman and act as a woman”. People who don’t act according to their societal gender are PERFECTLY FINE, but they shouldn’t try to force equality upon society as a whole.  
I am against discrimination, but I am pro the realization that unfortunately because of the society we live in, we cannot just “decide to escape” the game. There is a game, there is a distinction between the genders, and most people are part of this game. Since becoming “manly”, I have learned how to drive, started to work out, and told my partner that she can buy whatever she wants, because - “I will take care of the money”. Doing this stuff fulfills me, and if it wasn’t for the inherent “Sexism” present in both my partner and I, I might have never had the motivation to do or be those things to begin with."

I'm all for feminism especially from countries like Afghanistan or certain African countries but in the west I genuinely feel like women have certain privileges especially in certain social aspects. for example I know a woman who takes pictures of her feet and makes $2,000 a month just by taking pictures of her feet. I suppose a man can do that but not to the same extent.. money=easier life opportunities. downvote me all you want, but seriously come on! racism and homophobia  are easy but sexism is a more difficult topic as far as current 2023 ideology?

That being said, I've been in more situations where I had to deal with police that I wish were true, and at least 70% of the time I was instantly treated badly once I properly used my 5th amendment right. (I have definitely had one situation where I was intoxicated and likely not acting right just to be fair, so I don't count anything from that in this post)

If yall dont know, THIS IS ALWAYS THE RIGHT THING TO DO! So its so damn difficult not to believe that they are just treating me worse once I made their job more difficult since they are the once who can completely control the situation. I've been put into custody for many many hours after doing so, only to have no charges placed onto me and my family member told that I couldn't be released for reasons they for whatever reason couldn't disclose. Once for ""slurring my speech"" which apparently gets you put in holding for 12 hours sometimes and they don't need to actually prove this to anyone apparently. Once I was finally released, someone at the front desk said ""oh yeah, they always say that so Im sorry that happened to you."" Another thing is how it appears quite obvious to me that lying is a massive part of their job. The amount of lies ive been told just to try to get me to sign away my Miranda rights or accept a search is UNBELIEVABLE!

Point is, after all these things happening multiple times I cannot understand how you could view police as being mostly good unless you've never dealt with them. Maybe this comes off as more of rant than a proper post, but that first sentence is there for a reason and a big part of why I want to believe there is a reasonable purpose for this type of stuff from someone who's experienced it as well."
1,2023-12-11,"CMV: There are two distinct forms of social democracy, that are different enough to be fundamentally different political ideologies, so different that we need new terms to describe them, not sharing the same ""social democracy"" label.",u/Soyuz_1848,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18gdnqc/cmv_there_are_two_distinct_forms_of_social/,changemyview,"There are two fundamentally distinct forms of social democracy, one found in Latin America, Asia, Central Europe etc., and one mainly found in the US and Western Europe. Let's just call them ""left social democracy"" and ""right social democracy"". For background, I am a left social democrat so my description may be biased towards left social democrats.

* **Ideological Roots**: Left social democracy draws its ideological root from **Marxism**, while right social democracy has merged itself with **liberal and neoclassical** economic ideas so much that it's beyond recognition. Right social democrats usually originated from left social democratic parties, judging from their party clauses and hymns, but their actual ideological basis is liberalism, not socialism. They don't think wage labor is oppression. However, left social democrats think wage labor is inherently oppressive, like original Marxism, and fight for the welfare of the working class.
* **Voter Base**: Left social democracy are firm **99%**\-ers. They draw support from the poor working class. They even sometimes surrender to populist appeals and support conservative social policies that go against the ideal of Marxism to get more votes. On the other hand, right social democracy is firmly **middle-class**. They appeal to the moderately affluent, well-educated elites who are not rich enough to go fully luxurious but live a pretty decent life. They even sometimes surrender to elitist ideals and support rightist economic policies that go against the ideal of Social Democracy to get more votes.
* **Foreign Policy**: Left social democrats are **pacifist**, they support a diplomatic solution even with authoritarian regimes like China. Right social democrats are war hawks, being aggressive and **interventionist**, eager to protect the interests of US allies in the name of ""value-based diplomacy"". Their foreign policy is neoconservative. Left social democrats are far more dovish than the mainstream, while right social democrats are more hawkish than the mainstream. It puts them to the polar opposite sides. 
* **Diverse vs Different**: Left social democrats want a **different** system. They think wage labor is inherently unfair so they want strong unions, high social welfare and nationalization and worker co-ops. They may or may not think diversity is inherently good but they do think diversifying the rich class is not the solution. Right social democrats want a **diverse** system, so they largely minimize government intervention in the economy, while advocating for diversity in the workplace, like more female CEOs. They don't think capitalism is inherently unfair. 
* **How to cut the society**? Left social democrats cut the society horizontally. They see things as a **top-bottom** divide. Different nationalities, races, genders, sexualities etc. should abandon their bigotry and unite in the fight against capitalism. Right social democrats cut the society **vertically**. They look at things in the lens of nationality, race, gender, sexuality, maybe even income level, but never class. (No, income level is not Marxist social class). 
* **Pro-business or pro-union**: Left social democrats are **pro-union**, often even **anti-business**. Right social democrats are **pro-business**, and at best **neutral to unions**, even often anti-union (like Tony Blair). 
* **Examples**: Left social democrats include Melenchon, Corbyn, Allende, and Miyamoto. They're mainly seen as radicals, or fringe politicians. Right social democrats are most of the western liberal and social democratic political parties, especially before the 2010s (in the Third Way era). They're usually considered mainstream. 
* Any bad-faithed comments that call me slurs, especially ""tankie"" (which I am NOT), will not be replied. We're discussing the differences between two political ideologies, **not debating which one is better**. "

I understand the risks are different when talking about raising another human but the fears associated with it are only figments of human control. I disagree with the idea that one is morally better than another for simply deciding to not have kids. Too much of a case by case scenario where that type of generalization can’t be made."

12,2023-12-12,"CMV: The US should create a modern version of the ""Flying Tigers"" squadron in Ukraine similar to the original one in China which fought the Japanese",u/TargetedYeeting,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18gggic/cmv_the_us_should_create_a_modern_version_of_the/,changemyview,"In 1940, seeing a need for a bolstered Chinese air force, Chang Kai Shiek, and his American advisor Claire Lee Chennault came up with a plan to recruit American military pilots to join the Chinese air force to bolster China's defense, even before Pearl Harbor was attacked.  Chennault lobbied congress and eventually got his plan approved.  The plan would be for around 100 American pilots to leave the US military, travel to China and fly US supplied planes with Chinese markings, but under command of the Chinese military, and officially employed as mercenaries by an aircraft manufacturing company.  The key thing to note though is they were officially not affiliated with the US military, they were mercenaries and members of the Chinese air force.  This group became known as the ""Flying tigers.""  In the end, they are credited with destroying over 220 Japanese aircraft, and 14 pilots were killed in action.  

I believe this model could be applied to Ukraine as a way to bolster the Ukrainian air force.  

The Ukraine war has clearly entered into a stalemate, with neither side making any meaningful progress.  The only way this will be broken is some drastic change in technology or firepower, and the obvious place this will come is by the air.  Ukraine has largely blunted the Russian air force due to its Western supplied air defense system despite having only a few planes itself.  You can check out many videos from the beginning of the war of Ukrainian soldiers with stinger missiles shooting down Russian helicopters.  Russian pilots soon realized Ukraine is too dangerous to fly missions over, and have resorted to lobbing random rockets and missiles well behind the front lines, with Ukraine doing the same with its very limited Soviet fleet.  

The ""West"" has committed to training Ukrainian pilots on more modern jets, such as F16s, however, there is an extensive training curve, which is why no jets have been delivered yet.  Pilots have to learn English to be able to fly the planes, as well as the controls, which are often different from Soviet aircraft.  Ukraine also has a very limited number of pilots, with some already being killed in action during the war.  

The way the Flying Tigers was set up maintained the degree of separation which kept the US out of the war prior to Pearl Harbor.  Given the number of former US military personal who have gone to Ukraine to fight, it's not inconceivable to think you could not organize a small group of American or ""Western"" fighter pilots,  who might be interested, like the group who went to China in 1940-1942.  If any of the pilots are active duty, they would be discharged from the US air force or their respective military and enlist in the Ukrainian air force.  The US and other countries would then supply modern fighter aircraft, painted with Ukrainian markings, that they are trained to fly.  The US would supply weapons and maintenance to these planes, but the pilots would be taking orders from the Ukrainians and being paid by them, not the US or any other country.  

Besides supporting Ukraine, it would be valuable to see how American fighter planes perform in a real world combat situation.  A jet such as the F35 or F22completely outclasses anything Russia can deploy in Ukraine, and could be useful for attacking targets far behind Russian lines given their stealth technology, such as in Crimea, a vulnerability which which F16s and F18s would still suffer from.  

 I know what everyone is going to say... ""ESCALATION.""  This would be the US entering the war and directly fighting. Russia, this might lead to nuclear war.  Yeah, I understand the reservation.  My counter to that is many ex soldiers, including veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan have gone to Ukraine to fight, while not officially being sanctioned by the US, they have provided training and bolstered the ranks of the Ukrainian army.  Some of these soldiers have even been killed in action, or captured by Russia and later exchanged in prisoner swaps.  While Russia labels them as ""mercenaries,"" it still has not lead to any direct escalation between NATO countries and Russia.  This even includes Trevor Reid, a Marine corps veteran who was arrested in Russia after a drunk night out on suspicious circumstances, and later freed in a prisoner swap.   After being exchanged, he enlisted in the Ukrainian army, obviously wanting to settle his score with Russia, later injured and airlifted to Germany.  

Many of these foreign volunteers are also using Western weapons while fighting Russia, or training Ukrainians on how to properly use them.  Again, arming Ukraine has caused absolutely 0 escalation with Russia.  These volunteers again, are not members of any Western military, but members of the Ukrainian army.  I don't see why fighter pilots would be the exception.  They would be Americans, flying American supplied aircraft under command of the Ukrainian air force, no difference than an American tank driver or machine gunner in Eastern Ukraine.  

Russia also heavily employs mercenaries in its war against Ukraine.  Wagner is the most famous one, maintaining a massive security empire for corrupt African countries and sneaking their resources back to Russia as a way to evade sanctions.  Wagner was also used to capture Syrian oil fields from rebel fighters, and negotiate contracts for large percentages of their revenue in exchange for protection.  Russia still denied the existence of such groups, referring to them simply as ""volunteers.""  US backed forces in Syria were even attacked by them in 2018, and the US military fought back, with 0 Russian military reaction.  My point is there's already significant precedent for mercenary activities with Russia.  We would simply be using their own playbook against them, and when Russia complains or threatens over the pilots, we just shrug and say they're volunteers, they can do what they want, and they probably got the planes the same way Russian ""volunteers"" got their BUK missile system that shot down MH17 in 2014.  Russia has already consented to mercenary combatants by using Wagner in the Ukraine war, and sneaking in GRU agents to fight Ukraine in 2014, how is it any different if we do the same thing? Even during the Cold War there is anecdotal evidence of the Soviets sending fighter pilots to sneak into the North Korean and North Vietnamese air force during the Korean and Vietnam wars.  That never started WWIII.  

I do concede that such a program is a pipe dream given a new Ukraine aid funding bill can't even get passed in congress, but I do believe if implemented, it would be significant in Ukraine's defense, without leading to a wider conflict.  So please, change my view.

To begin with I have been heavily bullied in school since I was in nursery, for my dark skin. This has kind of damaged my self esteem forever. I have seen so many instances where fairer skin students have been favoured. 

For example as far as I remember, there was one group singing, where dark skinned boys and girls were removed from front rows and put in back and put fairer kids there. And so much more. 

If you see any advertisement here, only the most fairest/white girls and even boys are always selected and put in. This just can't be the coincidence. Even in movies there is a clear distinction, where heroes and heroines are white and pale, and villains are darker or black. 

I have observed so much low-key racism against dark skin in day to day life. Many of my friends in college now, actively say they would date or marry a white girl. Who's gonna date a black girl! One time I remember in a festival, I have a friend who is fair and handsome, and we entered a room and all of girls just started complimenting my friend while completely ignoring my presence. 

All of these continuous life experiences have thoroughly destroyed my self respect, and I have just started hating my body and my skin. I hate to look in mirror, and avoid clicking photos. I have heard comments like, 'we need better lighting in order to click your photo!""

Its strategy is based on so-called “prefiguration” which means creating institutions here and now that are working according to principles of horizontality and voluntariness,  and on direct action which usually means taking action to destroy the current hierarchical and coercive structures. So it has both the positive, creative side and more negative, antagonistic side. Why do I like it? Because I think these types of arrangements between people that anarchists want to create can help individuals accomplish their goals and develop in what they find the most important. Examples of strategies that anarchists utilise are creation of worker cooperatives, which are horizontally run workplaces where every workers is equal co-owner of the workplace, mutual aid networks like FoodNotBombs, horizontal unions like IWW that fight for better treatment of workers in hierarchical workplaces etc.. The part that is antagonistic towards the hierarchy and coercion is usually more controversial, because it quite often breaks the law. The law for anarchists is coercive and hierarchical because it’s put top-down on the rest of the population by a small group of law-makers and so it is for them the intellectual construct created by the dominating group to subjugate the rest of the population. Anarchists think that the unity of means and ends is very important, so they don’t do strategies where they create new coercion and hierarchy to fight another form of coercion and hierarchy. Every other political ideology naturalises different type of hierarchical relation between people and anarchism is unique in its negation of every such relation."

And this should be a good outcome for third parties because Biden leaked our national secrets and tried to overthrow the First Amendment. He has told us he wants to turn the United States' two-party system into a one-party (DNC) regime, defund our freedoms, and exterminate his enemies. Even if you think it's all bluster, such an outcome seems bad enough that it isn't worth the risk just to make a point. I would also like more options, but until FPTP is replaced with ranked choice voting in most states (a move I 100% support), all third-party voting has done in recent years is allow increasingly shitty Democrats to get elected.

Why English? It is the most spoken language in the world with 1.4 billion speakers, it is also the language used at sea and for science. It seems to make logical sense to only use English and primarily teach English to allow the world to cooperate easier. 

Secondly if this can not be achieved we should at least make it that all new words only have one variation instead of making a new word in each language it serves no purpose and just makes life harder.

Please consider and critique the following reasoning. I've enumerated them for simplicity.   
Final logical conclusion is in the title.  
  
1. Eventually, in the distant future Earth should be united as single state on the planet. This may happen naturally, this may happen in spite of some external threats but will happen sooner or later.  
  
1.1 This is beneficial from the economical, scientific, etc etc.. points of view, and even for space safety purposes. The sooner it will happen, the better.   
1.2 Everyone sane and caring should work on this for the sake of humanity.  
  
2. Union most likely can be achieved by two ways:   
  
\#1 One strongest country will absorb others via military/culture/economical dominance

  
\#2 All the countries willingly unite and form a joint Earth government.    
  
2.1 Scenario #1 is pretty questionable.   
 \- Full military dominance is not possible due to nuclear weapons existence  
 \- ""Culture victory"" is also unlikely to happen since the internet already shares the culture, but not individual elites interests.  
 \- Globalization already provide economical unification, but this is not eliminating the states difference and rivalry  
  
2.2 Association/unification (Scenario #2) will likely happen as union of approximately equally developed countries with similar state form, and European Union is an example.  
  
3 Union will not happen while there are ""superpowers"" in the world.   
3.1 EU-like unification require certain grade of equity, while superpowers will strive for their privileged position in the world union, which is not tolerable by others.   
3.2 Superpowers will loose their dominance upon unification, so they will oppose the progress.

Personally I can see several weak points here, but I'll be glad if you state them to me.

I will try to keep this as summarized as possible. So I have been talking to a fellow co-worker (28F) at my establishment, and she seemed like a very nice, sweet woman. Both her and I were getting into multiple topics, until one day, she told me she performs Astral Projection, and has been doing this for nearly 10 years. Though I already have a strong historical opinion of not believing in ghosts or the ""spirit realm"", she is a heavy believer in these categories, and ultimately believes in human beings having a soul, as well as other biological creatures (mammals, specifically), having a ""soul"".  
To my curiosity, I tried all kinds of methods that Astral Projectors supposedly use, such as the ""Gateway Tapes"", through meditation and laying on your back, breathing techniques, and/or binaural beats. The closet I have gotten over the span of a couple weeks, was seeing visions of my living room, and visions of my school, weirdly enough.  
However, this was not enough to convince me that this is my very soul, or my very existence, leaving the body, so to speak, and was unequivocally a trick of the mind. After staring at the darkness of your eyelids for a lengthy period of time, we are bound to form hallucinations, since our brains always try to make sense of its surroundings. Especially in the dark, where it attempts to fills in the blanks (thus is why people think they see ""things"" in the dark). During this whole ""Astral"" adventure, I have presented a task for this co-worker friend, which I thought (not to toot my own horn) was brilliant in an effort to debunk their hysteria...

I have written a HUGE and specific four-digit code on my white board, and I have asked them to Astral Project to my room to read the code. All of a sudden, they ""cant do it."" And make up an excuse each time I ask them to Astral Project (I did ask them politely each time and gave them respect, I'm not a heathen). But, now that they are refusing, or ""cant"", Astral Project to me, is really suspicious.  
Therefore, I think they are just lying to me. And my opinion is proven true. That Ghosts/spirits are not real. Astral Projection is not real. Protective crystals and witch spells are not real. Tarot Readings and Psychics are not real... etc.  
P.S We are still great friends, my co-worker and I, even if we dont agree on some things."

In California that would be $30,000 and in the UK that would be £20,000.

Minimum wage as a concept is put in place to ensure that employers cannot pay employees below the livable wage in a country (Of course in the US it's below livable wage but that's a separate discussion). However, once these people are taxed, the amount which they can live on, by definition, is below that. It's counterintuitive to the original concept. Taxation should be based on one's ability to pay, and minimum-wage workers just do not have that ability. 

I'm not saying that this change needs to come through right away. Governments can take 5 to 10 years to raise the tax-free allowance to match the minimum wage (which of course should rise with inflation) to ensure that the labour market can adjust to it.

Edit: I stand corrected on the US tax system. I've used the Californian minimum wage instead. I'm in the UK and the tax allowance is £12,570. Someone making £20,000 will be taking home about £17,100. I think it's ridiculous that someone on minimum wage is even paying a penny in tax."

I joined a facebook group around the game and UGH THIS LANGUAGE IS SO ANNOYING.

the words look like this “Po ko sya mga wala namang mang kung lag nasa baba” I shit you not. I just went through this group and recited some of the things they said.

Now I get being frustrated with a language, but this morning, I caught myself looking at someone from the groups’s profile picture (there was something peculiar about it) and thinking, “ugh, another Pilipino” 

I have had nothing against Pilipinos in the past ever, and have actually liked them before because my mother is a huge Jo Koy fan.

Am i turning racist because of a stupid fucking language?

One other thing I wanted to add, I hate the Portuguese language as well, but have no negative thoughts about Portuguese people, but that could also be because of my love of the natural beauty of Portugal and the rest of Western Europe, maybe?"

“Libertarian conservatism advocates the greatest possible economic liberty and the least possible government regulation of social life (described as ""small government""), mirroring laissez-faire classical liberalism, but harnesses this to a belief in a more socially conservative philosophy emphasizing authority, morality and duty. Primarily an American ideology, libertarian conservatism prioritizes liberty, promoting free expression, freedom of choice and free-market capitalism to achieve conservative ends while rejecting liberal social engineering.”

It balances liberalism and conservatism in a way that gives people the rights and freedoms to enjoy a fruitful life, while also maintaining a respectable value system in society. Most importantly, it promotes small national government, and emphasizes the importance of local municipalities in governance. Government should be small and social welfare should be regulated at the local level, preferably by non-profits or religious organizations that benefit from a 0% tax rate. Government should only deal with protecting its citizens in war, collecting taxes, providing interstate transportation, and providing funds to States so they can take care of their municipalities. 

I think socially, the government should have zero say in what we do with our bodies. At the same time, on a communal level, I think we should have a moral “code” that delivers consistency and predictability to its citizens. I strongly believe there needs to be a social standard of behavior that keeps society together. Otherwise, we facilitate the climate we’re in now; people afraid to publicly voice their values unless it falls in line with the mainstream (Hollywood) narrative, and people unable to determine their own identities because there’s no consensus to rely upon. 

It’s cool to have purple hair, and the desire to be an artist, but there needs to be structure, life is not one big mushroom trip. It’s cool to have Harvard frat buddies and geek out over markets and profit, but don’t prioritize those things over the economic and social health of society at large.

* I do not think there should be a war and I do not think this is desirable. I simply think that realistically that is the only way there would be ""world peace"" (even if temporary) and also reform of the United Nations
* I am not knowledgeable about this so I am happy to be informed but there's no need for condescending comments that I sometimes see on this sub that imply that the OP is dumb or absurd for holding their belief

View:

My view is that there can't be world peace or United Nations reform (which are closely related) until there is a world war or another large catastrophe that causes significant changes. The United Nations security council is clearly broken with a bunch of rather arbitrary countries having veto power over everything. There is no way any of these countries (at least the US, China and Russia) give up their veto power or agree to reform to lose their power willingly. The UN and the Security Council are theoretically the best place to resolve regional conflicts and promote peace. Therefore, since the members aren't willing to give up their power and they will always block most peace resolutions there will have to be a huge event where some of these powers are ""defeated"" and have no choice but to give up the power.

As for peace itself, without such a war or something there is almost no chance that things like Ukraine-Russia, Israel-Palestine, Yemen, etc. wars are completely resolved. I agree that the whole idea of ""one more war to end all wars"" like after World War I is wrong and history is likely to be repeated again but without this things are just going to get worse and no one trusts/will trust the UN anymore "
1,2023-12-12,"CMV: There has never been a ""conspiracy theory"" that was vindicated/proven true (please read post for criteria of what counts as a conspiracy theory for the sake of this discussion)",u/Jimithyashford,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18grmxh/cmv_there_has_never_been_a_conspiracy_theory_that/,changemyview,"I personally think conspiracy theory thinking is pretty much the lowest form of intellectual exercise, and is always wrong. While it's hard to put an exact definition on a conspiracy theory, these are the criteria I use, and I will provide examples for why I think these criteria are necessary to properly scope what I am talking about here:

1: ""The Truth"" must be known and believed by some form of institutional authority who is covering it up, and has successfully duped the bulk of the general populace.

Something that authorities were highly resistant to accepting as true does not count. For example, Heliocentricsm, not a conspiracy theory, because even though the church did kill people for spreading the idea, it was not cause they knew it was true and were trying to cover it up, it was because they believed it to be a blasphemous falsehood. The fact that cartels engage in human trafficking, not a conspiracy theory, because even though there are institutional powers that are trying to keep is secret, it's broadly known and accepted as true by the general population. 

2: ""The Truth"" must have been predicted in some way, maybe not precisely, but with some degree of informed specificity, by a conspiracy theory community, prior to the general uncovering of the truth. For example, MK Ultra is an example of a very shady and terrible thing our government did, but there were absolutely no conspiracy theories around it prior to it's general revelation to the public by congressional investigation in 1975. In order for it to count as a conspiracy theory proven true, there must have been some theory around it prior to it being proven/validated/uncovered to the general public. Also, the Truth predicted must be meaningfully aligned to the truth revealed, they cannot be tangentially related. For example, if it were revealed that fluoride can actually can lead to mouth cancer, and public health officials had been covering that up, that wouldn't count as ""proven true"" for people who think fluoride is in the water to lower your testosterone and make you more servile. Also broad general theories that are so vague that almost any uncovered secret of any kind could act as validation also don't count, like ""the government does stuff they aren't telling us"".

3: ""The Truth"" must be believed or proposed, in advance of general revelation to the public, by some group of discredited or dismissed truth seekers attempting to inform the public. It is important that this group of truth seekers view themselves as having the truth which is being covered up by some institutional power. A team of professional investigators/analysts/journalist/advisors breaking a story that there was no previous inkling of within any civilian conspiracy theory community in advance does not count. IE- Watergate. Watergate was an actual conspiracy plot, that the journalists who broke the story obviously had theories about, but there was no inkling out in the broader conspiracy community about it.   


The best single example to really drive home what I am getting at here is 9/11.

There are two conspiracies involved with 9/11. There is the actual real conspiracy carried out by a terrorist sect, and then there is the ""conspiracy theory"" that 9/11 was a false flag attack by our own government.

The first is a conspiracy yes, but wouldn't count as a conspiracy theory as we commonly use the term, and not as I mean it here. The Truth was not believed and suppressed by some institutional authority, the truth was not predicted in some way by a civilian conspiracy theory community prior to the general revelation of the truth by the execution of the plot.  


However the theory of the false flag attack, if it were born out to be true, would count. There is an institutional authority that knows it's true and is covering it up. There are meaningfully detailed theories held in advance of that revelation of truth by civilian theorists who have been actively attempting to make the public ""wake up"" and be aware.

&#x200B;

So with those criteria in mind, are you aware of any conspiracy theory that has ever proven to be true? "

There was a shooting in the Northeastern United States where a mass shooter shoot up a bowling alley and was later found out to have severe mental health issues, made threats to attack a military base, and was even hospitalized for a mental health issue. That tragedy could have been prevented if me made it illegal for people with certain mental health conditions and people hospitalized for a mental health issue to own a firearm. This would be done to ensure safety of society as we already have mental health laws that can admit someone to a mental hospital involuntarily and these facilities often do not allow you to possess potentially dangerous objects.

I don't mind being blue, nor is it surprising given the environment I grew up in. But I do wonder sometimes what would happen if I had turned out red in my blue zone. 

I remember an ex friend explicitly saying ""I cannot be friends with conservatives."" My parents used to joke about disowning us if we married conservatives- but behind every joke there's a grain of truth and, to this day, they still assume conservatives have bad, selfish intentions. And I'm sure the opposite is true in other parts of the country. 

I'm not suggesting we should tell children it's fine to align with any political group-it is very much not OK to align with the alt-right. But I think children should be free to choose whether red or blue suits them better. Or maybe they want to be moderates.

A) The Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the land. (Article VI, Clause 2)


B)The recent Supreme Court ruling on Bruen clarified that the Second Amendment is to be interpreted in plain English and through the eyes of the time it was written. 

C)US Constitution, Second Amendment:
""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""


1) The phase ""Shall not be infringed"" as interpreted in plain English indicates how strongly the frames thought of this right

2) Who is the militia? The militia as defined by the framers:.

 i)""I ask, sir, what is the militia? It is the whole people except for a few public officials"". George Mason

ii) ""The militia, who are in fact the effective part of the people at large, will render many troops quite unnecessary. They will form a powerful check upon the regular troops, and will generally be sufficient to over-awe them."" Tench Coxe
On October 21, 1787

iii) ""The power of the sword, say the minority..., is in the hands of Congress. My friends and countrymen, it is not so, for the powers of the sword are in the hands of the yeomanry of America from sixteen to sixty.
The militia of these free commonwealths, entitled and accustomed to their arms, when compared with any possible army, must be tremendous and irresistible. Who are the militia? Are they not ourselves? Is it feared, then, that we shall turn our arms each man against his own bosom."" Tench Coxe Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.



Now for the really fun stuff: machine guns, tanks, and fighter jets!

My grandparents paid for my parents cars, down payments multiple times, traditional fancy wedding, paid off mortgages, paid for my brother and I's starter car, private school, and a small amount for college. 


Compare this to what my parents have paid for.... nothing. Not only that, they said there will be no inheritance, as they have spent it all. My parents went part time at 50 yrs old and retired at 62. They made about 80k combined, so my grandparents have been subsidizing their lifestyle, rather than my parents retiring early due to high paying jobs. 


Now, my original post wanted to discuss the difference between silent generation attitude towards ""financial aid"", vs traditional boomers. This did not happen. I was called a whiny piece of shit by the first 8 comments and deleted the post. 


I'm 32 and make 60k in a large city and feel extremely poor. I have student loans and 2 roommates. I feel my parents used their leg up to spoil themselves, and my brother and I have could have continued to ""pay it forward"" as my grandparents did (we both live very cheap lifestyles) and be in a much more advantageous position... 


I think I am valid in feeling disappointed and I am NOT entitled. I view it the same way as thinking ""if I had bought 100 bitcoin in 2010 things would be so different"". ""If my parents didn't blow all my grandparents money, things would be so different"" etc etc No one gets called entitled for the former."

Raise taxes if you must to pay for it, but violent sexual crimes I don’t believe is adequately punished (yes punished, not rehabilitated) by therapy and prison time. These offenders, be they male or female, need to be sterilized so that not only can they not breed but lose any sort of sexual gratification they might get in committing these crimes. Their victims will never fully recover from their ordeal so therefore their attacker must experience a lasting hurt for the rest of their Iives. I believe more and more that rehabilitation would better suit than straight prison time, but when it comes to those who’ve committed violent sexual crime, no amount of rehabilitation is going to change people like that. There is nothing that their crime can be turned into some useful skill for society. To those who would argue “cruel and unusual” I consider the severity of the crime and find nothing cruel about it, nor unusual as we neuter dogs to help control aggression, humans are fundamentally no different."
1,2023-12-12,CMV: women's sex toys are the equivalent of male porn addiction,u/Snoo3014,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18gzspw/cmv_womens_sex_toys_are_the_equivalent_of_male/,changemyview,"Disclaimers: I enjoy using toys with women, and this isn't suggesting women should not use toys in any way. Nor is this suggesting men should not be learning what their partner likes and putting effort in to satsify them etc. Unfortunately most times this is brought up, it's in some sexist add-on about controlling women's bodies, not at all the point here.

So we hear a lot about male porn addiction and about how that is affecting men's sex drives and expectations of dating women, but how come we do not hear about what women's sex toys may doing for their ability to enjoy natural sex with men?

From my anecdotal experiences, a lot of the women that have trouble finishing on their own, use several different toys or many different toys. While it is isn't a problem for some women at all, I can't help but imagine that toys are used as a crutch by some women to avoid dealing with psychological hang ups about sex.

It's hard to imagine that women could possibly enjoy natural sex as much once they've become used to vibrators and dildos that pinpoint pleasure centers and overwhelm them with stimulation. It would seem once that becomes habitual, it would be much harder to orgasm from a penis or even manual clitoral stimulation etc. 

Essentially any sexual stimulation not done by a machine would have to be precise and stimulate exactly the right way while also account for the mental side of being relax, not distracted, etc.

 Again I'm not saying toys are bad, or that women shouldn't use them, but the conversation has been dominated toxic masculinity: if you can't make your girl orgasm, you're not man enough. VS. the very reasonable idea that it's very difficult or impossible to match the stimulation provided by specially designed sex toys and they create the same unrealistic expectations with women that porn addiction does with men.

Mandating secular governance, especially in the context of religious law, protects individual rights, and is necessary in society. Any religious  law is based on the interpretation of religious scriptures. Governments cannot be founded on a subjective belief. The lack of a standardization in interpretations is bound to result in ambiguity and inconsistency in legal rulings, making it impossible to establish a cohesive legal framework.   
Mandating adherence to a specific belief inherently restricts peoples agency and free choice. Every individual should have the autonomy to form their own beliefs, values, and moral convictions without coercion from the state.   
 

**Textual Examples:**  
 ^(Interpretation of all of the following verses are generally subject to the historical context of the religion, eg, the battles and conflicts during the early years of Islam. However many extremists use these verses to justify violence against others which is why religion cannot be interlinked with governing legislation.)

Obviously, a man can protect himself from factual rape allegations by not raping.

I'll use gendered language in the is post, but genders can be reversed.

I can think of two types of false rap allegations:

1. Malicious allegations.  These are situations where a woman knows she wasn't raped, but makes the accusation as some type of vendetta against the man, or to protect herself from ridicule or negativity.

2. Mistaken allegations.  These are situations where the woman fully believes she was raped, but the situation that occurred does not meet the legal definition of rape.  Legally, she validly consented to sex, even if she regretted granting that consent later.

For malicious allegations, there is essentially nothing a man can do to protect himself.  Even avoiding sex all together doesn't protect against malicious allegations.  Some malicious allegations could be avoided by making specific efforts to not piss women off, but that does little for, say, a situation where a woman falsely claims rape because she doesn't want her parents to know she consented to sex.

Mistaken allegations provide for more avenues of protection for men, but at some point you just have to take your partner at their word that they are consenting to the sex and are consenting for the right reasons.  So ""repeatedly checking in and reading body language"" is really the best protection for men attempting to avoid mistaken false allegations.

But if your partner is telling you that they want to have sex (either with words or actions), when they really don't want to have sex, what is a man to do?  It's reasonable to take her at her word, but you never really know if she's consenting because she wants sex, or if it's because she is afraid of what you'll do if she says no, or because she had a couple glasses of wine, or because she thinks it means you'll be her boyfriend.  And if it turns out to be some reason *other* than that she actually wanted to have sex, the man is at risk of being falsely accused.

Note that the examples I provided above as protections a man can take to avoid false rape allegations fall within the ""little"" a man can do.  So responses of ""look at your own post, there are lots of things a man can do"" won't sway my opinion."

In theory, the advice is sound. Getting more hobbies  increases the odds that you can connect with people, and therefore increase your odds at building a romantic connection.

My problem with this advice is it usually comes in response to guys complaining that they aren’t attractive enough, and rather than people just flat out tell them that, they say things like “real women don’t care about height or if you’re fit etc, they only care about (insert very basic bare minimum things that these guys probably already have like a job)”.

This is just flat out False, every woman I’ve ever known has had a height limit of some kind(some want taller than others granted). Most of them prefer atleast somewhat fit guys. 

I think if instead of fix your personality, people gave an actionable plan to improve superficially then whoever asked for advice would probably be helped a lot more than if they believed the solution was to pick up a new hobby."

I don’t agree with the logic of how she based her entire argument (which is totally besides my own argument), but I agree with her on the point that lions shouldn’t be crowned king of the animal kingdom. To give some more context to the girl’s argument, which is (again) besides the point, she claimed that tigers should be king, because (along with some other reasons) they’re bulkier. To be honest, I’ve never heard of such an illogical claim ever before. So here’s another take, since we’re doing this whole competition thing with animals: ants should be crowned king. Compared to tigers, ants are physically smaller, and, quite frankly, smaller than all of the other animals. They could easily be stomped on. But I think that entitling king of the jungle to certain animals by solely basing it off on physicalities, whether they’re big or small, is flawed. Ants are one of the most hardworking animals I’ve ever seen. Their petite physique makes them stand at a more advantageous level because they could easily duck preying eyes. It’s like they’re almost invisible. I don’t know about you, but that sounds extremely powerful to me. If they ever set their minds to something, you can trust that they’ll get it done and will not let anything stop them no matter what. I’m also generally confused about how and why we came to this (“this” meaning lions being crowned king) consensus. Why should we take our stupid, flawed hierarchical approach to the animal world? When did hierarchy begin?


TLDR; It’d make the most sense for ants to be crowned king of the animal kingdom."

Expanding its size. Currently, the size of the House of Reps is 435, I think it should have about 900 members.

For those saying ""it will be impossible to get things done"" Germany's Bundestag has around 730 members, large representative bodies work. I also think the House should be much more centered around debate than it, such as requiring *all* members to be in the chamber each day for two hours to debate. Democracy must be visible, and debate is vital to it.   

Perhaps more controversially, Congress should have a higher salary, for both members and staff. I have read somewhere that perhaps raising congressional salaries can reduce money taken from lobbyists. Raising the salary of staffers will make working on the hill more desirable and make it less likely for staffers to become lobbyists.   "

Reasons:

(1) Hammer and Sickle are commonly associated with authoritatian state capitalist regimes like China and the USSR. Avoiding their symbolism helps to reduce the stigma around communism.

(2) The world seems to be converging to a consensus of democracy and liberal progressivism. Changing the name of the ideology to economic justice and economic democracy helps communists to SUPERFICIALLY fit into the liberal democratic framework while working towards revolutionary change. It's harder for liberals to detect their true intents. 

(3) People tend to accuse anyone who dares to mention the word communism as a ""tankie"", which they're more often than not the opposite of the original definition of tankie. Avoiding traditionally communistic symbolism helps to avoid being stigmatized by liberals. 

(4) Changing the symbolisms and party names does not mean a change in the ideology itself. Look at how most ""socialist"" and ""labor"" parties in the West are neoliberals. It does not mean mixing communism with neoliberalism but rather means adapting to the times."

There *is* the obvious argument that advancements in psychology have allowed us to diagnose mental illnesses that were left untreated and undiagnosed in the past. I'm not refuting this, but what I do refute is that being the root cause of why [ADHD diagnoses have tripled since 2010](https://epicresearch.org/articles/number-of-adhd-patients-rising-especially-among-women). It makes too much sense to me that dwindling attention spans and constant hits of dopamine received through engagement on social media are a root cause of the massive increase in ADHD diagnoses we see today. I see this as a frightening issue when one of the most common medications to treat this disorder is amphetamines, which is essentially legalized meth. The difference between 30mg of Adderall and 30mg of methamphetamine is not actually that much; meth addicts just don't take 30mg of the stuff in practice. I am worried for us as a society when we are so quick to treat this problem with a potentially even bigger problem, without having serious concern for the root cause of it. 

ADHD is a disorder characterized by a dopamine deficiency in the body, and we treat it with amphetamines because, like meth, it is a drug that causes your brain to release dopamine. Outside of tolerance it does not build up in your system, meaning if you miss one single dose, your symptoms that day will be much worse than if you never started taking amphetamines at all. I am not trying to imply that we should ban amphetamines for people with ADHD who benefit from it, but I feel strongly that we should treat it as the sharp double edged sword that it is, and question why it was taken from its sheath to begin with. Many children these days grow up with smart phones and tablets watching YouTube and other forms of social media that have been proven to be incredibly addictive, that is a known issue. What doesn't seem to be debated as much though is the potential this has to turn into permanent drug dependency problems later on in life. Again, I'd love to be proven wrong on this."

There are only a handful of widely used sites (Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Tiktok) where the average person can state their views on various issues. The least censored of those are Twitter and Tiktok, both of which aren't exactly ideal for a forum type of discourse that Reddit has. With the release of the ""Twitter files"", Elon Musk revealed there's been widespread government initiated censorship behind the scenes to control the narrative. I'm not a fan of Elon Musk, but it's clear that restricting free speech online to fit government approved narratives isn't exactly a good thing since it can be used to restrict people's concerns over atrocities the government is complicit in / has been complicit in. I'm aware that a certain amount of narrative control is necessary (suppression of the anti vaccination crowd, racist narratives, etc), but narrative control and the usage of bot accounts to prevent uninhibited discourse over geopolitical issues isn't a good thing."
1,2023-12-12,Cmv: Bullying could make you evolve if you were taught how to deal with it,u/KiwiIsThe-Best,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18h8twm/cmv_bullying_could_make_you_evolve_if_you_were/,changemyview,"Just to start: not all bullying.  There are bullyings that happens purely for the joy or envy of the bully. These won't make you evolve.

But there are bullyings that you suffer just because you are too annoying and people around you are too impatient or immature to know how to deal with it. In this one, I am talking about myself. When I was a child I was pretty annoying and had an arrogance too elevate to hear people who tried to teach me with love. I just learned when I was humiliated. 

For example, I didn't change for a girl that was hating me the whole year calling me pick me (?) for standing an option different of hers during a homework.
But I did changed when people were calling me fake, annoying for speaking too loud and entering in all friend groups as if I was invited or wanted. I was being annoying.
Joining the bullies with jokes were my escape to all the times it started, but besides that, I also tried to find what was bothering and change if it looked appropriate.

It is important, yes, to teach kids that there will be mean people saying bad things about them, that they shouldn't care and trust in themselves. But I also think is important to make the kid learn to differentiate the purposes of each attack and know how to deal with each one. 

Today we have people on internet that don't even know how to differentiate haters from people who are annoyed by their behaviour. For them, everyone are just haters that envy this main character they are, wow.

Knowing that, yes, bullies are immatures and insecure people, but they still exist and you will need to deal with it. In fact, you may even NEED their agressiveness to hit something you weren't hitting by yourself. So even in the worst situation, make good use of it. Like the celebrities using the haters engagement? Using the bullies to analyse how we are impacting society."

If we all know that a healthy fetus is going to become a baby, then it is logical to look at it as a baby.

The same way if someone attempts to murder someone, or there was a conspiracy to murder, we acknowledge the intended outcome— to kill someone, and charge them appropriately.

The intended outcome of an abortion is to prevent a baby from living. Aka, to kill a baby.

An example I gave was, we’ve all heard of the hypothetical to go back in time and kill Hitler as a baby/kid/teen whatever, before he was Fuhrer. It’s because we all know the outcome is he will become Fuhrer, so in our minds, we are killing Fuhrer Hitler and not random baby Hitler.

Not really related, but why do people still feel the need to comment ""first""?  
Firstly, (no pun intended… originally. Sorry if that's too much off a irritating non player character comment for you (;), as far as I know, most creators (I'm not trying to generalize) don't exactly care if you're the first one to see their post. Furthermore, if I had to guess, the begin the content creator's audience is, the less likely they are to care!  
And Secondly, I hate to break it to you, but, unless this aforementioned creator has a very small audience, you're probably not actually the first person to see their video (forget it if they've got a massive fanbase).  
Personally, I wouldn't comment anything like that, especially on an established influencer's (or deinfluencer's) post(s), if anything, purely on the basis that, more likely than not, I'm not the first person seeing this video… not to mention to fact that there are probably already numerous other people commenting just that!  
Have you, personally, noticed any trends what with these sorts of comments ie as far as age goes?  
I promise I am not trying to target anyone! And fair, even that comment is entirely unoriginal. Point made. Case closed! Am I right? Haha  
tl;dr  
Is calling a random person on the internet a non player character a joke to those who do it, or are they serious?  
Are there people who actually believe making these comments is somehow going to make a difference and free the internet of low effort comments and trolls?  
Do you think these people are Internet Trolls or NPCS? I'm genuinely curious!  
Optionally, why do people still eagerly comment ""First"" or ""first!"" especially taking into account the fact that, more than likely, they're are entirely mistaken?  
Noticed any trends what with these sorts of comments ie as far as age goes?

And the kid-shows are absolutely unbearable to watch for adults. However, Bollywood doesn't have this problem. Most of their films can be enjoyed by both kids and adults, like 3 Idiots, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, etc.

Even then, Bollywood films are very emotional, with their dance numbers, their over-acting, etc. The tone that they try to show makes a lasting impact on you via the songs and over-acting.

They also don't need to be realistic or take things too seriously. They can make the most bizzare plot in existence and still make it enjoyable. Eg.Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge; in a part of the movie, Simran climbs up a mountain. Raj searches for her everywhere and eventually finds her on the mountain. She had built a campfire. He tried to get her home, but then she runs away again. After that he finds her in a swimming pool and finally brings her home. In this sequence, nobody complains about the absurdity of the situation, and instead talks about how comical it was.

This is why I feel like Bollywood is better than Hollywood."
1,2023-12-13,Cmv: The reason why most young men are single is because they're simply too afraid to approach women.,u/Actual_Parsnip4707,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18hajpt/cmv_the_reason_why_most_young_men_are_single_is/,changemyview,"We've heard the stats about how there's so much more single young men than there are young women within the 18-29 range. I believe it was around 62% of men in that age range were single where as around 30% for women. This has been a huge topic of discussion this past year and lots of people have blamed things like dating apps, womens high standards, social media and so on. While I do believe that these things play a role I think the biggest thing that's fueling this is that younger men just don't have the confidence to approach and chat up women as much as previous generations did. According to research, around 50% of men from age 18-25 have never even approached a woman in person. So of course if men aren't even putting in effort and trying to initiate contact with women then of course they are going to be remain single. And the number one reason that men of this age range states for lack of approach with women wasn't fear of being accused of sexual assault or allegations but rather a fear of REJECTION. 
Now as a 25 year old man myself I can sort of reasonate with this. Our generation have been lectured heavily on sexual assault briefings whether it be from schools or jobs and when you're constantly being told these messages about SA and consent. And also hearing all these stories in the media like Amber heard and most recently Trevor braurer with false allegation stories. Yes I believe lots of guys will become hesitant to approach women but that's just my perspective.
Things like the red pill/manosphere has made points about how womens standards have become delusional which I do agree to some extent this might be true. But I think this really mostly apply to big urban metropolitan areas like LA, New York, Miami etc where if you're not a millionaire you're basically a nobody so I don't think for average normies this is the case."

i went to school both with kids who we're adopted and kids surrogate kids and in my experience the surrogate kids were way better off then the adopted kids. 

from personal experience adopted kids almost always have some abadonment issues from being abandoned by their parents, surrogate kids on the other hand have atleast one biological parent and even then they don't see the non-biological parent as any less they're parents

so when i have kids i really want to do it with surrogacy and i would encourage other gay men (as well as infertile women) to do the same

Personally, I'm a European and I understand that it's not my place to judge American democracy and that is exactly why I'm posting this - for someone to challenge me on my view and prove me wrong. 

Either way, ask most Europeans and they'll all agree that after seeing news coming out of the US they don't respect US democracy anymore and believe it is a flawed and failed system. That's not saying that European democracies are perfect or even not broken but it's saying that the US isn't something that people look up or aspire to.

As for why US politics and democracy is broken there is so much to say that this post would start to get boring but I think most people are familiar with these issues so it will just be bullet points:

* Polarization and very little compromise between the two parties + red state/blue state divide
* Trump and Biden being the most likely candidates in the 2024 election
* Politicians being extremely disconnected with voters due to the 2 party system where voters might only very slightly agree with the person they're voting with
* Legal corruption i.e. lobbying and dark money going into politics on both sides
* Lack of trust in institutions - I saw a poll where I think less than 20% trusted Congress
* Gerrymandering and politicized state and federal courts

1,2023-12-13,CMV: Infidelity is a form of psychological violence,u/Unusual-Double-2003,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18hfp5b/cmv_infidelity_is_a_form_of_psychological_violence/,changemyview,"In romantic relationships, I firmly believe that infidelity is an act of psychological violence, a breach of trust so severe it inflicts damage whether or not it is discovered. This perspective is grounded in the belief that relationships are built on an implicit 'social contract' of mutual respect and fidelity. When this contract is broken by cheating, it's not merely a mistake; it's a profound disruption of the relational balance, resulting in emotional and psychological distress.  
  
This contract isn't based on formal vows or explicit promises. It's an unspoken yet pivotal understanding of loyalty. Much like societal laws maintain order, this mutual commitment to fidelity underpins the emotional security of a relationship. Infidelity, therefore, represents a unilateral alteration of these implicit terms, eroding the relationship's trust and respect foundation. The act itself, irrespective of its discovery, is a form of psychological harm.  
  
Let's put it in another perspective: When setting the foundations of a relationship, if people didn’t know whether they'd be the betrayer or the betrayed, it's unlikely they would condone infidelity. This suggests a universal recognition of its harmful nature.  
  
The comparison to gossip might be illustrative here. Gossip, like cheating, involves a betrayal of trust and can cause damage even if the subject never learns of it. The harm lies in the act of betrayal itself, not necessarily in its exposure.  
  
Therefore, the psychological impact of infidelity is not solely contingent on its discovery; the betrayal alone is damaging. It violates the essential mutual trust and understanding that maintains the relationship’s integrity.  
  
When infidelity is revealed, its psychological violence becomes more explicit through the pain and betrayal experienced by the aggrieved partner. However, the true gravity of infidelity lies in its very occurrence, marking it as a significant ethical violation and a form of psychological violence.

That means that in practice only two parties get seats in parliament/congress and maybe in certain countries some minor third and fourth countries. The most stark example of this is the United States - where it's all Democrats and Republicans.

I think that two party systems are a terrible idea. First of all, they contribute somewhat to polarization as there is often an ""you're either A or B mentality"" which is rarely seen in countries where there's multiple political parties. Yes, it can still be seen there but it seems more extreme in two party systems. In the US you're often either a Democrat or Republican and in the UK you're either for Labour or Conservatives.

The main reason though is that they limit voter choice incredibly, force voters to choose the lesser evil and result in elected politicians not actually representing their voters. Let's say someone is a moderate Republican, because they vote Republican they're likely to end up voting with an 'extreme' Republican because that's who is running in their district. Or a progressive Democrat ends up voting for a moderate because that's who is running. In a multi party system, one has more choice. Sure, you'll still disagree with many things but at least there will be more in common. One could presume that if there were multiple viable parties in the US there would at least be parties that would be: progressive, moderate Democrat, moderate/traditional Republican, new/Trump Republican. 

Finally more political parties means compromise and having less extreme measures that are likely to be unpopular in the country. Yes, compromise can be unattractive and can take time but arguably it's worse than politicians imposing basically what they want and what is likely not even what their voters believe anyway."

It empowers individuals, breaking down barriers of geography, economics, and time, creating a more enlightened and fair global society.

By ensuring that books are accessible to everyone, we create a shared reservoir of knowledge, enabling diverse individuals to enrich their understanding and actively contribute to their communities. This commitment aligns with the principles of cultural exchange, fostering connections across the globe and promoting empathy through the exploration of different perspectives.

The ongoing accessibility of books is crucial for dismantling socio-economic disparities. When literature is within reach for all, regardless of financial status, it becomes a tool for leveling the playing field, ensuring that educational opportunities are not confined to a privileged few. This democratization of knowledge contributes to a more equitable society, where individuals can pursue their aspirations irrespective of socio-economic circumstances.

In summary, from my standpoint, advocating for universal and perpetual access to books is a commitment to building a world where the transformative power of literature is harnessed for the benefit of all, promoting enlightenment, empathy, and equal opportunity across generations."

Immigration is frankly one thing that I believe people in all political sides just gets completely wrong. The main views are either discriminatory to those with unskilled jobs or reckless and lacking foresight into the consequences of lack of assimilation.

Here's how I believe the US should view immigration:

\- The US should stop highlighting high skilled workers and also give importance to unskilled workers: Yes they are essential, but you know what else is essential? Jobs that Americans won't do. Warehouse workers, fast food jobs, gardening. Why is it because certain individuals are smarter they should get a chance to live in America, while unskilled workers who are hard workers are shafted? This goes against the very ideals of  ""Give me your tired, your poor,  your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!” America's greatest strength is giving opportunities to those who wouldn't have them in their host country. By only letting in high skilled workers, not only is it discriminatory to those willing to contribute to American society and the economy, but it goes against the very principals of America that make the country so great.

\- Don't let in everyone, let in the right people: Not every immigrant is going to assimilate. They just want to selfishly use America without contributing to the culture or embrace the way of life. There must be a way to weed them out. Give them history lessons, make them do a civics test for green cards, just find a way to make sure they'll embrace the US way of life and not screw over both citizens and immigrants. Also more background checks, make sure they're not criminals or something. There are many people who are American in all but name, and they would make for fine Americans, but there are also those who don't care about the system and just want to selfishly benefit from the US and not assimilate.

I love America, and I dream of the day I get my green card, but frankly there are immigrants who are putting a bad name on immigration. I hope one day the immigration system gets fixed."

Both the DNC and RNC are private companies, under no obligation to follow their own rules, as evidenced by the obvious cheating in 2016. The democratic party decided to lose with Clinton than win with sanders, and they openly cheated voters out of their say. ""The court recognized that the DNC treated voters unfairly, but ruled that the DNC is a private corporation; therefore, voters cannot protect their rights by turning to the courts"" (ivn.us). 

The democratic strategy is (and has been since clinton at least) to fail over and over, so they can continue to fundraise. If trump was in office, he'd be doing the same thing as biden in the middle east, except it'd be expected, and the DNC would fundraise like hell. If the democratic party adopted their stances from 100 years ago, they'd win every election in a landslide, but they don't, because they don't want to win. In the 75th congress (1937-39), the house was made up of 334 democrats and 88 republicans, with the highest tax bracket at 79%. 

They want to keep the balance of power, keep feigning the outrage at the other, keep pointing fingers, so they can both keep fucking the people for corporate dollars. The democrats had the presidency, house, and senate multiple times and could have enacted policies to save the environment, tax the rich, regulate industry. 
""More than 70% of Americans say that the U.S. healthcare system needs either 'fundamental changes' or to be 'completely rebuilt.'"" 

If we want change we must vote third party. We can't just vote for biden because ""he's better than trump,"" because the parties are the problem, not the candidates. If the candidates weren't propped up by the parties, neither candidate would stand a chance. We have to go back to electing people that represent our interests instead of forcing ourselves to vote for the ""lesser of two evils."""

In several countries mainly in Europe, there are laws against holocaust denial. This makes absolutely no sense for countries that claim to believe in freedom of speech.

Whether it's offensive, or distorting history - people should have the right to voice their thoughts. Nowhere in the world are flat earthers jailed (as far as I'm aware), or those that think the transatlantic slave trade was good, so why does denying the holocaust get special treatment?

The truth fears no investigation. Denying an event is not hate speech, nor incitement to violence. There is no good reason why it shouldn't be protected under freedom of speech.

Besides, once you do that..where do you draw the line? Denying the existence and crucifixion of Jesus Christ is illegal, next? Because to some, there is overwhelming evidence that it happened, and denying it is extremely offensive.

It urgently needs more support, yet Republicans are holding up such aid unless the D's pass an immigration/border reform bill. It is looking increasingly unlikely that a deal will be done by year's end or even after.

The Democrats had **many** opportunities to prevent things from getting to this point.

Back in March 2022, Western support for Ukraine (and bipartisan support in Congress) was at its most feverish high, right after the invasion had begun. Back then, Biden and the D's could have plausibly called for a massive $300 billion military aid package (or something of that sort) that could have lasted for the entirety of the Ukraine war - and prevent the need for any further appeals to Congress. That would have been striking when the iron was still hot. Sure, the Kremlin fans like Marjorie Taylor-Greene, Matt Gaetz, etc. would have objected, but the pro-Ukraine faction was large enough then that it would have still been the majority.

Another opportunity was Lend-Lease. The Ukraine Lend-Lease Act was passed in May 2022 but expired in Sept 2023. The Biden administration made *no* use of Lend-Lease whatsoever, when it could have been a great workaround to circumvent Republican opposition. In fact, Lend-Lease was originally passed **precisely** to let Biden get around Republican shenanigans, yet the administration totally allowed it to go to waste.

Lastly, it should have been clear that the D's were likely to lose the House in the 2022 midterms. Midterms historically almost always go against the party that holds the White House. It should have been clear that the time to get any major Ukraine aid done was while the D's still had their House majority, not afterwards.

It should have been obvious to Biden and the D's that support for Ukraine was going to fade rapidly in Congress and among Republicans - and they should have anticipated this and called for a huge amount of aid at the very *beginning* when the iron was still hot, or used Lend-Lease, rather than letting it cool and **now** trying to get Republicans to approve $61 billion for Ukraine. It's almost as if Biden and the D's appear surprised that Republicans are now obstructing Ukraine aid, when it should have been obvious that that's what they would do. The Democrats behaved as if they didn't need to strike when the iron was hot - or as if they thought the iron would *always* remain hot.

Sorry to all of my foreign friends.

We have created a very substantial administrative state with agencies like the EPA, DHS, EEOC, FCC, FTC, SSA, and on and on and on. While I am personally of the belief that these agencies are absolutely critical to maintain a functioning society, many do not (including SCOTUS Justices Gorsuch and Alito, who are very eager to dismantle these agencies and the administrative state altogether.) Here is my rationale for why a robust administrative state is necessary:

* **Administrative agencies facilitate bring to bear specialized knowledge that facilitates creative problem solving**
   * These agencies are often staffed with scientists and policy experts from diverse backgrounds. Appointing experts in various fields to regulate those fields gives them the opportunity to focus on formulating creative solutions to problems that arise with our societal infrastructure. This is much more desirable than asking politicians to create regulations on issues where they have no expertise to contribute. 
* **Administrative agencies act largely outside the pressure of politics**
   * The extra link in the chain between democratically elected representatives and the administrative state is no big deal because people have told the legislature and executive branch what they want through their votes, those branches get their people to work, and the agency will then create policies that reflect the will of the people based on their vote
* **Presidential Administration**
   * Because the President is the head of the administrative state, any major regulation created by an agency will be analyzed by the white house through a cost-benefit analysis performed by people responsive to and controlled by the President.
   * This allows the President to act as a final check on any regulation. Involving the President in administration allows someone who was chosen by the public to have influence over these large regulatory decisions in an effective way.
* **Societal Inequity**
   * In a society without an administrative state, it becomes increasingly difficult to resolve societal inequities because industry is no longer accountable for the harm that they cause. This does not only hurt poor people, but also consumers, laborers, etc.

You can change my view by making the argument that less regulation is better for everyone, not just for industry. I am open to changing my position."
1,2023-12-13,CMV: Mandatory giving of dna samples at birth isn't a bad thing.,u/Spektra54,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ho32t/cmv_mandatory_giving_of_dna_samples_at_birth_isnt/,changemyview,"So this is inspired by the recap of the sub. Two of the recap comments are about a post on mandatory paternity testing. A lot of them go on about dna database bad. However I didn't see many reasons why exactly is it bad. Here are my arguments why it's a good thing.

The most obvious one is it would solve false paternity. Which I think is a good thing. 

Another on mentioned often in the thread is it would help track down fathers who abandoned their kids. This was mentioned as a point discourage men from agreeing but I fail to see how this would be a bad thing.

A lot of people also said it would help catch rapists, but also a lot of criminals as having a dna sample means you have a great chance of finding the person. 

The above three points were mentioned in the comments from the recap but I don't see how it is a bad thing. 

Another great benefit I could see is that it would help treating adopted kids. And I am not talking about finding birth parents. This database would allow any one persons doctor acces to their medical history. I belive this would help both those who are adopted but also people with ancestors. In general a great database of peoples familial connections could help doctors.

Now the expense is a great argument against and creating the database would be a lot of work. So I will concede that this might not be a great thing ""right now"". But if we make a database and the cost of genetic testing goes down this seems like a good project to me.

So to change my view I am looking for ways this database could be used for evil and if those evils outweigh the possible gains. 

I will try to answer all claryfing questions."

He ordered drug dealers and users to be executed. My plan isn't quite that severe. I just like to use that as a moniker. 

So what is my plan?

Switzerland builds facilities for users. Where they can come and get high safely. There is no compulsion to quit. However there is a lot of resources to do so. 

Duterte we already discussed. He waged a very literal war on drugs. 

So this is what we do

1) (Switzerland) Build facilities all over United States. These are specialized places that sell safe drugs LEGALLY. You can come and get high as fuck. 

We would require medical check ups (maybe once every 6 months). Offered for free at the facility. This is to make sure people are healthy enough to do the drugs. With added perk of potentially catching some other shit that they should get treated. 

There would be ample opportunities and resources to help you quit. Including housing and helping people find work again. BUT THERE WOULD BE NO COMPULSION TO DO SO. You can just come and get high as much as you want. 

These places would have medical personelle on staff in case of overdoses. Which should be rarer with regulated drugs sold. As well as law enforcement if necessary (some would need it).

THE CATCH IS you can't take a lot of it home. You can get long release tablets to keep you from going into withdrawals. But you can't just get a bunch of heroin and walk away. You have to do it there. Perhaps allow a smaller amount of weaker drugs like percocets. But only a small amount. The goal here is to keep the streets free of drugs....

2) (Duterte) Go balls to the wall on the dealers. Introduce strict mandatory minimums for dealers. Give people manslaughter charges for selling shit like fentanyl. 

On top of that massively increase police budgets. At least for a short while. Use snitches, informants, undercover cops, surveillance. Use our imagination and ingenuity to make it as difficult and dangerous as possible for the dealers to operate. 

The idea here is to make the average dealer simply nope out. 

Because the user now doesn't really have to deal with them. It's a double sided assault on their profession. 

As far as cost. It would be expensive initially. But the amount of $ we waste on regulating drugs at the moment. Would be a worthwhile long term investment if it can indeed bring down the amount of illicit drugs available on the streets. 

Some final thoughts:

A) Possession would still be illegal. But for anything we allow to take home you'd get an ""easy to get"" prescription. So if you're caught with that it's legal.

B) The facilities would need some debaucherous activities such as night clubs and the like. Cause a lot of people like to party when they get high. That would make it more expensive but not impossible. 

C) If you tried to take something home you're not supposed to or if you got caught driving high after the facility. That would be a hefty charge. "

If this standard is not met, then there is something ill, wrong, or indecent.

What do I mean by unreasonable, there has been, to my knowledge, NO institution that has had a population that is representative of the population. When looking at police officer demographics in NY during the 1900's there was a dipropionate number of Irish-Americans. In Hawaii during ww2, a disproportionate amount of  labor was conducted by Japanese-Americans. A disproportionate amount of army officers are asian. Not to mention looking at sports demographics.

I don't think this is true.  
  
When I say far right I mean explicitly fascistic and or White nationalist.  
  
First while I reject the notion that Donald Trump and his restructured GOP are especially different from pervious iterations of the party, even if you think that they are especially far right. They do not prove a far right takeover is immanent. They keep losing, Trump lost in 2020,his party lost in 2022 and his party keeps losing stat elections.  
  
Second rising immigration will make a far right takeover impossible. Immigrants for reasons so obvious I refuse to explain them. Are not going to support the far right (or at least the far right as we understand it in the west). White people are just losing what little power they had to Jewish people, South Asians and Middle Eastern peoples. They are also facing extinction in a century. There is no way they will just magically undo all of this tomorrow.  
  
Third my final point and what leads me into why I am writing this. The capitalist class isn't on there side. Look at what is discussed at the Ivy League. It isn't anything far right. Look at the marketing campaigns of basically every big corporation, do you see any theses or ideas that can even be remotely interpreted as far right ? No but you see a lot of pontifications about rainbow capitalism and diversity. Even if you argue this is only for money and does not show sincere support. Look at the hiring practices at these companies. Basically every corporation wants more diversity and less White people. Can you find me one company in the last decade that goes out of it's way to hire more White people ? Not to mention all the diversity training and consulting these companies engage in. Look at Black Lives Matter got 10 billion in donations from the richest people and corporations on the planet, can you name me a White activist group that got anything even remotely comparable to that ?  
  
So why do I write this ? I think a lot of you are going to dismiss me out of hand without considering what I am saying, which is unfortunate because I have a feeling we agree on most of the important issues.  
  
I bring this up because I think fixating so much on a far right takeover that isn't going to happen distracts from the real issues at hand. That being capitalism and the climate change caused by it. I have seen a worrying trend in online discourse for a lot of leftist to alley themselves with liberal capitalist because they believe the only alternative is fascism. My message to all of you is that we don't need to live like this. Fascism will never win and we need to demand more of society. The liberals are ripping us off like Velcro.

&#x200B;

I think people just hate White people so much that they ignore the crimes of rich and powerful POC in some misguided aim at revenge.  

I also see people complain about the 2 party system in America, not realizing that this is how it stays in power. Idiots on both sides think the sky will fall if the other neo liberal capitalist party wins

78,2023-12-13,CMV: Twitch needs to Ban NSFW content,u/lovestocomment,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18hrtli/cmv_twitch_needs_to_ban_nsfw_content/,changemyview,"I recently looked into some of the changes to twitches policies around NSFW content. Basically, its allowed but won't be featured on the home page. 

Here is my opinion on this. I think there is a time and place for everything. And I personally love twitch because it's a platform focused on gamers enjoying other gamers playing games or talking about games. It also helped to normalize gaming and fights the stigmas that existed where gamers are losers, girls don't game or they are bad at gaming etc. it also helped to fight the stigma that a ""gamer girl"" is just woman dressed somewhat sexually with colored hair. I also like that kids and teens (male and female)  would go on the platform and enjoy it's content without the worry of being exposed to NSFW content. 

Now all of that progress will be lost. I have family members and friends with kids who have caught their kids looking and or listening to NSFW streams. And as someone who watches streams on twitch I sometimes see these 18+ streams popping as recommendations. I'm not against sexual content in general. Not do I moralize sex or anything of that sort. However when I see content creators on there engaging in NSFW suggestive activities (teasing) and recommending their audience to join their OF. It's just perpetuating the issue of boys and girls being overly exposed to NSFW content. It also brings body image issues and how women and men objectifying each other. Yes, there filters implemented and age restriction stuff that could be used. And yes, one could argue that the parents should monitor their kids viewing activities. But no one is going sit and actually watch their kids watch video streams. 

Why does that type of content needs to be on a game streaming platform? Idk, I'm just sick of see young men and women being exploited and over exposed that that type of content. Maybe twitch should create a separate platform that type of content. 

There is the policy update:

I think it’s neat and I do understand crypto, I’ve been using Bitcoin since 2010, and I have researched all of it almost obsessively during the Covid bull run and ultimately keep coming back to the same conclusion.

Bitcoin is worthless.

Sure, some countries with unhinged leaders are trying to switch to it, and yes, it does help some people in Africa who don’t have banking access still have a currency to use, but those are extremely niche examples and don’t work well with something as volatile as Bitcoin in the long run.

It’s also incredibly deflationary by nature which only sounds good in theory but every lost wallet is just Bitcoin that is removed from the supply forever. No one can add more Bitcoin to the network to stimulate any type of economic growth.

The network is slow and relies on WAY too much energy to run. It’s impractical for day to day purchases and it can’t be a real currency until everyone accepts it, which is highly speculative.

As a worldwide store of value, the entire world would have to agree that it is worth something. I agree it’s easier to store than gold but it’s still reliant on a functioning network to run. If some apocalyptic event knocks out the grid, your bitcoin will still technically be there, but accessing it or trading it will be impossible.

You can use it to buy questionable shit on the internet, but that’s about the only purpose it ever had for me.

Every single crypto investor is doing it for one reason. They think it’ll make them rich. Which means they are buying it now, to sell to someone for more later. That makes it a Ponzi. Eventually someone is going to get stuck with the hot potato.

Big institutions are buying up the lions share of it. People like Michael Saylor and the Winklevoss Twins will be trillionaires if it actually takes off and everyone will have scraps of scraps. That’s not the economic equalizer. That’s the same wealth hoarding we already have amplified by a million.

My theory is big institutions are making their bitcoin plays and creating hype just so they can cash out on retail investors leaving the casuals high and dry. Or just keeping it going forever as a Ponzi they can manipulate whenever they need to generate wealth for themselves."
1,2023-12-13,CMV: dating advice is pointless as it matters much less what you do and much more what you look like,u/wettigingss,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ht0dn/cmv_dating_advice_is_pointless_as_it_matters_much/,changemyview,"So when I say this I’m talking about the majority of people within serious dating age range (18 to 30). I’m sure 50 year olds have opinions but there aren’t many of them dating. The majority of people dating are in the 18 to 30 age range. 

So dating dynamics have changed as social media and online dating as well as women no longer having to settle for a relationship. So first for women I would argue dating advice is pointless as in most stages of dating they are not the driving force. They play a passive role and it doesn’t necessitate effort other than being around males to be desired. I once saw a tweet that said something along the line of “most women on 600 pound life are married, eat that cake sis”. It’s a joke but it’s serious, women do not have to try to find sex or a date. 

Men on the other hand, play an active role so things are different. But I would still argue dating advice is pointless because it doesn’t make a difference. What’s the most important part of dating is being physically attractive to a wide range of women. That is the only sure fire way to be successful in dating. On or offline. People say things like “be funny, be kind, be xyz” but it’s honestly all bullshit as they do not guarantee success. 

Being conventionally attractive does guarantee some level of success."

Just read [this mind-blowing article](https://www.nationalmemo.com/american-life-expectancy) about how the policies of your state might literally be shortening or lengthening your lifespan.  
  
Turns out, there's a growing gap in life expectancy between red and blue states. Here's the deal:  
  
1.Conservatives love the ""futility thesis"": This fancy term basically means they think public programs and policies don't work, so why bother? But studies are showing a clear link between liberal policies like anti-smoking laws, Medicaid expansion, and income support, and higher life expectancy.  
  
2.Red states, on the other hand, tend to have lower life expectancies. This isn't just about income or education. Even when you control for those factors, the states with more conservative policies seem to have worse health outcomes.  
  
3.It's not just about a feeling: Studies show that restrictive gun laws in blue states actually reduce gun deaths, both homicides and suicides.  
  
4.Federalism? More like ""dominate where we can"": Conservatives often talk a big game about federalism and letting states decide, but then they push for national abortion bans and preempt local laws. Seems like they just want control where they have it.  
  
So, what does this mean for us?  
  
1.Liberals and progressives, keep fighting the good fight! Your policies might literally be saving lives.  
  
2.Everyone, pay attention to your state's policies! They could be impacting your health and well-being, whether you realize it or not.  
  
3.Let's have a real conversation about this. This isn't just about politics, it's about life and death. ️  
  
What are your thoughts on this? Do you think state policies have a real impact on life expectancy?

They make us work for very long periods of time, which is bad. They also gaslight us into thinking work is the most important thing. Schools make us work for 5 days all to be free for 2. 2 days of rest after 5 days of work isn't enough. Schools care more about silence and order rather than learning. They will get a kid in trouble if they don't do a thing the way they want even though a kid might learn better that way. Schools prioritize order, not learning. Schools are about teaching kids obedience, not learning. Schools actually don't like smart kids, because no school wants a kid smart enough to know what's happening. As someone with autism, I notice schools praise me more if I'm obedient rather than if I'm smart."

I just think it is offensive and cannot be justified at all. It just isn't nice at all. I saw someone wearing a confederate soldier costume, without understanding that it is offensive.

1,2023-12-13,CMV: Santa Claus is actually the Devil,u/Focustazn,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18htwm3/cmv_santa_claus_is_actually_the_devil/,changemyview,"HEAR ME OUT!  
  
I heard this theory from some honestly, pretty culty fundamentalist Christian groups when I was in high school and thought it was hilariously stupid.  
  
In college, a psychology professor was going through a section on the Jungian Shadow Theory, and had us do a writing exercise where we imagine a fictional character that is regarded as a hero/protagonist/positive character, and bring about what darkness may lurk in their shadow.  
  
My classmates went with the usual, Batman, Superman, Ethan Hunt, Jason Bourne, Mr. Incredible and I forgot what else. One of them did a piece on Lucille Ball's ""Lucy Ricardo,"" which was quite interesting.  
  
My mind wandered to the aforementioned crazy notion of Santa Claus being the devil, and I started trying to find tidbits of info that matched up. The existing stuff seemed to be mostly about the anagram between ""Satan"" and ""Santa,"" and very little else. But as I thought this through, I began running into more...  
  
The Name  
  
Although ""Santa"" is derived from the word ""Saint,"" the current version of it is an anagram for Satan. In addition, ""Old Saint Nick"" is oddly reminiscent of Satan's nickname, ""Old Nick.""  
  
Santa Claus Himself  
  
Santa is based loosely on Saint Nicholas, a bishop rumored to have given money anonymously as gifts to the poor, including paying the dowries of a few girls whose families could not afford it.  
  
However, ""Santa Claus"" is a mythical interpretation of this person at best, and is effectively now recognized by culture as an imaginary deity due to his immortal nature in the myth.  
  
\- He is immortal in nature, and capable of traversing the entire surface of Earth over the course of one night to reach all the children.  
  
\- He is a big, red, old deity; Satan is referred to in Revelation 12 as ""Great Red Dragon""  
  
\- He doesn't come through any doors or windows. He comes down the chimney, which could be a metaphor; he comes out of the fire to give his gifts, and then goes back into the fire.  
  
\- The myth makes it a point that his laugh is a deep, bellowing ""HO HO HO,"" which, if you think about it, could be an evil, villainous laugh.  
  
\- Christian songs are almost always, ""grace, love, salvation, holiness, our mighty God,"" etc. But Santa Claus' song?  
  
""You better watch out, you better not cry, better not pout... Santa Claus is COMING to town""  
  
Is that not terrifying, if you examine it a bit? We are supposed to be grateful and love our holy God, because He welcomes us with His limitless Grace. But we have to watch out and keep quiet when Santa comes to town.  
  
\- We offer him cookies and milk on the table, similarly to how many ancient cultures place fruits at a shrine to offer them to ancestors and their (false) Gods.  
  
\- He audits the children of the world for their behavior; Satan is known as ""The Accuser"" who attempts to discredit us in the eyes of God.  
  
\- The contract we have with Santa is good behavior in exchange for material gifts. If we behave poorly, we are given coal, or a foreshadowing of our fate in Hell. In any case, salvation and grace are nowhere near the picture.  
  
\- He lives in the North Pole, essentially at the ""Top"" of the world, as he is the King of Earth, and that place attracts negative current.  
  
\- His workshop is a place where little pointy-eared demons do his bidding, fulfilling material desires in exchange for children's souls.  
  
\- He operates on ""Magic,"" which as we know in reality is demonic power.  
  
The Christmas Tradition  
  
\- We decorate a Fir (or sometimes pine) tree and parents place the gifts underneath it, which is similar to pagan practices worshipping Satan. The physical gifts are then given to children, ""From Santa"" symbolically at least, but through outright lies of his physical existence in practice.  
  
At the top of this tree is not a Star of David; it's typically some Angel figurine (which could be Lucifer) or a Pentagram.  
  
\- We abbreviate the holiday to ""Xmas"" which is derived from the Greek X, the first letter of the Greek, ""χριστός"" or ""Christos."" However, this does not necessarily mean Jesus Christ. The word simply means ""Anointed One,"" but if you remember, Lucifer is called ""Anointed cherub that covereth.""  
  
Of course, this could apply to the English ""Christ"" as well; it is strange, however, that it just turned out to be the case that they needed to abbreviate it this way. The letter ""X"" looks like a toppled cross; whether that can mean anything is up to subjective interpretation.  
  
\- The day of the celebration is the same day the Romans used to celebrate their ""Sun God."" The reason it was turned into the Christian holiday is debated; some believe it to be Christians trying to take the pagan holiday for themselves, and others believe it's because the day is exactly 9 months after the March 25 crucifixion of Christ. In any case, it was a pagan holiday that eventually found itself being used to celebrate Jesus' birthday.  
  
Is Santa Claus just Satan?  
  
It seems Santa Claus overshadows Christ on His own supposed celebratory day. Remember that Antichrist means ""In place of Christ."" What better plan on Satan's part than to use God's actual holiday to act as the counterfeiter of our creator God.  
  
I know a lot of people come up with explanations such as, ""X happened because of Y"" or ""This is named \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ person did \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, it's totally Christian."" However, I'd like to open another paradigm. What's to say Satan can't use the good intentions of Christians to fulfill his plans? In fact, isn't that precisely his goal to begin with, to corrupt as many otherwise God-fearing people as possible? What if, scattered throughout history, these events happened to create a counterfeit Christ in order to corrupt a celebration of Jesus' birth, changing its meaning?  
  
\- Instead of Grace and Salvation, good behavior and material gifts/prosperity  
  
\- Encouraging the culture to lie to its children about the existence of Santa in a physical sense in order to elicit good behavior from them, rather than through Godly principles  
  
\- Diminishing the importance of Jesus Christ on His supposed holiday in exchange for Santa, elves, and magic  
  
Anyway, let me know what you think. Even if it's false, it may have the makings of a good creepypasta. Also, forgive me if there are logical holes everywhere. I came up with this a decade ago, and it was considerably more robust then than it is now."
1,2023-12-13,CMV: UFC/MMA will Never be a Top Sport,u/Funtimes856,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18hut0i/cmv_ufcmma_will_never_be_a_top_sport/,changemyview,"As the title states, I don't think the UFC nor the MMA marketing companies (Bellator, OneFC, etc.) will ever be considered as **quality** or as **consumed/viewed** as mainstream sports. 

I consider mainstream sports to be NFL, NBA, MLB, English Premier League and the NHL. These are the most profitable, well established sports, and viewed sports.

I'll discuss the reasons why be using the UFC's model. The UFC is the most established and put together of the MMA producers. Here are my justifications why:

* **Single Athlete v. Team Sports:** Team sports are more consumable for viewers. If a competitor gets an injury then another team member can step in to take their place, resulting in the competition being completed on time. When a UFC main event athlete gets injured the event gets cancelled or (more likely) replaced with a weaker product. 
* **Personality-Driven Competition:** The UFC requires personalities for their business model to work. They need the viewer to be invested in the individual rather than the competition. They promote personalities and openly ask competitors to create personas to generate interest. This is an obvious flaw in their business model, as charisma cannot be taught. By comparison, while their are certainly personalities, the NFL promotes individual athleticism and team work. 
* **Complexity:** The other sports have more complexity, which as a result makes them more interesting to the viewer. There are play callers, coaches, financial implications, trades, strength and weakness to team compilations, and other factors at play. The UFC competitions boil down to one guy landing a punch or submission on another guy. There are no discussions regarding camp benefits, coaches, corner men, or other factors unless there is a one-off. 
* **Brand Protection/Ethics-based Behavior Requirements:** There are no ethics requirements for UFC fighters. They are permitted to conduct illegal activities and still participate in competitions. Meanwhile, NFL athletes are required to keep their behavior inline with ethical guidelines. 
* **Gruesomeness:** The UFC openly advocates and depicts the most gruesome of the competitions. This is not palatable to many viewers. 

I'm a long time UFC/MMA fan.  I just don't think they will ever be as high-quality nor as viewed as the mainstream sports.

I'd much rather put thought into a personalized gift for someone than buy (and receive) something generic from a White Elephant game. Not to mention how ""stealing"" rules make White Elephants worse: it feels bad to steal, and it feels bad to be stolen from. Like ""Merry Christmas Samantha, that quirky vase you unwrapped and fell in love with, and started thinking about what flowers you want to put in it is mine now, because I've **stolen** it from you. Ho ho ho."" What a fun game to get people feeling good about gift-giving.

But I recognize that I may be blind to the shortcomings of the Secret Santa format, and that there might be better things out there.

Are there other gift exchange formats I'm not familiar with, that are arguably better than Secret Santa?

Is there some aspect (or rule combination) for White Elephant exchanges that would make it better?"

Their answer s were various flavors of ""it depends on context, if it was directed at a person, etc."". Based of a reading the the relevant section of the code of conduct in question, that seems absolutely correct. From Harvard's for example.

>Discriminatory harassment is unwelcome and offensive conduct that is based on an individual or group’s protected status. Discriminatory harassment may be considered to violate this policy when it is so severe or pervasive, and objectively offensive, that it creates a work, educational, or living environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive and denies the individual an equal opportunity to participate in the benefits of the workplace or the institution’s programs and activities.

These factors will be considered in assessing whether discriminatory harassment violates this policy:

• Frequency of the conduct

• Severity and pervasiveness of the conduct

• Whether it is physically threatening

• Degree to which the conduct interfered with an employee’s work performance or a student’s academic performance or ability to participate in or benefit from academic/campus programs and activities

• The relationship between the alleged harasser and the subject or subjects of the harassment.

It's pretty clear one could imagine a student directly calling for genocide of a a given group(not that it actually has happened recently), and not breaking any of those rules as stated above. They're obvious horrible people for doing it, but as written, that part of the code of conduct can't be used to discipline them. 

It's ironic that the right, the part of the political spectrum that's been critical of campuses for restricting speech, is now the one complaining about this the most.

I've heard alot say is the question were asking about any other group(black, LGBT) , that they would have instantly answered ""Yes!"". I don't see any proof of that. Where are all the students being expelled from these schools for saying bad things about black people or LGBT? 

In fact, UPenn's code of conduct EXPLICLITY points out that bigoted speech itself is not enough for a student to be disciplined.

>To refrain from conduct towards other students that infringes upon the Rights of Student Citizenship. The University condemns hate speech, epithets, and racial, ethnic, sexual and religious slurs. However, the content of student speech or expression is not by itself a basis for disciplinary action. Student speech may be subject to discipline when it violates applicable laws or University regulations or policies.

So I basically don't really see anything they said as wrong, and considering that they were under oath I understand their desire to be precise in their answer. 

So if you have any evidence of them not adhering their code of conduct, and expelling students for bigoted non-harrasment speech that could change my view."

Charitable giving forces citizens to subsidize organizations that their representatives have no power over.

There are guidelines now for what type of charities are tax deductible but the guidelines are vague and hard to enforce. It would be far simpler for our government to directly fund those activities instead of leaving it up to barely regulated charities.

1. Servers get a normal minimum wage. Why should they get tips when convenience store employees don't?

2. I've worked very long hours for extremely low salaries in the past. Now I'm more comfortable because I worked hard and upskilled myself. Asking someone born rich to tip is reasonable but not someone who's grinded hard to get to where they are.

3. In Pakistan, if you don't make enough money, you live with your parents or you share a small apartment with 4-8 other people. You manage your costs. Even doctors and engineers at the start of their careers live in poor conditions. Expecting that everyone should be able to afford a 1BR apartment in a big city is ridiculous.

4. If you are living in a first world country, you are already better off than most of the world. Be grateful and don't beg for tips.

5. It's a free market. If you don't like your salary, change your job. Or you can unionize. Pressurize the greedy corporates and business owners to pay you better, not middle class customers like me.

6. Who gets to decide which professions should / should not have a tip? Why can't a software developer ask tips from clients?

7. In Pakistan, government officers usually ask for a little bit of money to get some work done. If you need a tax refund of 10000, they will ask you to give them 10%. Just to do his job. Here, you would call that giving a tip. We call it bribery.

8. Not including tips and taxes in the product price is deceptive. It's meant to make the customers spend more. There are studies that prove that people would rather spend 20+taxes+tips vs $25 all inclusive.

9. Tipping culture is cancerous. They want tips on the tax amount too. The percent keeps on increasing. They pressurise introverts to tap 20% on the screen when they don't want to pay that much."

In capitalism you cant simply help people because they need it, you have to profit, you can't live with basic human necessities, you need to profit. Our planet is dying and getting destroyed because its far more profitable to mine for non-renewable sources. Science can be biased because to do research you need money, and the best way to get money is through sponsors, and to keep sponsors and funding, you have to work in the best interest of those sponsors, if your research contradicts what those sponsors stand for, then you lose funding. Most people in power are born into money and have inherent privilege. Slavery is the result of people wanting a way to make more money without having to spend much of it, so to do that they bought slaves and justified them keeping them as, well, slaves with racism. Beauty standards are as bad as they are because, to make money, beauty industries push unobtainable views that will never be reached so people will keep buying and buying and buying their products. Its more profitable to the government if they do not have to pay for anything, and if everything is privatized, so it makes perfect sense to allow children to go to school, not knowing if they will come home to see their parents, why would any parent want to send a child to a place like that. They have to make things like personal transportation required by killing the public transportation industry, because every if every single person needs a car, then there's more profit. Healthcare has to cost money because if it doesn't then that's a profit loss. People who are less able to work as valued as less. School was literally originally designed to teach people to be factory workers. In capitalism people have inherently more power then others, and as we start to move away from that, politicians need to give us something to distract us from that so they can regrip their power. In capitalism you have to put your ability to work over your own fucking life and health. We have to have fundraisers decide if fucking children get to live on to the next year.

* God: The greatest being possible. Being the greatest being possible would mean that God has great-making properties (e.g., mercy and justice) to the maximum possible extent.
* Omnipotence: The ability to do anything logically possible. This understanding rules out God being able to do the logically impossible, such as relaxing a moral attribute essential to his nature.

Before I continue, I do want to clarify that I do not think hell has literal fire, nor is it a torture rack. In Catholicism at least, the tortures of hell are self-imposed. The pains in hell per Catholicism follow from the very nature of sin. They arise from the *inside out,* not from *the outside in.* Either way, pain of loss and pain of senses is very real and literal in Catholic teaching, but it isn't from an eternal source, nor does not consist of fire, which are taken to be hyperbole in the NT.

The Bible teaches that:

1. God is all loving, powerful, knowledge *and* wills an eternal relationship with every human being He has created.
2. Many people end up in hell.
3. Hell is eternal conscious torment (though the nature of the ""T"" can be debated).

**Why does hell exist if God wants all humans to be saved?**

Hell was not created for humans. In the Bible at least, hell was created only for the fallen angels and Satan (Matthew 25:41). Why does anyone end up there, then? Because people deserve it *and* freely choose it. God doesn't send anyone to hell, people send themselves. Read the rest of the post for why God is obligated to enact Justice on human sin.

&#x200B;

**How do people ""send themselves to hell""?**

It requires understanding why God became a human and died a vicious death to get why people rejecting Jesus is a choice to go to hell:

* (1) Since all have transgressed God's law in various ways and are thus guilty, everyone deserves some form of punishment in hell. Sure, there are some better than others. But being better than others does not necessarily make one \*good enough\*. But how can God as Judge express his merciful nature by forgiving guilty people and removing their liability to justice \*while remaining all just\*? Sure, a judge has the *power* to not convict a criminal, but they would no longer be just. And God can't relax any of his immutable moral attributes that are essential to his nature, he must be fully just and fully merciful at once in response to human wrongdoing. Traditionally omnipotence doesn’t include bringing about logical contradictions so even God wouldn’t be able to relax justice or mercy while still being fully just or fully merciful. Mercy seems a relaxation of justice, and justice a refusal of mercy. There is a tension with God being both a fully just Judge and fully merciful Father at the same time in light of human sin. God solves this dilemma on the cross. Full justice is fulfilled: sin is punished through an infinite being (thus having infinite merit), but mercy is also enacted. The solution is for God to give \*us\* the mercy and \*himself\* the justice.
* (2) Wronging an infinite God is a wrong of infinite severity. This is because the severity of any wrong action goes up when the ontological status of the entity wronged goes up, when all other things are equal. Wronging an animal is worse than wronging a plant, while wronging a human is worse than wronging an animal, when all other things are equal. Since God has infinite ontological or moral status, the severity of wrong against Him is infinite. Only God could correct such a wrong, but justice demands that only humans correct it. Thus, if humans are to be forgiven, it’s necessary that God become human to correct the wrong for us. The thought process is thus this: (1) Only humans ought \[to atone for sin\]. (2) Only God can \[atone for sin\]. (3) Only a God-man both ought and can \[atone for sin\].

Since God is a Judge and since Jesus' very life and death resolve us of our deserved punishment, it is clear that Jesus' death and resurrection acts as a sort of pardon. But just like a pardon that has been issued by a judge or the government and yet freely refused by the criminal, the God-man's redeeming work remains inefficacious in the lives of those who freely reject Him. Thus, not accepting Jesus is akin to not accepting a pardon from the government when one is a guilty criminal. This explains why the God-man is the only way to salvation. If one doesn't accept the pardon (or more rightly, the gift), then one falls back on God's Justice against their sin by enduing the punishment they deserve, just like in western Justice systems vis-a-vis rejected pardons.

&#x200B;

**How is God** ***Just*** **by allowing the damned to suffer in hell?**

People often say that finite sins do not merit eternal punishment. However, the length of time that someone does any particular sin does not determine the length of the punishment. For example, a murder could happen in a split second, but a robbery could last for hours, but the former incurs more punishment. Someone may object and say that our finite nature renders it impossible for us to commit a crime that deserves eternal consequence. In response:

First, sins against an infinite God are a wrong of infinite severity. This is due to the severity of the wrong being dependent on the moral status of the entity sinned against, all other things being equal (the Status Principle). Wrong against an animal is more severe than wrong against a plant, while wrong against a human is more severe than wrong against an animal, all other things being equal. Since God is of infinite ontological or moral status, the severity of the wrong for the sin against Him is infinite (the severity of the wrong goes up as the ontological status of the being wronged goes up, all other things being equal). Keep in mind that this principle only applies when all other moral considerations are equal. Let's say someone steals five dollars from their friend, and another person tortures an animal. The Status Principle does not imply that stealing the five dollars is worse, because all other things are not equal. Other moral considerations come into play to determine which is worse.

Even aside from ontological status, the wrong is graver when against God given His power to fight back, the special relation borne between the sinner and the wronged (like us and God!), and the infringement of right obedience are all things that aggravate the wrong. For example, murdering one’s loving mother is worse than murdering a stranger. I think that’s true because I think that debts of justice are deeper in situations where one has benefited so much from another’s care. Or if the robbed man ended up murdering the good Samaritan for his sandals, I’d think that’s a very heinous treatment of one who did so much for another. A special sort of degradation in the act. And if the good sought – the sandals – is incredibly and obviously worse than the damage inflicted – the murder – that’s another reason for added wrongness. Moreover, if the person wronged is a proper authority over the one wronging him and has specifically forbidden the wrong, that, too, is reason to find the act worse. In short, the power of the injured to fight back, the special relation borne between the sinner and the wronged, and the infringement of right obedience are all things that aggravate the wrong. In the divine case, the wrong is aggravated to an infinite degree because of God's infinite nature. Keep in mind that I'm not just speaking of sins directly against God. We can speak of some sin being proximately or directly directed towards God's creation, and ultimately directed towards God himself.

Second, it's possible that when in hell, people continue to freely sin and so incur additional punishment ad infinitum. It's also possible that people in hell freely choose to remain impenitent, and so remain in hell forever. Thus, the gates of hell might very well be ""locked from within"" (as C.S. Lewis once said), not from an external force. Love, even divine love, cannot be forced upon a free agent in a way that grantees a genuine request for repentance. People like David Bentley Hart however argue that it's necessary that all humans sooner or later form a relationship with God through grace. This is necessary in virtue of God’s nature as Goodness Itself. But if this is the case, our final marriage-like relationship with God would be gravely deficient.  For it is the essence of relationships that they are the result of the choice from those involved, not necessitated. This means that a perfectly good God can permit rational creatures to reject his love forever.

Third, even if hell is locked from the outside, people who choose hell must at least in some way be ""quarantined"" from people in heaven. Since sin is contagious, people who continue to freely sin in hell will cause turmoil if placed in heaven and so must be separated to avoid another fall. The only way to preserve a place of total goodness is to keep evil away from it.

&#x200B;

**How is God** ***loving*** **when He allows so many people to send themselves to hell?**

God is not only all loving, but He is also an all just judge who upholds the moral integrity of the universe. If God were not an all just judge, then our universe would contain no ultimate moral responsibility for all wrong committed in its history. While regular people are free to show mercy without being held to justice, a judge has an obligation to do justice—at minimum upholding the rule of the law. Thus, legal philosopher Jeffrie Murphy notes that if the judge ""is moved, even by love or compassion, to act contrary to the rule of law—to the rules of justice—he acts wrongly” - Jeffrie Murphy, “Mercy and Legal Justice,” in *Forgiveness and Mercy*, ed. Jeffrie G. Murphy and Jean Hampton (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), pp. 175-76. In short, God as Judge and the law itself cannot merely forgive without violating his all just nature.

With that being said God does not just send people to hell to express His Justice against wrong, but because He is also loving. God must respect the free decision made by His children to reject Him and His pardon and thus allow them to send themselves to hell. God cannot force someone into heaven where they will be in God's revelatory presence forever without their consent. So in a sense, God allowing people to send themselves to hell is loving because it respects the autonomy and free choice of people. In the end, there are some who say to God, ""thy will be done,"" and many humans to whom God will say, ""thy will be done.""

Further, hell serves as an incentive for people to believe and for believers to continue believing and so results in a maximum amount of people coming to freely know God and His salvation. Indeed, people who don't believe in God tend not to believe in an afterlife at all. Thus, a finite hell could serve as a reason for many to *not* believe in God and to live as they please. But the whole reason God created the world was to share his goodness and love for all, so if hell being finite impeded on this goal, then that gives God justifiable reason to allow people to freely send themselves there forever!

&#x200B;

**Why does God create people who He foreknows will freely choose hell?**

On Jesuit Molinism, it's possible that God can't make it such that everyone always freely does good or choose him, and so God cannot guarantee a world in which everyone is saved. However, while this *may* resolve at least some level of responsibility on God, it still doesn't seem fair on this view to put blame on the sinner when God is the one who places a person in a circumstance which he foreknows will lead that person to freely reject him. There are however different understandings of God's omniscience that completely absolves God of responsibility, and puts the blame on us. These different views are called ""simple foreknowledge"" or ""a-temporal knowledge.""

On simple foreknowledge, God has only two logical steps of knowledge, distinct from Molinism, which has three. This view lacks middle knowledge. The logical order of God's knowledge on this view has the divine decree logically posterior to His natural knowledge (of what could happen) but is logically prior to God's free knowledge (of what will happen). On simple foreknowledge, it is logically impossible for God to know what \*will\* happen in the actual world logically prior to the decree to make the world actual. So, He didn’t know the actual future of the world until the world was made actual. Once the divine decree is made and the world simultaneously becomes actual, God knows what will happen. But by “then” it’s “too late” to use that knowledge to change the future. If a future event is foreknown by God chronologically prior to its occurrence, it is impossible for the future event to not come to pass, for that would falsify God’s foreknowledge. Simple foreknowledge of what people will freely do thus doesn’t help God because it comes logically posterior to His creative decree. He cannot not create people who choose hell or who do massive evil without invalidating His knowledge. Many dispute whether this renders God's foreknowledge useless providentially speaking, and many argue that God is a gambler on simple foreknowledge (though this debatable unlike with open theism). However, this isn't necessarily the case, for logically prior to the decree, God could know: “if X obtains, then I will do Y.” In a sense the blueprint of an infinite number of possible divine interventions are mapped out logically prior to the decree.

On a-Temporal knowledge, which is my preferred position and is common in Catholicism, God is independent of time and knows everything that is past present and future for us in an eternal present. God thus doesn't ""foreknow,"" rather, He knows everything that occurs in the world in a tenseless state. On an a-temporal view of God's omniscience, there is no temporal succession in God's knowledge, but there is still logical order. An event’s obtaining is logically prior to God’s knowing it. One champion of this view was Boethius, who lived in the 5th and 6th century AD. Other proponents of a-temporal knowledge included Augustine, Anselm, and Aquinas. On this view, God's knowledge of who is damned is logically posterior to His perception of creation in the eternal present (not prior to it). So, God knows who is damned \*because\* He perceives it, not the other way around. ""By the time"" God knows who is damned, it is ""too late"" to change that, since the damned are ""already"" parts of the world in existence in his eternal present of what are for us the past, present, and future. However, divine sovereignty is not obliterated on this doctrine, for the logical dependence of God’s knowledge on the events known does not rule out the causal dependence of those events on God’s acts, which themselves are included in God’s knowledge. It is true that these two views above do not involve meticulous providence, at least as with determinism or Molinism, but they have more providence than open theism, such that it is consistent with (and in the case of a-temporal knowledge, is widely attested in) Catholic tradition.

# Anticipated Objections:

* **Objection #1: God cannot be harmed, and so cannot be wronged.**

God being infinite or eternal does not logically preclude Him from being harmed. God is a consciousness. Thus, it is logically possible for Him to be harmed in a psychological like manner. In fact, the OT consistently speaks of God being in some sort of psychological pain in response to people's sin: “Yet they rebelled and grieved his Holy Spirit. So, he turned and became their enemy and he himself fought against them.” - Isaiah 63:10.

Even if God can't be harmed, there’s no good reason to think that harm is the only norm of what is ""wrong."" Being a closet diehard racist is wrong even if they never happen to cause harm to others. Or my wife could wrong me if she cheated on me, even if I never found out and was not harmed by her action. Another example: you might wrong me by frustrating goals. So likewise, you can wrong God by frustrating his goal to unite all humans to him, say, by being a hypocritical Christian that leads others to reject the gospel. So even if God can't be harmed, why think the discussion of wronging Him stops there? Why think that all harms and wrongs, and that all harms are wrongs?

I typically think of harming as a species of wronging. But then, only some instances of harming are wronging. I think incarcerating someone typically harms someone, and yet I think it is not wronging them if he is justly sentenced for a crime he committed. We might say that it isn’t harming, but unjustified harming that wrongs someone. But then that new term, ""unjustified,"" is itself a moral notion, and so is no good for attempting to give an account of what wronging is. So, to my mind, not all harms are wrongs, not all wrongs are harms, and the qualifications you need to make to harming (unjustified) end up making the account circular (to wrong is to harm in a wrong way). Given that, I’m reticent to form a solely harm-based account of wrong.

&#x200B;

* **Objection #2: The severity of the offense committed also depends on the moral status of the one who committed it. So, wrong by an animal is not as morally weighty as wrong by a human, all other things being equal. The severity of the wrong goes up when the ontological status of the being who sinned goes up. And so since the sinner in this case is not infinite (human beings), it stands to reason that the punishment is not infinite.**

The reasoning of this objection doesn’t work. Anything times infinity is infinity. And so, if I were a, say, 6 on the ontological-status-meter, that times infinity would still max out my blameworthiness. The same holds if I’m only a .004 on the ontological-status-meter. In short, the mitigation due to my ontological status will not render my culpability to less than infinity in light of wronging an infinite being. The same holds true for the conception of sins against a being than which none greater can be conceived.

&#x200B;

* **Objection #3: Doing goods has infinite significance, and so offsets infinite wrongs.**

Doing good does not nullify infinite wrongs. Even if you do the speed limit most of the time, a cop would be just in issuing you a ticket if he caught you violating the speed limit. Sure, they could show mercy, but then the cop is relaxing justice, and God can't relax an attribute essential to His nature. Further, praise and blame might be asymmetric here. I think punching my mom is graver than punching some stranger, given our relationship. I think that failing to help my mom after surgery is graver than failing to help a stranger, given our relationship. I don’t think that helping my mom is more praiseworthy than helping a stranger, due to our relationship. Helping my mom might well be more obligatory, whereas helping a stranger might well be supererogatory. Or failing to help a stranger is graver than failing to help an animal. It could be that there is greater obligation to help a stranger human than an animal. And the supererogatory is, all else equal, more praiseworthy than the obligatory. So it seems to me that there is an asymmetry in the case of blameworthy offense and praiseworthy action with respect to those we bear special relations to, like our parents and God. So even prima facie, good actions cannot outweigh bad ones, for we already owe God total obedience in our behavior towards our fellow humans and bearers of the images of God, as well as towards God Himself.

&#x200B;

**Objection #4: Infinite hell destroys retributive Justice since everyone in hell suffers for eternity.**

However, Jesus taught that not only will there be different levels of glory in heaven, but there will also be different levels of damnation in hell (e.g., Luke 10:10-14; 12:47-48). Many Christians (including myself) actually believe that some people in hell won't even receive much active punishment, but more so a relational separation from God, which itself is a punishment without anything added to it. There are thus different levels of hell and punishment for eternity.

&#x200B;

**Objection #5: The view that the punishment must be infinite in Hell, because sin against an infinite God is a wrong of infinite severity, ends up in a contradiction. For Hell can never produce an infinite punishment, it will always be finitude upon finitude. It seems God's justice will never be satisfied.**  

Yes, the damned will never have a time at which they can rightfully claim: “that’s it, God; I’ve paid back, full and entire, the debt I owed.  Now it is only fair that you let me out.”  In other words, for those who affirm an eternal hell, this inability to fully pay back the debt seems more a perk of the view than a worry. If the worry isn’t so much the inability for the damned to satisfy the debt, but instead the fact that God’s justice will never be fulfilled, we might distinguish senses of fulfilling a virtue. Perhaps absolutely considered, God’s justice will never be fully satisfied, in the sense that God can never say “what my justice demands has now been fully met.” But there’s another sense in which it is satisfied.  For it would be unreasonable for God to expect that which is logically impossible. It is logically impossible for incremental payback to yield infinite payment. So justice absolutely considered is impossible. It would be unreasonable for God to demand or even desire the logically impossible. Instead, God gets perpetual repayment to the level that the person can possibly repay. No more could be reasonably asked for.

&#x200B;

**Objection #6: Why would people continue to sin in hell?**

I don't see how post-mortem conditions will make it less likely for the damned to continue sinning. Humanity has become addicted to sin and so those who do not accept God's offer to transform them may continue to sin even in light of the obviousness of God's existence. In fact, people may become so addicted to sin in this life and the next that they are unable to refrain from committing it. Their own character formation in this life and the next (in hell) in a way prevents them from turning away from sin. The habit to sin will reach to such a degree that the agent loses any desire to do what is right, with the result being that the desire to do good disappears and so does the freedom to act on it. As such, it's possible that people who choose hell form a character either in this life or the next that effectively removes their freedom to choose for God, thereby truly damning themselves forever.

&#x200B;

**Objection #7: If people do not have the freedom to reject God in heaven, then how does autonomy on earth preclude the necessity of the salvation of all at some point via God's goodness?**

Even if one grants the assumptions in this objection, when one considers a relationship like a marriage (which the Bible often uses to symbolize God's relationship with his people), only a person who has autonomy can enter a marriage or a marriage-like relationship since \*entering\* such a relationship means precisely to renounce one’s autonomy in certain respects, and to do so out of love. In heaven, the saved renounce their autonomy in the sense that they no longer have a choice with respect to saying yes or no to God, since they have already made their choice and thereby ‘committed their freedom’. Thus, the very act of commitment and the revoking of some aspects of autonomy actually makes the ensuing relationship more perfect than it would be if there was never any autonomy to begin with."

\- I do NOT want to kill gen AI. (Not that I could if I wanted to.)

\- I DO think gen AI can be done ethically. More consideration and respect needs to be paid to the people whose data is going into the training dataset, however.

\- I don't want to get into a conversation over whether AI-generated art is ""real"" art. It certainly can produce beautiful results and I do find it interesting as a way of creating art that we may never have had the opportunity to see if gen AI didn't exist. Art is subjective so I think the question is moot anyway and uninteresting as a topic of conversation.

\- I have a fairly good laymen's understanding of the underlying technology. I know it doesn't ""mix"" inputs to create new outputs, or create a ""collage"" out of its training data. I know it learns the probability of the placement of the pixels of an image with a certain label, and then de-noises an image, placing certain pixel values in certain places, according to those probabilities. 

\- I have used image generators and text generators as a curiosity. I'm not talking about something I have no experience with.

The meat of the argument:

Let's take image generators as a specific example. These machines use millions of images scraped from the internet. A lot of these images, especially the ones users most want to emulate, are the copyrighted intellectual property of artists who depend on revenue from their IP for their survival. These artists were not informed that their work would be scraped and used in a machine that would replace their labor and directly threaten their livelihoods, and did not consent to their work being used this way. Copyright law hasn't had much to say on this so far, but that is due to the law lagging behind the technology, not the idea that this is an ok usage of IP. 

Artists should be able to choose whether or not their work is used in a training dataset, and should be credited if they do give their consent.

Similarly, large language models that scrape copyrighted IP need informed consent from the creators of their training data, and need to credit or compensate those creators where they can.

The fact that this kind of data is able to be used in this way is part of a larger issue with the cavalier way we treat people's data. I am strongly of the opinion that, if my data is valuable to someone, I should have control over and should benefit from that value. "
223,2023-12-14,CMV: Its a stupid law that the bartender has to open cans of beer for you a concerts/venues,u/dl0lol0lb,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18i1nas/cmv_its_a_stupid_law_that_the_bartender_has_to/,changemyview,"So sometimes I’ll go to a concert and I’ll be up front and someone will be like “hey will you hold my spot while I go up to the bar/go to the bathroom?”

And while I have never asked someone to do that for me, if I did, I would probably think it would be cool to bring them back a beer from the bar as a thank you. 

But if you bring a stranger an open container, you’re likely gonna get “uhhhhh…..I’m good…..thanks” and some weird looks. 

And really if it was somebody’s MO to slip people’s drinks, this would be the way to do it. Just by saying “hey I’m gonna head up to the bar, do you want me to grab you something?” Or “thanks for holding my spot while I went up to the bar. Got you a beer.”

And, like, let’s say I am with a group of people and we all know and trust each other. One guy could go to the bar and get everyone beers and it’s gonna be a lot easier to carry them back when they’re unopened. 

And let’s say I want to get there early and get a good spot and have, like, 3 or more beers throughout the show and don’t want to lose my spot. 

If they gave them to you unopened they will keep fresh longer than if they were opened. An opened beer is just going to go flat sitting around for too long. Also, if it gets knocked over, it’s done for. 

I really don’t understand this rule at all. I read something about the venue “only being licensed for on-premise consumption.”

1. Who I’m the world is going to go to a concert and treat it like a liquor store and pay 5x as much for a beer and the price of a ticket and have to weave through the crowd when they could just go to an actual liquor store?

2. If somebody wants to do this, why would they give a shit? (nobody is doing this, but if they were, it would be a huge deal, right?)

Are they trying to prevent people from giving alcohol to minors? Is that what this is all about?

1. They already check IDs at the door, give drinkers wrist bands, and mark the hands of minors. If security sees a minor drinking, they could do something about it then. 

2. If a minor wants to drink at the show, and there is somebody there willing to buy it for them, the whole opening the can up thing is not going to deter them. 

So, I really do not understand this law, and based on what I currently know, I believe that this law is stupid. If there is any legitimate reason why they do this, I would love to hear it."
1,2023-12-14,"CMV: These are good, non-sexist, discussion norms",u/Ok-Leather5257,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18i2ia8/cmv_these_are_good_nonsexist_discussion_norms/,changemyview,"This is intended to apply to all casual discussions on ""academic"" topics, broadly construed. Think of two friends, walking in the park, trying to get to the bottom of some academic question (e.g. could wings evolve, what's the correct stance on free will, etc. idk). One, both, or neither, might be experts on the topic in question.

Claim 1: The following is a permissible discussion procedure

1. Ask if the people/person want to dicuss X.
2. If they say yes, ask if they want to share their view.
3. Listen to it. 
4. If you disagree\*, ask if it's okay to share why you disagree. 
5. If they say yes, share what you take to be the step/premise you disagree with. 
6. Wait to see what they say, which may include telling you you've misunderstood their argument. 
7. Let's say they give you a refined argument (which may happen whether you misunderstood or not i.e. they may refine it in the face of your objection, or just say, no you've misunderstood the argument is *actually* this.)
8. You can then say ""oh but I think (unless I'm misunderstanding something) my objection still works"" (perhaps because they misunderstood it).
9. And so on until one of you desires an end to the conversation, or you all come to a mutual agreement about what it is you disagree about, or until you agree. Bearing in mind that there is a room for a kind of ""face-value"" disagreement i.e. ""I accept that wings can evolve by natural selection, because you're the expert. However, I just don't understand *how* yet. When I try to imagine it, it doesn't make sense. I'll have to look up the steps online like you said. In short, X clearly follows from Y, but it doesn't yet *seem* to follow, for me.""

\* We only ever hear what we hear, not necessarily what the person said, and certainly not necessarily what the person thought. When I am talking about disagreement it's always relative to one's own perception of the argument. Part of my claim is it is perfectly fine to say ""argument xyz doesn't make sense in my opinion"" (\*even\* if the person is an expert), so long as it is clear that you don't mean *the argument in their head* doesn't make sense, but the *image of their argument in your head* based on what they said. 

More precisely, if someone with whom you have a casual relationship agrees to discussion on some academic topic, assuming these norms is not morally wrong. (If they get upset and you assume these norms again, that might be wrong).

Some related claims:

\- There is a sense of ""trying to prove someone wrong"" and ""trying to prove someone right"" which overlap. i.e. ""desiring someones humiliation"" and ""desiring someones vindication"" clearly do not, but ""sifting the evidence and arguments and trying to find out what's true"" is a possible interpretation of both phrases. Compare this with stress-testing some device: you're simultaneously trying to break it and prove it can't be broken. I contend there's no contradiction here. 

\- In normal circumstances, with good intents, proving someone wrong is a favour. 

\- It's okay to ""mine"" experts for information, assuming they consent to discussion (and you stop when they ask). 

\- These norms don't constitute turning discussion into debate.

\- (Possibly the most important claim, really want to be corrected/shown how I'm wrong on this if I am) ""**These norms are not a manifestation of institutional sexism.""**

I'd be interested if anyone can change my view on any of the above, especially the last one.

&#x200B;

\---

Why do I believe all the above? I believe these are all the relevant presuppositions.

People are entitled to their opinions. 

People are entitled to disagree (and, normally, express that disagreement).

All else being equal, it is better when people learn rather than not. 

Learning is good. 

A lot of learning is just finding out you were wrong about something (e.g. the earth is not flat, there is a picture of free will such that it is consistent with determinism etc.).  

Logic is not the be all and end all, it's useful for some things, but there's much it doesn't fully capture. 

The institutional norms in philosophy discussion are systematically wrong; women and other marginalised people are interrupted more, dismissed more, overlooked more. Their conversation partners are often not speaking in good faith. 

Discussion should not be a blood sport or an ego boost.

Open ended truth-seeking discussion is valuable.

Not every conversation needs to be open-eneded truth-seeking discussion. 

It's a moral vice to not be willing to change your mind just to protect your ego, or to become angry *just* because you've been outargued.

It's not ok to intend to make someone else feel bad about an error of theirs (whether it's about a matter of fact, or reasoning).

We should afford experts the respect they are due.

I'm deeply curious about how other people think, and what they know. To a first approximation, everyone has something to teach me.

None of these principles/norms license belief with particularly bad contents.

Not entirely happy with how I've expressed myself, but don't want to be even more verbose! One more comment: my motivation here is to stress-test my own ideas. I wanted to come up with norms that lead to enjoyable and productive academic conversation which isn't a manifestation of institutional sexism. If I've failed, I want to know so I can not be such a manifestation! Only goal here.

Many thanks in advance."
1,2023-12-14,CMV: I get frustrated if I touch things that are 'dirty' after I shower at night,u/GlitterGlop,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18i2ke8/cmv_i_get_frustrated_if_i_touch_things_that_are/,changemyview,"I'm pretty sure this happened mainly because of covid, where in my household my mom was very adamant on washing, wiping and cleaning everything that was from the outside to be used inside the house. After coming back home from being outside, you could either stay in the basement (which I'll classify as a 'dirty' area), or shower and hang out in the house (which I'll classify as a 'clean' area). It's been going on like this throughout covid. Even after the whole covid fiasco, my family still continued to sanitize everything. The thing is, I'm not sensitive to outside things when I'm wearing my outside clothes as I'm outside, but when I'm inside the house, I need to make sure that the 'outside' item I'm using is 100% clean and sanitized before I use it. I know a lot of my friends don't exactly have the same mindset as me, and I want to change my view.

I'm currently studying abroad and living in an in-campus shared dorm with roommates. It's inevitable for me to come back from class and sit on my desk to do work, so I do. I'm trying as best as I can to explain my feelings towards this subject, so please be patient with me as I'm not exactly good at langlit. Whenever I go out, I classify myself as 'dirty', since I use public transport, touch public door handles, sit on public chairs, etc. Thus, my laptop and phone becomes dirty, since I bring them around, put them on desks, etc. When I go back to my dorm with my outside clothes and me being classified as 'dirty', I'm okay with using them as normal. However, after I take my shower for the night, I have to always wipe everything with wet tissue. 

I don't know why, but if I'm fully showered and I touch something that my mind classifies as 'dirty', then I can literally imagine and memorize the exact area of my hand that is now infected and is 'dirty'. I'll go out of my way to remember this area so that I can wash or wipe it off later on. If I don't my mind will be constantly occupied by it and I'll feel frustrated. I can't use my desk after I shower since my chair and my table are 'infected' by me when I was wearing my outside clothes. I can't use my laptop or phone either, so the best solution is for me to use wet tissue, wipe everything down, and use it.

This happens with my bed too. Back at home, I used to always have to be absolutely clean to use it. I can't use my outside clothes to sit or lay on my bed (which I see a lot of my friends/people on the internet do). Right now, I've been trying to ease myself to being more okay with being 'infected' with 'dirt'. Recently, I'll change my outside clothes to my home clothes to take naps on my bed, even though I know that my arms and legs are probably still 'dirty'.

I feel like this isn't normal and it's actually getting frustrating, hopefully someone can convince me on this idea."

we as individuals have a choice to associate with whoever we please and no laws will try to affect that. so why do we stop at privately owned businesses then? the civil rights act of 1964 stops privately owned businesses from having the choice of associating with whoever they please and the most common example would be denying services based on religion, sex, gender, or race. privately owned businesses are an extension of the individual's life as they own it so it makes no logical to not apply the same freedom of association that we as individuals have. 

I am not defending racism but instead I am defending the individuals privilege to association and applying that to private entities like businesses. I believe that racism should not be fixed by the government and it would be an abuse of human rights and far more ineffective, a business that allows anyone to purchase out of a choice they made is far more better at eliminating racism than a business being forced to allowing everyone service by the government.

26,2023-12-14,"CMV: Economics is mostly ""Religionomics""",u/OvidPerl,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18i5yj0/cmv_economics_is_mostly_religionomics/,changemyview,"**TL;DR**: People, including many economists, base their economic beliefs on their personal values, rather than evidence.

Background: I went to college to be an economist. My first two years, I took every economics class available[1] in a program designed to prepare me for an undergraduate economics major. I wound up going into software engineering instead, though I still love economics.

What finally drove me over the edge was a professor making an impassioned argument that [the 1972 collapse of the Peruvian anchovy harvest was actually one of the major causes of stagflation in the US](https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2009/march/agricultural-commodity-price-spikes-in-the-1970s-and-1990s-valuable-lessons-for-today/). While it was a factor (it impacted cattle feed prices), such narrow focus on a minor topic doesn't help us understand the bigger picture.

In years of reading multiple papers and articles on economics, what I stumbled across, again and again, were bold assertions presented as fact, with little to no evidence to support them. ""Government intervention always makes things worse."" ""Private industry is always corrupt."" ""X is always/never Y."" (This is maddeningly common in Libertarian papers). These faith-based comments, of course, show up routinely on the news when pundits are invited, often with derisive laughter for those who disagree with their unqualified assertions.

Even in straightforward discussion, such as whether and how we should provide money for children in poverty, we get bogged down in discussions about ""right"" and ""wrong"", but rarely do people cite evidence for outcomes. Often, when I cite evidence from a non-US country, the response is, ""they're nothing like the US, so it's not a fair comparison."" That, of course, shuts down all debate because you could use a variant of that for _any_ discussion. (""Texas isn't like California, so we can't compare 'em."")

What I eventually realized was that people's views on economics weren't based on optimal outcomes. They were based on their value systems. Specifically, many economic policies have a trade-off between efficiency and fairness. On the large scale, that could be the difference between Libertarianism and Communism.

On a smaller scale, such as aid for children in poverty, we could go with maximum efficiency: give parents money, no questions asked. Or we could go for maximum fairness: do the children exist? How old are they? Means testing? Does the parent have custody? What's the local cost of living? Visit the children to verify everything. And so on. Going to either extreme of maximum fairness or efficiency seems to lead to potential breakdowns, which is why evidence-based outcomes need to be considered, but they're not.

Many modern economists (Stiglitz, Krugman, Varoufakis) _do_ present evidence, but it often feels stilted, like they have a point of view and they're bringing up evidence for it (to be fair, when writing for a news site, it's hard to be well-rounded; I should read more of their actual papers).

Economic systems seem to largely be a trade-off between efficiency and fairness and which economic policies one supports seem to depend on your personal values, rather than evidence. I rarely see this trade-off explicitly discussed, even though it's at the core of so many disagreements.

Much of modern economic discussion, therefore, comes from those with the shining eyes of the converted, rather than an analysis of likely evidence-based outcomes. I also saw this routinely in my economics professors, often arguing for free trade and supporting laissez-faire capitalism, rather than presenting a well-rounded set of opinions.

Hence, ""religionomics"" rather than economics.

I recently graduated college and my experience there has taught me this. I went in thinking incels were ridiculously and my experience seeing how women act around chads shows me how right they are.

First, I genuinely believe that as a man, you’re sexually desirability is based on the things you cannot control. Your height, race, genetics for your hair, jaw, bone structure etc. those have to be built right and if they aren’t there’s nothing that can be done to improve. There’s a reason why a 4’9 jacked guy isn’t going to pull as much as a 6’2 jacked guy.

80% of women pursue the top 20% of physically attractive men. This can be seen easily on dating apps and it applies in real life too. Sure there are outliers but if you look at the men who are having the most sex with the most women it’s not going to be the mid or ugly guys no matter how good their personality gets.

I think this plays into the idea of AFBB, sure people love to say “well more 20% of men get married or find relationships” sure, because a chad isn’t looking to commit. They’re looking to enjoy being the type of guy women find sexually desirable. When women “mature” they sacrifice being sexually attracted to their partner for the stability and companionship that they get in a long term relationship with a guy they aren’t as sexually interested in.

That’s why sex in college is seen as more wild than sex in a relationship. When a woman has true burning sexual desire, she’ll be more willing to do crazy things than with a guy that sex is more about an obligation as a result of being in a relationship. There’s a reason why 60% of women aren’t having orgasm with their partners, they’re not attracted to them like they were chad.

Personality doesn’t matter. I mean racists, misogynists, homophobes and whatever degree of bigotry is what most fraternities are known for, yet they are incredibly popular with women. Why? Because they’re sexually attractive enough that however shitty they are it doesn’t matter.

Saying “it’s your personality” is just cope. I’ve heard guys say significantly worse shit about women than I’m saying now get tons of attention from women. The idea that personality means anything is bullshit."

I've always found this idea really hard to believe, that Putin would attack a NATO country. Currently, he's not doing amazing in Ukraine so why would he be crazy enough to attack a NATO country? What could he gain from that? Even if he was doing great in Ukraine and on the brink of success, why would he ever attack a NATO country? 

I get that some counterarguments will be:

* Maybe he thinks the US won't actually intervene - that doesn't seem realistic to me and even without the US I don't think Russia stands a chance against France and the UK, especially in its current state
* Putin is crazy so he'll just do it - even if he is, he probably realizes maybe he can win in Ukraine but going into NATO territory is certainly going to be pushing it too much

I believe that the whole ""X NATO country is next"" talk is just to get people to understand that the war is close to home and support Ukraine but it is completely unrealistic as neither side wants a NATO-Russia war."

I've seen many here saying that women can only cum for penetration and if the guys penis hasn't a certain size, it's impossible to please her. They say all women are like this and that mostly in teal dating life they ask first thing a dick pick. 
I have never asked a man a dick picture before a date and never met a woman who has. I never saw a single woman talking about it. I actually don't even know many women who are able to cum through penetration. Men set up a lot of priorities for dating. Sex, appearances, clothing. But they said the reason they can't have a girlfriend is because we are the picky ones and no woman will EVER date a normal men. Because we are all kardashians, apparently, living that lifestyle. Everysingle women on Earth. Poor men are being oppressed by our high dating standards.

Meanwhile: they go for the blood BBL American girls who also have their life views extracted from tiktok, while men from reddit. They want a tall big dicked rich guy. Men are só lonely and unwanted cause all women are like this nowadays. but they are always talking about stretch marks being gross, clothing having to follow a certain moral rule, weight needs to be controlled, size of body too. Everything that is superficial is a priority for them.

Meanwhile, many women are out there looking for real connections. They usually are invisible for this guys, who only go for kardashian tiktok old teens. People their own age? Meh. Normal women? Meh. People with real goals and expectations? Meh. Women with a normal, not model, appearence? Fuck no! They chase the most superficial immature women they can find and then they blame all of us when they are rejected. What kind of logic is that?

Men don't even know how women's bodies work but they want to blame us on their lack of reality thinking. They think (real) women think and act like other reddit guys tell them. I personally never saw a women advocating for any of the things this guys say we like or look for. 

I look in a partner for charisma, partnership, reliability, sense of humor, goals in life being similar. Most (or all) women I know are like that. I never met a girl who was more concerned to dick size then to partnership. This are male concerns. Men are worried about their dick size, about their height, about sex, about stretch marks. Meanwhile women are concerned in finding a reliable partner who won't cheat or beat her up. 

CMV, considering that this American kardashian/chad culture isn't a real thing out of reddit in other places that are not the United States.

286,2023-12-14,"CMV: if parents are not legally mandated to pay for college, there should be a much easier process to declare as an independent student for those from wealthy but unsupportive families",u/Internal-Ad1632,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18iag78/cmv_if_parents_are_not_legally_mandated_to_pay/,changemyview,"I am not from the US, but I generally find the system unfair to those who had financially unsupportive but high income parents. Basically the financial aid system from most schools gives close to full ride to those from lower income family (at least most schools I researched do) but gives barely anything to those from higher income family.  
How is that fair for the students who came from high income family that refuses to pay for college, that if their family refuses to pay, they'll have to take out a huge loan?  
If parents are not paying for college in a lot of families, shouldn't every student automatically be declared as independent as soon as they turn 18 yo?  
There should be an easy process for students with high income unsupportive parents to declare independent: they can goto court to sign a form to get emancipated to receive full ride/be considered as independent, but as a trade off they will become ineligible for inheritance and their bank account will be locked and monitored for rest of life from parents so they can't send over any money (to avoid loopholes). In this process, whether or not the parent is abusive shouldn't be considered. 

So basically student has a choice between either goto college that their parents refuse to pay for and end up with a huge loan but get the benefits of inheritance, or get a full ride by declaring as independent but become ineligible for inheritance as he/she would become emancipated.   
If FAFSA/ financial aid application wants to look at parent income, then government should legally mandate that all parents must cover whatever remaining amount after aid the student applies to, or else it's unfair for the student if a student from lower income family can goto an ivy because he gets a full ride, but a student from a high income family can't because his family refuses to cover the remaining amount after aid.  
It is also unfair in cases where family makes 300k only willing to cover state school/CC and student gets no aid, and family makes 50k gets full ride to ivy. Because every students deserve an equal chance. Higher income family also doesn't always equate to better growing environment for kids either, as a lot of wealthy parents are abusive and neglectful too.  
Or else, since the government couldn't force all parents to pay for college, FAFSA then should look at every students whether their parents' income is 500k or 50k as independent students and only offer aid based on student income."

These are very much in opposition to the global consensus on the resolution of Israel/Palestine. As long as he remains in power, there will be no peace in the region.

We know that he will most likely go after the war, given his attempts at judicial reforms and security failure on Oct 7th, which means whoever comes in next will be responsible for the path forward. In order for this path to be workable, this person must also be in charge of Israel's actions during the war. For example, let's say Lapid will come into power after Netanyahu and wants to initiate some kind of peace process with Palestinians. In order for this idea to work, the IDF will need to be a lot more cautious than if they were under Netanyahu's command. 

Essentially, the path after the war must align with the path taken during the war, and that is only possible with one Prime Minister in charge. Assuming that Bibi will not be PM after the war, he cannot be the Prime Minister now too."

For example, a stroke can cause religiosity in individuals who were previously uninterested. This is well documented and researched. It is linked to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Being religious/spiritual is linked with activity in this area of the brain and as such it is nothing but a phenomenon or imbalance like any other. It leads to “doubt deficit” and an increased likelihood of authoritarianism and religious fundamentalism. (Citation in comments.) In other words, religion and spirituality can be not only be explained, they can be induced. 

Additionally, mental illnesses that create increased brain activity, like mania in bi-polar individuals, often bear these same hallmarks. Hospitals are filled with people who think they are Jesus or some other religious figure or who are convinced they are having a spiritual experience. 

Given the pervasiveness of violence done in the name of religion this should be seen for what it is and treated as such. A neurobiological phenomenon that is destructive. Religious/spiritual people should be medicated or at least understood to be mentally unwell and subject to de-emphasis in popular representation. 

I say this as a bi-polar individual who was previously spiritual and have since returned to baseline after being properly medicated. I cannot figure out for the life of me what I was on about. In the same way that a stroke can induce religion, medication can mediate it and logic/sanity can prevail. The world would be a much safer and better place as a result.

Gone are the days of the 90s and early 2000s when the internet was dominated by teens and nerdy hobbyists. At this point literal grandmas in rural Africa are on the internet at this point. Even people who aren’t on the internet are on the internet somehow.

Basically, *everyone* is online, basically all the time. Lawyers, doctors, politicians, nurses, kids, students, seniors, Europeans, Indians, Arabs, Americans, Brazilians, etc. When you’re sitting on the toilet mindlessly scrolling your Reddit feed you’re being exposed to people and ideas from all around the world and from all walks of life. It’s basically impossible to avoid communicating with people who you have no idea about and who you know very little about.

But of course, internet anonymity and ease-of-access ignores all that. You often hear “remember the person behind the screen” but this is much harder to do when you’re interacting with a random twitter profile, or Reddit account, or Snapchat user. 

I don’t know what the answer is, but it just seems to me that continuing to act like the internet is just some “Wild West” where anything goes is no longer serving humanity’s interests. Too much is at stake and too much of our interacting takes place on it for it just to be a lawless mess. We can see this with just how destructive things like social media and bots have been on things like elections, national security, etc. 

And this is coming from someone who used to be a strong believer in the need for privacy and anonymous accounts. I don’t think strict government oversight is the correct course of action but at the same time I don’t think just acting like anyone can say anything online with no accountability is the correct course of action either. 

Anyway, these are my two cents. I’m willing to hear counter-arguments."

So, if some day in the future some genocidal dictator uses the jewish star without even knowing its meaning just because it looks cool, should we ban that symbol too and shame all jews who use it? Are we seriously going to let people ruin good things that easily?

Children should be forced in school to learn the true meaning of the swastika, so we as a society can avoid unfair prejudice.

The swastika looks horrible to all of you because of purely subjective reasons and social conditioning, but it is actually a beautiful symbol from a purely geometrical POV, it resembles rotation without having to rotate, that's amazing.

Maybe banning the swastika makes sense in Germany to prevent the raise of neo-nazis, but in the West in general education about the symbol would be a much better alternative.

Of course there shouldn't be any freedom of speech for literal nazism, limitless freedom of speech would make sense in a world where what you said didn't have consequences, but in the real world 100% of freedom of speech is impossible, we have to achieve 99% of freedom of speech. The thing is that we should educate people so they don't have this fixated idea that swastika can only refer to nazism."
1,2023-12-14,CMV: Hairstylists should be ranked by an internationally standardized organization,u/god4rd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18iersl/cmv_hairstylists_should_be_ranked_by_an/,changemyview,"My proposal is as follows: there should be an internationally standardized organization to rank the skills of hairstylists. This way, clients can have the confidence that 1. they have sufficient skills and abilities to cut your hair, and 2. they are charging accordingly for it.  
When I was a kid, I had a traumatic experience at a salon where they horribly messed up my hair. There was another time when I got traumatized because the hairstylist hurt my scalp so bad with the hair clipper. They scraped it so hard that I ended up bleeding. Since that day, I've always felt anxious about getting my hair cut for the first time at a new place or with a new stylist.   
I hate not having the confidence to know if a hairstylist is genuinely good at their job and putting my head and hair (and sometimes beard) in the hands of their scissors and machines.  
I know it's not THAT serious because hair grows all the time lol, but hear me out:  
I think my proposal could alleviate some of the anxiety for those of us who care about our hair, and at the same time, eliminate abusive hairstylists who charge as if they were the Michelangelo of haircuts but end up making you waste money to look ugly.  
It could work like a kind of certificate that is renewed every few years. Similar to the chess ranking system, where if you have 2000+ points, it's known that you're incredibly skilled, and it goes down from there... 

First, the hairstylist decides how much they will charge depending on their ranking (naturally, the higher the ranking, the more they could charge, but not necessarily); second, you as a client decide whether you want to spend a lot of money (going to a higher-ranked stylist) or save money (going to lower-ranked stylists) and take the risk that they might not cut it as well as you hope.  
The rankings would also have categories since cutting short hair is not the same as cutting long hair, or doing intricate and modern hairstyles or treatments. Some of the skills they could assess include: steady hand, sensitivity when using clippers and razors on the skin, the ability to identify and adapt to different hair types, knowledge of color theory, hair dye chemicals, bleaching agents, etc.   
What do you think, lol?"

Now how tf do I explain this doozy...  


I've had a long history with immensely deep neuroticism and problematic life situations including.  
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Child molestation/rape and loss of anal virginity at 8.(school bus)

Missing english classes for court because principle tried to burry it.

Drug addicted dad, divorced.

My childhood dog and best friend got put down at age of 4 cause stepdad kept letting out without leash in city.

Never did well socially, academically or creatively. Literally learnt to ""collect"" the outcasts in each class to create a circle of convenience friends just to curb the alienation & bullying tied with dread and loneliness (Started doing this subconsciously since 5th grade)

I literally lied about an illness to get out of school for years and fooled world class doctors in toronto as a child just because I couldn't handle the suffering just going would cause anymore.

Never able to advocate for myself, couldn't read the text on the board (some of it I could with squinting) and  I just went with it when they tried to chalk it up to me focusing on the tiny printout text in the corner. I literally couldn't see what to take notes on.

My dad fixed his life together and had another family but our last interaction was me getting pissed at him for borrowing money from me and not telling his wife during covid troubles, I blocked his number and never spoke with him again, he hit a moose this summer and died on impact. I haven't been able to put on or even open the case containing the necklace with his ashes because his face is in there. I look for him everywhere I go.

I've been on 9 different psych meds for a variation of different theories, i've quit all recreational drugs at request of my doctor and have been to the psych-ward, Group counseling, one on one counseling and I can't afford any private therapy.

Canada obviously doesn't have the means to assist me, and is in immense Economical & political turmoil that will likely not start looking up for at least a 2 years to a decade.

I live paying 1500$ a month for a place without clean drinking water and will likely need to live in the middle of my family farm with no power, heating, water or society in the vacinity during canadian winter. (Probably die of the cold)

I tried creative writing and got asked if I was ""native"" because my grammar was so bad, likely a snowball effect from the lack of english classes in jk-1st grade :DDDDDDD

Theres nothing I want out of life, and in my mind, the only remotely correct choice my country has made in recent is to open euthenasia to those unable to cope with adversity including those with metnal illness (Personality disorders count).

Im in thousands of debt at 21 and have never done hard drugs (other then mushrooms I tried to self-treat treatment resistant depression with). I was sent to the psych-ward by my last 2 work from home jobs with rogers and 3rd party for my government.

&#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  


I don't believe life is inherently worth preserving, Those who can get more joy then suffering are obviously ""winners"" that have grounds to keep desiring life, but at this point I don't want to struggle through the obstacles I bring to a romantic relationship, I cannot maintain friendships due to how manic and problematic my personality is and I have so many genetical passed mental disorders like ADHD, BPD, And a very unusable 5 type personality chart (immensly Neurotic, Very agreeable, very creative, Introverted & 0 conscientiousness) so I would feel awful if I ever tried to make offspring, not to mention .

&#x200B;

I live as a mechanism for others, now that my family either doesnt want anything to do with me or doesn't know what do with me all im alive for is so my grandparents can feel like they didn't fuck up with my mother and so my mother has a meaning to her life to maintain her drive to keep suffering despite being 55, chronic pain and 0 retirement plan/options.

&#x200B;

  
I ask myself everyday why I don't just kill myself and the answer is always i've seemingly been gaslit into believing I must be wrong, but the only explanation I get from even professionals is ""Maybe it won't be like this later though."" and that's not enough.

Now with euthenasia coming to canada match 17 2024 (11 days b4 my birth-day :'D) for my type of issues, i'm almost certain i'm going to do it to make a point against this empty follow-through culture.  


I have asked for help, i've talked with pros and tried to reachout to resources, I can't utilize them properly and all of them are backed up, gate kept or didn't work.

I'am effectively useless in my conscious impact and the positive effects of my passive existence in diminishing by the day as the downsides to everyone for my existence goes up as I become more disconnected and make more depressing posts and consume more resources. Also get closer to an insane break where I take out my suffering on others, possibly irreversibly.  


I think suicide is becoming a form of our natural selection as more and more people are always doing it despite seemingly everyone trying to fight it. and the only way we were able to combat it in our ancient history was by exiling the families of anyone who would kill themselves in the tribal eras. Now we just propaganda them into thinking they don't wanna and messing with their brain chemistry.  


You are guranteed hunger, Thirst and fatigue, you aren't promised happiness, obligations are forced on you on day 1 but the desire, purpose and joy is not, sometimes it may not even be optional ( very rare but still, babies die in hospital, 3rd world countries exist.)

At this point I actually wonder if the concept of ""nothing"" was the true hero all along, and this ""something"" or ""life"" is actually the interference, the ""noise"". Maybe we were on the wrong side all along? But regardless I think suicide should be widely allowed and parents should realize they can't ask their kids if they want to come into the world and they might end up not enjoying it, and that should be okay too, Y'know it's about the journey and memories n stuff, sometimes it's not for everyone too, it's life imo.  


This being said I bet no one will ever really try to understand or read this whole post, it's not desirable, your instincts oppose this fundamentally cause it doesn't feed, heat or power you, it ends you, but maybe you shouldn't need to be powered, heated or fed, maybe the universe should go back to pre-big bang, who knows if that was ultimate bliss or not? All I know is this whole life thing sucks in my view and is not worth it in the slightest & making it worth it in any sense severely feels outside my dashed potential and detrimental characteristics.  


I'am not telling anyone to do it, I just think more will and it'll become a normal part of our society at least for a developmental/transitional time period and it may not be a bad thing for the sake of long-term human preservation (The only long term goal/point to human life i've found)."
1,2023-12-14,CMV: Parking Lots Should Phase Out Compact Parking Spots (USA),u/craptinamerica,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18igtrf/cmv_parking_lots_should_phase_out_compact_parking/,changemyview,"I can appreciate there being dedicated spots meant for Compact cars, but there are always people who feel entitled and think the rules don’t apply to them.

I had an appointment downtown and the parking lot just outside the building was pretty small, allowed maybe 25 cars.  In that parking lot, I noticed cars that weren’t “compact” were parked in compact spots.  I own 1 sedan, 1 compact car, and an SUV, this day I drove the sedan and parked in a “regular” parking spot.

When I say they need to be phased out, I mean that the next reasonable (or mandated) time the parking lot would require significant maintenance or repainting, they should just make ALL the car parking spots “regular” sized parking spots or slightly larger to utilize all of the allowed space on the property.

Making them “regular” sized parking spots (or slightly larger) would allow more room to safely open doors, including those with compact cars who inconveniently have someone who doesn’t have a compact car park next to them in a compact parking spot.

In my opinion, it just sounds more beneficial to everyone in the parking lot that everyone has enough space to safely park and open their doors, since not everyone is considerate to not park in a compact spot when they aren’t in a compact car.

It has certainly gotten better since the 1920s in terms of reduction of global poverty and economic opportunity, but there are still so many problems in this world that make me sad such as.

* People commiting suicide.
* Infertile people grieving that they cannot have biological children.
* Racial minorities being unjustly profiled and brutalized by the police.
* Cable news channels spreading misinformation, propaganda, and half-truths just to be sensationalist rather than actually reporting just the facts.
* Income and wealth inequality.
* Domestic violence and sexual assault.
* Ex-felons not being able to find a job due to a criminal record associated with a crime they already served a sentence for. 
* People not being able to access healthcare.
* Innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza being killed by the IDF due to no fault of their own.
* LGBTQ+ and special needs children being bullied and excluded for being different.

And on an on. Honestly, I think younger generations like Millennials and Generation Z have an optimism bias where they want the world to be a utopia or a heaven-on-earth due to growing up in school, being usually treated fairly, getting an education, accepting differences, and being shielded from the harsh truths of reality. Inequality, inequity, injustice, poverty, lack of healthcare, boredom, and human rights abuses, as well as other things in life can really take a toll on your mental health.  I wish for a utopia where we can live forever without injustice, inequality, oppression, poverty, and bias, but I do not think that is possible, even with technological progress and social change.

A psychotherapist in his mid 50s talked to me about my reluctance to stay on my prescription medications and he told me that ""part of being an adult is having to cope with things you have no control over and you cannot change. Accept what you cannot change"". I honestly think that these older generations have came to a point where they thought ""it is what it is, you just have to accept the status quo because nothing you can do can ever change it"". But having to cope with people being killed unjustly or people being discriminated against is a tough pill to swallow and saying, ""just deal with it"" is not enough for me. We need to do more to help people and make the world a better place. Should I just accept the world as it is and just focus on what I can do as an individual to improve my life or should I try to be concerned about social issues that affect other people?"
1,2023-12-14,CMV: American politics demands that you believe objectively false statements.,u/Fresh_Birthday_8712,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18iik7i/cmv_american_politics_demands_that_you_believe/,changemyview,"The one thing that annoys me the most about politics is that to truly “belong” in the Republican or Democratic parties, you must choose to believe (or at least pretend to believe) a mismatched assortment of statements, some of which are objectively false, and most of which have nothing to do with each other.

This is frustrating for me because I’m a very logical person; I’ll personally choose to believe whatever is most objectively true, regardless of how politically incorrect it is.

For example, if you tell most Republicans that global warming is real and human caused, and puts the future of humanity in real danger, you won’t have many Republican friends anymore. They’ll think you’re a RINO. On the other hand, if you tell most Democrats that there are only two genders in a real medical sense, prepare to be cancelled. Now you no longer have any Democrat friends. Try expressing both statements in the same sentence and watch the confusion and anger that goes over many people’s faces. You have committed the ultimate thoughtcrime by daring to state two objectively true statements together.

Where I live, people will think you’re crazy if you say that global warming is real and human caused, even though studies have proven that it is. In the cities, people will think you’re crazy if you say there are two genders. But ultimately it’s the same issue - to be accepted politically, you must agree (or at least pretend to agree) with statements that are objectively incorrect.

That example only involves 2 statements, and it only gets worse if you start stating other objectively true statements, especially if they happen to be completely outside of the Overton window. There are several objectively true statements I am afraid to say in person because people couldn’t handle hearing them: for example the fact that all gods and religions are made up and as imaginary as Santa Claus, the fact that circumcision is rape and child sexual abuse, or the fact that there are differences between the average intelligence of different races (obviously individuals are variable in intelligence; I believe that Obama is the most intelligent president the USA has had during my lifetime).

You can call me a bigot or ban me from Reddit, but that doesn’t make any of these statements stop being objectively true, and it won’t stop me from personally believing them. It will only further prove my point that to be politically correct, you must believe objectively false statements."

How much nail polish is just enough for a biological male to be termed NB or how short does a girl’s hair have to be? Is it a coincidence that ‘non-binary’ biological females usually have the same hairdo and dress?

I really think it’s just a consequence of social activism and politics, rather than something inherent to someone’s identity like being gay or trans. You don’t necessarily have to feel like your a woman or anything to be termed a woman. Just because of what you ‘feel’ (whatever feeing NB entails) doesn’t mean it’s a truth that everyone should subscribe to. Calling you ‘they/them’ is awkward, and for me, does nothing to address actual social justice/gender equality issues which are actually impacting people. This is just a fashion, and if these people hadn’t heard of this label on social media, they would never have even contemplated it remotely."

People always use the terrible metaphor ""a man is in the desert, and a woman is on a raft in the ocean"" to refer to the idea that the problem of men is finding a partner in the first place, while the problem for women is finding a man whose not toxic and/or abusive. this is terrible terrible framing. It's in itself a sexist claim because people who say this believe that men are somehow far more likely to be toxic partners than women are, and they aren't. They might be far more likely to be *physically* abusive, but emotionally? No no. A woman is just as likely to be manipulative as a man is. A woman is just as likely to cheat as a man is. A woman is just as likely to lie, be hard to deal with, just be as asshole, etc, as a man is. Dealing with toxic partners is something both men and women face, and they both face it quite often.
 
*Note: I am talking specifically about the general concept that it's harder for women to find ""good"" partners than it is for men. Obviously women deal with more physical abuse and sexual assault, but on a broader level men and women typically deal with the same amount of other types of emotional abuse, toxicity, cheating, and generally bad partners*

As for the ""men being in a desert"" part. I think you would have to seperate any studies about this into age groups. My hypothesis is that young women today are much more promiscuous than older women were, more liberated obviously. Any studies which do not take this into account do not sufficiently represent the truth. It wouldn't be hard to imagine that a 22 year old woman today has an equal or greater number of sexual partners to a 45 year old woman who was socialized in a less socially liberal society. And if both of these womens experiences are put into a study meant to reflect the year 2023 and which direction society is going, where is the truth in that? You would get a very distorted average. Yes. Women today have more sexual partners than men do, and woman today are less likely to be virgins than men are. So while men struggle slightly more to get a partner than women do, it is just as likely that once they finally find somebody this person will be incompatible or toxic.

That doesn't mean however that men are ""in a desert"". If you cannot get a single date, then you are not a normal man sorry to tell you. You either have social issues you need to work on, or you are truly repulsive in which case I am so sorry. There is no solution to these problems if you care about people being autonomous and free to make their own decisions, which I do. But an honest analysis of society is a good thing."

The reason why social networks are deteriorating, people are hanging out in public less, dating sucks, and the relationships themselves often seem forced is because of social norms established by zoomers: not the economy. 

Most people under the age of 25 who acted an asshole to me were not struggling to make ends meet. They are assholes because they are insecure and are afraid of whether some a given relationship will humiliate them in some way in the future. And they have that fear of being humiliated because all of the peers their ages do regularly humiliate their friends. 

Examples of shitty communication norms from zoomers and some things they should do:

1. Ignoring texts that don’t interest them. Just say something like “oh that’s interesting, but not my thing personally.” You’re not going to offend the person. Don’t worry. 

2. Saying “im busy” as an excuse to not hang out with someone then never follow up with a time that you are free with. Yes I’m a millenial and millennials do this too, but the vast majority of people my age who say they are busy will follow up with a time they are free. But I understand it’s actually often underhanded zoomer dissing that they just don’t want to spend time with you. But just do what millennials do and either ghost them or say that you don’t have time to accommodate new friends. 

3. If someone has a problem with you, hear them out before you get defensive. 

4. If you reciprocate flirtation, you are not saying that you are DTF. Learn to flirt when there is no stakes/no intended outcome of the flirting. Try to enjoy flirting for itself.  

5.  You can still care about someone having less of a tough time than you. 

6. Spend more 1 on 1 quality time with friends without feeling like you need to have something in the background to distract you. 

7.  Learn to not be possessive of people you show vulnerability to. 

8. Girls: boys aren’t gross. try befriending one for once you’ll be surprised that there are straight guys who aren’t just trying to fuck you. And no he is not being nice to you because he wants to fuck you. 


I could keep going. I’m sure I’ll see “bUT otHer gEnEratiOnS Do iT tOo” but lollllll do you think think they did this shit more than zoomers? Do you think they didn’t suffer from economic hardship/racism/sexism?"
45,2023-12-14,CMV: Scientists and Engineers Should Actively Engage with the Ethical Implications of Their Work,u/monkeymalek,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ile10/cmv_scientists_and_engineers_should_actively/,changemyview,"As a scientist or engineer, I believe we have a responsibility to not only focus on the technical aspects of our work but also to earnestly engage with its ethical implications. Take, for example, engineers at Lockheed Martin who work on defense projects. They might justify their work as just another job, but the end result is often weapons that could potentially harm or threaten lives. How can one work in such an environment without considering the moral implications, especially if the output is used in ways that conflict with one's personal ethics, like causing civilian casualties?  
On a more personal note, a current dilemma I am facing is in the field of bioprinting. The potential for this technology to be used to benefit society is innumerable, but the clear connections to pursuits like achieving human immortality is something I find ethically questionable. This leads to a broader concern: should we, as professionals in our fields, be responsible for how our work is ultimately used, especially if it goes against our ethical beliefs?  
Many of us might choose to ignore these moral quandaries, concentrating solely on the research and development aspect of our jobs. This approach, though easier, seems insufficient to me. If our work indirectly contributes to actions we find morally objectionable, aren't we, in some way, complicit? This is not to say that the responsibility lies solely on the individual engineer or scientist, but there's a collective responsibility we share in the industry. Our roles in advancing technology come with the power to shape society, and with that, I believe, comes an obligation to consider the broader impact of our work.  
In conclusion, while it's tempting to work in a vacuum, focusing only on technical goals, I feel we have a duty to engage with the ethical dimensions of our work. This engagement is crucial not just for personal integrity but for the responsible advancement of technology in society. I'm open to having my view challenged or expanded, especially from those in similar fields."

The only real limit is the leave provisions of your work contract. I've seen many people go on stress leave just because they don't like their jobs. In theory, the requirement for a doctor's note should certify that they really are unable to work. But in practice, anyone can get the note if they ask."

We are constantly comparing ourselves to others and we are always thinking about our social positioning within our families, friends, coworkers. If someone has confidence in their cooking skills let’s say, their confidence comes from their relative ability to cook something better than the rest of the people that they know. Those that know this person is a better cook will lose confidence and not feel as worthy with them in the kitchen thus making this person who enjoys cooking think more highly of themselves. Put that same person though in a kitchen with professional chefs and they wouldn’t be as confident with their abilities and the professional chefs will take that persons lack of ability and inherently feel better about themselves and gain confidence.

Others examples being like if you are the first done with a test you’ll feel really good about yourself getting up  in front of the whole class and leaving because the rest of the class feels a bit more rushed and unsure of their abilities. When a model posts a bikini pic she feels more worthy about herself with the thousands of likes but those thousands of likes come from girls who think “I can never look like that, she’s so beautiful”. 


So basically if you want to be confident, you must make others feel less confident even if it’s unintentional. I’m also not saying being confident is a bad thing, but it’s like power. Power wouldn’t exist if everyone was on the same playing field."

When I give someone a gift, I do it because I like them and want to show I care about them, not because I feel obligated to.  When people say this, it makes it seem as if they view gift giving as an obligation, which then makes me think either they secretly do expect a gift, or they are just saying it to virtue signal.  

I also have seen it used by some people as a subtle way to suggest that they’re better off financially than the person they got it for.

I’m not suggesting that everyone who says this phrase actually has these motives.  As I said, I think it may even be well intentioned sometimes.  But even so, I think the phrase is too easily interpreted negatively, and it would be best if we phased out this phrase."

This extends to real life as well - my Jewish friend told me he is asked what his opinion on the conflict is whenever someone finds out he’s Jewish. I must say, I find it extremely antisemitic to equate Jewishness with the Israeli government. That’s tantamount to equating Islam with Al-Qaeda. What’s even more disturbing about the whole thing is it’s mostly progressive people that are guilty of conflating the two.

I really want to hear a convincing argument as to why this conflation of Jewishness with Israel isn’t antisemitic."

34,2023-12-14,"CMV: When establishing a democratic government in a developing country, I think the Westminster system is best.",u/damndirtyape,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18iox6o/cmv_when_establishing_a_democratic_government_in/,changemyview,"In case you aren't aware, the Westminster system is the form of government used in the UK. The country is divided into districts of roughly equal population, and each district elects a single representative to the parliament. The parliament will then hold a vote. If 1 person can win over 50% of the vote, they will become the Prime Minister. The prime minister is the leader of the country, with the support of a cabinet of ministers. 

This system is used in many countries. But, a large number of people argue that a proportional system is better. It is argued that the Westminster system is not representative enough. In more recent times, when new democratic governments have been established, they have often attempted to implement some type of proportional system. 

I acknowledge that some of the world's best functioning governments make use of a proportional system. For example, the Scandinavian countries are all proportional. However, these countries were generally well functioning before they had proportional systems. In contrast, there are examples of proportional governments functioning terribly in less developed countries. Iraq and Afghanistan are good examples of this. 

For a number of reasons, I think proportional systems are more delicate, and work best when they are implemented in a country which already has stable institutions and a well educated populace. In less developed countries, I think the Westminster system is preferable. 

**Less educated people need a simple system**

If a populace does not have a history of democracy, I think they need to be eased into it. This is especially true if they are not well educated. If you're trying to build democratic institutions from the ground up, you need baby steps. 

There are different types of proportional systems, and some are more complicated than others. But, I think everyone can agree that it is easy to understand first past the post elections in single member districts. You vote for your favorite candidate, and the person with the most votes wins. Its simple. 

Moreover, in an undeveloped people, there are likely to be a number of people who don't have good access to information. It might be difficult for them to keep track of various national parties. But, its easy for people to attend a town hall and ask questions to a couple of individuals. They may not understand the nuances of national politics, but they can at least judge the character and reputation of the individual candidates. 

**Its difficult to implement proportionality in a country that does not already have well established parties**

Proportional systems work best when there are well known and well established political groups. If you introduce proportionality to a new democracy, the people aren't going to know who to vote for. In situations like this, its common for people to simply vote along ethnic or sectarian lines. Parties get votes because they put up signs saying they will protect a certain ethnic group. 

Furthermore, these parties often don't have a well established internal system that is used to pick their candidates. Its common for them to be run by small uncountable clique that picks its candidates based on loyalty. Its not uncommon for parties like this to be composed of people who are just there for a paycheck. Candidates like this are more likely to take bribes and engage in corruption. 

In contrast, under the Westminster system, the individual candidates are scrutinized by their voters to a greater degree. There is more pressure on the party to pick candidates with more appeal to the wider populace. 

**An unstable country needs a very stable system**

One other benefit of the Westminster system is that its stable. There is usually one party with a majority of the seats, or a very small coalition. In contrast, proportional governments sometimes require weeks or months of negotiation between a wide array of parties. It can be very difficult to form a coalition, and these coalitions are more fragile. They collapse more easily, necessitating new elections. 

If the country is unstable, they need to be able to quickly form a government that is less likely to collapse due to internal fighting. You can't have months of party negotiations if people are starving, or if there are armed groups that pose a serious threat to the government. Places like this need a stable government that can form quickly. 

**Local representation is especially important in countries with a wide degree of variation between regions**

Many undeveloped countries have a high degree of variation between regions. Its not uncommon for them to contain a large number of different languages and distinct ethnic regions. In countries like this, local representation is really important. You need candidates who speak the language of a region and are familiar with the cultural norms. 

The Westminster system handles this well. Local representation is most definitely one of its strong points. 

**Conclusion**

For all these reasons, I think think the Westminster system is the best choice for a developing country that is implementing a new democratic government. Its simple, its stable, and it emphasizes local representation. These are all things that developing countries need. 

There are certainly some well functioning proportional governments. But, these governments were often implemented in countries that already had a stable society and a well educated populace. This style of government is less suitable for a developing nation."
5,2023-12-14,CMV: White male X Woman of Color interracial relationships are valid and there is nothing to criticize about the concept,u/No-Potential-7333,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ipipw/cmv_white_male_x_woman_of_color_interracial/,changemyview,"the title says it all

I am a White man who has dated mostly women of color most of my life, I am the women I have dated have received a lot of of backlash to our relationships. I will in short run down the reasons given

1:WMXWOC relationships have a history rooted in colonialism- this is false because basically all the colonial empires had laws banning race mixing, as chivalry was the way in Europe and men were expected to sacrifice for the good of their family and nation these laws were pretty much always enforced more harshly on men. I saw one Muslim historian claim Europeans took women from the Maghreb as sex slaves during the colonial age. I can't even find evidence Europeans had sex slaves at this this time much less ones from the Maghreb specifically. 

1.5: related to the last point even if this is rooted in colonialism why does that matter now ? There is another widespread preference that is rooted in colonialism that being society's preference for tall people especially tall men, I don't know if you know this but white people are tall look up list of tallest countries and you see a bunch of white countries, this was pretty much always the case especially in the colonial age. Whites would use their height as proof of their superiority over their colonial subjects. So I ask you this, is it racist for a woman to prefer tall men ?  

2: WMXWOC is a fetish that is oversexualized and promoted by porn, this is also a myth as the mainstream porn industry at best doesn't care about these relationships and at worst outwrite hates them. I challenge you to look up say White male Asian female or White male Black female and see what comes up. What will probaly come up is either unrelated videos or loads of Black male White female videos. Look up interracial porn same thing. No joke just to test thus I looked up White male Asian female porn on pornhub without an account (this website is awful do not use it) and the first result was ""Tattooed Boyfriend finger fucks you to orgasm // NSFW Audio and ASMR // Dirty Talking Verbal Boy"" This isn't even close, the only way the algorithm could make this mistake is if the site is purposely trying to suppress this type of content which I can't prove, however I do believe this possibility to be likely   


3: These relationships are promoted by the media. This is also false, I looked up on google ""interracial couple movies"" and the first results were ""Lake view terrace"",""focus"",""you people"",""a bronx tale"",""everything, everything"" and ""the sun is also a star"" 

Only the last 2 were White male x WOC.The top results nd the majority were a black man and a white woman

4: WMXWOC couples have a higher abuse rate. I have yet to find any data that this is true, but let's assume that it is. 44% of percent of lesbian women and 61% of bisexual women – compared to 35% of heterosexual women – experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime. Source: National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, 2010 Summary Report. National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Division of Violence Prevention, Atlanta, GA, and Control of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. So are Lesbian relationships not valid either ? 

I am sick of the hypocrisy, the worst part is that the backlash isn't coming from conservatives who oppose all interracial relationships, these people bother me less because at least they're consistent. It is coming from rad libs who claim to be all about free love and support anything between 2 consenting adults "

I found interesting stats on there.

>>The top 10% of households by wealth had $7.0 million on average. As a group, they held 69% of total household wealth.

>>The bottom 50% of households by wealth had $51,000 on average. As a group, they held only 2.5% of total household wealth.

This stat could also explain why the US on paper is recovering but people still feel economic pressures? Maybe the top and middle class are soaking up the the money from sectors in the economy that are recovering? That's why the top might have told their lackeys to push the narrative and there is such a huge disconnect?

As for the argument where if half of Americans lost everything, and America would be fine there would of course have to be some stipulations. They wouldnt be able to revolt/have to go to work to the best of their abilities. 

I'm sure there are plenty of gaps of logic in my argument so dont take it too seriously."

Basically, I just think that rampant sexual anxiety and frustration is a huge problem, pretty much everywhere in the entire world, and I think that this is a major contribution to a lot of the things we do to cause each other to suffer, and that scales from down to individual relationships all the way up to the laws we pass and sometimes even the wars we wage. 

I’m not saying sexual frustration is the only problem and that fixing that fixes everything. I’m saying that it is a major factor in many ills. 

And solving sexual frustration doesn’t mean forcing everyone to fuck, passing laws or anything. I think we just need to have a culture shift in our thinking about sex, and not fixate on it so much.

I don’t have a 12 point solution to fixing the cultural axioms of sex or anything, but I guess my basics are something like:

1) Stop relating sexuality and purity. Unrelated. Sex isn’t dirty or bad or shameful. So just chill with the purity bullshit.

2) stop putting sex on a pedestal. Some people don’t even like sex. Most people like sex at different amounts. Don’t call the people that really like it sluts, and don’t call the people who don’t care much for it impotent or weak or whatever you call them.

3) Don’t give a fuck what gets other consenting  adults off. Are they consenting? Are they adults? If the answer to both is yes then shut your mouth this goddamn instant, and further to that, stop talking thinking that way. You’re brain is wrong if you thought of anything in which you answered yes to both and think you deserve to have an opinion. So stop. Stop having that opinion.

I will certainly respond, but I’m writing this drowsy before bed, just sharing some deep thoughts I just had, so responses won’t be until tomorrow. 

Also, to be clear, this was kind of stream of consciousness, kind of just typing the thoughts as I’m thinking them.

2,2023-12-15,CMV: Power scaling is pointless and misguided,u/Z7-852,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18isxtg/cmv_power_scaling_is_pointless_and_misguided/,changemyview,"""Who would win a fight"" is question asked all the time in different fandoms and is mostly answered using ""power scaling"". Basic principle is as following. Consume all possible media the character is portrait and take their best performance or ""feats"" and then use transitive relation and compere them to other characters in said media. This gives you some sort of power tier and now you start heated argument with someone about how this character could win that character in a fight. That is power scaling in a nutshell.

This kind of discussions always devolve into fandoms arguing about pointless and misguided interoperations of these characters and stories they are in. If you ask same question in two different subreddit you can guess the concusses winner just from subreddit name alone. Your favorite character will always win and my main argument tells why this is actually always correct.

First some minor arguments why this is pointless before the actual main argument.

* **Taking only the extreme feats.** Characters power level is not same their strongest feat. Sometimes their action is due to luck or it's a last ditch effort. Not something your would even consider using in a actual match up.
* **Inconsistency within story.** Even within same story written by the same writer, characters power level fluctuates. There is sometimes in world explanation for this and sometimes not.
* **Inconsistency between stories.** Squirrel Girl have managed to subdue heavy hitters like Galactus and Thanos so clearly she is the most powerful Marvel here out there. In others she is knocked down by a bus. Same character has different feats depending on the story sometimes even losing or gaining abilities depending who is writing it.
* **Not taking in account flair.** If I write a book and say character is ""fast as a bullet in a boxing ring"" everybody knows I don't mean that they can throw a punch 3000 km per hour. That is figurative speech. And when comic book artist or animator animates a flashy attack where character pulls moon from orbit and uses it to strike a planet they don't actually mean that what happens. It's just flair. There is no consistency with this kind of flair and it doesn't have to have.
* **Difference in media.** Continuing on the last point written text is not comparable to animation or video game. These are different medias and depiction of same action will appear very differently in all of them.
* **Impossibility to compere different IPs.** Magic (or power) systems in each IP work differently. Trying to compere magic of Harry Potter to magic in Lord of the Rings is pointless because they are not comparable. This becomes even worse when you try to say ""because this character can absorb chakra in their own universe they should be able to absorb magic mana in other"". That's not how those worlds work.
* **Fights don't have justification**. This is more about bad writing in part of these debates but characters don't have any motivation to fight each other and therefore these fights are narratively poorly written and boring.

And now the actual reason why power scaling is pointless and misguided.

* **Writers can do whatever they want.** [Stan Lee put this the best. Who would win in a fight? Whoever the writer wants to win.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3pOIDaF1Dw]) Writers write compelling and good stories. If they are fun they are fun might that be because of cleaver tactics or flashy animation. Writer can make anyone win any fight and if the story is good it's good. It doesn't matter what characters have done in some other stories or how one is ""supposed to be stronger"".

And this is not just ""let's ignore plot armor"" kind of deal. Plot and the story is all that these fictional characters have. They are not real so they have nothing but plot armor and plot weapons. All their feats and actions happen because of the plot and therefore are at whims of the writer."

But none of their arguments hold up, because there's nothing unique about child beauty pageants compared to other, far worse activities kids in America do.

1. ""The parents who put their kids in them are psychos""

Have you ever been to a youth sports event? Parents force their kids to play, fight refs, fight coaches, fight other team's parents, belittle the kids, ignore concussion symptoms, make the kids cry constantly, and will weight shame them if their weight is affecting their performance (read the stories about young synchronized swimmers and gymnasts for insight into that). There's nothing unique about pageant moms (and do you think for a second the reality show didn't make them seem worse than they are for views?), we're just used to the idea of sports parents being psychos and have become numb to it.

2. ""It's all about pedophilia""

&#x200B;

Pedos are everywhere kids are. Schools, youth sports, hospitals, church, you name it. We even understand that stranger danger was stupid, since the pedo is gonna be someone you know. But when it comes to child pageants, people are convinced it's pedophiles all over the place. That's stupid. Little kids haven't been around long enough to develop a real talent like playing an instrument, so they all dance. Whatever. How's that different from doing cheerleading or dance? I even hear that they must attract pedos because the girls look like adults? What? How's that make sense? If you see a little girl in a big dress and thing ""surely this must be a pedophile thing"" that's on you. You're way too paranoid. 

&#x200B;

3. ""It sends a bad message to little girls""

&#x200B;

Without even getting into messages it sends to girls, we have kids who we strap to sheep and force to ride them to the point of life threatening injuries because their parents want them to become rodeo stars. We put kids in boxing to punch each other in the face until one falls down. We have them racing go karts and smashing into the wall. But we're really convinced beauty pageants need to be made illegal because they encourage girls to be pretty? Really? Just say you don't like them and let the people who do, do them. "

1,2023-12-15,CMV: At least 90% of the people who think they have autism are just poorly socialized/looking for attention. Even most of kids who are diagnosed with autism really just have bad parents.,u/Tsunami_7777,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18iuul8/cmv_at_least_90_of_the_people_who_think_they_have/,changemyview,"I am sure this has already been done before,  so feel free to downvote or delete my post.

Autism is a severe genetic intellectual disability that manifests itself in complete inability to learn certain skills or manifest certain traits that are considered normal. A person who is autistic is literally incapable of certain things no matter how much you try and train/teach them to do so.

In general, most of the people who have 'autism' in modern society are not incapable or unable to achieve normal social skills and abilities- they are just regular people with poor social skills, poor life skills, and/or who have been raised without a proper parent/mentor in their life.

Kids should be socializing with other kids and interacting with adults for multiple hours a day every day from the age of 1. If you raise a kid on technology and keep them isolated from society then obviously they are not going to develop the skills they need.

Many of the kids who are getting diagnosed with autism are perfectly capable and normal human beings who have spent their entire childhoods looking at an iPad. If these kids had parents that actually sat down with their kids for a few hours a day and spent time with them then they would easily be able to acquire normal skills through mimicry and observation.

Likewise, most of the adults who have autism are just looking for an excuse for their own basic insufficiencies. Just because you have some excessive quality of any kind does not make you autistic, it just means that you have not addressed yourself or managed yourself appropriately.

There is nothing or special cute about being autistic. It is a curse just like being born with some other physical disability. These people need special care for their entire lives and they are unable to take care of themselves or work in most cases.

Genuinely autistic people cannot overcome their disability with any amount of care, attention, or effort. Modern 'autistic' people could easily overcome their 'quirks' if they spent as much time on themselves as they spent on TikTok or any other social media showcasing their autism. 

People who are claiming to have autism on social media, or parents who showcase their 'autistic' kids for views, should be canceled immediately. Pretending to have a disability for attention is disgusting. Autism is just that, a disability, and a very severe one at that.

Autistic is by definition a developmental defect. If you are a fully developed, beautiful, intelligent human being calming to have autism- you are just an asshole. If your completely biologically normal kid doesn't like to make eye contact or talk to people- chances are you are just a neglectful parent who gets off on glorifying and victimizing yourself. 

Having known many autistic people in my lifetime and seeing the depth of their helplessness and the difficulty they face in society, it makes me so mad to see so many people claiming to have autism just because it serves their own sense of identity. Have they never met a real autistic person? Do they really not understand how much that these people suffer in our society? I just don't understand how something like this can be considered trendy or acceptable.

1,2023-12-15,Cmv: freedom of speech should include hate speech,u/Basic-Toe-9979,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18iva62/cmv_freedom_of_speech_should_include_hate_speech/,changemyview,"Im a firm believer that freedom of speech shouldn’t be censored in any circumstance ever. For example a white person who drops the n word while aware of the significance of the word deserves to be knocked out imo but should never, in any circumstance, be censored.

Im 100% aware that the n word, r word, f word etc can hurt some people but so can almost every word, if used for ill intent.

What im saying is that if someone want to hurt someone else verbally, they shouldn’t be forbidden from using certain words because they’re too ""offensive""

It’s like the act of verbally assaulting someone is perfectly fine as long as your vocal cords don’t make a certain combination of sounds, or else you’ll lose the privilege of expressing yourself on most platforms. Is it just me or it makes no sense?"
1,2023-12-15,CMV: 'Down By The River' By Neil Young Shouldn't Exist,u/Redrolum,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ivek8/cmv_down_by_the_river_by_neil_young_shouldnt_exist/,changemyview,"'Down By The River' seems like a woman abusing song and I can't for the life of me wrap my head around why it exists when Neil Young is supposed to be a progressive and socially conscious artist.

Even as a teenager the lyrics of Stevie Ray Vaughan's bothered me ""Yeah I love my lady, she's long and lean /
You mess with her, you'll see a man gettin' mean"" I commented even at the time that it wasn't a love song Stevie just wanted to threaten the world and music was his medium. He goes right from ""love"" to crass objectification, it felt like every other song of his was this one, and it really got under my skin and made me overall dislike him as an artist.

Same with Jimi Hendrix's 'Hey Joe' - a quick story those lyrics go back many decades, but in his version it seems like it's just glorifying violence. I don't really understand why this song exists or what you're supposed to do if you're at the concert. Do you dance, or sing along to this? Do you hold your head in your hands and cry?

Someone once told me that Eagles 'Lyin' Eyes' was used by abusers, since most of the fans of the song didn't get that it was at least half the husband's fault for allowing the cheating to happen, and MJ's Billie Jean sort of seems like it's picking on women with mental health problems and it seems like it would be a much better song without ruining that name. The point is I get that there is artistic merit to most of these tunes but there is nothing redeeming or even justice invoking in DBTR (Down By The River) whether or not you're living in a van in the vicinity.

Imagine if someone were to put together a playlist of all these songs and just sit in a darkened room staring at your girlfriend while the sun goes down. They're threatening. They're intimidating, and I fundamentally don't understand why they exist, why they're so popular, and why the lyrics don't bother everyone else and at the same time I bet Neil puts this hit in every single playlist.

That's like some sell your soul to the devil at the crossroads to play guitar real good type of darkness there. I don't understand it but I want to if there is anything more to it than that most folk just don't really listen to the lyrics. I want to know if there is any artistic merit to an unredeemably villainous song especially compared to the rest of his discography.

I did search up interviews and reddit posts on this song but no one really comments on the lyrics much."

The most common arguments for antinatalism include:

- Life entails inevitable suffering.
- Death is inevitable.
- Humans (and all forms of life) are born without their consent—no one chooses whether or not they come into existence.
- Although some people may turn out to be happy, this is not guaranteed, so to procreate is to gamble with another person's suffering.
- There is an axiological asymmetry between good and bad things in life, such that coming into existence is always a harm."

1,2023-12-15,CMV: Dating and navigating romantic/sexual relationships is harder for men,u/West-Teach6260,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18izeks/cmv_dating_and_navigating_romanticsexual/,changemyview,"In the west where there isn’t such a thing as arranged marriages (widely) and there aren’t economic factors preventing women from being able to live alone, dating is 100% more difficult for men than it is for women.

So if we’re talking about a casual sexual relationship I don’t think anyone is able to argue that it is easier for women. But I would argue that it’s easier for women to find a satisfying partner too. Why? Well it’s simple, is it easier to find an ace in a full deck of cards or find an ace hidden in the woods somewhere where? I would say the former.

As for dating (and I guess casual sex), men are the ones that are courting. Men are the ones approaching women, asking for numbers, buying drinks, driving conversations, trying to impress. For us, it’s a job interview. Men are the ones risking rejection, risking humiliation, risking looking like a creep because they accidentally set of some red flag in the woman’s eyes because they were a little awkward or whatever. For us it’s conversational chess.

For women it’s as simple as saying yes or no. Women are the ones playing a more passive role in dating, so they don’t have to do much other than exist in a location where there are men. For most women, a man that likes them is easily replaceable. At similar levels of attractiveness, any woman gets more attention from the opposite sex than vice versa. 

It also doesn’t help that women have a much higher criteria for what is passable for men. Women rate the majority of men as being ugly and only find the top 10% to 20% to be attractive. So that means 80% of men are not going to have casual sex. Maybe that 80% can date after women get out of the phase when they want to be with men they’re attracted to, but that means spending your late teen and 20s alone while most women can get sex of relationship if they want.

Men are attracted to more women and have a much lower standard of what women should bring to the table for a relationship. Women aren’t exactly replaceable for 80% of men, there’s a reason why most marriages and relationships are ended by women. Men want to hold on and fix things. Women can find a new man with the snap of her fingers."

46,2023-12-15,"CMV: Every densely populated and large enough country, should have two mostly separate rail systems: high-speed mainly for passenger, and low-speed mainly for freight",u/Soyuz_1848,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18izy8p/cmv_every_densely_populated_and_large_enough/,changemyview,"(1) Define densely populated and large enough country: have at least a chain of major cities along an at least 500 km curved line, which is enough to financially support a high speed train line

(2) Define high speed rail: railways with a top speed of at least 250 km/h. Define low speed rail: railways with a top speed of at most 160 km/h. Define mostly separate: they may intersect and may interchange with each other, slow lines may serve as a feeder role or connection lines to faster lines, but the majority of travel done should be separated. 

(3) why they should have high speed rail is obvious. HSR offers an unparalleled balance of speed, comfort and economy in terms of medium-to-long range travel, aka 200 km to 1000 km, if we include high speed sleeper trains then we can extend to 2000 km. Not to mention it's safe and low-carbon. 

(4) I'll focus on why separate passenger from freight travel. 

(A) most existing train lines can't be upgraded to 300+ km/h to support high speed trains so we need to built dedicated high speed lines.

(B) for high speed lines, adding painfully low freight trains would drastically decrease the efficiency for faster trains. Everyone's trip needs to be slower now. 

(C) for low speed lines, even if you run fast train models on them, they're still forced to run at a low speed. This is a massive waste of the train's capacity. Thus we need to have two separate rail systems. They may intersect and slower lines may serve as a feeder for passenger trains running on high speed lines, but they should largely remain separate for the most part. 

(D) why keep slow lines mostly for freight: as we know freight trains don't need to be super fast. 80 km/h is more often than not enough. Thus they need to run on the slow lines. And one reason why passenger rail is so expensive in the US is that freight trains are generally profitable than low-speed passenger trains. Running more passenger trains on slow lines won't bring much profit. 

(E) If we have passenger dedicated high speed lines, they won't face competition from freight travel, thus the price can be driven down."

Even an attempt to reboot the franchise to modern day failed.

Not only does John Wick has not one, not two but FOUR amazing movies, it is a pop culture phenomenon. For one, it has influenced the action genre so much with movies like Extraction and the James Bond movies taking inspiration from the slick choreography. John Wick 4 is the 11th highest grossing movie of 2023. 

Most importantly it reinvigorated Keanu Reeves' career. Prior to John Wick, he wasn't in any big franchises and was mostly known by older people. However once the first movie became a hit, he more or less made a career comeback with everyone young and old knowing who he is. 

Furthermore the John Wick movies are just better than the Matrix films. The Matrix movies while having cool action sequences, interesting lore and cutting edge technology, are very hard to understand and are not that accessible. John Wick on the other hand not only gives us both traditional gun fight sequences alongside creative action sequences, very interesting lore with the way the world of these assassins work, but it's also understandable enough that anyone can just turn off their brain and have fun with the movies, thus making them more accessible. And while a thought provoking message about reality and free will is nice every now and then, most people just want to turn off their brains.

Overall, the Matrix made Keanu Reeves a household name, but John Wick is Keanu's staple franchise.

1,2023-12-15,CMV: “God” needs us just as much as we need Him.,u/Ornery_Tailor_9879,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18j1isv/cmv_god_needs_us_just_as_much_as_we_need_him/,changemyview,"I think the idea of God can be expanded to somewhere further than what is explained in any religion. At the core of them all, God symbolizes the creation and sustainability of life. Even for the atheists or agnostics; there’s always some meaning to which we establish behind this otherwise mysterious life we live. There’s always a God.

I grew up Catholic, but have since grown away from the Catholic Church for a multitude of reasons. Honestly, I’m not sure if my faith, or if I believe in the same omnipotent “God” as the Catholics I was raised with. However, I have came across countless admirable people who live their lives gracefully and selflessly in accordance to the teachings of God.

I also have countless friends of different religions and beliefs; people I hold in the highest regards with greater respect for them than I have for myself. Regardless of their religion, they all hold some sort of central values or beliefs that they use to live their life in a higher sense of morality. They try to be good people, and I love them all.

Whether these Gods could be physically proven is irrelevant. The collective faith of billions of individuals of various religions and beliefs have shaped humans into living at a higher standard of perceived morality for millenniums, and without those collective beliefs, actions, and faith, that God would die, and so would the message for building a “better” community. The more prevalent the faith of a collective religion, the more powerful that God becomes—malevolent or benevolent the God needs its followers to live.

Sometimes I think of each of us humans as our own personal God. It’s our conscience that has control over countless microorganisms that ultimately compose the bodies we know, much like my fellow Catholic raised friends believe God has an almighty control over humanity. We are a God to the life that lives inside us, and we need them to survive, just as much as they need us.

Would it be so silly to think of the Earth as a cell in a much larger enteral system that we humans might perceive as God? I think it’s our duty to make the planet work, along with our fellow species of life on this planet to keep our beautiful planet living, so the Earth can play its role in the universe. If we live in a cancerous way, we will leave a tumor on our limb of the universe. There’s no intergalactic surgeon so it’s fair to assume the conditions would be terminal.

The universe needs us to live and thrive so I can live and thrive itself. It needs life to live, because without any life, the universe would be just as dead as the Old Gods."

49,2023-12-15,CMV: Pepper spray based weapons should be allowed in war.,u/Grandemestizo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18j2u2s/cmv_pepper_spray_based_weapons_should_be_allowed/,changemyview,"Pepper spray is currently illegal to use in combat because it is a chemical weapon. While I wholeheartedly agree with the ban on the use of chemical weapons in combat there should be an exception made for pepper spray.

Pepper spray is the safest and most effective non-lethal weapon in common use. It has saved countless lives by offering an alternative to lethal force. Military objectives often do not require the death of the enemy but lethal force is used anyway because it is the only reliable method of removing the enemy from a particular location. I believe large pepper spray type weapons could be used to effectively force the enemy to retreat or surrender in many situations, saving lives and preventing collateral damage.

Let’s take, for example, a house in a dense urban environment which is being occupied by terrorists. Current military doctrine is to either destroy the house with explosives (typically an air strike) or have infantry clear it with grenades and small arms. If it were possible to saturate the interior of the house with pepper spray using a sprayer the size of a flamethrower or perhaps some sort of pepper bomb, it is likely that the terrorists could be forced to surrender without the use of lethal force. This would be particularly useful if there may be non-combatants in the house.

A gas mask is an effective defense against pepper spray. The fact is that many terrorists organizations do not have the ability to supply all of their fighters with gas masks and even if they did, the fighters would have to put on their gas masks before the pepper spray is deployed for them to be effective. One also cannot wear a gas mask indefinitely, so a long period of pepper spray saturation of an area would still be effective against forces wearing gas masks.

To use an example from conventional warfare, suppose you have two opposing armies fighting from entrenched positions. Pepper spray could be deployed into the enemy trench by air dropping pepper bombs or perhaps through specialized artillery shells. The enemy would almost certainly have gas masks but again, those have to be removed eventually to eat or change the filters. If the enemy trench can be saturated with pepper spray for several days it is likely that the enemy would be forced to retreat, or would at least be burdened with the need to rotate forces in and out of the trench at a much increased rate causing serious logistic strain. All this would be accomplished with little risk of death or serious injury.

It is not a perfect weapon. There are countermeasures and it is possible for a person to be hurt or killed by pepper spray under certain conditions (though this is very rare) but it is a potentially effective and relatively humane tool which militaries should have access to."

To all those saying that I could save my money now and grow a tree of money in the future, it's a valid point but it boils down to a more Philosophical question. Would saving make me happier? Does more money in the future mean more happiness? I agree that to some extent money does bring happiness, but there's a subjective upper limit where it doesn't mean anything anymore. Going out to expensive restaurants and buying expensive hobby gadgets fulfills me more right now, than the promise of a Yacht I'd use once a year when I'm 60 or a granite kitchen instead of a wooden one. I mean, that's the question I'm essentially asking.

I kind of have this rule that if I want to do something and money is the issue, then it's not really an issue. The benefit i'd get from doing something I wanted at the time I wanted to do it far outlasts the benefit of saving it for something I don't know I want yet. If I really do not have the money for something I want, then and only then I'll actually save for it. Regardless, It won't be something as grand as a Castle or a Yacht.

End of edit.

.....................


I'm in my 20s, working multiple jobs and earning money like 99% of people my age. Regardless, I'm being forced to put a lot of it in pension. If I want to draw money out of this pension, I have to pay like 1/3 of it in taxes.

I started developing an opinion that it doesn't make sense that in old age I'd like to live in luxury, while being young I'm forced to behave frugal and modest with my savings.

I assume based on my personality and the generalization of old age, that when I reach the age of retirement, I'd very much just like to relax with a good book in the countryside, and not spend it on grandious and luxurious expenses. The time for those expenses is NOW, when I'm young. Why should I wait 40-50 years to actually enjoy spending without worrying?

I mean, at my age, I shouldn't be thinking twice about spending money in travelling, gadgets, good food, furniture, etc. I am mostly sure that in old age those things would interest me far less.

Another point is that as I grow older, I gain more experience years or start a business, and naturally my income grows. Why should I save money from the miniscule amount of income I make right now, as opposed to saving from my theoretical business let's say 30 years from now, where my income then would be 10 times my income now?

It's as if right now I'm being paid 2 peanuts and I have to put 1 penaut in savings, and in an older age I'd make 10 peanuts, and I'd have to put let's say 5 in savings. It makes much more sense to save when you have what to save FROM.

I also don't understand why can't I just not be forced to put savings in pension, and a day before retirement just dump all my savings into my pension account. That would be an equivalent to putting each month without the hassle of putting money away at a young age.

The only ""forced"" income I should be needed to put aside is the bare minimum that's enough for living and not dying of hunger when it's divided monthly at retirement age. Anything else just doesn't make sense to me, for the aforementioned reasons."

If you were to meet me, I would ask you your name if I was interested in getting to know you more. And you would tell me, ""My name is [John, George, Scott, Ashley, Briana, Alex]""

And then I would accept what you told me. Because I do not know your family history. I do not know your name until you tell me it. And I will accept whatever name you tell me, regardless of what is on your driver's license or birth certificate. 

A given name is fine. If you prefer your given name, I have no problem with you. It is also practical. A child's given name is practical. We give it to them because we understand that a child cannot initially name themselves. But eventually they will be able to.

A child's given name is fine, if it is the name that they have chosen. A chosen name is much better, imo. Because it is the name that you have decided on for yourself.

Kanye is not an idiot. There is no way that he doesn't understand the simplest joke. The episode comes so close to basically just saying the meaning of the joke plainly, so if he watched the episode he cleary knows the meaning of the joke.

Why would he pretend to not understand the joke though? Simple. It fits with his public persona very well. His egotistical and self-centered attitude is so iconic that it makes sense for him to play into it. He's also done it before, like on the Ego remix. On the I Love Kanye skit, he ends it by saying ""And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye"". He is self aware.

About the [3 responses](https://youtu.be/zw_GiE7ZcgQ?si=lNh4V_mxqCmBNlmq) he made to the joke:

Gorgeous and Made in America: This does not at all show that Kanye doesn't get the joke. It's making fun of Kanye, of course he's gonna respond.

2019 Interview: This is the closest to him seeming to not understand the joke, but I still doubt that. He could have easily just remembered it and decided to reference the joke in a more serious context to appear clueless to keep the gag running.

People are constantly saying that he still doesn't get the joke, which is why I made this post."
92,2023-12-16,CMV: Pity Sex Is Fine,u/idea-freedom,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18jrd0p/cmv_pity_sex_is_fine/,changemyview,"I’ve read many posts or comments excoriating pity sex. Let me define what it means for my purposes so we are on the same page.

“pity sex”: sex offered or allowed by one partner solely for the other partner’s satisfaction, with no expected or realized enjoyment on the part of the offerer.

The normal posts or comments about this will justify turning down pity sex because it makes them feel wholly unwanted and lacks the real human connection that great sex really satisfies. To be clear, I don’t disagree that pity sex is very “pitiful sex”, and far below the bar of a truly meaningful sexual experience.

So why do I think it’s fine? As in so many things in life, we can control our perspective, and through our perspective things can be wholly changed in our experience. I CHOOSE to view pity sex as an offer of love and service. Sometimes a partner can’t bring themselves to the point of sexual enjoyment based on their own life and mental state. Viewing this as some manifestation of my own inadequacy would be my own problem. Instead, I view it as their own issue, and something they don’t enjoy going through. They would rather feel engaged in sex, and they sometimes can’t. This is hard for them as well. In these circumstances, recognizing that their partner may have a need they don’t currently have, and offering it is an offer of service to one they love. 

I further believe taking pity sex is better than masturbating alone. Both are not so fulfilling, but one involves dropping pride and accepting an act of service from a loved one. Accepting service is difficult because of pride, but when we do we can draw closer to the server. Pity sex, serving one another through hardship, and dropping our pride can lead us closer together, and result in true mutually satisfying sex that we all want more of in the future. 

Ok, now cmv."

My 1st reason is that it makes them be able to work hard. Every year, around 10,00,000 applicants do the Joint Entrance Examination. Those aspirants study for around 9 hours per day. That means that they work for 9 hours per day. This can make them learn how to work hard under pressure, which is an useful life-skill. Right now, bith my older cousin-brothers are in college, and they work for around 12 hours a day. However, they are unfazed, since years of studying for the Joint Entrance Examination has made them get used to working under pressure. My father works for 5 days a week at work, and 6 days a week as a president at an event. However, even he is unfazed, since studying so much has made him get used to the long hours of work.

Furthermore, imagine how happy the people who go to the Indian Institute of Technology are! This is such a special achievement to them, and by banning the Joint Examination diminishes this achievement, which will make absolutely worthy candidates lose their motivation to work hard in the future. Furthermore, in colleges where entrance examinations are not a way of deciding the eligibility wnd skill of a candidate, such as Ivy league colleges, other things that have no correlation with the skill of the candidate in that particular field, such as participating extracurricular activities, learning a foreign language, and more. Imagine doing all this, and having to study in order to gain knowledge in your field! That is spinning too many plates at the same time, and as the old proverb goes, Jack of all trades is a master at none.

Finally, even with these challenges overcome, there is no reasonable alternative to the Joint Entrance Examination. Currently, there are around 11,00,000 people giving the Joint Entrance Examination Advanced, with only 10,000 seats in the Indian Institute of Technology. This means that only .09% of aspirants go to the Indian Institute of Technology, while the accentance rate of Ivy league colleges is only around 4.5%, which is a whopping 49,500 candidates, which is 495% of the Indian Institute of Technology's seats. It is impossible to fit these many people in the college.


The above reasons are all of the reasons why I think that the Joint Entrance Examination should not be banned."

4) Nobody has to watch you open a bunch of presents and you don’t have to open a bunch of presents just front of people. This is a win for you and the guests! Trust me, nobody likes watching you open your quirky wine goblet and 2023 Snuggie equivalent.

Both Democrats and Republicans tend to hold this same assumption. It is the big unspoken driver and motivator behind both parties' policies. Whether this assumption is actually *correct* or not isn't really relevant; it's what both *believe*.

If you are a Democrat, and think most illegal immigrants would vote (D) in the future, why *wouldn't* you want them in America, and be given the right to vote? It would be a massive boon to your party at the ballot box. Similarly, if you are a Republican, and think most illegal immigrants would vote Democratic, then of course you'd oppose them tooth and nail. Letting millions of them come in and vote (D) at the polls would be electoral suicide.

To put it another way, **if most illegal immigrants held MAGA views, were pro-Trump, and were known to be very conservative, the D's and R's would flip stances in an instant.** There's *no way* the D's would allow tens of millions of MAGA Trumper illegal immigrants to come in and be given the right to vote in America; that would be electoral suicide. Similarly, Republicans would be welcoming as many such migrants as they could.

Of course, there are other factors involved in the debate - whether such migrants take jobs from Americans, whether the border facilities can handle them, whether there are unsafe people (i.e., terrorists or drug cartel members in the mix,) etc. But the overall main crux of the issue is how these illegal immigrants would vote, if given the right to vote."

One of the ways we're encouraged to raise money is through partnerships with big fast food and fast casual companies. The way these partnerships work is that during a certain time, your organization gets a certain percent of sales as a donation if you meet a minimum quota. Sounds great, right? However, after doing a significant number of these fundraisers, I've become convinced they are actually designed in a way to maximize profit for the company at the direct expense of the charity. I've come to believe that the fundraisers aren't actually about the company wanting to help the community, and I hate being this cynical. 

Here is my evidence:

\-The biggest one is that you only get a percent of MENTIONED sales. So, basically, you only get a cut if the buyer says ""I'm here to support X High School"". If they don't say it, no money for you. 

This would be reasonable, except...

\-You're not allowed to hang out at the restaurant with a sign, pass out flyers, or remind people as they come in that your fundraiser exists. In order to get money for your org, you basically do free advertising for the restaurant, but they rig the game so that if any of the people you bring in forget, you get nothing.

This might also be fair, except...

The percentage you get is TINY. I've seen anywhere from 10% to 33%. This means you advertise for free for the restaurant, drive traffic there and get them business, are not allowed to encourage those customers, and it's all still for less than half of what the restaurant makes. 

I also have done a fundraiser where the kids got 10% of all sales + tips in exchange for bussing tables for a fast food place.. They were allowed to beg for money, and we made almost 3 times  what we usually do. I still think 10% for 6 hours of free labor is absurd if it's about charity, though. 

If it were all about charitable giving, I just think it'd be set up in a way that helps the charities. 

I'm open to having my mind changed because I hate being this cynical about the world, and I'd like to think big companies aren't lying to our faces when they claim they want to help kids and the community. I'd especially like to hear from any corporate employees of major fast food companies to know if y'all actually design these fundraisers with an eye to do good and the company's perspective. "
1,2023-12-16,CMV: Porn should 100% be banned.,u/HistoricalArchiver,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18juqr4/cmv_porn_should_100_be_banned/,changemyview,"I do indeed think porn should be 100% banned. Whether it is legal, consensual, illegal, etc.
There are some reasons for this:

1. The porn industry is known for its spreading of STDs
2. Erectile dysfunction is common amongst most male actors aswell, this somewhat correlating with my first point 
3. Minors can easily access it and can view more nudity than their grandfather ever did. 
*I should clarify this means internet porn, magazine porn, anything showing fully nude women for non educational purposes.
5. It embraces lust, now lust is bad to me in the sense that it blends the line of love and lust. The porn industry mainly makes content for men, and it promotes objectification of women.
6. Continuing on the previous point, impressionable teens can view porn and have the wrong idea about what love really is.
7. The fetishization is going high in the porn industry aswell, there’s people who fetishize overweight people, certain races above others, and fetishizes even sexualities, such as men watching lesbian porn.
8. Many of the actors hesitantly do some videos just for money, involving kinks and fetishes they are not into, but decide to go through with it anyway.
9. Porn is like a slippery slope, you can see videos for things you’re not into but it can imprint on the young mind, eventually people can get into truly deprived things, maybe go on to even watch snuff films or watch more violent videos within porn.

In conclusion I think it would really be a benefit for porn to be 100% banned.

While not *real* children, the designs for these children are clearly and undeniably derivative from real life human children. I.e. Kobato Hasegawa, a popular loli that has a very clear child’s body proportions and behavior. 

This is why anyone, even someone who doesn’t watch anime, can watch a lolicon anime and recognize that these characters are human, and which characters are children - without having to be told. 

It’s visually apparent to everyone because it clearly derives from real human children and everyone knows what that looks like. 

The sole defining characteristic of the genre is the sexualization of specifically prepubescent girls. The fact that this aspect is the defining feature of the genre is because prepubescent anime girls make loli fans aroused. As I have shown that lolis are based off and designed to resemble human children, this is pedophilic. 

Their is no good reason to be turned on by prepubescent girls, and just because it’s a drawing does not mean they don’t represent pedophilic fantasies."

10,2023-12-16,CMV: All U.S. states should adopt a universal traffic law system,u/DustTheOtter,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18jy76d/cmv_all_us_states_should_adopt_a_universal/,changemyview,"For clarification, I believe there should be a single, universal traffic law system for the entirety of the United States that makes all state traffic laws the same. At the very least, the 48 contiguous states. 

One problem I noticed regarded the default speed limits in residential areas. For the most part, states have a default around 20-25 mph, but I did some research and saw that some can go much higher, such as Pennsylvania's 35 max. Another problem here is that this speed can vary within the state as well, and there isn't always a signage to indicate the speed limit. This applies to other unmarked roads with even higher limits, such as states with 55-65 mph limits on undivided roads in rural areas. From my experience, there is little to no signage in these areas. 

You're supposed to know the default speed limit when there is no signage, but if you cross state lines, that default can change. I believe it's 0art of the reason it seems people can't drive when they come from another state. I have heard countless others talk about how ""people from California, Texas, etc can't drive."" I feel the problem is the differences in our states' traffic laws. 

Another major one is traffic lights. Thankfully, all states allow a right turn on red (unless otherwise posted), but a couple major ones I noticed are the allowance of entering an intersection on yellow and turning left onto one way streets on a red light.

Now states like Washington and California allow drivers to enter the intersection on a yellow and then clear the intersection when it is safe to do so. States like Oregon, however, do not permit this and failure to stop at a yellow light can result in a traffic violation. That is one state over and the law is completely different. 

Now, regarding the one way law, here in Colorado, you are not allowed to turn left on red unless the street you are driving on and the street you are entering on are both one ways. 

Most states have this law, but there a several that allow this regardless if the street you are on first is a one way or two way as long as the street you are turning on is a one way. And of course there are those that do not permit regardless. 

And what about vehicle modifications. If you live in a state where certain vehicle modifications are legal (window tint, light color, underglow, etc) and then you drive across state lines, your vehicle can suddenly become illegal and you're subject to a ticket. Even if we can't change the laws regarding lights and speed limits, I feel it's absolutely unfair for a vehicle to become illegal just because you're traveling to a new state. 

And all of this is under the assumption that it's possible to do this at all. I'm sure this sort of thing would go against each state having individual freedoms, but I feel it could be a lot safer if each state has the same traffic laws."

Yet, a common sentiment I hear in music criticism circles is that calling songs musically ""basic"" or the complaint of ""the artists don't play instruments"" is kind of passe. It feels like people focus more on things like lyrical content, song writing, and how much the song ""slaps"" or ""creates a vibe"". While these things are important, I also don't really understand why no one really seems to care as much about how hard a part of the song is to play on a given instrument and how impressive of a feat of musicianship a song is to play.

But this not the legal definition of rape for many countries. In the US, rape requires penetration. For females forcing males to sex there is ""made to penetrate"". This leads to statistics sounding like most rapes are commited against women and that most rapes against men, are commited by men. This does not hold true though, if we use the public consciousness understanding of rape. 

I quote a user who does a better job than I could presenting the evidence.

\begin{quote}

Women rape men at a similar rate as men rape women, it just does not count for it is considered “forced to penetrate.” Data on prison rape is also not counted in rape data.

Proof? Sure.

Here is some CDC data on rape: https://archive.ph/oBtE5

And a break down of how many men are actually raped if they counter female on male rape.

To find the data specifically: Table 3.1 on page 18 for the number of female victims Table 3.5 on page 26 for the number of male victims The tables contain two sets of figures: ""Lifetime"" and ""12 month"". They are derived, as you'd expect, from questions like these: ""Has <thing> ever happened to you in your lifetime?"" ""Has <thing> happened to you at any time in the last 12 months?""

Lifetime prevalence figures are considered by statisticians to be far less accurate than previous 12-month prevalence figures. If you consider, for example, a 65-year-old being asked to think back over their entire life, one source of inaccuracy becomes obvious. Another, changing societal attitudes, is especially relevant in this case. While women do not always report their rapes, men massively underreport being victims of rape for a variety of social reasons. There is still a huge stigma attached to male rape victims, especially of women perpetrators - far more than the stigma for female rape victims, which has been alleviated by decades of public education campaigns and positive portrayals in pop culture. Some men don't even realize that men can be raped, so they don't recognize that it was rape when that happened to them. Male underreporting is now improving rapidly thanks to increased awareness of this issue, but the changes are quite recent.

As a result, the further back in time any survey looks, the greater will be the impact of male underreporting. That's why these tables show an unusually large difference between the lifetime and 12-month figures: they reflect the huge shift in attitudes to male rape victims in recent decades.

So we're going to use the previous 12-month figures for our assessment. [Note that this data published NIPSVS is from 2012. Attitudes to male rape victims have shifted substantially over those eleven years, so we can expect even the 12-month figures from this report to understate the number of male victims significantly] With that context all taken into account, what are the figures from the NISVS report for male & female rape victims?

Women: 1,473,000 victims Men: 219,000 [CDC figure for rape by a penis] + 1,715,000 [CDC figure for men forced to penetrate a woman] = 1,934,000 victims 1,934,000 / (1,473,000 + 1,934,000) = 0.5676 Thus men are 57% of the total number of rape victims. 1,715,000 / 1,934,000 = 0.8867

So the perpetrators who are making men penetrate them (i.e. women) commit 89% of the rapes of men.


\end{quote}

*There is one aspect of inaccuracy that I spot.
We are only considering rapes of women that involve penetration.
I don't think it's that big a deal though, as it's not victim olympics but just demonstrating that this isn't a gendered issue, so it's the fact that the ball parks are equal that counts.

A comment by another user to further illustrate the point:

\begin{quote}

Almost half of all rapists in the US are women.

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known/

The reason you think most men are raped by women is because of the feminist Mary Koss, who worked to change the definition of rape so that a man forced to have sex with a woman is ""made to penetrate "", and is specifically and deliberately excluded from rape statistics.

So of course if you remove all the female on male rape, the only male rape victims left are those raped by men.

“Although consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman. p. 206”

If we acknowledge that a ton of rape of men by women goes unreported and unaddressed, then it's very likely women do make up half of all rapists.

Also fun fact it is legally impossible for a woman to rape a man in the UK and in Switzerland to this day.

Illegal immigrants, by their very definition, are already criminals who have shown either negligence or contempt for the law. They’ve broken customs and norms, bypassed systems meant to enforce them and in doing so are also likely to support criminal enterprise (smuggling people and goods across the border, forged documents, businesses that hire illegal migrants as a form of slave labor.) Instead of seeking asylum through any legal channel or seeking employment or anything else they come through an illegal method.

Illegal immigration takes away from legal immigration. It creates a justified contempt which spreads to those who do respect the rule of law and go through established and enforceable customs and norms. Allowing illegal immigration is by definition allowing people to violate the law. It’s allowing people to violate policy and thus the types of people that are allowed into the country are unenforceable, unvetted and unknown.

Supporting illegal immigration allows vulnerable people to be exploited. American businesses cannot hire them legally, so they will often either end up homeless or lying or more commonly being trafficked.

Including more and more people will add to the overall supply that each person in the network will have access to, thereby compounding the process. For added security (insurance) have each person in the network find others to rely on. With that you’ll have overlapping security.

They Individually add up how much it costs to sustain themselves/their lifestyle before combining with person B who has done the same. Each would take turns spending from this surplus before passing it off the next time either one of them produces. This produces value at a greater rate than the current one because both will have more resources to draw from and thus gets thrown back into the system before starting again. So the more person A gains the more B gets and the more they earn together the more they can gain individually, continuously compounding as time goes on. With the inclusion of more people, say for instance person A found someone else to rely on, the system overall becomes more robust and less likely to fail (like in the event either become jobless).

Here’s a link to a video of thanos picking up all of the stones:

https://youtu.be/kCGH43UvXd0?si=AhNfC6dYYPGg95oi

Admittedly, my argument is somewhat weakened by the fact that we get less data because we don’t see thanos get the power or reality stone, the fact that soul stone is weird (and we saw Hawkeye hold it) and that the space stone is in a container (the tesseract) but I think my I still have enough to back it up. I believe that if the gauntlet is meant to contain the power of the stones, thanos should have experienced that burst of energy every time he picks up a stone (other than the soul stone and *maybe* the space stone, but probably not because if it wasn’t dangerous to hold it why is it in a container?) and he should have struggled to get the stone into the gauntlet, and only then would the stone(s) ‘settle down’. 

Some may argue that this would mean the snap itself would do no damage, but I disagree. I can’t seem to find any clips that say this, but I thought they talked about one needing to exert their will over the stones in infinity war/endgame. If they do, great. If they don’t, in my opinion, it makes sense for it to work that way. 

Here’s how I envision the ‘correct’ mechanics of the stones/gauntlet/snap working: 

Thanos picks up a stone, he gets that painful burst of energy we see in infinity war, and struggles to put the stone into place. Once it’s there, the energy stops because the gauntlet is now doing its job of harnessing/containing the power of the gauntlet. Some may take issue with me inserting ‘containing’ into the mix, but I have two questions for those that do: If the gauntlet doesn’t do anything to contain the stones, why would the burst of energy not go on forever? And if your answer to that is that the burst of energy stops because thanos successfully exerts his will over the stone(s), why doesn’t him picking up the stone count as the beginning of that process?

Anyway, now that the stone is in the gauntlet, thanos doesn’t require willpower or anything like energy or force etc to simply maintain the position of the stones in the glove, but use of the power of the stones does require willpower and/ or energy/force etc. and this scales directly or exponentially (doesn’t really matter) with how many stones he is using at one time. This might sound like an overly complicated way of thinking about it, it  really just means that the gauntlet contains the power of the stones, but since using the stones obviously requires their power, it channels their power into its user at will. 

The reason the burst of energy that comes from initially acquiring a stone is so much greater than that from using one in a fight is because the stones overwhelm you with energy when first picked up, and the gauntlet contains that energy when it seals them. And the reason the snap damaged thanos so severely was because it used all of the energy of all of the stones, or at least significantly more than anything else we see, and definitely uses all 6, which we don’t see him do otherwise. This also is evidenced further by the fact that thanos uses the glove, which contains all 6 stones, to try and stop stormbreaker, and his arm is just fine. So it’s not use of the gauntlet when it contains all 6 stones that hurts him, it’s use of all 6 stones to such an extreme extent.  Bonus theory: his arm doesn’t get damaged until the gauntlet overloads and itself gets damaged, at which point it stops containing all of the energy and the excess is what hurts thanos. 

Hulk’s snap uses a totally different gauntlet made from different materials, I’m not including that one in the analysis, especially because Uru (the metal thanos’s gauntlet is made out of) is some ultra metal that’s inherently resistant to magic or something… somehow. 

I don’t really know how to tie this all into a neat bow at the end but I believe I have put forward enough evidence (using only the material provided by the movies) to demonstrate that the stones should have hurt thanos upon picking them up, only to stop doing so when placed in the gauntlet."

Clearly, based on the slave girl and the end of guardians, just picking up a stone exposes you to its energy. So why doesn’t thanks even get phased by picking one up, but he gets briefly incapacitated by putting one in the glove?

It's not a stretch to say that he's lost enough support at this point that winning even half of those states will be a challenge, if not impossible. By the time the election gets here, the numbers could be a lot worse because he's hemorrhaging support both domestically and internationally right now. You can argue all you want, but you're not going to change the minds of anyone who thinks he's a genocidal maniac who should be punished for his complicity in the slaughter of thousands of innocent Palestinians. It's just not going to happen. 


I don't think anyone is justified in shaming and fear mongering people who want to vote their conscience next year. I'd go as far as to say that voting for Biden is actually handing your vote over to Trump, especially if you live in a purple or red state. If Biden can't win, it's better to jump ship now instead of making yourself look like you also support genocide. 


(I'm not here to debate genocide. Read the genocide convention. You're not going to convince people calling it a genocide that is not a genocide anymore, so there's no point debating it here. I just can't make my point without making it clear that people aren't voting for Biden because he supports genocide, and that's not going to change by next November no matter what he does.

1,2023-12-17,CMV: The way certain “progressive” communities center their in-group’s perspective but never the perspectives of others often shows itself to be toxic and wrong.,u/imbalancedMortician,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ka2r5/cmv_the_way_certain_progressive_communities/,changemyview,"For example, in some circles, someone will say something like “The fact that people still think Bigoted Things about black people in the modern day of 20XX is **retarded.**” Someone will reply saying “Hey, the word retarded is an ableist slur, 100% agree with the general post but please don’t spread that slur.” The OP will then go to the other person’s profile, see they pass as white, and counter “I didn’t ask for your white-ass opinion **retard**, take your hurt feelings somewhere else! THIS ISN’T FOR YOU AND YOUR CRYING *DOESN’T MATTER* TO ME! **I** AM THE HURT ONE HERE I DON'T HAVE TO CARE ABOUT YOU!” Then in many cases, if the person harmed by the OP’s ableism tries to keep educating them or asks for mod action against OP for being nasty, they will be banned because the sub “centers the experiences of POC over white feelings”. Or if this is happening on Xwitter, they get dogpiled to death by equally toxic accounts.

I’ve seen similar things happen in racist/Queerphobic gay circles hating on BIPOC/the BTQ+ and even in people speaking about Asian cultures getting mad at “Westerners” pointing out something inherently sexist in the practice they’re defending or whatever. I've also seen this when people make generalizations like “X racial/gender group is racist/sexist and they must all be literally made of sewage or something because idk about you but every X I ever met stabbed me in the eyes IRL.” and someone comes in saying “Hey please don’t generalize that’s an awful thing to say.” Then the OP goes “NoT aLl X- Shut the fuck up and go cut if you’re so sad idc about you actual eye-stabbers!” This attitude is never okay.

  
I get that if someone’s ancestors are plantation owners and they come in all butthurt about discussions of real history it's one thing, that’s a scenario where centering of the minority voice should be applied, but also people being bigoted as a reactionary response to their own experiences with other types of bigotry is wrong and should not be shielded! Especially if they turn around and try to use their own pain to excuse it. I know it’s not always easy to be courteous of others while in pain but that’s not a good enough excuse for me.  
  
And it’s not incorrect for anyone who sees to call them out regardless of in-groups or out-groups, in fact, it should be done and the OP getting called out should face consequences regardless of whether it’s a vent post or not. There’s no room for that in any space regardless of who is or isn’t supposed to be centered. It's not derailing and someone can call out the shit parts of a post without detracting from the accurate parts, if there are any and it's not just pure reactionary vitriol from being hurt in the past.

423,2023-12-17,CMV: Blaming Bad Policy On 'White Men' Is Wrong And Politically Stupid,u/DwaywelayTOP,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18kajht/cmv_blaming_bad_policy_on_white_men_is_wrong_and/,changemyview,"I've been mulling over a topic [after reading it here](https://www.nationalmemo.com/ken-paxton-2666596245) and I think deserves our attention: the counterproductive and politically naive trend of blaming complex societal issues solely on 'white men'. This isn't just about being politically correct; it's about understanding the deeper, nuanced factors that contribute to policy decisions and societal changes.  
  
Consider this: Blaming 'white men' as a homogenous group for the challenges in reproductive rights or other social issues oversimplifies the problem and alienates potential allies. It's essential to remember that characteristics like gender, race, and age aren't opinions or ideologies. Yet, we often see this generalization, especially in certain left-leaning circles and media. For instance, MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski repeatedly criticized Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, focusing on his race and age rather than his actions or policies.  
  
Let's take a step back and think about this. When we reduce individuals to just their physical attributes, we miss out on engaging in more meaningful, policy-focused discussions. It's easy to forget that people of all backgrounds can hold a variety of views. Texas Democrat Rep. Henry Cuellar, for example, votes against abortion rights. Would it be fair or accurate to reduce his stance to his ethnicity? Certainly not.  
  
This trend isn't just unhelpful; it's politically harmful. By alienating groups, we risk pushing them towards opposing political agendas that may not align with their interests. Remember, the Supreme Court justices who established Roe v. Wade were predominantly white men. It’s about perspectives and policies, not just physical attributes.  
  
Moreover, this kind of rhetoric can be easily weaponized by political opponents. When we engage in this oversimplification, we inadvertently provide ammunition for figures like Donald Trump to rally against us, further polarizing the political landscape.  
  
So, what should we do? It's crucial to focus on policies, actions, and ideologies rather than resorting to broad, unhelpful stereotypes. Complex issues demand complex discussions, not reductive blame games.  
  
What are your thoughts on this? Have you noticed this trend, and how do you think we can shift the conversation to be more inclusive and productive?  
  
Looking forward to your insights and discussions!

This is not about them. *I REPEAT!* This is not directed to the civilians caught in the crossfire.

&#x200B;

Since its inception, Israel has tried to maintain a peaceful relationship with its' neighbors. I am not going to open the can of worms that is Israel's right to existence, but for the sake of the argument, I am going with the my view that Israel has a right to exist. Between its' inception, Israel has fought 3 wars with its' neighbors, all of which they did not start. In each of those wars, they won, and by the late 90s/early 200s, it had given back all of the land it claimed and was trying to maintain relations with the entire Near East.

&#x200B;

In 2005, Israel agreed to the Palestinian's demands, and pulled out of the Gaza Strip. They left the tourist industry intact, they left their floral industry intact. They pulled out in a concise and peaceful manner. It was even heralded with support from the Israelis, Palestinians and many other countries. Now, yes, Israel did control the fuel and water lines, as well as the border and port control, but they did not weaponize it on the larger scale. of course there where conflicts in regards to that area, but there where always going to be smaller disputes that both sides handled terribly. But overall, it had the potential for a normalization of relations between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Now, with this great potential, what did the Palestinians do? They gave the keys to the castle to the Hamas.

&#x200B;

The Hamas then proceded to divert fuel, aid, money and weapons into their terrorist plans. They let the industries that Israel let them have flounder into nothingness. The Iron Dome was literally created to stop rocket attacks *from the HAMAS* directed into Israel. But up until then, it was an uneasy truce. Then came the October Attacks, and now the table is flipped. How is Israel ever supposed to trust Palestine now? When they themselves elected the Hamas into power? When the Hamas are using Civilians as Human Shields? When the Hamas literally invaded Israel, took hostages, and is currently torturing, raping, and killing them by the truck load? The Palestinians got into bed with the Hamas, and now they are reaping what they sowed. Israel will never trust them ever again, and the only way to gaurantee Israel's safety is by flushing them out once and for all. I don't support punishing civilians, but the Palestinians have used all empathy and mercy that is held in my heart, and I fully support Israel razing Gaza to the ground if it means eliminating the threat once and for all.

&#x200B;

Keep in mind as well: Israel has the capability to glass the entire Gaza Strip if they wanted to, and they are giving critical civilian area a warning before they bomb it. Israel is being merciful in my book, and the Hamas are exploiting this mercy by again, using them as human shields."

It is completely arbitrary to support the rights to performing one of these but not the other.

Most of the reasons that could be cited for getting an abortion could also be used for justifying an infanticide. Not being financially stable, birth defect in the child, rape, ect. could all be good reasons for infanticide. (one cause of getting an abortion that I thought of could not be applicable to infanticide, though; complications from childbirth could possibly kill or injure a mother, but a birthed infant obviously couldn't do that except by some freak accident)  
  
There are also reasons why an infanticide could be considered SUPERIOR to an abortion, from a practical standpoint. I'll list them here

* It's a less invasive procedure. The mother is not being put at risk by killing the infant.
* Whereas a mental illness could not be detected by a fetus in the womb, it can be by a live infant, which could be cited as a reason for terminating it (if you think that's immoral to kill an infant for a mental illness, then is it also wrong to kill them for some physical disability/defect that we commonly see?)
* A mother could be financially secure when she just gives birth to her baby, but fortune could change on a whim and she could be left completely bankrupt and unable to care for the child.

I'm sure there are others that people could point out. So, to reiterate, why exactly is it wrong to kill a child after it has been born but not before? To me, the line is completely arbitrary. But I would like to know other people's thoughts.

This means you stay sick for longer, and the symptoms get significantly worse than they would have if your immune system was working properly.

This information was carefully released during COVID, stage managed to pretend it was COVID-specific, but actually it applies to all common illnesses.

This information is not well known because of two major conflicts of interest. 

First, over the counter painkillers are an incredibly profitable industry, there is a huge incentive to cover up side effects from recommended usage.

Second, over the counter painkillers exist primarily to allow sick people to stay going to work by masking their symptoms. Employers squeeze more productivity out of workers. Employees avoid taking sick days until it's an emergency.

Without these medications, people would have stronger immune systems, less intense sickness, and a lot more fevers!"

Everyone with an internet connection will eventually find porn. I know when I was a kid I found an online magazine that was the most depraved German porn I've seen even up to this day. Objectively disgusting for like 99% of the population.

I think when a kid turns 13 the parents should explain masturbation and porn and give them some content that is a good example of sex in the real world that aren't depraved. Maybe even softcore or partially censored and not hardcore BDSM, or involving bodily fluids, or more objectifying to the actors than the base rated from just being in porn, etc. An example of better porn (in general, there's always exceptions) is porn aimed at women. It's usually more loving and the actors both seem to find it pleasurable without ridiculous over the top acting.

It seems weird to say parents should give porn to their kids but I think a kid finding porn themselves is literally a gamble that can cause serious damage to their psyche. I personally know someone who was traumatised by seeing snuff rape porn as an 11 year old and they couldn't talk about their issues with their parents or other adults because they thought they would be shamed and punished for it. They only got over their issues as an adult when they had their own therapist.

I know it's a contentious issue and I could be convinced otherwise but I thought of it this morning and I can't think of a good reason to be against it other than finding it an extremely awkward conversation."

Whilst I criticise his approach (he blurted it out when she came to talk to him about her rent situation), I think the premise of the agreemnt is ok (when the 20F told her friends they caused an uproar - which is definitely understandable considering female agency/autonomy has been on a decline in my country.)

However, in this case, I think this agreement is morally acceptable, and I think that giving more options to consenting and rational adults to be a good one.

I imagine a lot of commenters may criticise the ‘consenting and rational’ argument as the deal may sound extortionate, but I feel the 20F is more than capable to make her own decisions (is the indignity and suffering worth more than the impact of rent on her finances) and I feel her option to reject the proposal means, in essence, she has all the cards. 

I think this encapsulates my thoughts: I think the argument ‘well she has no choice’ to be a bad one because, if the offer wasn’t there the outcome would be the same, and if she accepted the proposal would, in jargon, reveal her preferences about the situation. Thus, she can’t really be taken advantage of this situation.

Note that I wouldn’t extrapolate here and legalise/normalise this kind of behaviour (lots of issues I could foresee with jacking up rent prices etc) but I think taking this situation on its own, ceteris paribus, to be morally acceptable. 

I’m 16 and male which I readily accept may colour my view on the issue."

In my life, I've preferred female friends over male friends. Frankly, I've found that it was easier to talk to women about certain things, more emotion driven things. I feel  like women are just more emotionally intuitive but also in terms of ""deep"" conversation make for (generally) better conversationalists. Of course there are as with everything exceptions and I am generalizing but I am also speaking from my experience. 

Not only that but men tend to be only interested in a narrow band of stuff - sports, gaming, etc - and if you're not into those things yourself it kinda ""exes out"" a good chunk of things to talk about with your fellow male. There again, are plenty of exceptions but the most numerous tend to be the ones into those interests.

I have my theories as to why I feel this is so, and I can explain them.

One, there is a social stigma (at least in the US) of men being open with their feelings. This goes back to the idea that men must be stoic, the providers, the hunter gatherers. And then there is the element of homophobia that still lingers in our society - that if a guy is in touch with his feelings he might be gay. These attitudes still persist in my experience, even if unspoken, in ethnic American groups (I'm Latino) that are conservative in nature, and also in more conservative white groups as well.

Secondly, I feel that due to the fact that women were oppressed from really having an outward existence (EG, a job, a career) for a good chunk of history until around the 19th/early 20th century, they had to adapt in some way and I feel their intelligence turned more inward - more introspectively. Because women were historically assigned to the role of caregivers, they became more nuturing and someone that is more nuturing is generally speaking, someone that is more easy to speak to. These traits in men were not taken well socially. While they were not able to do the things they wanted, they did gain the ability to become more empathethic, more introspective because when not raising children they had plenty of time otherwise to actually think.

Where men for most of history spent their lives having careers, jobs, etc many never really developed emotionally in the same way as women - simply because of a lack of time. For most of history the role of the man was provider, protector, etc. When you're out providing there isn't much time for introspective thought - and that introspection becomes stigmatized as a weakness, a sentimentality, and so it gets suppressed as well.

It was a woman who taught me about existenialism at age 14 (she was 14 also) and who encouraged me to look at the classics - Guys at that age were like ""fuck is existenialism"" and had no use for it. Some of the best conversations I ever had about politics - the most rational, most civil ones - were with my now dead ex who had a lot life experience. Guys in my experience don't tend to really be into nuanced conversation about these topics.

I've met men who were great conversationalists. Some of the greatest conversations I've ever had were with my father (who is very much in touch with his feelings and also not a typical ""guy"" - he neer liked sports, never liked any of that) and my brother in law who I would walk and talk with from 11pm to 6am sometimes. So, this isn't me hating on other men or simping for women - I don't simp for anyone and I never will. These are just my generalist views garnered from my experiences."

Firstly, expecting one group of people being collectively responsible for paying out to another group of people for things they weren’t involved in is impractical and too emotionally charged/inflammatory for it to be sound policy. 

Secondly, in my case living in a former colonial power, if it’s my tax money being paid out to ex-colonies under the guise of “reparations”, I don’t see the use in my money funding a multitude of corrupt governments. Secondly, plenty of money has gone to support the development of ex-colonies through EU membership, foreign aid and charity work. But apparently, that’s not enough? How much more money is owed?

38,2023-12-17,CMV: Copyright isn't a solution to most artists' problems with generative AI,u/dale_glass,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18khmd9/cmv_copyright_isnt_a_solution_to_most_artists/,changemyview,"AI has caused quite a lot of worry among artists. One of the most proposed solutions is copyright enforcement. I believe this will not work.

The main reason is that it seems to be an instance of an [XY problem](https://xyproblem.info/). An XY problem is when an user wants to do X, decides for some reason that the way to get there is Y, and throws all their efforts behind accomplishing Y, even though it could be a wrong/inefficient/ineffective way to do it.

In this case, ""X"" is often ""ensure the safety of my livelihood"", and ""Y"" is enforcing copyright.

Reasons why I believe copyright won't do it:


1. Many seem to ignore the fact that the public domain and permissive licenses exist. There's a vast trove of imagery out there that's completely free to use for any use case imaginable, and a lot that people have explicitly released under permissive terms. Things like [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) and [Flickr Creative Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) are vast archives that can be easily used.

2. Some are still talking about LAION 5b. [LAION 5b doesn't host any images](https://i.imgur.com/Mge130u.png), only providing URLs and descriptions. It's also in my understanding already obsolete, so there's little point in trying to fight against it.

3. Copyright is a single use weapon. AI can be done in a copyright respecting manner, so at the very best it could be a very temporary setback, after which it ceases to be a significant problem for generative AI. However...

4. In fact the problem has already been solved. [Meta AI](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/metas-new-ai-image-generator-was-trained-on-1-1-billion-instagram-and-facebook-photos/) already built a model based on images Facebook obtained permission to use. Consenting to this is effectively how users pay for their usage of Facebook. There may be a few hiccups here and there from content people didn't have permission to post, but all the same, there's a huge amount that's in the clear. Other entities have or are doing the same thing.

5. Some say ""If they're going to use my work, I should be compensated for it"". Even if legally one were owed a royalty, as per #1 and #4, the critical flaw here is that nobody needs to use any particular artist's work. There's in fact the option not to use it, and to train exclusively against the public domain and what people agreed to. So even if by law you're owed royalties, it's very much possible that what you'll earn will amount to $0.
 
6. It's in fact possible to train generative AI on AI outputs, so any holes in the dataset can be eventually fixed by generating something that's close enough, fixing it up a bit as needed, and using it as an input later.

7. Poisoning techniques won't be effective. First, because there's plenty material to use that's 100% legally in the clear or was created before the techniques, and therefore won't be poisoned. Second, because it's unlikely it won't be counteracted.

8. Laws aren't absolute world-wide. For instance it occurs to me that there's probably no consequence from using images from hostile nations. It's exceedingly unlikely that the US would cooperate with for example North Korea, so their artwork is effectively free for the taking.

9. We've got precedent with the [GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) that limitations are highly disliked by the industry and that it'll do its best to avoid them. The GPL merely asks for sharing in kind, not even for a payment. The end result is still that a huge amount of companies avoid it like the plague, highly preferring projects distributed under ""do whatever you want to"" terms. 

10. Copyright enforcement effectively favors large corporations like Facebook, Google and Microsoft. They have huge amounts of media, legal departments and terms of service where they already got permission to use people's images. This is only likely to make things worse, by further centralizing generative AI under large multinationals.

11. Extremely few large entities are artist friendly. Eg, Disney probably has an interest, but they will care far more about being able to make new movies cheaply than about favoring artists. Even the likes of Photoshop are getting into AI, probably because a huge chunk of their profit comes from corporate environments that don't really care much about freelance artists.

For the reasons above, the TL;DR is:

1. Copyright won't kill generative AI. I'm almost certain of this.
2. Copyright won't provide royalties to artists in any significant amount. I'm very confident in this.
3. Copyright may result in being thrown a bone in the form of being listed among a million names in a list of credits somewhere, 

Therefore, I believe that the only good reason to push the copyright angle is if one truly believes it's about artist's rights and nothing else. It won't get generative AI un-invented, it won't protect your livelihood if generative AI is what endangers it, and it won't get you paid a compensation."

I’m going to start by saying that idc about Chris Chan’s gender identity. I’m not going to argue about whether or not they’re actually trans, or argue about or not they deserve to be addressed by whatever pronouns. When I learned about Chris Chan it was from a person calling them her, so I’m gonna call her her. Any replies that talk about their gender identity im not commenting on because again, this has no relevance into my opinion here.

So what happened to Chris Chan was essentially a targeted multi year harassment campaign, which included stalking, breaking and entering, theft, coercion, non consensual pornography, and a few other crimes against Chris chan perpetrated by the trolls. Even though she’s objectively horrible, what happens to her is a literal crime. That’s not even discounting the fact that she’s clearly mentally unwell.

So first I think we can talk about just harassment, over the course of like 15 years Chris Chan was being harassed by trolls who took advantage of the fact that she was way to mentally deficient to be able to tell reality from fiction. This allowed them to create their own Truman Show where there were literally fake people Chris Chan spent months and years conversing with believing they were friends/dating. This is morally a shitty thing to do. And it was done for years. This is where I think it goes far enough that someone should’ve been held accountable for harsssment.

When it comes to the stalking, there were many many people who traveled to Chris chains home and took pictures of her while she was out an about. They also took pictures of her home, through windows, and even stole from her house. Like if I was doing this to a random women I would get arrested, and no one was held accountable for this even though it, like the trolling went on for years.

On multiple occasions Chris was coerced into sending nudes/sexuall videos under false pretenses and every time they did they would share them. That in of itself is a crime. Throw in the fact that Chris Chan is clearly unfit to consent,  and it just gets so much worse.

Now this isn’t a defense of Chris Chan, but I don’t think the things done to her are morally permissible just because years after they happened she raped her mom."

My 1st reason is that all of these countries have close cultural ties with each other. My Indian and Pakistani friend both speak Urdu fluently, despite one being Indian and the other being Pakistani. I, an Indian, have Bangladeshi neighbours who I feel culturally close with, despite me being Indian and them being Bangladeshi. My Pakistani teacher and my Indian classmate both speak Panjabi together, despite them not even being from the same country. My Pakistani teacher is absolutely obsessed with Bollywood, especially Shahrukh Khan, despite him being from India. My Pakistani friend shares memes with me. Although those memes are directed to a Pakistani audience, I can understand those memes as well. For a while, the Pakistani audience turned to Bollywood due to a lack of quality cinema from Pakistani cinema industries.

My 2nd reason is the melting pot this new country would be. Imagine how many cultures would be in this country! Moreover, these cultures are interlinked, and the cultures are even across borders, such as Bangal and Panjab. All of these cultures, could interlink and learn from each other, making them flourish. More so, the main difference between India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are religious differences. If various religious groups can co-exist in western countries, then why can't they do that in South-Asia? Furthermore, many Muslims are respected in India, such as Shahrukh Khan, Salman Khan, and Aamir Khan. In Pakistan, many Hindus are respected, such as Danish Kaneria, Deepak Perwani, etc. More so, this change might decrease the nationalistic feelings of citizens of the 6 countries, since they don't have any enemies to hate.

My 3rd and final reason is that this might improve geo-political relations internationally. For example, China and Pakistan are allies, and India and the United States of America are allies. If India and Pakistan unite, then this might bring a closer gap between the United States of America and China. The border between India and Pakistan is so armed that the floodlights on the border can be seen from space. Right now, China is taking over Jammu and Kashmir, but if India and Pakistan unite, then they can repel China due to them not having to fight over the territory. 

These is why I believe that India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka should unite."

Mainly for the sake of brevity. 

For the past 10 years the rhetorical focus of governments, charities and corporations alike has been on race/gender/sexuality. And poverty has taken a back seat in the conversation.

A cynic might point out that ‘fighting’ some amorphous spectre of ‘racism’ with a few D&I schemes is much cheaper for the Goldman & Sachs’ of the world than actually trying to solve wealth inequality.

The best argument for the focus on race has been to look at outcomes. Minorities tend to have disproportionately worse health care outcomes, education, incarceration etc. 

But in the U.K. at least, when you control for socioeconomics, these outcome gaps disappear almost completely. With white children even fairing worse than minorities with respect to education outcomes.

It would seem that the racial inequality we see today is largely the result of wealth inequality, rather than deliberate racism - institutional or individual.

Instead of focusing on helping the poor, we spend our time teaching wealthy kids they are ‘oppressed’ because of the identity group they belong to. Creating a atmosphere of paranoia, assuming every other person is a secret racist/bigot. 

By focusing on wealth inequality not only would we materially help the same minorities we want to support (as they are status more likely to fall into that bracket). But we would also help millions of white families who are struggling, and reduce social division."
1,2023-12-17,CMV: Atheists and Agnostics should not celebrate Christmas,u/peanutgallery44,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18kkpto/cmv_atheists_and_agnostics_should_not_celebrate/,changemyview,"**In short:** Christmas is a religious holiday celebrated by Christians, commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ. Everyone is entitled to their own religious beliefs, but those beliefs come with a different set of religious holidays.

This holiday has been, in recent years, both secularized and paganized with the introduction of Saint Nicholas (Santa Claus) as the center of the holiday instead of Jesus, and with more focus of the celebration on the spirit of winter itself instead of what it represents. Santa, from what I remember, traces back to [old pagan tales](https://explorethearchive.com/where-did-santa-claus-originate-from) and was Christianized by the bishop [Saint Nicholas of Myra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Nicholas).

More generally, it is uncommon to see Jewish people celebrating Ramadan or Christians celebrating Hanukkah. Following from this, **people who choose to not have religious views or who reject religion entirely should refrain from celebrating religious holidays such as Christmas.** Everyone has their own religious views, or lack thereof, and we don't normally celebrate the holidays of other cultures.

As for the secularization of the holidays, I believe Christmas has become extremely materialistic. As I type this, there is a giant catalog of the year's ""most popular toys"" on the table - and it is designed for kids to choose their own toys. Somewhere along the line, the holiday became more about the toys and the goodies than about celebration of our Lord. This is why **I believe de-secularization of the holiday and a return of this holiday to worship of Christ is necessary.** The holiday seems to have been taken over by these materialistic interests, to the point where Jesus is but a footnote on a day that was established for worship (""Christ mass"").

I also think that **we should not teach our children that Santa is real** - it is a deception and, while a fun tradition to keep the kids on their best behavior, distracts from the true star of the show.

### Common Retorts

**The common retort to this is to reference Saturnalia**, a celebration of the winter solstice and the darkest point of the year, representing the turning of the seasons from days getting progressively shorter to days getting progressively longer. This argument attempts to claim that Christians co-opted an existing pagan celebration, but the historians are still debating this one so it's not a definite thing. The first celebrations of Christmas have indeed been traced back to the third century, but there is still some ambiguity about specific calendar dates of certain holidays since this time period followed primarily the Julian calendar which was itself corrected back in 1582 AD with the introduction of the Gregorian calendar.

**The next most common retort to this is that the Romans celebrated Sol Invictus** on this day, which was a celebration of the Roman god of the sun. The celebration of Sol Invictus started around 100 AD, which was seemingly before the recognition of the Christmas celebrations in the third century. However, it could very well have been that Christmas was celebrated at a much smaller scale before being ""recognized"" more formally in the third century and given the specific date of December 25th.

### In Summary

- Secular people should not celebrate Christmas in its current form.
- Christmas is about venerating the birth of Christ and family, not about giving gifts and making sugary snacks.
- With respect to work, people generally should not have a company holiday when they do not have the religious views for which that holiday is celebrated.
- Christians should not teach children that Santa is real, and instead teach them about the real meaning of Christmas.
- People should celebrate the holidays as they were intended to be celebrated.

For both just getting a hookup and getting an actual relationship how you look matters more than your personality.

For sex it’s easy, women don’t want to fuck mid men. They only want to fuck hot men. They’re willing to fuck mid men if they provide something else but when there’s a hot guy nearby that they actually could sleep with why would they fuck a mid guy that has a nice personality?

People often say, “looks gets you in the door, personality helps them stay” which is the truth.

I am pro-democracy and I wish to see the Communist Party gone and for China to become a true and free democratic nation. I am strongly against separatism of any region from China (that includes Hong Kong), but I believe that Taiwan should continue to be its own country. I want China’s borders to be kept as they are.

However, the way Hong Kong is being portrayed in the West since the 2019 protests is completely exaggerated. Yes, opposition figures in Hong Kong are being arrested under the national security law and are being charged with the national security offenses. Yes, people in high schools, universities, and colleges do not know where the red line is. Many of these human rights abuses should indeed be condemned and Hong Kong government officials (as well as officials in Beijing) should indeed be sanctioned. But does that dominate the lives of Hongkongers nowadays? I don’t think so, despite the city’s government whining and complaining sometimes.

Here are seven reasons to support my argument:

1. Ever since the Chinese government ended its draconian, controversial, and brutal zero-COVID policy, tourists are coming back to Hong Kong. Yes, the city's government regularly issues statements in response to Western condemnation of human rights violations in the city, but do they affect tourism? To a substantial amount, but not a hard impact.
2. Many people in Hong Kong are enjoying the city, a stark contrast to Western narratives of fear and uncertainty dominating the city’s residents and its atmosphere. People go to their favourite singers’ concerts, go shopping around the city, travel to other places in the world, and enjoy what the city has.
3. I also believe the reports in the West about Hong Kong exclusively quote Hong Kong opposition figures, which fuels the impression in people around the world who have followed news in Hong Kong since 2019, that it is a city oppressed and with people fearful and resisting authoritarian control en masse. Some news reports also say that there is a police state in Hong Kong, and that people are surveilled 24/7, but these are actually only true for Hongkongers who have opposed the CCP for a very long time, and do not apply to the average Hong Kong resident (i.e. the general population). So these kinds of reports are exaggerated.
4. Despite fears (which I believe are exaggerated) that Cantonese is going to die soon and be replaced by Mandarin, Cantonese remains the dominant language used in Hong Kong by almost 80-90% of the population. It continues to be used officially and in day-to-day life in the city.
5. The Hongkongers who are arrested under the national security law are those who support Hong Kong independence and/or advocate for ending CCP rule in China. Merely criticizing the government, its policies is still legal, as long as people don't go too far and radical. The city's judiciary remains somewhat free (for example, an investigative journalist's conviction was recently quashed).
6. The internet in Hong Kong remains free and open, despite the city's government blocking some anti-government websites. YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, etc. are still free to access, and the majority of the people I follow on these websites are Hongkongers. They post as if life for the people of Hong Kong has never changed. They have fun and talk about what is going on in their lives right now, as well as what they will do in the future. This is like as if life for Hongkongers has barely changed.
7. ""One country, two systems"" in Hong Kong is not just about the rights and freedoms that the city enjoys. The city continues to have its own passport, currency, and legal system.

Therefore, I believe that Hong Kong continues to enjoy its rights and freedoms, despite the crackdown on opposition figures in the city."
27,2023-12-17,CMV: The Oscars should use ranked-choice voting for every category,u/miniuniverse1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18kn9w9/cmv_the_oscars_should_use_rankedchoice_voting_for/,changemyview,"Currently, only best picture uses ranked choice voting while the other categories use normal first past the post system. [If you don't know what ranked-choice is, here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8XOZJkozfI&ab_channel=CGPGrey). Making every category decided by ranked-choice would make the whole system more fair and lead to fairer results, as in the most agreed upon choice, rather than having the risk of having votes split, leading to a third, more unpopular choice winning. Also, a person who doesn't want to rank all their choice doesn't have to fill in the entire ballot, so if they choose, a voter could just choose their favorite and leave it at that.

The only other thing that I would like to address before hand is that some people think that the system is confusing, which I don't think is a fair argument, because it takes about five minutes to explain at the most, and since the voting for the Oscars is online, a system could be put in place to stop people from screwing up their ballots."
1,2023-12-17,"CMV: Privilege, absent poor behavior as a result of it, should be celebrated rather than condemned.",u/ifitisntconnor,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ko5if/cmv_privilege_absent_poor_behavior_as_a_result_of/,changemyview,"For clarification i’m defining privilege as either an advantage that has been given to someone as a result of circumstances outside their control and/or the absence of hardship resulting from circumstances outside of their control.

Maybe it’s just because i’m chronically online, but it seems like the word privilege is being used more and more as an attack on many different groups of people. White privilege, rich privilege, male privilege, female privilege, etc. I’ve even seen posts recently talking about the privilege of having a loving family and how we need to be more critical of our behavior towards children as a result of it.

I think the main issue that comes from privilege is when people are ignorant of the privileges they possess, or even when people use their privilege as a means of hurting or oppressing others who lack those advantages. My view though, is that privilege is a good thing that should be celebrated rather than shunned or ridiculed or looked down upon. The fact that people today have it easier than people before is something to be proud of, so long as we’re still cognizant of the fact that the privilege needs to be spread more and more to those who currently lack it.

Some children are born into rich loving families that support them emotionally and provide them with resources to achieve their goals in life and they’re made fun of or told to be ashamed of that, which seems to me like a bad case of crab in a bucket syndrome. I recognize I have privilege that many do not and i also recognize that others have different or more privilege than me. I don’t pity those who have less or envy/look down upon those who have more: im grateful that prosperity seems to be bestowed upon more and more people given that relatively recently in human history, most people were shitting in buckets and dying of disease at age 25. 

TL;DR- While we need to remain critical of disparity and work to provide resources to the disadvantaged, we should not look down upon people for having privilege. Rather we should be appreciative of the fact that people are getting more support and help throughout life, so long as they recognize their blessings and don’t abuse their fortunate circumstances."

The guy completely dismisses your argument and says that because he is a firm believer in Jesus Christ, the devil played tricks on his mind and that is why he became angry. My question is, how is this person different from a talking chimpanzee? Im really struggling with these ideas and my therapist mainly helps me with trauma and not social relationships since Im a very successful salesman. So far, I haven't been convinced by any arguments that can tell me the difference between a person with no awareness and an animal.

settling in a new land is not immoral. people have always moved. i think a lot of places especially in “the old world” including europe, middle east, india, china, korea and japan are wrong to restrict immigration and restricting foreigners from settling in those lands. most of these countries to varying degrees are ethnostates that are extremely difficult for foreigners to work in or buy land, especially farmland. its a little entitled to say this land and economy is for my people and pass that on to their own kids.

america has comparatively little to no restrictions on foreigners investing in, buying land and working in america. we admit more immigrants than most other countries and dont restrict foreigners from buying houses (canada does this). we expect our children to compete with other people and work for what is theirs in life. this is a good thing and the rest of the world should be more like this. 

people are condemning israel for settler colonialism. i think the criticism of israel being an ethnostate is fair, but the arab world should be more open to immigration and people settling in those lands. israel actually enables this, though only for jews (atleast partially because really bad antisemitism in the mideast).

1. The government should not have this much control over its own citizens, to decide what the citizen consumes. We pay our taxes, and we are sovereign individuals with our own will. If a person decides that they want to destroy their health with drugs, then that’s their choice. And as long as that person isn’t committing crimes, then it isn’t the government’s business. And while you could argue that the government has banned drugs to preemptively reduce crime, you cannot hold people fully accountable for their choices while simultaneously steering them into one direction. 

2. Alcohol is one of the worst drugs to exist. It’s highly toxic, destructive and sometimes lethal. Withdrawal of alcohol can be lethal for some addicts, and it is highly addictive. To ban certain drugs, even those that are less dangerous than alcohol is illogical. And the only reason for alcohol even being legal, is because of cultural norms. Similarly, the only reason other drugs are illegal is also cultural.

If someone wants to alter their brain and feel better, then weed or shrooms, which are almost completely harmless, are a much better alternative. Yet, they will in most cases land you in prison."

I saw probably 5 penalties today where zero exaggeration the defenders body weight and momentum causing him to bump into the opposing player caused a penalty. When the defender was actively trying to hold back. It ruins the game. 

When a runner has the ball, they need to be stopped and brought to the ground. There shouldn't be a rule to do this ""nicely"". It's not fair to the defenders at all. When a receiver is catching a pass, it needs to be broken up. Defenders shouldn't be asked to break this up politely. Same with quarterbacks. If you want to run, how about take responsibility to get out of bounds or get down. 

Take away leading with the helmet plays and dirty plays should certainly be called as penalties, but when a defender is trying to break up a pass, stop a runner, or literally just bumps into somebody, this should not be called. Take away basic dirty plays and let the players play and youll have a way better product. Nobody wants to watch an over legislated and over regulated game. 

When think basic dirty plays I think, leading with the helmet, and blindsiding players unnecessarily. For example, QB doesn't see linebacker coming behind him. Just wrap him up and bring him down, don't end his career. Same for defenseless receivers, and late hits out of bounds. Otherwise just let the players play."

They believe that only homicide should be included in firearm death statistics when discussing gun control. I disagree.

Firearms can be used for hunting and for sport/recreation, but much of the argument around gun control--especially the debate about the 2nd amendment in the US--centers on the use of firearms for one's defense. Defense against criminals and a potentially evil government. If guns are such a valuable object because of defense, then all instances where they do the opposite should be considered, including suicide.

[The research shows that the risk of successful suicide increases when one lives in a home with a firearm.](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/risk/) (As an aside, a person's risk of dying by way of homicide [also increases if they live in a house with a firearm](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8371731/).) The reasons for increased success rate of suicide seem obvious. Every second that passes for a person experiencing suicidal ideation is a chance that they decide against suicide, so a method that is potentially very quick to perform, such as self-inflicted gunshot, leaves fewer chances for reconsideration than a method that takes more preparation, such as hanging or jumping from a structure. This is combined with the fact that survivability for self-inflicted gunshots is lower than many other methods for suicide. The result is that, for people who experience suicidal ideation, their chance of survival decreases when a firearm is present.

In a country like the US that is experiencing a serious mental health crisis, why wouldn't we include suicides in firearm death statistics?"

I am talking specifically about being from certain minorities and/or oppressed groups allowing for an increased likelihood of admission. Essentially, affirmative action is useful for a variety of reasons:

1) To make up for unconscious bias of admissions officers. This is the phenomenon whereby _all__ human beings tend to make categorical judgments without intending to. In white cultures, it often leads to disproportionately misjudging the character and talents of black people, and this judgment is even displayed by black people living in these countries. While some people try to get around this with ""unconscious bias training,"" unfortunately these attempts have been generally uneffective so far. 

2) To make applicants' resumes more adequately represent their true talent. There are many ways racism, racial policies, and unconscious bias can affect how well someone scores on standardized testing, their grade point average, etc. Even one racist teacher can lower a person's grade point average to unfairly disadvantage them. So in fact, when this is properly accounted for, certain minorities should actually have better applications than they submitted.

3) Because diversity is important in a university setting. not only is it important so that minorities don't feel isolated on campus, but there have been multiple studies about how diversity often means a diversity of thoughts and ideas as well, and how that can increase creative problem-solving.


Potential counterargument: ""But...Harvard is unfairly judging Asian Americans."" Whether or not that is true, that doesn't mean we should  give up on affirmative action all together. It just means Harvard's algorithm and statistical analysis of privilege needs to be updated and changed."

People say that iPads shorten attention spans of children, and to some degree this might be true, but it’s no different from in the 1940s when Kid’s attention spans were shortened by radio, or how 60’s kids attention was shortened by tv, or how 80’s kids attention was shortened by video games. Attention spans shortening is just a normal part of technological evolution, and it’s not just limited to kids either. You’re probably reading this off your phone or computer, which shortens your attention too, and it doesn’t make you any worse of a person.

But she was the one who became a single mother of four kids, and the eldest disappeared for nearly 15 years but is now married and with a child.

Vegans actively proselyte, because they believe that converting everyone to their group is for the greater good, sometimes to the point of forcing it down the throats of people who don't want anything to do with it. Veganism is also often a core part of the identity of its practitioners. 

A specific example, and the event that caused me to begin forming this opinion, there was a post on the main vegan sub a while ago about a couple who's daughter ate meat behind their back and they were disowning her (apparently they'd been forcing her to watch documentaries about the evils of meat-eating weekly, which is profoundly ironic), and the responses were basically identical to what you'd see in a catholic group where parents were complaining about their child leaving; dozens of comments about how she'd 'come around', or how it was a shame they couldn't make her do the right thing. The few comments that were criticizing the choice to disown their daughter or indicating that her actions were a result of them shoving their beliefs down her throat were downvoted.

Now, the main criticism I predict against this position is that veganism has no supernatural elements. Confucianism is a historical religion with no supernatural elements, and I can think of two fictional philosophies with no supernatural beliefs that are commonly regarded as religions; the Qun from Dragon Age (which is even referred to as a religion in-universe) and the Brotherhood of Steel from Fallout.

I am posting here because I am forming this opinion, and I dislike forming opinions unless I am aware of the reasoning behind positions that counter that belief, so I'm hoping that if any exist, someone will give them to me."

This isn't even a right hand or left hand drive argument. I've driven both right and left hand cars that have indicator stalks on different sides, it's absolutely maddening. Also don't get me started on the idiocy of indicator stalks and other critical signalling on steering wheels.

1,2023-12-18,CMV: There is nothing wrong with keeping wild animals in captivity,u/SpookySnap,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18l4gtk/cmv_there_is_nothing_wrong_with_keeping_wild/,changemyview,"So here is some context:

Whenever I look at the comment section of videos of wild animals (either in zoos, aquariums, etc.), there will be people who will say something along the lines of ""poor animals, we should release them back into the wild instead of keeping them in captivity"". And I do get the sense that this is a very popular sentiment based on the amount of likes and the responses that these comments get.

&#x200B;

I have never understood why to them, ""releasing them back into the wild"" seems to be the most moral thing to do.

&#x200B;

Granted, my opinions are mainly influenced by 2 factors:

1. Being aware of the cruelty of nature: I have followed the Instagram account natureismetal for a couple of years now, and I have seen the many ways in which suffering has occurred in nature - getting eaten alive by hyenas, diseases, etc. that affect both preys and predators alike.
2. Influence in philosophical concepts like negative utilitarianism, which holds the absence of suffering in higher regard than the presence of utility.

&#x200B;

Thus, I would think that if I were an animal, I would much prefer being in captivity, with my basic needs met and I wouldn't face the suffering that I would have otherwise faced in the wild.

&#x200B;

With that in mind, here are some assumptions that I have about people who think otherwise (feel free to correct me if I am missing out/ misrepresenting anything).

1. They have a romanticized view of nature and are not aware of the extent of suffering present in nature. The idea of releasing captive animals into nature is often viewed as a liberating act, akin to breaking free from shackles, thus enabling these animals to experience a higher quality of life than their current situation.
2. Even if they are well aware of the extent of suffering in nature, they think that the concept of personal autonomy extends to animals and supersedes whatever additional suffering they are going to face. I might not be using the word ""autonomy"" correctly here but I hope you all understand it contextually (not having to be confined within a limited space etc.).

&#x200B;

Based on the ones above, I think the contention mainly lies in 2.

&#x200B;

So if I were to reduce the pros and cons of living in nature vs captivity to one sentence, it would be that:

living in nature = more autonomy, but almost more suffering

living in captivity = less autonomy, less suffering

&#x200B;

In which case, why then do people think that the idea of autonomy supersedes that of basic needs? I would think that the idea of autonomy is a human concept, and might not be easily generalizable to animals. Furthermore, it seems intuitive to think that basic needs take precedence over autonomy. In captivity, I get a decently sized habitat that mimics my natural habitat, I am well fed, and I have the assurance that I won't be torn apart alive by hyenas. 

&#x200B;

Here are some counter-arguments that I am not convinced by: 

1. Living conditions in zoos/ other enclosures might not be ideal. But in that case, the argument would be: ""we should improve the living conditions in zoos"", instead of ""we should release the animals into the wild"".
2. Suffering in nature is overblown. Of course, not every animal is going to be eaten alive by animals, but I don't think it's controversial to claim that physical suffering in nature would be noticeably higher than the suffering in enclosures.

&#x200B;

At the end of the day, based on the sentiments of the comments I see. I think many of them are advocating for it from the position of principle (we should release the animals because the animals deserve to be free), which is the part I do not understand.

21,2023-12-18,"CMV: The ""full fare"" for plane tickets (like booking code Y) and ""rack rate"" for hotels should be abolished.",u/Soyuz_1848,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18l5pwi/cmv_the_full_fare_for_plane_tickets_like_booking/,changemyview,"Reason 1: They're meaningless. Actual fares never go that high. A full-fard economy, when international, is typically 10~20 times more expensive that what we usually book. Hotel rack rates are 5~10x more expensive. Domestic flights have slightly lower full fares but still 3~5x higher than the actual rate. No reason for such a ceiling we'd never reach.

Reason 2: They create a false sense of discount. Many airline tickets at least in China where I (used to) live advertise a ""90% discount"" but they're comparing to the full fare. Everything is typically more than 70% discount. So for people who don't travel by plane often, they'll be likely to be tricked into buying an expensive ticket thinking it's a bargain. Same for hotels, unrealistically high rack rates and falsely deep discounts.

Reason 3: They create room for corruption. For corporate travellers they can just book the full fare, 20x more expensive airline ticket and upgrade to a business class for free or for very little money. The company spends a lot of unnecessary money. Or even worse they can buy a full-fare ticket and  change to a lower class, have most of the money refunded, then ask for a high reimbursement. It's technically illegal but it's often exploited in reality, at least a few years ago in China (now less common because of stricter regulations). This point is usually not very applicable for hotels because governments and companies usually regulate the actual price, not the class."
1,2023-12-18,CMV:Bollywood should stop using Urdu and English in its movies.,u/AdTrick7283,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18l5tq2/cmvbollywood_should_stop_using_urdu_and_english/,changemyview,"In my opinion, Bollywood should stop using Urdu and English in its movies.

My 1st reason is that more people from non-Hindi speaking regions of India will understand it. Most of India watches Bollywood due to a lack of quality content from regional cinema, lest they be from South-India. Most of India had loan-words from Sanskrit, including Hindi. Therefore, if Bollywood uses Hindi in its movies, then more people from non-Hindi speaking regions will be able to understand it better. Eg.Thank you in Hindi is धन्यवाद, thank you in Bangla is ধন্যবাদ, and thank you in Urdu is شکریہ, which is more closely linked to thank you in Arabic, which is شكرًا. Even so, I have many South-Indian friend who say that they can understand Hindi more than Urdu, which means that if Bollywood uses Hindi, then people from all over India can understand it more closely. Most Hindi spoken outside of India is not very closely linked with Urdu, since I, a Bangla-speaker, can understand it more than I can understand Bollywood dialogues.

Furthermore, my 2nd reason is that it will preserve Hindi. Due to Bollywood not using Hindi in its movies, people don't speak proper Hindi in Hindi-speaking regions. Rather, they speak a mix of English and Urdu. If Hindi is used in Bollywood mvies, then Hindi will not be a dying language, and can flourish in Hindi-speaking regions. English will not be looked upon as a superior language, due to people being proud of their own language. Even English sounds dull compared to Urdu, but Hollywood makes good rom-coms as well.

My 3rd and final reason is that Bollywood is known as the Hindi-language cinema industry. Therefore, it should use Hindi. Meanwhile, Lollywood is the Urdu-language cinema industry, and if Pakistanis want to watch Bollywood, then they should watch it in subtitles, similar to how non-Hindi speaking regions of India watch it with subtitles right now. It should appeal to people of its own country, not people of another country. Even so, this will save the regional cinema industries of Pakistan due to a wider audience watching it. Some people even use it to learn Hindi, and if Bollywood does not use Hindi, then the people using it to learn Hindi would not learn it properly, which is not good if they want to travel outside India, where sanskritised-Hindi is used a lot."

I'm also not arguing about what happens to Arab Israelis in Israel-proper or Gaza, just West Bank, especially Area C.

West Bank is legally Occupied Palestinian Territories, which means Israel has the responsibility to govern the citizens in the West Bank. In the current framework of governance, it is operating an apartheid state, which I define as a state that explicitly enforces racial segregation, and the domination and oppression of one racial group by another. The racial groups in question here are Jews and non-Jews in the West Bank. In the West Bank, nearly all Jews are Israelis and all non-Jews are Palestinians, so if the state enforces segregation, domination and oppression of Palestinians by Israelis, it is an apartheid state.

1. Palestinians and Israelis in the WB are subjected to different laws. Israelis arrested are charged under the civil court, while Palestinians arrested are charged under military court. The same crime committed by two different individuals almost always leads to vastly different outcomes, where the Palestinian outcome is significantly worse than the Israeli outcome, to the point where it constitutes ""domination"" and ""oppression"".

2. Palestinians moving within the West Bank are subjected to checkpoints that Israelis are not. They can be random, permanent, or temporary. They cause severe delays and restrictions to Palestinian movement relative to Israeli movement. This constitutes ""segregation"" and ""oppression"".

3. It's much harder, sometimes impossible, for Palestinians to obtain permits to build houses legally, so they have to build houses illegally, which are then subjected to bulldozing because they are illegal. Israelis don't face the same restrictions and often their constructions are sponsored by the state too. Also, as a result of this, Palestinians are forced to live in enclaves. This constitutes ""segregation"", ""domination"" and ""oppression"".

Any state implementing any one of these 3 will be accused of operating an apartheid regime. To CMV, you'll need to show what I stated above is blatantly incorrect, or why implementing any one of these does not fit the description of an apartheid state."

What they usually dont mention is that this is often achieved through by threats of violence. It is a crime to leave the religion in the vast majority of Muslim-majority countries. In 10 nations, it is a capital offense, while in others you can go to jail, and in others you lose child custody and cannot get married, and someone who tries to convert Muslims is punished in all countries. The majority of Islamic scholars agree the death penalty is prescribed for apostates. Though executions are rare, that just proves the point; it is to chill dissent.

This is leaving aside the face that persecution of religious minorities has expanded in recent decades. If I was a Zoroastrian, Christian, Hindu or especially a Jew or atheist, I would say I was a Muslim on a census if I lived in any of these countries."

We see the same thing happen with testimonies from North Korean defectors: people lie for attention and fame. Testimonies end up contradicting each other. Therefore, testimonies from ""survivors"" are IMHO not conducive to discourse on the subject.

Of course, the concentration camps suggest that some people died, but it probably wasn't a number as large as 11 million (at a time when Europe had only 550 million people).

Overall, I think it's just way too much of an exaggeration to make the Germans seem like the bad guys (when so many other countries have also carried out genocides, yet most people don't bother to learn about them)."

ChatGPT has never really impressed me, as it has failed on every logical question whose pattern it hasn't already seen.

Enough of the rant against LLMs, a counter example against the progress of AI is the progress of self-driving cars. We have been working on self driving cars for more than a decade and they aren't anywhere close to human level despite having far more sensors and being trained on far more data. Humans can learn to drive in every situation in less than a day. Waymo on the other hand needs an extremely accurate map of a city to operate there. It also has Lidar and a bunch of other sensors. Humans can use common sense, and they just have two cameras.

What makes people think AI will be able to come up with something as complex as the Theory of Relativity by itself if it can't even drive a car."
1,2023-12-18,CMV: Nobody goes to hell if we look at it logically(if it is even possible),u/Hegesias_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ldobq/cmv_nobody_goes_to_hell_if_we_look_at_it/,changemyview,"Firstly I define the definition of soul if soul is something that never changes (as is commonly believed). Soul is an entity that experiences everything that happens in the life of a body. The body can change: it can get Alzheimer’s, forget everything, it can develop other diseases of the brain, psyche, the body can get a tumor that makes it as aggressive as possible, and so on. The soul is something that can never leave the body while it’s alive. The soul is something that never changes, therefore it is something that experiences the process of birth, growing up, aging and, what is very important, the process of changing in the ORGANISM, regardless of how this change occurs.


It is obvious that everything we do is strongly connected to our brain. As an example, we can refer to a study where with transcranial magnetic stimulation you can change a person’s opinion that God exists. A huge number of things influence whether we believe in a certain thing or not, whether we take some action or not, and so on. There is currently no evidence that a person is capable of doing anything that cannot be explained by the banal functioning of the brain and the environment. The functioning of the brain changes, the environment changes. A person doesn’t believe in God (a mortal sin) because of a certain brain function at “the given moment”. “The given moment” is a single period of time. Life is made up of a collection of “the given moments,” therefore, if hell as a place existed, it would be more rational to say that it is a person at a “given moment” who goes to hell. A person who repents also does this at “the given moment,” therefore the person at “the given moment” is redeemed and “approaches to God.”


Obviously, there is no material evidence of a soul or God. In general, it is completely impossible to prove such an entity as God, because in order to know something for sure (in the absolute) you need to be something that is capable of knowing everything(could infer some contradiction but let’s forget about it for this discussion). But in this context we assume that God and the soul exist. God, like the soul, isn’t a material entity, the body and brain are material. Can a non-material entity be something for which an immaterial entity is judged or rewarded? From the above, I conclude that nope, it cannot, which means that an immaterial entity always has some kind of characteristic regarding good/evil. (Now I will talk about Christianity, because the concept of Christianity seems to me the most suitable to what I think). In Christianity there is a trinity: father (God), son (human), holy spirit (reference to the soul as I view it). Every person has a soul, regardless of what a person does, what changes happen to a person, their soul is unchangeable. The soul is ideal, the ideal is an absolute state, it’s in no way dependent on time, obviously.


Interpretations that a person goes to hell for their sins: this interpretation is aimed at the body. I don’t know why it was made if Christianity is true. It is quite common in Christian doctrine to say that “the ways of the Lord are mysterious,” so I think I’ll make do with that. The soul, as something absolute, shouldn’t end up in a place where it will be “punished” for actions at “the given moment”; that would be simply strange.


David Hume used this body change argument as a way to show that people don’t really believe in God (I don’t wanna write a lot about it but this is the idea behind it), but I present a conclusion that is certainly amateurish from the point of view of many people based on this “change”.


It is also quite important to note that Im relatively far from believing in God. As a teenager I was an atheist, at a certain point in time I leaned towards agnosticism. I don’t know if anyone previously expressed what I expressed (or rather, I’m sure that there were such people - I just don’t know the names (probably yet)), but this interpretation of God and the soul seems to me the most logical. With such an interpretation, even some contradictions disappear, for God can be all-forgiving, omnibenevolent, etc. in relation to the soul. Of course, I’m ready to hear various contradictions from the Holy Scriptures regarding what I wrote, it would also be interesting to see not ordinary criticism but additions to what is written. I would also like to note that in this conversation it wouldn’t be appropriate to prove the absence of God or to prove that before talking about God we need to prove his existence (and we don’t have any evidence so far). I am well aware of this, but in this argument one of the premises is that God exists.


Also regarding the huge number of people who interpreted/interpret the Holy Scriptures in such a way that a person can go to hell: regarding those who interpreted this: a banal lack of sufficient knowledge about the brain. Those who interpret it now: in general, it’s similar AND the fear of leaving mainstream dogmas.

It is a freaking pain in the ass to deal with promiscusous people when its about building a relationship, but that's not the point.

Whenever someone voices their concerns regarding that, reddit generally says in the top comment that: ""You can break up with anxone for any reason as long as you dont shame or judge them"" (perfectly reasonably consensus) but then proceeds to shame and judge (mostly men) for having the preference of not dating a promiscuous person in comments number 2 and 3. ""You have some growing up to do"", incel labeling, etc. 

While women are always encouraged to stick to their preferences, men are questioned and - especially when the question of promiscuity comes up - invalidated and judged upon.

I have been lied to and played by promiscuous people more than I can count, I associate more meaning to physical intimacy than ""just sex"". If for her it's just sex there a difference in values. Moreover there is a difference of mindset in terms of making overly emotional and impulsive decisions just to have fun and a story to tell comlared to choosing a lartner based on compatibility and values.

And the aftermath is that 9/10 it will be a pain in the ass when entering to a relationship with a previously promiscuous person because they are either emotionally scarred or have 0 experience in building a relationship.

At the end of the day my reasoning doesnt even matter, it is the fact that I have this preference and no one has the right to judge me for it while they constantly emphasize the tolerance for each others preferences.

But as usual, if you have any valid reason to uphold this double standard on having promiscuity as a dealbreaker I am open to hear you out."

So, basically I was talking to a friend of mine the other day and she told me how it ""crossed her boundaries"" when people asked her about her boyfriend, after she posted a picture of them online.

Like, you post something on social media for people to see it. You have no excuse to say people are in the wrong for asking?!

I mean, I do find it weird that some people she hasn't talk to for years asked her about that just for gossip, but since she decided to post about it she should at least expect that. If you want a private relationship then don't post about it and don't announce it to people. 

Same goes for many people who bring stuff up on their own and when you ask them to elaborate they say ""I don't feel comfortable answering that"" or ""that's crossing my boundaries"". Like, then why did you have to bring that up?? It's plain rude to say that. If you don't want to answer a question do it in a more polite way, just say something irrelevant, change the subject or make a joke about how you don't wanna answer. I'm sure the other person/ people will get the message.

Last but not least, similarly to having boundaries people saying that it's okay to ""take a break from people and it shows you have boundaries"" sounds so selfish to me and it pisses me off. Yeah, take a break from people but don't fucking expect them to accept you back or to just appear once again and everyone acting like nothing happened. Actually that whole concept of saying ""it's okay"" or ""it's fine"" to everything irritates the hell out of me. Nobody owes you nothing the same way you don't owe anything to anybody. It's not okay to be selfish and rude for the shake of ""choosing yourself"". Choose yourself in a polite way."

How is it fair that the woman gets to opt out of parenthood at will, but the man has no say. How can you blame fathers who suddenly turn into the milkman if they didn't want the baby in the first place?

I think we should still give the woman the deciding vote on whether to keep the baby but there should be a legal option for all men to opt out of fatherhood before the birth."

>\[Israel is\] starting to lose that support by the indiscriminate bombing that takes place.

>It was pointed out to me — I’m being very blunt with you all — it was pointed out to me that — by Bibi — that ‘Well, you carpet-bombed Germany.  You dropped the atom bomb.  A lot of civilians died.’  
>  
>I said, ‘Yeah, that’s why all these institutions were set up after World War Two to see to it that it didn’t happen again — it didn’t happen again.’”

In other words, Biden acknowledged that Israel is committing war crimes. In the same remarks, Biden said:

>we’re not going to do a damn thing other than protect Israel in the process.  Not a single thing.

He stated that this commitment is because:

>The goal is Israel’s security.  \[…\] many of you heard me say over the years: were there not an Israel, we’d have to invent one — we’d have to invent one. I believe, without Israel as a freestanding state, not a Jew in the world is safe.

[https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/12/12/remarks-by-president-biden-at-a-campaign-reception-5/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/12/12/remarks-by-president-biden-at-a-campaign-reception-5/)

Based on these remarks, here is my paraphrase of Biden’s views on the current Israel-Gaza war: maintaining an ethnocratic state where Jews are in control of the levers of power and use that power to benefit Jews (“Jewish state” from here on) is essential to ensuring the security of Jews worldwide. The security of Jews worldwide is extremely valuable, so war crimes against non-Jewish civilians are a tolerable cost if the alternative is imperiling the Jewish state. I think this view is likely a fairly common view among Israelis and Zionists worldwide.

My view is that:

1. Biden is right. a Jewish State that has gotten past its growing pains (i.e. Israel after a hypothetical resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict) is likely the best way ensure the physical security of Jews worldwide.
2. However, Establishing and maintaining a Jewish State requires significant moral and cultural compromises.
3. The drawbacks are big enough that a person who does not ascribe greater value to the lives, rights, and security of Jews than they do to the lives, rights, and security of others should not support the maintenance of Israel’s Jewish character.

Most of the arguments that I’m making here can be applied to the establishment and maintenance of any state that is organized around a specific ethnic, racial, religious, etc… group (I’m just going to simplify this to “ethnic group” from here on) on territory that is not already occupied exclusively by that group.

1. **A Jewish state will ensure the security of Jews**

I think that, generally speaking, the lesson that Zionists have taken from Jewish history is correct: populations that stand apart in some way from the rest of the society that they live in and that do not control significant political power (and therefore military power) are vulnerable to, and will likely experience, persecution. This experience is not unique to Jews and is incredibly widespread. In fact, wikipedia lists 31 events that have been called genocides in significant scholarship in the last century alone ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_genocides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_genocides)). Less egregious forms of discrimination and persecution are even more common.

If an ethnic group is in control of political and military power in the state (lets call it state X) that they live in, it’s highly unlikely that the government of that state will persecute that ethnic group. It is still possible for a foreign state to attack, but it will be possible for state X to use military force to resist that. If, as in Israel, the ethnic group that controls state X allows any member of their group worldwide to move there, then the existence of state X also protects from discrimination against that ethnic group in other nations because X can serve as a refuge. I think this is basically the rationale behind the creation of Israel (if you ignore the religious dimension that determined where Israel was established), and it seems sound to me.

2. **Establishing and maintaining a Jewish State requires significant moral and cultural compromises**

I don’t think it’s possible to **create** a state for a particular ethnic group without harming other ethnic groups unless the territory that is to become the new state is already almost exclusively occupied by the ethnic group in question. An example of that would be South Korea. The Korean Peninsula is incredibly ethnically homogenous, so South Korean politics is by default controlled by the Korean ethnic group (oligarchy issues aside) without the need to oppress or discriminate against any competing ethnic groups. When there are multiple ethnic groups in the territory that is to become the new state, for one group to take control of political and military power the other ethnic groups must be disenfranchised. I think there are multiple overlapping ways for the non-dominant ethnic groups to be disenfranchised (treat the descriptions that I give here as the definitions of the terms in this discussion. I’m not interested in arguing semantics.):

A.	Majority rule. If the ethnic group with power is already the overwhelming majority ethnic group. I think that this is probably the least problematic way other ethnic groups can be functionally disenfranchised. If an ethnic group is the overwhelming majority in the state, then they should have more political power than the minority ethnic group. However, to avoid setting the stage for ethnic conflict it is necessary to have institutions that ensure that minority ethnic groups do have a meaningful political voice and that their rights are respected (e.g. a constitution that limits the extent to which the majority can control the lives of the minority). I think that in a state that is explicitly formed to serve the interests of the dominant ethnic group it is unlikely that there will be robust institutional protections (when considering both the letter of the law and the enforcement of the law) for minority ethnic groups.

B.	Ethnic cleansing. This is one of the standard ways of generating an ethnically homogenous state ([https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-11-24/ty-article-magazine/.highlight/why-this-top-expert-on-ethnic-conflicts-has-hope-for-israelis-and-palestinians/0000018c-0191-dca2-a9fd-659bf8590000?lts=1702442228142](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-11-24/ty-article-magazine/.highlight/why-this-top-expert-on-ethnic-conflicts-has-hope-for-israelis-and-palestinians/0000018c-0191-dca2-a9fd-659bf8590000?lts=1702442228142)). To generate conditions on the ground that will allow A, the dominant ethnic group can forcibly remove members of other ethnic groups from the territory that they plan to turn into their state.

C.	Oppression. Allowing non-dominant ethnic groups to remain on the territory of the state, but actively suppressing their political voice so that they cannot influence the governance of the state. South African Apartheid, where non-whites were not allowed to vote, is a good example of this.

D.	Genocide. Destroying non-dominant ethnic groups. There are multiple ways to accomplish this. The most obvious is to kill members of those ethnic groups (e.g. the Holocaust and the concurrent genocides of other groups). Other ways are sterilizing members of those ethnic groups or forcibly assimilating them into the dominant ethnic group (e.g. Uyghur genocide, Native American/Australian reeducation schools). Genocide does not have to be complete. Even destroying a small fraction of the members of the non-dominant ethnic group can, particularly in combination with B and C, help secure political power for the dominant ethnic group. Genocide can also facilitate B and C by causing the non-dominant ethnic group to flee out of fear of victimization or by destroying the non-dominant ethnic group’s will/ability to resist oppression.

Since Zionists began their mission to create Israel, Jews have never been the overwhelming majority ethnic group in the territory of historical Palestine (1800s: <10% Jewish; 1947: 32% Jewish; 2019: 52.1% Jewish; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic\_history\_of\_Palestine\_(region)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Palestine_(region))). As a result, majority rule has never been a viable option to secure a Jewish State. That has meant that Zionists have had to use ethnic cleansing, oppression, and genocide (options B-D) to create and maintain Israel as a Jewish state. Even with Israel solidly established as a Jewish state, it will be necessary for Israel to continue to use B-D for the foreseeable future to maintain the Jewish character of the state. The ways for Israel to escape the need to do B-D in the long-term are either horrific or highly unlikely:

* Massively increase the fraction of the population that is Jewish through very high fertility rates or Jewish immigration. Depending on how this is achieved, it could involve policies that I view as immoral. For example, discriminatory immigration policies (such as those already in place) that favor Jewish immigration over immigration of other ethnic groups even if the Jewish immigrants have no recent ties to the territory of Israel while the members of the other ethnic groups do. I regard these policies as similar (and in some ways more extreme) to historically racist immigration policies in the US ([https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/artifact/h-r-40-naturalization-bill-march-4-179](https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/artifact/h-r-40-naturalization-bill-march-4-179); [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/opinion/race-immigration-racism.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/opinion/race-immigration-racism.html); [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\_citizenship\_law#:\~:text=Individuals%20born%20within%20the%20country,proficiency%20in%20the%20Hebrew%20language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_citizenship_law#:~:text=Individuals%20born%20within%20the%20country,proficiency%20in%20the%20Hebrew%20language)). These immigration policies also just haven’t been enough to increase the Jewish fraction of the population.
* Complete or near-complete ethnic cleansing of the territory of Israel. If Israel manages to reduce the population of non-Jews in its territory to a very small fraction of its population, it will likely become unnecessary to engage in any further ethnic cleansing, oppression, or genocide to maintain the political supremacy of Jews.
* Complete or near-complete genocide of non-Jews on Israeli territory for the same reasons.
* Partition. If Israel manages to negotiate a two-state solution that allows Palestinians to have a state where a Palestinian government has supreme authority over their own state, Israel proper’s non-Jewish population is small enough that it is likely possible for them to avoid using B-D. Given the bad blood built up over the past century and the offers in previous peace negotiations, it is hard to imagine that this is achievable due to Israeli fears for their own security if they don’t maintain some level of control over a hypothetical Palestinian state. In my view, a Palestinian state that remains subject to Israeli control over some aspects of the state’s operation is just a less severe version of disenfranchisement and oppression of Palestinians.

Assuming that Israel reaches the point where they have a Jewish state that is no longer engaged in B-D, it likely is not possible to **maintain** a Jewish state without discriminatory policies that I (and many other people, I think) would be staunchly opposed to in my own country.

* To ensure the long-term Jewish character of the state, it will likely be necessary to institute policies that enshrine that character in Israeli institutions (e.g. the Israeli Nation-State Bill; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic\_Law:\_Israel\_as\_the\_Nation-State\_of\_the\_Jewish\_People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law:_Israel_as_the_Nation-State_of_the_Jewish_People)). Even in cases where these laws do not result directly in discriminatory action (as is the case for the Nation-State Bill), they will symbolically position non-Jews as secondary to Jews in Israel.
* If Israel becomes a desirable place to live for non-Jews, discriminatory immigration policies will be necessary to ensure continued Jewish supremacy in Israel. Long-term change in the demographics of the state similar to what we're seeing in the US would be completely unacceptable in a Jewish state.
* If the Non-Jewish share of the population grows due to differences in fertility, it will be necessary to reinstitute B-D to ensure continued Jewish supremacy in Israel. The need to maintain Jewish supremacy sets the stage for the development of an Israeli version of white genocide/white replacement theory ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White\_genocide\_conspiracy\_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_genocide_conspiracy_theory)). Unlike the modern US, because Israel is supposed to be Jewish, it is likely that acting on those views will be more socially and politically acceptable (and it’s already a problem in the US).
* For Israel to be a refuge for persecuted Jews worldwide that retains its Jewish identity, Israel will need to maintain some combination of discriminatory immigration and asylum policies. What happens if there’s another event like WW2 and both Jewish and non-Jewish refugees seek asylum in Israel? Does Israel allow Jewish refugees to enter, but deny entry to black, Asian, Arab, etc... refugees? What if there is a flood of refugees that does not include Jews? Does Israel determine the number of refugees it will accept based on how it will affect the political power of Jews in the country? In other words, does Israel allow unlimited Jewish refugees when Jews are affected by the crisis, but severely limit the number of non-Jewish refugees when Jews aren't affected because they will change the balance of political power in Israel? These are questions that other countries (particularly in Europe) have recently struggled with, but if Israel is to maintain its Jewish character, discrimination must be built into the system.

Another important thing to consider is what ethnic nationalism and doing/experiencing all of the above does to the political culture of the resulting state. When considering this, it’s worth keeping in mind that an overwhelming majority of American Jews (the majority of the Jewish diaspora) support the democratic party ([https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/05/11/u-s-jews-political-views/](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/05/11/u-s-jews-political-views/)), so they likely tend to prefer a state with left-leaning social values.

My understanding of Israel is that its most important governing principle is keeping the Jewish people safe from antisemitism. Regardless of how well-founded Jewish fear of antisemitism is, this governing principle is a fundamentally xenophobic one that relies on suspicion of the outsider to provide Israel with its *raison d’être*. It seems to me that building a state whose very essence is based in opposition to the “other” is buying a one-way ticket to right-wing extremism (on social issues). This is particularly true when the circumstances of the state’s creation have resulted in an ongoing ethnic conflict that continuously strengthens pre-existing xenophobic tendencies. The trajectory of Israeli politics is in line with that. For 32 of the last 46 years (since 1977), the Israeli prime minister has been a member of a right-wing party ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_prime\_ministers\_of\_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_ministers_of_Israel)), and the current government of Israel has been called its most right-wing ever.

Given the policies required to maintain Israel as a Jewish state, I have a hard time imagining that a version of Israel that embraces liberal social values will be able to retain its commitment to being a state characterized by Jewish political dominance. If Israel retains its commitment to Jewish political dominance, I have a hard time imagining that it will be the kind of place that liberal Jews will want to live.

3. **The cost of a Jewish state is too high**

Here’s a summary of the benefits and drawbacks of Israel as a Jewish state:

*Benefits*

* In times with minimal persecution of Jews (e.g. the modern era), an increased sense of security for all Jews from hypothetical future persecution.
* If Jews experience severe persecution in the future, a state that will accept Jewish refugees and that has the military means to defend them.
* At a hypothetical time in the future (when the current conflict has resolved), the existence of a place where Jews can be confident that they will not face persecution or violence from non-Jews.

As an aside, some people will probably argue that Israel has already served as a refuge for hundreds of thousands of Mizrahi Jews expelled from countries across the Middle East and North Africa, which should count as a tangible benefit. This point is complicated by the fact that they probably wouldn’t have been expelled if Israel hadn’t been created, which makes that argument somewhat circular: “We need to create Israel to protect Jews” --> Arab countries expel Jews in retaliation for the creation of Israel --> “We were right to create Israel to protect Arab Jews.” Because of that circularity, I haven’t included it as a benefit.

*Drawbacks*

* Some combination of ethnic cleansing, oppression, and genocide of the Palestinians has been and will be necessary to establish and maintain the Jewish character of the state for the forseeable future. This has involved and will continue to involve massive suffering for the Palestinian people.
* After the initial period of ethnic cleansing, oppression, and genocide has ended, it may be necessary to resume those policies in the future depending on demographic trends.
* Current insecurity for Jews and Israeli Palestinians in the Jewish state due to violent conflict with Palestinians and neighboring states.
* Current insecurity for Jews worldwide as people inappropriately hold all Jews responsible for Israeli actions.
* The final form of the Jewish state will be institutionally racist by necessity.

To determine whether to support Israel as a Jewish state, we need to weigh these benefits and drawbacks. For me, this seems relatively straightforward:

The benefits of having a Jewish state are largely hypothetical right now. The only large scale violence towards Jews right now is taking place in Israel and the Occupied territories because Israel hasn’t gotten past its violent start-up phase. In the rest of the world, Jews are generally safer than they currently are in Israel. For them, Israel is basically an insurance policy.

On the other hand, the drawbacks of Israel as a Jewish state are largely being felt right now:

* The initial ethnic cleansing of historic Palestine has resulted in a refugee crisis that has yet to resolve after 75 years because a return of the refugees would eliminate Israel’s Jewish majority.
* Ongoing oppression and ethnic cleansing of mostly peaceful Palestinians in the West Bank because incorporating them into the state of Israel would substantially reduce Israel’s Jewish majority.
* Israel’s conflict with Hamas has resulted in unbelievable levels of human suffering in Gaza.
* The ethnic nationalism and xenophobia that are at the core of Israel’s Jewish identity are making Israel increasingly illiberal and are weakening democratic institutions in Israel proper.

On one side of the scale, we have hypothetical benefits to Jewish people that materialize only if their current host countries turn against them. On the other side of the scale, we have actual human suffering that is happening right now to Palestinians. I like to use an insurance analogy to think about this problem: let’s say that Person A has the option of claiming a health insurance policy that requires them to feed Person B a life-altering or lethal dose of cyanide now. In my opinion, it doesn’t matter how prone Person A is to health issues – that’s an unacceptable trade-off because the severe consequences to Person B are guaranteed, whereas the benefits to Person A are only possible. It seems to me that there are only a couple of ways to conclude that it’s better to claim the insurance policy: (1) if you place greater value on the health of Person A than on the health of person B or (2) If you think the expected harm to Person A from whatever health issue they develop is going to be much worse than the harm to Person B from cyanide. For (2) The Person A’s potential health issues would have to be both very severe (i.e. worse than cyanide) and very likely. In those two cases, the expected benefit to Person A might be of greater value than a guaranteed detriment to person B.

This is how I think about the value of Israel as a Jewish state. I think that Holocaust 2.0 in the US is extremely unlikely, and short of holocaust 2.0 it’s hard for me to imagine something worse than what’s happening to Palestinians now. I also view Jewish and Palestinian lives as equal in value. As a result, I view the current suffering of Palestinians as an intolerable cost to secure the safety of Jews in the future, especially if you end up with an illiberal state that’s fundamentally xenophobic and discriminatory in the end anyway. To conclude otherwise, you must either view Jewish well-being as more valuable than Palestinian well-being, which is racist, or you must think that the American Holocaust is imminent, which doesn't seem plausible to me.

I’m not interested in arguing semantics: I don’t care if what’s happening should be called “genocide” or “ethnic cleansing.” These were the easiest words for me to use to describe what I’m talking about."

This was during what many would describe to be a better economic environment. They had a real fear of scarcity and not being prepared for something unpredictable. Today it seems like so many people have nice stuff but $0 in cash. 

People in the US since WW2 have largely been unscathed by the worlds conflict and although there were some economic downturns, the US remained comparatively stable to most of the rest of the world. I think that's one of the main points here, that most of the world is in a worse economic position, has access to less cheap goods, and has less of an ability to make something of themselves. I feel like this is lost on many American's today. It seems that many believe that the US is actually poor and the rest of the world is killing it which couldn't be farther from the truth.

To me, the boomer avocado toast advice stands for being frugal and making financial sacrifices. Many people won't even consider a financial sacrifice like buying a $25,000 SUV instead of a $50,000, even if that means living paycheck to paycheck. American's have a total of 1.08 Trillion in CC debt. How much of that do you think was spent on necessities? Probably not as much as you would think. And yes, obviously there are still frugal people left who save stuff and repurpose it and don't care at all about appearances. In my experience though I listen to people living above their means, making regular wasteful purchases, bitching non stop about how shitty the US is because they're not driving a Porsche. "
1,2023-12-18,CMV: Sex dolls are not creepy,u/Mindl3ss0n3,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18lh2py/cmv_sex_dolls_are_not_creepy/,changemyview,"Sex dolls get a lot of hate with no real explanation from a lot of people, usually just saying “creepy” with no further rationalization. 

I argue that they are not creepy and actually a net positive for the following reasons. 

1. It is a masturbatory aid just like a vibrator and a good romance novel are for women. (Note: I wont be responding to any comments about how it’s not equivalent, a sex toy is a sex toy is a sex toy) 

2. Can help to stop porn addiction. Someone not watching porn is no longer contributing to the objectification and violence that affects women due to its consumption. 

3. Can help reduce or help alleviate erectile dysfunction in men. Particularly death grip from excessive masturbation, premature ejaculation, and endurance issues. 

4. Can help prevent a man from seeking out a sex worker, which may expose him to legal trouble, disease, and if often enough, money problems. Edit: Also prevents exploitation of sex workers. 

5. For the right couple can enhance sexual encounters just like any other sex toy.

Edit: sex dolls that in appearance look like adults, not minors. 

Edit: Pediophobia is not discriminate in this regard. "

The Institute for the Study of War notes, for instance, that [the situation is not static; it is very fluid and could go either way.](https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/if-west-cuts-aid-ukraine-russia-will-win-if-west-leans-ukraine-can-win) The ISW article notes that Ukraine could most certainly lose if Western aid dries up and Russia continues pressing in relentlessly. I could cite numerous other articles, but that ISW article alone makes the case convincingly enough.

The European Union may be taking measures to cut off Orban/Hungary's veto or circumvent him in order to get $50 billion of European aid to Ukraine, which is a separate matter but would be a good thing if it's done. But as far as the United States is concerned (since most people in this sub are American,) there is $61 billion in aid that is being held up for Ukraine right now because of Republican demands for reform on asylum, migrants, the Mexican border, etc.

As much as Democrats loathe the idea of caving in to the R's on this, the brutal truth is that **time is on the Republicans' side, not the Democrats' or Ukraine's**. The Mexican border and migrants coming in is a relatively *non*\-urgent situation - not much will happen if it persists. The Ukraine situation is *very* dire and urgent - *lots* of bad things can happen if unaddressed. **In other words, the Rs can afford to wait; the Ds cannot.**

As of now, there is no indication the Rs are going to drop the border/asylum/migrant-reform demands, and the Ds already missed a golden chance to get the bill done and sent to Biden's desk before Congress shut down for the winter recess (the Senate is still staying in to get work done but the House went home.) 

If the Ds continuously refuse to give way on the border/asylum bill, then Ukraine will likely start to see heavy losses and be forced to ration increasingly scarce ammo and artillery as Russia gains more and more ""freedom of maneuver"" and starts to outflank and outrange Ukrainian forces. This could then lead to Russia rolling Ukraine as far deep as it did in early 2022 or even worse. "

While it is true that executive functioning (self-regulation) is a quantitative trait in the population, that does not provide for everyone having ""a little ADHD"". Some people fall towards the extreme left of the curve and present with serious impairment, some are gifted in their ability to self-regulate, but most are in-between. The symptoms become a ""disorder"" when there are too many and they cause impairment in one's life. So, the disorder of ADHD is like high blood pressure. Everyone has a blood pressure reading but when blood pressure is too high, it is the disease we call hypertension. That does not mean “everyone has a little hypertension”, as most do not qualify for the disease. Having a ‘little ADHD’ or ‘little hypertension’ would likely indicate a milder severity of the disorder/disease which most do not possess.

I think it does a disservice to those with ADHD where it includes disorder. It only qualifies for disorder when the symptoms are a) abnormal in quantity relative to the population, b) are causing serious impairment in one's life and c) are persistent and pervasive. Some people exhibit mild ADHD, which I guess you can call a 'little ADHD', but even they still meet that criteria. However, most of the population objectively does not, therefore in my view there is no such thing as everyone being mildly disordered."

I've stopped wearing my star of David necklace and I didn't put my menorah in the window this Hanukkah due to fear that my house would be targeted. I am anxious when I go to synagogue because I worry there will be protests outside or I'll be the victim of an attack.

I'm now uneasy around Muslims because there's a risk that they might wish me harm. I don't feel good about having that reaction because rationally I know that I'm generalizing and that not all Muslims want me dead, however it's difficult to not be on high alert because there's always the chance that they do.

I realize that my experience is skewed and that it may seem like more Muslims hate Jews than is actually the case, but the fact is that I see very few Muslims stand up for Jewish people these days and it leads me to believe that even if they personally wouldn't hurt me, they might not prevent me from being hurt either.

I'm not trying to disregard the struggles people face as a consequence of uneven wealth distribution. That is a very real issue with capitalism, and as I understand, It's also an issue within other systems.

To be clear, I think a blend of taxes and free market is necessary for this reason.

I'm more referring to how in a low income neighborhood, a dollar store can open and compete with other low income dollar stores. 

Personally, I'm Just not sure why there's such little emphasis on consumer empowerment and the idea that consumers don't HAVE to settle for a fixed price. We can also vote with our dollar; so if we're concerned about ethical practices we can shop at the most ethical and cheapest place. i.e. when Walmart is found to be unethical, we're free to shop somewhere else. 

 I understand voting with your dollar can cost more, but in theory it doesn't NEED to. 

It almost seems like saving money isn't something taught or ever a priority for many working class people. (At least in a North American Context)

1,2023-12-18,CMV: Using PROPER mirrors is better than looking over your shoulder while driving,u/valkyriebiker,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18llgn6/cmv_using_proper_mirrors_is_better_than_looking/,changemyview,"I maintain that using PROPER mirrors is safer then looking over your shoulder when checking behind you on the road. But I read a lot of posts to the contrary, that looking over your shoulder is better because that's ""what I learned in drivers ed"" or something without giving sound reasons why.

So here's my argument. Convince me that I'm wrong.

You're driving along and need to change lanes.

The problem with looking over your shoulder is that the various roof pillars can and do create a blind spot. You can lose a motorcycle in that blind spot if the pillar is wide enough, especially on the left where the motorcycle's profile is narrower (seeing it more head-on and less from the side). And, yes, STOCK mirrors have blind spots, too.  
I added 3 inch wide angle mirrors on my car's stock wing mirrors (mounted to the inside upper corner) and swiveled them outward for even more coverage. There is no blind spot on either side whatsoever and I have confirmed this repeatedly by observing sight lines as people pass me on either side. I can see two lanes on each side of my car -- the adjacent lanes and the lanes next to that.  
Not only does looking over your shoulder give you a incomplete view (those roof pillars), but shifting your gaze that far off 0 degrees (0 being directly ahead) can cause rapid loss of forward context. At 75 MPH (more or less the avg highway speed), you're moving over 100 feet per second -- less than 3 seconds for a football field length.  
Having PROPER mirrors (not just stock mirrors) and knowing how to use them is safer. And, indeed, in many vehicles it's the only way to see behind you anyway. Vans of many styles, all box trucks, and any vehicle that is pulling a trailer. There are many such vehicles where mirrors are the **only** way.  
When I rent a car (like when I've flown somewhere), I bring another set of 3 inch wide angle mirrors with me that I affix to the wing mirrors using suction cups and secured to the stock mirror mount with a safety cord.

I've been doing it this way now for 40+ years and have never even had a close call let alone hit anyone.  
If I'm wrong, if I've missed something, then what is it? I'm literally asking you to change my view."

Northern Ireland is *almost* a two-state nation, it is a nation in which citizens of the United Kingdom and citizens of Ireland have equal, although overall are ruled by the United Kingdom, there is a sense that there is a state for each of these groups to look to outside of Northern Ireland.

The Northern Ireland conflict has been resolved for roughly the last 30 years and there has been lasting peace in Northern Ireland. Are the two groups integrated? No. Is there total amicability between the two groups? No. But do both groups feels at home in Northern Ireland? Yes. Do both groups feel safe in Northern Ireland? Largely, there is the occasional sectarian attack, but these are few and far between(not sure if I'm using the word sectarian right).

Why does the Good Friday Agreement work to maintain peace? /Power-sharing/. The idea is simple, there must always be a unionist party and a republican party in Northern Ireland in order to form a government. This means that government must always be acting in the best interests of both groups in order for anything to get done, or, in other words that CAN'T act against the interest of one group or the other.

What I propose, therefore, is to have a state in historic Palestine, possibly with a right to return for Palestinians, I'm undecided on thatbpoint, where the Jewish people and Arabic people living there are both guaranteed representation in government. The government is unable to attack Jewish people for people, the government is unable to attack Palestinian people. Palestinians are treated equally under the law and are able to escape from an apartheid system. Jewish people can live without fear from a Palestinian or otherwise Arabic state.

A one-state solution for two people.

An acknowledgement of the needs of both groups by the government.

Maybe it's utopian, but hopefully, it could stop the violence and persecution.

One aspect where I am not believing that they have any meaningful influence as portrayed on social media: **movies and box office numbers**. Every time a movie comes out with a female lead and/or majority female cast, or a ""diversity casting"" as they constantly complain, if that movie flops, you have people screaming ""incels didn't watch the movie because they are scared of women, so of course it became a box office flop! But it's a great movie!"". If a movie is cast with a male lead and it flops, we usually do not hear the same rage from social media that ""<insert group name> did not like this movie because <reasons> and that's why it flopped"", as compared to when incels are brought up.

We have had some stellar box office numbers from female-led movies (e.g. Barbie, great film, loved it) and we've had some flops (from both male and female actors). Notable recent flop that made me want to bring this up: The Marvels. I saw the movie in the cinema when it first came out, really enjoyed it, but it was not a packed room on the opening weekend. Every time someone brings up ""incels are to blame!"" I usually answer ""why didn't women go to watch this movie since they want to support women in movies so much?"". Zero meaningful opposite responses, every time. The movie had decent Rotten Tomatoes scores, and was reviewed mostly positively elsewhere.

I find it incredibly difficult to believe that the number of incels that exist, that can influence movie box office numbers, is a statistically meaningful number. Not men in relationships (since incels are not in relationships), just incels that get constantly blamed for movies flopping. Even if incels complain on social media to try to ruin a movie by review-bombing it, it is pretty obvious when that happens; I have yet to see proof that review-bombing even works with these box office flops."

There’s a good month or two of the year where class starts literally before the sun rises. Yet I’m expected to teach kids math during this time. Some of my students who have no choice but to take the bus to school have to wake up at 5, yet the sun may not rise until close to 8 in the winter, well after our first block begins. I’m sorry, but this is simply unreasonable. 

Human beings’ natural cycle is to be awake when the sun is up, not when it’s down. That’s why you often hear about why it’s bad to go to sleep very late. Well,   waking up too early, while it’s still pitch black, and you’re traveling to school while it’s still pitch black, is just as bad. And the fact that kids are being subjected to this can be really damaging to their health. 

There are a couple of points I would like to address obviously: the first would be for places far North like Alaska, where it would be impossible to otherwise fit a full day of classes between sunrise and sundown, as during the winter the sun will barely even be up, if at all. Obviously here they would have no choice but to start before sunrise and end after sundown. But for any other place in the lower 48 states, this shouldn’t be an issue. 

The other point to address is that this rule is simply for the school’s bell schedule. Before-school and after-school activities should not be included here, as during the winter months especially, there’s simply not enough hours where the sun is up to fit them in. It’s simply from the first bell to the last bell of the day. 

But yeah, otherwise, I feel it would be perfectly reasonable to expect schools to set their bell schedule based on when sunrise and sunset are. We already have the tools to know when the Sun will rise and set at any point in the year. Each school district should be expected to check when the Sun would rise and set on December 21st, the shortest day of the year, and set their bells based on those times. Again, the only exception would be Alaska. 

Anyway, perhaps I’m missing something, so I’m open to hearing arguments why this shouldn’t be illegal. Your argument would have to include a point about a potential benefit to starting before sunrise/ending after sunset and/or a potential drawback of limiting school to take place between sunrise and sunset."

 While socialism traditionally advocates for collective ownership of the means of production and a classless society, the Soviet Union under especially under Stalin exhibited a top-down, authoritarian control over the economy and society. State ownership of the means of production did not translate into genuine worker control or empowerment in a meaningful enough way to count as Socialism, as decision-making was concentrated in the hands of a bureaucratic elite. The absence of true worker self-management and the suppression of dissenting voices demonstrate a departure from the core principles of socialism. Additionally, the existence of a privileged political class, stark economic inequality, and a lack of meaningful democratic processes in the Soviet system underscore how the Soviet Union deviated from the ideals of socialism, portraying it as a state-capitalist entity if anything rather than a truly socialist society."

Second, his “assault” was based on this robbery. She could’ve prevented this by not taking his stuff or giving it back the moment he began to defend himself

Third, at best i can’t see is see an issue with him pushing her back in the car but I can also see it as him distancing himself from her and the bad situation.

I don’t know why people get on their high horse and are like “but what gives u right to pass judgement on them and decide that they should die?” Uhh maybe cause the crimes they committed are deplorable and beyond redemption? I’m talking about people who are unanimously without a doubt guilty with evidence to back it up, not people who might be wrongfully accused. People always bring up that argument like “what if they are wrongfully accused?” Then a good vigilante obviously wouldn’t target someone unless they know for sure. And ofc not all criminals would be targeted like say someone who shows remorse or have done petty crime or committed crime out of survival (like a battered wife murdering her husband), and it would be tricky navigating that. But to get in the way of people who would want an obviously evil and convicted person to die and say “you have no right to pass judgement on them that is the laws job!” Just NO. Some of those laws be protecting the criminals instead

There are so many cases where the law fails to even give the victim justice. There is the infamous true crime case from Japan involving a teenage girl who was tortured/raped/humiliated by a group of teenage boys in the span of 2 or so months as their parents turned blind eye (I won’t go into details cause it’s really horrific but her name is Junko Furta if you are curious). And how does the law reward these criminals? By giving them slap on wrist and having most of them be out at the longest within 7 or so years. Now these teens are out reproducing and possibly doing this to more victims and the victims family is left to deal with that idea. And to add salt to injury the parent of one of the kids decides to desocrate the victims grave and blame the victim for ruining her son’s life! Like excuse me?!

After hearing a story like that with 100% evidence that these criminals are guilty how could you be all rational and say “umm well they might change still dont deserve to die”. Who cares? They didn’t give mercy to victim why should we? I just don’t get how people can read and hear evil stuff done by evil people with no remorse whatsoever and think it’s wrong to wish them dead or gone from the world. Im not saying i would or you have to go out and do some vigilante justice yourself but I wouldn’t be against it if someone decided to take matters into their own hands.


Like ppl say Light Yagami from death note is a monster but mostly from the actions of killing innocent people that weren’t involved with actual crime. But his intentions to kill all criminals isn’t necessarily evil to me imo. He only became evil to me when he started targeted ppl that were on to him or petty criminals. But I’d argue if he didn’t do that he would be in the right to continue what he was doing albeit with a bit more tact and certainty when it comes to choosing who to “kill”. 

I probably sound like a lil psycho but we all consume revenge stories especially ones with people who kill people who rightfully deserve it and we eat that shit up! What difference is it if we turn a blind eye to an actual vigilante that would go out and actually take matters into their own hands in real life? I understand there would be danger in letting average impassioned netizens like me pass judgement on people who I think are “guilty” but I just don’t think criminals who get off scoff easy deserve to live and I feel we’d all be secretly happy if these monsters somehow died on “accident”."
1,2023-12-19,CMV: Misandry is merely an expression of internalised mysogyny. They are both the same thing.,u/Tahallon,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18lz6fs/cmv_misandry_is_merely_an_expression_of/,changemyview,"I'll give you a personal example for context:

I work as a paramedic, and we see alot of not so good things on a daily basis. Most of the women there have formed support groups with each other, where they hug and cry and just try to process the mental/emotional strain from their work. I've also tried doing the same with my male colleagues. Now, it took me years way into adulthood until i was finally able to develop the mental/emotional tools required just to be able to maintain all my internal stuff, because no one in my life had ever taught me how, because so many misguided heartless monsters still believe that mental and emotional care is not even something that should be considered with men.

So, knowing how difficult it is for most men to manage these things with society still treats them today, i decided i would try to help them by setting aside a few moments during working hours, and then prolonged social sessions outside of work, where we are pretty much like a mix of a friend-circle and a group-therapy session. Some of the women from work saw and heard of some of it for themselves, saw us doing pretty much exactly what they were doing...and their first instinct was to ridicule and humiliate us as weak, cowardly and juvenile for trying to work through the exact same things that they experience with us, that affects them with tears and grief just like us. Or they are just evil demons who are using whatever excuse available to them to degrade and dehumanise the souls of their fellow human beings.

Either way, i believe wholeheartedly now from both this experience and countless others, that any woman who demands for the men around her to be uncompromisingly strong, stoic and reliable, does so because deep down, wether she is concious of it or not, considers herself to be weak, cowardly and helpless. That any woman who cannot even conceive the idea of not having a man take care of her financially and emotionaly with nothing in return, is that way because an all-too big part of her mind is thinking ""Men aren't as dependent and mentally fragile as me to need me to mutually provide what they are providing for me, so why should i have to worry about these stronger lifeforms when my fragile self needs them to baby me all the time!"".

I wholeheartedly believe that any woman who feels threatened by the men around her attempting to be human beings rather than allow themselves to be opressed by sexism into being her personal boytoy beasts of burden, feels threatened because internally, she doesen't want to live in a world where the men around her are as weak, cowardly and useless as she perceives herself to be. Because if everyone is as pathetic as she thinks she is, then even someone like her can understand it means the world would be doomed."

I limit my proposal to private universities because public universities have additional first amendment restrictions. 

Most of the critiques are that there would be too much ambiguity. Sure, fine. 

Students and faculty should propose hypothetical or real cases to a body that is mandated to publicly 
sharing its decisions and have them bind later decisions.

If it's in a black-and-white zone, ""X ethnicity or religious students should be killed,"" then immediate expulsion and firing, regardless of tenure. It can be gray if it's a good faith hypothetical of course. 

If it's a gray zone (e.g., Hamas/Bin Laden/KKK should be killed), then the body just says if it's not allowed or not and commits itself to subsequent rulings. 

A big problem with the Harvard President was that she noted past free speech restrictions as her predecessor's doing. Fine, so no more excuses. 

This is also good because prospective students who get into top private universities have options. They can see if they like the speech climate and go or not."

I'm just telling you all this so that you can check your ""oh god, another anti-science freak"" rhetoric at the door. :)

Let's make sure we are at the correct starting point here. Let's say we started talking about whether we should trust peer-reviewed research, all of it, in a general sense. I do think, in my heart of hearts and not speaking from the anti-science hat I am currently wearing, that it is 100% legitimate and valid to say that it is good to be at least somewhat skeptical of peer-reviewed research. It is dangerous say ""this study, and really any study at all, is absolutely correct in all of its conclusions, simply because it went through a peer-review process."" It's a process performed by humans and therefore imperfect. Peer reviewers can miss things. They can be too stressed to really perform the job well enough. Sometimes they just don't actually understand the underlying mathematics / science behind the study (personally I have run into this one in my own work). It shouldn't surprise anyone to know that sometimes the peer-review process just misses stuff, and so some studies can get through that have erroneous conclusions.

HERE is the part I'd like to discuss. We are in agreement that skepticism of peer-reviewed study is a good thing. But here's the stance I'm going to take: since the peer review process doesn't appear to work, I see no reason to trust ANY study. Any at all! Why? Well, they all went through peer review, right? And we agree that peer review doesn't really work? Do we have any idea of how often it DOES work? Is it working 99% of the time? 50% of the time? 2% of the time? It's probably closer to 99% than 2%, but really, how the hell do I know that?! If we're really going to take this view seriously, that peer review deserves skepticism and it's an imperfect process, then how can I trust ANY peer-reviewed research at all???

I will not be responding to people who blatantly did not bother to read what I spent time writing down here.

First of all lets start with the counter arguments. I did not say that everyone has equal opportunity and life is a level playing field. Let's say that your father and mother are successful lawyers who together earn mid 6 figures. They pay for everything at college allowing you to pursue law and their connections grant you increased opportunity. If someone from a middle class family tried to get into law they would have a much more difficult time achieving what you have so it would be unfair to say that you go where you got from working harder. That being said if you are from a middle class family and dedicate to your time to becoming a lawyer you will become a lawyer and have a fulfilling life. You won't find yourself with a degree you do not know how to find a job with, unable to live life because you cannot pay of your debts.

From my experience people from middle class families usually go into college with the mindset of do what you want or do what makes you happy instead of do what makes money. They are more likely value their free time and choose degrees that are not as difficult. Kids I knew whose parents who lawyers, doctors, high earning engineers, etc, were not getting drunk on the weekdays, They were not saying, ""C's get degrees"". They spend most of their time studying not because they found their dream time but because they prioritized success.

I am not saying wealthy kids do not have more opportunity just that people from my experience middle class children do not fully take advantage of the opportunity they have. And although it may be harder for them to be on par with their rich classmates it is well, well, within their ability to obtain a job at the end of their 4 years that allows them to take care of themselves and pay back their debts.

Also I am talking about average upper middle class student vs average middle class student. Saying you knew some jackass whose dad was the CEO of a company and gave him a job straight out of college making 6 figures does not disapprove what I said. I also said middle, not working class. I believe that the average person does not take advantage of the opportunity they are given in life so although their wealthier children might have more opportunity for success the average person is well within their ability to get a good job after college. So if you cannot pay your bills and student debt is stopping you from living life and come from a middle class family it is mainly your fault."

Across the left and right, I have reasonable confidence in saying that we agree that there is a breakdown of immigration law. More than that, we both agree that immigration law itself is in need of an overhaul. We just can’t agree on what it should be.

In 1793, our nation passed a Federal law called the Fugitive Slave Act. It was written with the intent to enforce Article 4, Section 2, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution, which required the return of escaped slaves to their owners. It sought to force the authorities in free states to return fugitives of slavery to their masters.
Despite the law, many free states and the citizens therein chose to defy both federal AND constitutional law. Some areas even passed laws that countered the federal law, and some juries refused to convict individuals indicted under the Fugitive Slave Act. This is just one of dozens of examples of civil disobedience that I could reference, but I chose this one because I think the parallels are particularly apt.

I’m not advocating for contempt of our constitution, our government, or our elected officials. But I will argue that those who resisted the Fugitive Slave Law were right to do so, as they acted in accordance to a higher law. And of a similar virtue, I believe that mass, indiscriminate deportation of illegal migrants is wrong."

1,2023-12-19,CMV: dating in America is worthless for me and I’d be better off getting an arranged marriage,u/Somemushu,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18m8vhr/cmv_dating_in_america_is_worthless_for_me_and_id/,changemyview,"I guess to start off just so people are more aware of what the process is like nowadays: your family gets into contact with other families and with their permission recommend you people to connect with. Then if you’re compatible you get married with the consent of both parties. Usually, very driven and professional people tend to go this route. 

As for myself: I’d describe myself as the above. I’m in a professional school, I am independent, I cook, clean, and can take care of myself. I hit the gym, I’m funny, and I have some hobbies that I consider fun. 

Dating just hasn’t worked out for me though. I’m in my late 20s, and it feels like all my friends around me have partnered up and are having a good time. I’m frequently left out feeling like a third wheel. I’ve tried SO HARD with dating but it just feels so impossible. I’ve hit the apps and have had just no luck. Idk what it is. I’m average height, look pretty decent (according to my friends), I’m funny though I admit all I have are dad jokes. But no one is interested. I’ve asked so many women out but all have just been interested in being friends instead. 

I’ve been feeling really deflated about it all lately to be honest. Idk is it my height or race? I know it’s a significant hurdle in America but maybe I underestimated how big of a hurdle it really is. Is it my personality? I just am not sure what to work on without outside advice. I’ve been trying really hard on that front. Or am I just ugly and people are too nice to say so? 

Either way, I think my family is getting that depressed vibe from me lately and want to help so they’ve floated around the idea and I’m not going to lie it sounds tempting. All of these girls are completely normal and are just looking for a guy to share successful lives with and it’s basically what I want too. The idea of falling in love with someone sounds nice…but maybe it’s just not in the cards for me and this is just the better alternative. I’ve had my shot and I clearly failed and am unwanted on the dating scene in America so this is the best alternative. I can’t help but feel like I might regret not waiting for someone but…I’m not getting any younger and the amount of “good options” left seem to shrink every year too."

Sex is a human activity. Most people will have contact with it throughout their lives. 

Of course there is an appropriate age to start doing that, there is some steps you have to respect in order to have safe sex, etcetera.

Even so, this care that is needed is not very hard to perform. Mostly all you need is a condom (if this person is not your only partner), consent, and some type of birth control. 

Despite all of this, some people (im not talking necessarily about religious people) feel the need to go around saying sex is “a big responsability” in all sorts of ways, usually to defend premarital chastity. 

Usually, if you ask them, they cant really explain their thoughts. They say birth control is not 100% effective, that condoms are not 100% effective to avoid diseases and all sorts of stuff in order to deffend sexual abstinence. I think in the end everyone who does that or cares about other people’s sex lives that much are usually very puritan and have no arguments other than that. 

Truth is: their usually just sexist, puritan and conservative and dont wanna admit that. 

Do you think that is a misconception? Enlighten me."

The left and the youth always get blamed whenever republicans win but most if not all of the time it's because moderates force through corporate democrats under the guise of ""electability"" even when that claim is verifiably false (ie: bernie being a stronger head to head matchup against trump than biden was in the polls) even against the complaints of the same people they always accuse of not turning out to vote.
If they want those groups to vote they need to be willing to make a sacrifice and support legitimately good candidates in the primaries even if it makes them uncomfortable, ""vote blue no matter who"" can't just be a slogan to browbeat the left with, it cuts both ways, they need to suck it up and vote blue no matter who even if that blue is a leftist candidate. The best way to get the leftists in your party to show up for the election is to be willing to compromise and support a candidate they can actually get excited about.

2. There is a disparity of motive between the moderates and the left. The left has legitimate moral reason to hate the candidates moderates push through the primaries due to the massive harm and loss of life their foreign policy inflicts upon helpless people abroad as well as the concessions they make to corporations, this is especially prevalent this election cycle with biden overtly funding and vocally supporting the genocide of the Palestinian people in gaza as well as admitting that he himself is a zionist, zionism being an inherently imperialist/fascistic ideology which supports the creation and expansion of an ethnostate.
The moderates however, have no such moral complaints against left leaning candidates and instead base most of their complaints in emotion and fear; making vague statements about them being ""too far left"" or ""not electable enough"" and repeating talking points from McCarthyism/the red scare which have no backing or basis in reality especially seeing as leftist candidates tend to support policies that have much broader appeal than the moderates do on a policy by policy basis and often fare better in direct match-ups against the opposition. This has been proven in real world scenarios as well with left leaning candidates winning in deep red states against republican candidates where the democratic party routinely takes losses when putting forth centrist/corporatist candidates. Essentially the left has a legitimate moral justification whereas moderates are acting out of fear and discomfort and tend to push through candidates that make them feel comfortable even if those candidates are monstrous human beings who shouldn't be allowed anywhere near power.

3. Moderates in the democratic voter base have forced this choice on the left for decades and it always results in a back and forth fight with the party in power switching every few years as things slowly get worse. Whereas in those locations where further left leaning candidates win, those areas tend to stay blue much longer as a result of the people living there seeing the positive effect of the policies left leaning candidates put into place.


4. All this to say that If moderates want to actually win elections, they need to stop supporting candidates that are widely unliked by both sides of the political spectrum and stop blaming ""the left"" when it is observably their fault that this is happening. ""The left"" can't be logically blamed when their candidates are consistently more successful when given the chance in real elections. It's moderates that are costing us elections and it's moderates that will be at fault for the US slipping into a full blown fascist dictatorship if they hand the presidency to trump by putting forth a nominee nobody likes.


Things that won't change my mind:

1. ***""It's actually conservatives fault""*** Yeah, sure I agree, they're bad people and ultimately to blame, but it's a waste of time and effort to try and change their minds. We should focus on groups that actually can change. Those are leftists and moderates and of the two moderates don't have a real justification for continuing to impose their bs on others.

2. ***""but biden did (insert good thing here)""*** Biden/any centrist doing good things on occasion, or even often does not outweigh the lives they take with their foreign policy and it certainly doesn't outweigh outright genocide.

3. Appealing to me personally to vote for him. This isn't about my vote; it's about how if he loses I won't blame leftists/the youth, I'll blame moderates who constantly saddle us with unappealing nominees that are so bad it's more surprising when they win than when they lose.

4. ***""biden doesn't actually have control over what happens in gaza/biden is already trying to stop it""*** This one I've heard a lot recently and the first part is dubious at best, israel could not do what it does without the funding the US gives it and biden has control over that the second part is easily disproven with his own words and actions."

I am not trying to change anybody's mind, but rather, I want to understand what justification can be used dor this.

1. For those unaware because of the current conflict in Gaza, the West Bank is currently under a fascist, apartheid occupation. This is implied because of Israeli's settlement expansions. In 1983, the Jewish population in the West Bank was 22,000. Last year, that number is estimated to be as high as 500,000. 

2. Those settlements are built on top of destroyed, evicted or ethnically cleansed Palestinian lands. They were considered illegal by every country from 1967 until 2019 when Donald Trump declared support for them.

3. The ""International Community"" votes every year to condemn those settlements. This includes Europe, France, Germany, Ukraine, India, so on. The US and Canada were the only countries apart from a few small former Oceanasian/US colonies to not condemn them.

4. The settlements destroy Palestinian lives, property including farms and businesses, control Palestinian consumption (85% of the West Bank's GDP comes from Settlements- that money only goes to Israel), and every year hundreds of Palestinians get evicted for those settlements.

5. Hamas has no operations in the West Bank, that much is clear. Yet 350 Palestinians have died in that area since the start of the war 2 months ago. There are walls and security checkpoints separating the West Bank's settlements and many parts of the West Bank and all of them make a 5 minute walk take up to 30 minute in security clearances and checkings.


So why is that last paragraph relevant? If this information, combined with the fact that 8,000 children and 6,000 women have died out of 20,000 identified civilians in Gaza, how can it not be ethnic cleansing?"
139,2023-12-19,"CMV: Republicans are modern-day Confederates in that they advocate for an societal structure that will foster a permanent underclass (or caste), exploitable both socially and economically.",u/humanessinmoderation,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18maanc/cmv_republicans_are_modernday_confederates_in/,changemyview,"Looks look at the parallels between Confederates and modern Republicans:

**On Economic Exploitation and Social Hierarchy:**

* **Confederates** strongly supported a socio-economic system based on slavery, where an underclass was not just a byproduct but a necessity for the economy. This is well-documented in historical sources like “Confederate Reckoning” by Stephanie McCurry (source: Harvard University Press).
* **Republicans**, particularly those aligned with more extreme views, often support policies that critics argue perpetuate economic inequality. This can be seen in opposition to raising the minimum wage and reducing social welfare programs, which some argue helps maintain a lower economic class dependent on low-wage jobs (source: Economic Policy Institute, “The Impact of Raising the Minimum Wage”). [https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-the-federal-minimum-wage-to-15-by-2025-would-lift-the-pay-of-32-million-workers/](https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-the-federal-minimum-wage-to-15-by-2025-would-lift-the-pay-of-32-million-workers/)

**On Racial and Social divides:**

* **The Confederacy** was explicitly structured around racial inequality. The cornerstone speech by Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens in 1861 is a stark reminder of this, where he stated that the Confederacy’s foundation rested upon the belief that blacks were inferior to whites (source: Teaching American History, Cornerstone Speech).
* **The Republican Party** have been known for exploiting racial tensions, as seen in some rhetoric around immigration policies and voting rights issues (e.g. ""thugs,"" ""welfare queens"", dubious claims of ""reverse racism"", etc). Critics argue this creates social divides that echo past segregational ideologies (source: Brennan Center for Justice, “Voting Laws Roundup”).

**On economic policies favoring the wealthy**

* **The Confederate**, antebellum South’s economy was heavily skewed in favor of the wealthy plantation owners. The reliance on slave labor was a means to maintain and increase their wealth (source: “[The Half Has Never Been Told” by Edward E. Baptist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Half_Has_Never_Been_Told:_Slavery_and_the_Making_of_American_Capitalism)).
* **Modern economic policies endorsed by Republicans**, such as tax cuts for the wealthy and opposition to wealth redistribution efforts, are argued to disproportionately benefit the upper class, potentially leading to a wider economic gap. This can be seen in analyses of policies like the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (source: [Tax Policy Center,](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/distributional-analysis-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-passed-senate-finance-committee) “Distributional Analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”).

**On labor rights and exploitation**

* **The Confederate economy was exclusively built on the exploitation of slave labor**, where labor rights were nonexistent. This is extensively covered in historical literature on the Confederacy.
* **Today, Republican policies are optimized to undermine labor rights**, citing opposition to labor unions and deregulation efforts that potentially increase worker exploitation 

**Political power and voter suppression**

* **The Confederacy** was invested in maintaining political power through disenfranchisement based on race. Post-Civil War, this continued with Jim Crow laws (source: [National Museum of African American History and Culture, “Jim Crow Era](https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/stories/traveling-through-jim-crow-america)”).
* **Republican-led states** include enacting voter ID laws and gerrymandering, perceived by critics as modern forms of voter suppression, particularly impacting minority communities (source: [ACLU, “The History of Voter Suppression”](https://vote.uiowa.edu/sites/vote.uiowa.edu/files/2021-08/The%20History%20of%20Voter%20Suppression.pdf)).

**On flags and symbolism**

* Both wave the same two flags — the US flag and variations of a Confederate Battle flag

Fat people, for instance, often lose weight because of ridicule.

Incels are misogynists who hate women. Many of them are short, ugly, earn low income, or have some other deficiency that makes them unattractive. Therefore, if we bully and criticize them, they will steadily improve and become much better.

The more we mock and bully incels, the more well-adjusted, less sexist, and better-looking and better-personality'd they will be. Every 4-foot tall incel man, when mocked for his height, will grow to 5-foot-10. Every incel who earns a low wage will soon earn six figures. Every obese incel will drop two hundred pounds. And the more pro-women, more winsome, they will become.

Eventually they will come thank us for having bullied them into no longer being incels.  Where there used to be a sexist, hateful, misogynistic incel, there will now be a tall, handsome, responsible man thanking us for our tough-love mockery."

original post for the sake of context:

""i know because i am that kind of person. i am the source on this. some people will never accomplish anything. no matter how much time, effort, and practice we put into anything we consider worthy of our attention, we'll never be worthy of whatever it is we want to do. we are simply too incompetent and incapable. its shitty, but thats the reality. sometimes people are just born lesser and we're better off just accepting that and making way for those that werent.

so, those are my true feelings. its not something i talk about to the people i want to keep around. obviously its a shitty take and i hate living like this, but i cant keep myself from genuinely feeling this to be the case. anytime i make a mistake of any kind, no matter how trivial, the negative feelings i get afterwards are so intense and crippling that i dont want to do anything at all for the rest of the day and can result in self harm if bad enough. to be completely honest, this is a bit of an act of desperation. something has to give soon. i appreciate anyone who took the time to read this and welcome feedback.

notes to consider: yes i have tried therapy. i am currently planning on getting back into it. i am also medicated. to give you an idea of how bad off i was beforehand i am currently taking 200mg of zoloft every day because it used to be worse lmao. kinda pathetic, but it is what it is"""

It seems to be a purely US trait because I've never seen people from other nationalities do that.

* It doesn't add anything interesting to the conversation
* it is a symptom of refusal to look at history from different perspectives

1) **I've chosen this DailyKOS link for my post largely due to it being the best single page summary I've come across**.  Note that I've followed the daily news for decades (albeit with a bias as we all have).  I've strived to do considerable research on the topic to develop my current viewpoint (with a tendency to lean center left for information sources).

2) Regardless of your opinion/views of DailyKOS as a news source **note that they provide links to each tracked item which can be further web searched**.  Likely there is duplication between accusations, charges and convictions which increases the DailyKOS track count.

3) In democracy **every individual deserves the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty** and likely some of these DailyKOS tracked cases have/will turn out to prove innocence.

4) **I get how overly simplified it is to classify 'left vs right' with such a delicate subject** but in my opinion it's one of the clearest trends that appears to develop a pattern of behavior.

5) To be clear **I have no doubt that a number of politically left leaning individuals could and have been implicated** as well.  

6) I am very open to being 'wrong and misinformed' about this viewpoint and **ultimately a crime is a crime regardless of who commits it**.

1,2023-12-19,CMV: It's a bad idea to commit suicide because it might not actually be the escape you're looking for.,u/Silent-Egg-8197,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18mfzt5/cmv_its_a_bad_idea_to_commit_suicide_because_it/,changemyview,"**TLDR;** Imagine, you try to escape hell on earth (via suicide) only to wind up in the actual HELL with no chance to again, escape. You legit made your life hell....

**Pascal's Wager** \- states that it is better to believe in God than not to because its better to make the ""safe bet"" that heaven and hell exist. Therefore, be religious in life so if you die, you go to heaven not hell, and if there's no gods then you just die like everyone else and are simply dead. The End. But what about some odd form of the reverse of this? 

============================

**MY VIEW TO BE CHANGED:** 

It's a bad idea to commit suicide because you might have been better off alive:

Yea, so I am going here... so firstly, WHY is it a bad idea you may ask, well, Pascal's Wager, that's why (but kinda in reverse?). 

People who commit suicide (unless in war or some horrendous injury) are doing it because they think life is too hard, and that life is basically a living hell. Therefore, simply kill yourself and you will finally ""escape""! From everything I have read about suicide, the suicid-ers reason for doing it normally goes something like this: ""XYZ is shitty, I don't want to live *my* life anymore, I wish I could die... \*goes and fulfills said wish to die"". Here's where the issues may begin... Escape involves changing your location per-se. Let's just say that you have no light in your life and have never considered the afterlife or gods. Let's also say there is no afterlife. So killing yourself is just ""making it all stop"" and ""stopping existing"". Easy ""win"". All your pain and suffering is now over and no longer are you anything. YOU DIED.

Ok, so let's say there IS an afterlife! As a person who has (well, no one reading this has successfully committed suicide) committed suicide, you are betting YOUR LIFE on the fact that ""the pain stops"" when you die. What if there IS something after here? What if there is an after-life of some sort? Well, you might be even more fucked then when you were alive.... Yikes... You kill yourself because life is basically a living hell. So now, in this world that HAS an afterlife, you killed yourself, you are now dead, but ITS NOT OVER YET! You now find yourself in some form of afterlife, and you might be put on a one-way-flight to HELL ITSLEF! Now, you thought your life was bad?! Now image being immortal, and then being put in a place 10x worse than the worse days of your life, the whole time thinking ""I wish I had not killed myself and I would do anything to go back"", but there is no escape from hell, you can't just kill yourself because you're already dead.... Super duper fucking yikes fam.

IDK if people who commit suicide are religious or not more than often, but if someone does, there is a chance, idk if 1/100 or 50/50 as no one here or anywhere on the earth has that answer, but it is a gamble. If you are trying to escape hell on earth, please don't write yourself a one way ticket to actual hell! 

P.S. If you are suicidal, just know, people on earth, now or in the past, would have given everything to be in your place... Some people are blind, some have cancer, some have no arms or legs. Life sucks, but shit has levels of suck, and everyone has problems. So get help! And I am 100% sure someone will help you!   


Peace and love :D"

I disagree with any government attempt to ban books, but I am not opposed to private entities or organizations if they want to ban a book that is for only their readers. 

For example, let's say I am the owner of a website where anyone can go on and post their books. I will obviously allow most books (like 99.9% of them), but if there is occasionally a book with extremely vile messages, for example if it is explicitly pro rape or pro murder, I will probably remove it from the site because I don't want to be responsible if some impressionable teenager reads it and gets the wrong idea, or if the book gets used as justification for some heinous crime. If the author really wants people to read their book, they can simply go to another website or find some other outlet that does not ban their book, but if they also want to remove it for similar reasoning, it is their right to do so.

Overall, I find the debate of ""book banning"" similar to the debate on social media. In general, there should be free speech in the sense that you can't be arrested, but if for example if you go on reddit or facebook or twitter and write some extreme, provocative statement, then whoever is in charge has the right to remove your post as you so choose. In some circumstances, for example Kanye's statements about Nazis I would even say it is moral and fully justified for companies to remove them from their sites. However, there seems to be a double standard when it comes to free speech, since people often acknowledge that social media companies have the right to and should remove certain posts, but the same is not applied when it comes to books."

I'm a 25 year old male who is chronically online and pretty much a hermit. I made up this pros and cons list of how I feel a relationship would be for me. I have never attempted to date in my life, and I generally try to avoid people during the four days that I do leave the house for work. I'm curious what people think about it and if they have any statements that could change my view on this.

Pros:
Someone to play games and watch movies, anime, or youtube with.

Easier to afford housing as a couple.

The tax brackets are more favorable if you get married.

Cons:
Less time to play games.

Less time alone.

Have to leave the house more. I only leave the house 4 days a week and only to go to work.

Costs a lot of money. I am extremely frugal.

Gotta talk a lot more. I go most days without speaking a single word.

Gotta talk with someone irl. I don't mind speaking online to people through text or voice chat.

Gotta talk about my emotions, feelings, etc. Makes me uncomfortable.

Gotta talk about and think about the future. I generally just live one day at a time and go with the flow.

Physical intimacy such as kissing, hugs, hand holding, s*x. This stuff grosses me out or makes me uncomfortable. I'm likely on the asexual spectrum or something.

They could kill me in my sleep or poison my food."

The mother of a child is the only person who can be 100% certain of the father of her child, and that’s only if she is only having sex with that man. When it comes to men, there is no way, without a paternity test, to be able to tell if he is the father of the child he is raising.

The idea that men can know 100% based on trust is not true. I say this because I highly doubt that almost men who were victims of paternity fraud trusted their partners.  No amount of trust means anything. I would go as far to say even appearances of the child don’t mean anything. If two people who share no blood can look alike, this means that a person can see similar traits between a a baby and themselves. It can be misleading.

Without any scientific DNA test there is no viable way to prove that you are the biological dad of a child, therefore you can’t know for certain."

I am autistic and generally struggle with mental flexibility, but I'll try my best!

And yes, before you ask, I am in therapy and have been for a long time. But I've generally been resistant to it because of difficulty accepting alternative points of view.

My father was... a severely abusive man. He would be violent toward my mother a lot and I sometimes had to watch. One thing I found out later that he would do was that he had a cycle of expressing sexual interest in my mother around me, then that night when she would reciprocate, he would turn it off and become abusive. This quickly led to her being very uncomfortable with his flirting, which I was exposed to.

Also, I had a traumatic incident at around 7-8 where a female friend of my mothers starting ranting about nudie magazines and how if I looked at them I was misogynistic like my father. At the time I was very sexually curious, so I kind of... decided that that meant that wanting to see women naked was wrong and a form of abuse.

Now, many years later, I am still struggling with finding dating and flirting impossible because of my feeling that there is no real difference between my sexual interests and misogyny. Furthermore, I see that often men who express such views online are accused of ""not treating women like people"", so it creates a damned-if-I-do, damned-if-I-don't situation.

I do get that we're in very sensitive, unprecedented territory with his many indictments and lawsuits, but unprecedented behavior should result in unprecedented consequences, shouldn't they? Furthermore, isn't Donald Trump ultimately the architect of all of this by choosing to proceed with his candidacy, knowing that he was under investigation and subject to potential lawsuits and indictments? If a President commits a crime on his last day in office (or the day after) and immediately declares his candidacy for the next election, should we lose our ability to hold that candidate accountable? What if that candidate is a perennial candidate like Lyndon Larouche was? Do we just never have an opportunity to hold that candidate accountable?

This historic decision, supported by a 4-3 majority of justices appointed by Democratic governors, demonstrates the grave challenges facing the nation's democratic institutions.  
The ruling, which stems from Trump's alleged role in inciting the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack, defies the prior district court's reluctance to apply the 14th Amendment to the presidency. Despite the current stay until January 4 or a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Trump's campaign's intention to appeal sets the stage for a precedent-setting legal battle that could impact his eligibility in key states.  
This case highlights the urgent need to interpret the 14th Amendment's intent regarding presidential candidates and its explicit reference to ""officers of the United States."" Those arguing for disqualification maintain that the framers intended to bar insurrectionists from all federal offices, including the presidency. On the other hand, Trump's defense relies on the Electoral College as a safeguard, asserting that the amendment does not directly apply to the highest office.  
In light of these developments, it becomes increasingly evident that democracy in the United States is under severe strain, with the fundamental principles of democratic governance destroyed outright."
1,2023-12-20,CMV: It's never okay for an adult to date someone who looks underage.,u/shemademedoit1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18mocsf/cmv_its_never_okay_for_an_adult_to_date_someone/,changemyview,"Yes, this CMV is based on controversial reactions to posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/18mji9s/jyoti_amge_she_is_the_worlds_shortest_women_with/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/PaymoneyWubby/comments/10j8thb/australian_media_reacting_to_shauna_rae_getting/).

First of all, the statement in the title needs to be precisely defined:

**""CMV: It's never morally acceptable for a typical adult to have a sexual relationship who physically looks under the age of 16""**

Please address the fully defined CMV here, not the one in the title, which I use because it would be too wordy to use the fully-defined CMV.

Yes, I used the word ""never"", if you can find even a single exception than you win a delta. But there are some exceptions I will not accept since they are obvious exceptions to a general rule and won't be (in my opinion) enough to overturn it.

**Rule B: Do I personally hold this and am I open it to changing?**

Yes and Yes. People should have agency over their own sexuality, but we should morally discourage predatory behaviour, we should discuss where the right balance is. Maybe my ""never"" rule is too restrictive and we can find a better way to do morality in situations like this. Let's see.

**Rule A: Explain the reasoning behind my view**

The reasoning is simple. Most people agree that it is morally wrong to be sexually attracted to minors. And since sexual attraction is based on physical traits, then it is also morally wrong to be sexually attracted to someone who *looks* like a minor. And this is the basis for my CMV.

Rebutting possible counter-arguments:

**As long as both people are consenting adults, then it should be allowed, shouldn't it?**
>Legally yes, but morally no, and this CMV is a moral question. There are 45 year old creeps who date 18 year olds, and both adults are consenting so the relationship is permitted on legal grounds, but everyone knows that the guy almost certainly is exploiting the immaturity of the younger person.

**What if the guy has genuine intentions and actually is in love with the other person, and vice-versa, that means them having sex should be okay?**
>Sure, but good luck proving it. As I said before, in the vast majority of cases guys in this position are exploiting their partner for non-genuine reasons. This is one of those moral situations where we presume that the guy is exploiting her and it's up to him to prove he isn't. If you can find a simple way to test whether the relationship is genuine on the side of both parties and does not fall within exploitative situations, then sure, please say so and let me know.

**Isn't it unfair to presume immorality and expect the guy to ""prove"" that he comes with moral intentions?**
>No, it's not wrong to do so. We do this whenever we see couples where the girl is 18 and the guy is 40+. Everyone just *knows* the guy probably has other motives than forming a sincere relationship with the girl. And because of this overwhelming statistical fact, it is okay to presume guilt and expect the guy to prove his innocence. And good luck doing so.

**How about a man who is an adult but, like the woman, has a similar physical condition (and vice-versa)**
>Yeah that would be okay, and is an exception I accept, but I used the term 'typical adult' in the full version of my CMV statement, so it doesn't apply to situations like this and won't award you a delta.

**You are just removing her sexual agency, which is wrong / You are severely and unfairly limiting her partner choices**
>No, she can consent to sex with anyone. There is no moral judgment on her. However, we can still pass judgment on the motives of those who have sex with her, which as I mention multiple times, are almost certainly based on an immoral sexual attraction.

**The reason sexual attraction to a minor is immoral is because it leads to abuse of minors, this is not in play here**
>Despite this, we still want to discourage any behaviour which potentially promotes sexual activity with minors, which therefore includes sexual activity with those who *look* like minors.

**You can't control who you're attracted to. Being attracted to the body of a minor is okay, as long as you don't actually get involved with a minor**
>Despite this, we still want to discourage any behaviour which potentially promotes sexual activity with minors, which therefore includes sexual activity with those who *look* like minors."

However, the whole entire movement is a huge cherry-pick. The basis of their movement is that women make up only 34% of the STEM workforce, and that number is too low. I find it funny though that there’s no movement for more women in blue collar professions. For example, construction workers are about 91% male. So to them, 34% is way too low for STEM fields and needs to be changed, but they couldn’t bother to care about how every single blue collar job is extremely male dominated. Many blue collar jobs can actually pay very well with experience and time, but it seems that women are only pushing for jobs that allow them to sit in an office all day and do essentially useless work, while blue collar work is what keeps every country running."

That's what's supposed to happen after you fund the means to blow up a fucking hospital. You're supposed to ask god for forgiveness and not sin anymore.

How can all of these christians be comfortable with having god on the money actively admit to ""not caring where the money goes"" "" Just so wrapped up in their own problems to care"" 

 They don't care enough to make the churches taxable to fund the war their ""god"" just can't seem to stop.


 They just cling to the idea that they will be endlessly forgiven as though they aren't going to be sinning until their dying day.( Using this blood money is basically a sin) I'm willing about most christians haven't asked forgiveness for the atrocities going on. They just send ""Thoughts and prayers"" And suck eachother off in the comments. 

If there is a god. It's going to look christians in the eye with a one dollar bill and say ""Was it worth it?"" "" Did you get your fill?"" "" Of course not"" ""Just like last time"" 

Please change my view.  I don't think anyone that doesn't denounce what the dollar bill is in the name of god is a true christian."

Great book, great film. What I loved about it, is it’s one of the extremely rare films where all the stakes and drama are about planning ahead….

When Watney is stranded on Mars he immediately takes steps to begin growing his own food. The jeopardy is not immediate, the ticking clock in the story is about how he will run out of food several months in future if he doesn’t do x, y, and z.

Contrast this with most action/adventure/sci fi blockbusters. 

They take place over a few days, usually follow some kind of heroes journey esq fish out of water plot. Where the hero is a morally neutral or even morally bankrupt individual, who at the whim of circumstance, is able to turn things around and defeat the single, identifiable antagonist in a big CGI battle. Any long term processes like training take place in montage where we can’t see the real work behind their achievements.

In real life, drama unfolds slowly. People change their character gradually over time, not through a set of fast paced call to action plot beats. Whether it’s pulling yourself out of depression, helping nurse a sick family, or starting a business. 

Even on a macro level, the dangers we face as a species - from climate change, geopolitics, pandemics. These are all solved not by a hero who shows up on the day, but by slow paced negotiation, preparedness and planning. Just like Watney in The Martian.

I believe part of our inability to solve long term problems in society, and in our own lives, comes from being over exposed to stories that fixate on short termism. And that movies like The Martian (and I’m sure a few others), show that you can in fact create true drama around planning for long term jeopardy."

yes, a distinction between the separate cultures is useful but we have words like cultivar, breed, subspecies, variety, race, variant, strain, ecotype, landrace, and lineage.

the reason for this view is that the lines between these variants is blurred and remain blurred so long as they continue to share genetic pools. i would assert this so long as we consider modern man to be the same creature that interbreed with those other people. however, if we decided to consider modern man sufficiently different from those that mixed, i would be fine with that. if you reject that delimitation then i would assert that those other human lineages didn't completely die off but that the lineages simply converged into something new and slightly different.

i believe this is the way things are headed anyway due to widely accessible genetic data."

They will see this as an attack on democracy and give them one more reason to vote Biden out. 

I also think it's pretty obvious to everyone that SCOTUS is going to overrule this by at least 6-3 in Trump's favour. I can even see this going 9-0 depending on the reasoning and the precedent they want to set. This will be absolutely grab headlines and dominate the news even more than the Colorado ruling, giving Trump even more attention that he can feed off of. It'll basically solidify him as the Republican nominee. 

Where it goes from there depends on the ruling.

294,2023-12-20,CMV: Astrology is complete and utter nonsense(including/especially the detailed one),u/TarhatazedSource,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18mtnlk/cmv_astrology_is_complete_and_utter/,changemyview,"Ive heard that ""college girl astrology is stupid but the in depth one is true"". After meeting a guy who is heavily into natal charts i decided to read up on it to judge for myself. After some research, I have infinitely times more respect for college girl astrology than this stuff. The girls at least mostly do it for fun. These people believe in what is essentially just nonsense. So, explain these things to me and change my mind.

First and foremost. The signs are constellations of stars and the planets are the planets of our Solar system. The actual dates of the planets and the signs in real life are not exactly right, there is also not 12 constellations but 13 (between Scorpius and Sagittarius theres one called Ophiuchus). The signs are also not evenly distributed to a month cycle the way they are in the Zodiac. Some actually only last a few days (like Scorpius) while others last 50(like Virgo). So its very safe to say that most peoples charts in Astrology and in real life would not look the same.

Then we have the vague nature of the chart interpretations.

\-You are warm,empathetic, caring....... all that stuff means absolutely nothing and most people will identify with it. 

Contradictions are so common its almost comical that anyone takes it seriously. I took my time to read about this and i used my own data.

So are you ready. 

Sun in Capricorn means you are reserved ,ambitious , honorable , cold ,strong willed ,bitter and mistrustful. Moon in Cancer means you are emotional.Moon in Cancer people can have a hard time compartmentalizing their lives simply because their watery Moon knows no boundaries. Sometimes, as a result, they may act irrationally. So one part of me is super cold and grounded while the other one is hyper emotional. One part is overambitious and power hungry ,obsessed with boundaries and has a natural need for independence, the other one is too dependent and inert to do anything and doesnt respect boundaries. Ofc im gonna be one of these so they will simply proclaim whatever it is i am as true and call Astrology true.

Theres more. Cancer moon means you are tied to your home and family. Mercury Sagittarius means you will probably end up moving somewhere and you like foreign languages. Again, a massive contradiction that will either be true in one or the other. 

Or Cancer Moon,Capricorn sun and Virgo rising means that the person is very reserved in love and highly picky of who they choose to share themselves with but who they choose they end up bonded for life.

Meanwhile, Pluto in Sagittarius sextile Lilith says that he idolizes sex and experimentations, may have an affair...

The situations are endless. Just contradiction after contradiction meant for people to nitpick what they think describes them and nothing else. No substance of any worth.

That being said, the signs are archetypes that could resemble some people. Some are loud , intense, some are more quiet , reserved, some are more this and that but if we look at the signs its either a hit or miss. My brother is a Cancer and for him its a hit. Reserved, emotional, calm, very receptive of his surrounding. My dad is a huge miss. He is very hardworking, no nonsense etc. He is a Libra. My mom is very calm like my brother, she is an Aries...... My friend group has 7 Geminis out of 15 people and they are all completely different when looking at love, career, humor.....

If we look at the detailed chart its basically everything and as i said above , youre meant to pick the ones you think describe you and throw away the ones that dont , making it useless. 

Im gonna leave my chart here and you tell me things about me. Ill reveal stuff to see whether you guessed right. Say something about my appearance(not exactly to guess how i look like because i wont post pictures of me but i do have some things about my body that are pretty specific) , interesting things about me, specific stuff thats not vague. In fact, most times i talked to astrology people they guess based on my appearance on a specific sign so my first impression does fit the archetype of a sign, try and guess it from my chart and also say why you chose that. I also had a very specific situation that impacted my life in a massive way that i hope someone will get from my chart.

Am I outdated for having this perspective? I’m from an Asian family who has taught me to always be wary of what I put out there online and to be of age before you have sex.

Just to put it out there, I am sex positive and I think it is okay to have sex before marriage. I also acknowledge that when hormones are eating, teenagers should be allowed to experiment with their sexualities and bodies. However, I do not think that it is wise to take something so permanent like nudes even if it is out of trust and it is consensual. I do not truly believe that a 15 year old can fully consent to sex even if it is with another minor.

So, why is it that whenever the world expresses fierce resistance against Israel and claims that said beef is **only** with the Israel, antisemitic hate crimes also rise? What happened to, *“We have no problem with Jews, we love the Jews. We’re just against Zionists.”* ?

If someone was against the Russia war in Ukraine, and kept preaching “I love the Russians, just not the Russian government,” and then tagged Russian restaurants in NYC with “free Ukraine,” what would that tell you? 

If someone was against China’s treatment of the Uyghurs and kept preaching, “I love the Chinese, just not the Chinese government,” and then yelled at a Chinese American person in NYC to “Free the Uyghurs,” what would that tell you? 

And yet, when synagogues and kosher restaurants in NYC are tagged with “Free Gaza” or “Free Palestine,” an American Jew is told “go back to Poland,” and protesters in Sydney chant “gas the Jews,” I’m to believe it’s *just* anti Zionism?

1,2023-12-20,CMV: Natural oil reserves are a net negative on a country,u/GeneroHumano,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18mxbt2/cmv_natural_oil_reserves_are_a_net_negative_on_a/,changemyview,"I am sure people will come up with a few exceptions, but I am more interested in this as a rule.

Let's start with a small country like Guyana. They have a small economy, largely absent from geopolitics, then they discover large oil reserves. Most people think that is a good thing, their economy is booming, and sure it is, But this is only the short term, already a neighbour is threatening to invade and suddenly the sights of super powers are on the tiny nation and their influence is starting to flow into the country.

Speaking of the neighbour, I don't think Venezuela is threatening to seriously invade, mostly because I don't think any of Venezuela's problems come from a lack of oil. Venezuela also had an economic boom for while, but it is much further down the timeline than Guyana, and should be a cautionary tale. After the boom that made Venezuela one of the wealthiest nations on the planet, the country got a bad case of Dutch Disease (I would argue any small country that discovers oil is bound to get this because no other aspect of the economy could possibly match the growth of the oil sector), and has been at the mercy of fluctuating oil prices for a long time. Eventually, just as most petro-states do, Venezuela also developed a big corruption issue. Wealth inequality, and entitlement led to the rise of incompetent populist leaders that completely wrecked Venezuela's oil industry, doubled down in the corruption, and have keep the country in a never ending tail-spin and perpetual state of economic collapse and a recurring, ironic energy crisis.  


Large, developed countries and super powers fare better because they have more diversified economies, but are no less prone to corruption due to the unchecked rise of an oligarch class (see Russia). In federal systems, the states or provinces with the oil reserves also develop an outsized sense of entitlement and self-importance against the rest of the country, and special interests start pushing for divisive rhetoric, poisoning politics, and sabotaging education and long-term cultural development due to oil's perverse incentives to contradict scientific consensus. Texas in the U.S. and Alberta in Canada are both good examples of this. Both of these states/provinces pump out populist politicians, push for regressive policies, are prone to misguided separatism, and sabotage their own education to keep workers from critically assessing the need for clean technology and transition. This all results in negative effects for the country at large. Some are obvious extrapolations, like dropping standard of education, wealth inequality, and bad-faith democratic engagements, but also the concentration of power around these sectors shape policies in ways that: allow oligopolies to rise by allowing for poor corporate practices like vertical integration, sabotage efforts to develop proper public transit infrastructure across the country, weaken environmental regulations (which in turn makes other sectors less productive due to more unstable ecosystems and biodiversity loss), and force reliance on other corrupt states.

Then there are secondary effects too. Car-centric cultures for example, that result from poor public transit, become more dependent on oil and redeveloping the infrastructure. This dependence on oil leads to more urban sprawl, more traffic, and more wealth inequality as owning a car becomes a de facto necessary tax to participate in society. As a country becomes more dependent on oil, its interests become more intertwined with that dependence, and populations can't make clear minded decisions regarding geopolitical events such as wars, because they are directly affected by the resulting fluctuating gas prices which in turn results in poor foreign policy incentives for democracies. Ironically, these interests start to appeal to ""energy independence"", when in reality it is mostly corrupt, theocratic, and plutocratic countries that benefit from reliance on oil and get to set its prices, while greener technologies don't provide a profit to the local barons, but are truly accessible by anyone with the proper infrastructure.

In short, I think we never see past the short term economic gain, but time and time again we see countries fall to the greed brought on by ""black gold"" and it makes everything worse, from inequality, to quality of life, to having a habitable planet."

The main arguments I hear is 'if you don't want a baby, don't have sex'. And I think this argument is low quality exactly like that told to women. Men can get raped. Women can also take a mans sperm in the condom in the trash can and get herself pregnant by herself. 

""Its your genetic material"" So is babies surrendered. 

I just don't get it. There would be less women wanting to keep the baby if men opted out. If I knew I wouldn't get money, why would I go through a year of pregnancy just for nothing? many women want children, but if they can't raise it properly, I would think, as a woman myself that they would think it's not a good deal. 

But honestly, I haven't heard ONE argument that doesn't apply to women. 

This post is mostly for pro choice people. Like if pro lifers say men can't opt out and abortion shouldn't happen... that's different. 

My stance is simple. Don't want a baby? Weather it's adoption or not, surrender it to the state. Either everyone gets to do it, or no oen

Due to the outsized revenue streams the football brings in to the top tier of schools, regional conferences have been torn apart and realigned in ways detrimental to the schools and athletes. Furthermore, the introduction of NIL deals have exposed the decreasingly amateur nature of the sport at the top levels. It becomes increasingly clear that the schools and athletes have little to gain from playing lower tier opponents where 50 point blowouts become the norm. So I want to propose a solution where college football, still operated by the NCAA, moves to a different system comprised of regional conferences feeding into a championship league. 

Most teams play around 12 games a year with 10 being conference games. If we have a champions league with 10 teams, that allows 9 regular games and a championship game along with out of league rivalry/warm up/etc. game. Those ten teams would feed in and out of 5 regional conferences that were essentially the old power 5 conferences. Those would also have some level of relegation/promotion with even more local conferences. I wont address those here but will say there needs to be a way for a school like JMU to overtake a school like Syracuse to take an ACC example. 

So let's start with the top of the organization. Each regional league conference would send two representatives to the champions league. Imagine Alabama, Georgia, FSU, Clemson, Michigan, OSU, Washington, Oregon, Texas, and Oklahoma in a league with everyone else playing more locally. In a given season, the two representative teams would play twice and the loser gets relegated while the winner stays (method of relegation is moot), so five out and five in (champions of regional league conferences). While a champions league run would be tough on the schools and players, the financial benefit would be significant. Also, this limits the number of teams making cross country trips while maximizing the opportunity for top players. While this might intensify the hold that top programs have on the top of the league, it allows any program to fairly compete for the championship based on record (looking at you college football playoff committee). 

In the context of the regional league conferences there might be some reasonable sorting which would minimize travel. Perhaps moving FSU into the SEC equivalent, Maryland back to ACC, etc. to create competitive conferences while maximizing student well being. Additionally, I think this would actually grow the interest in watching the sport and improve TV ratings/ticket sales. Playing for promotion or to avoid relegation is very compelling in English soccer. It also represents a tangible goal  over the long term as opposed to a relatively meaningless bowl game. 

The major problem I see is that there might be objection by schools like Vanderbilt who benefit massively by being in the SEC but their football team is perennially beaten down while they do great in other sports. 

My view can be changed based on whether its a sustainable model, its objectively worse than the current model, or other structural issues I'm not thinking about. Details like who will align in what conference are somewhat unconvincing. Most of those issues can be easily overcome. 

Anyways, I hope to have some good discussion"

First off, low hanging fruit is always going to be taken quickly so the stuff at the beginning is going to be done faster. Anything that comes after that is built upon those fundamentals which necessitates mastery of those fundamentals. How can that be exponential if you spend x time for low hanging building blocks and y time for what comes after?

Secondly, humans only do stuff so fast. Just because there are more avenues to go down doesn't mean anything because a human can only do so much. Giving humans tools like computers can certainly increase productivity but even that has limits as a human can still only do so much regardless of how fast they can receive data.

Theaters around me offer both English Subtitled and English Dubbed versions of the film, so I have to pick which one to see. When it comes to animated films, I've always preferred Dubs rather than Subs. I know that both versions feature an imperfect translation. 

As opposed to live action, the Japanese and English voice actors are on more equal footing when it comes to using only their voice to bring a character to life. I guess the Japanese actor has the advantage of being able to take direction from the Director personally as well as has a better understanding of how the Director envisioned the character would emote because they share a common language and culture.

However, with the English Dub I get to immerse myself more fully in the film so I can focus on the amination and the action, rather than reading subtitles. I also sometimes have fun being able to watch the film and recognize familiar voices of English-speaking actors that I know.

I know there are people that feel strongly about ""subs not dubs."" Is it just feeling differently about the trade offs I mentioned? If so, are there particular instances in Ghibli films where seeing the original Japanese version really changed how you experienced a film/scene? Are there other aspects that I haven't considered?"

Israeli people are indigenous to the land and fully have the rights to defend themselves, no matter what the consequences are. I think that’s basic humanity, to allow people to resist the forces that want their entire existence erased. 

People are also saying it’s a genocide and I don’t agree with that either, because saying that is basically disagreeing with the fact that Israel has to defend itself, and in a way it’s anti-semitic. Israel has never done anything to palestine like what happened on October 7th so it’s fully justified what they’re doing and I’m getting kind of disheartened to see less and less support for Israel. It’s kind of sad to see so many people being brainwashed to believe that defending oneself is not okay. Anyway, I do want to hear other opinions and perspectives so it makes sense to me."

The payment processor facilitated the fraud. The credit card company developed a method of making payments in mere seconds, and charge merchants worldwide a percentage for every single transaction. This profit margin should serve as insurance to protect the customers. 

A bad actor takes advantage of their easily abused system, and the merchant is at fault despite funding the entire operation via commissions?    Yes, im sure somewhere in the clauses is an agreement signed by merchants that they are responsible, yet it becomes an issue of monopoly where no one really has a choice, theres 3 major credit card companies : Visa, mastercard and amex. If you reject these, you become irrelevant and no one will buy from you.  So you must agree to the unfair conditions or be crushed by competitors.

It should be entirely illegal for a credit card company or online payment platform to forcefully withdraw funds from you.   If you are responsible for fraud, the government should handle the case. Banks should not have the final say without your conscent. "
1,2023-12-20,CMV: It's a serious red flag if a man has no female friends,u/Plastic-Abroc67a8282,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18n4krw/cmv_its_a_serious_red_flag_if_a_man_has_no_female/,changemyview,"  
If a man has no female friends, that means that out of all the women he has met in his life, he has never been able to have a single healthy, long-lasting friendship with any of them. So unless he spent his whole life in a monastery, a man who can't become friends with women either A) has such lackluster social skills that he can't manage it, or B) simply doesn't view a relationship with a woman as worthwhile unless it has a sexual gratification component.    


Someone who is only capable of viewing women as sexual objects, someone who does not see friendships with women as having equal value as friendships with men, that is someone who likely cannot maintain a long-term healthy romantic relationship with a woman either - because he will never respect her as an equal or as a person outside of his sexual attraction, and when that sexual attraction fades, he will lose respect for her and stop treating her well. There is no safety or long-term stability in a relationship with a man who only cares about you to the extent that it gets him off.

I think therefore that when vetting a man for short or long term companionship, lack of female friends is a huge red flag that indicates the person is either immature, or a misogynist in wait."
1,2023-12-20,CMV: The current housing market (US) is more of a panic/bubble/transient phenomena rather than based on economic trends.,u/SiliconDiver,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18n4npz/cmv_the_current_housing_market_us_is_more_of_a/,changemyview,"Caveat: Housing and all economic markets are *very* complicated.  I understand this.  I'm actually largely posting this so I can learn and understand things that are beyond my understanding.

Basic Premise: The housing market, like all markets operate on a supply/demand model.  As a California resident I will be using the Californa housing market as my case study.  Over the past decade, and predicted future trends *should* indicate housing cost going down, rather than increasing.  

 - Over the past ~10 years (Jan 2014) , the US (and California) have constructed more housing than the population has increased.  This is even when you factor in decreased construction during the financial crisis
  - The US overall has constructed in the ballpark of 12 million new houses in the past 10 years [citation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOUST)
   - US population has grown by 17 million over the same time period. [citation](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/population)
  - California has constructed around 1 million new homes in the past 10 years.
   - California population has grown by about 400k in the past 10 years. [citation](https://www.macrotrends.net/states/california/population)
- Demographic trends predict immediate population decline in the US and California
   - The US is predicted to have declining population [within a few decades](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/population-projections.html) 
   - California has already dropped in population the past 3 years straight[citation](https://www.macrotrends.net/states/california/population)
- Home and rental vacancy rates have remained relatively static.  The market isn't being driven up by ""investors"" hoarding property and leaving them vacant
  - California has the lowest vacancy rates in the country, and sit at the lowest in the past 40 years. [Home vacancy citation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CAHVAC) [Rental vacancy citation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CARVAC)
  - US vacancy rates also are among their lowest in the past 40 years [Home vacancy citation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USHVAC) [Rental vacancy citation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RRVRUSQ156N) 
 - Despite the above, housing prices have spiked in price:
  - California housing price index has doubled in 10 years [sl fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CASTHPI)
  - US housing price index has also doubled in the last 10 years [sl fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPINSA)
- Houses are fundamentally unaffordable (looking at California here) This is clearly unsustainable.
 - The median Single family home in Los Angeles is $1 million.  The Median income in Los Angeles is $30k.  Who is buying these houses? This is clearly unsustainable and the prices can't continue.  As more supply exists, and people leave the state/die, new people *have* to be entering the market.  There isn't a monopoly on the housing market just for people ""already in the market"".  Rationally the bottom has to fall out.

Potential counter-arguments: 
 - Housing demand is outpacing population growth because we are changing into a society that gets married later, and an increasing amount of the population lives alone.
   - I'd agree with this somewhat,  Its difficult to say to say which way this relationship works.  Are people living alone because this is now a commonly affordable luxury? Or are people choosing to live alone despite the skyrocketing costs that it drives, which seems to defy economic/rational reason.   If we can establish a strong/causal relationship here, I'll grant a delta.
 - There are other factors at play, eg Prop 8 in California
  - Totally agree, I think policies like this cause inefficiencies in the market that can drive up prices. I just don't understand how price goes up over a 10 year period in which supply outpaced projected demand.  If you can prove this relationship I'd grant a delta
 - The market can remain irrational for longer than you can remain solvent (Or in this case longer than you can afford to wait out buying a home).
   - I agree, but I don't think that necessarily refutes the idea that the market is an irrational bubble.
 - Housing supply was so desperately constrained in the 90s and 2000s, that we are just now suffering from that backlog of constrained supply even with increased construction. 
   - This is interesting,  I'd like to understand how it takes 20-40 years of low supply to effect price, especially when the opposite trends are true today.  Why wasn't there a housing shortage/crisis to this degree in the 90s?
 - *location location location* People just can't afford housing where they want to be, HCOL areas are getting more expensive, and LCOL areas are being abandoned.
  - Maybe? But We are seeing housing prices increase even in non-desirable areas.  Again staying on my California example, its not just SF, SD and LA increasing in Price, Its Fresno, Bakersfield,  Blythe etc.  

TLDR, There is an aging, declining population and new housing supply has outpaced population increase over the last decade.  Current spiking housing prices are driven more by panic, fear and speculation than a rational prediction of macro-economic trends."

47,2023-12-20,CMV: The American Right Should Support Voting and Election Reform,u/Kcue6382nevy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18n7jlu/cmv_the_american_right_should_support_voting_and/,changemyview,"In the United States, dissatisfaction with the two-party system is evident not just on a political level but also on a geographical one. Republican and Right-Wing voters in blue states, such as California, often find themselves underrepresented, if not outright ignored, in the political landscape no different to the attention given to Democrat and Left-Wing voters in red states like Texas. This imbalance in representation underscores the urgency for a more inclusive electoral system that ensures fair representation for all citizens, irrespective of their state's political leanings.

Conservatives, like their counterparts across the political spectrum, encompass a rich tapestry of views, beliefs, and ideologies. Their diversity parallels that found among leftists, moderates, and centrists.

Recognizing this diversity is crucial to understanding the need for a more inclusive voting system. An electoral framework accommodating more than two parties would not only serve the interests of the Right but also those of all citizens. Allowing multiple candidate and party options to thrive and gain representation in Congress or Assembly is a democratic imperative that benefits everyone.

Additionally, the American Right's historical underestimation in the past decades of the threats to democracy, especially during the Trump administration, poses a risk not just to the nation but also to the world. Failing to address the flaws and rot of democratic principles across the US and allowing the influence of establishment and corporate interests to dominate politics jeopardizes the well-being of our planet and diminishes the quality of life for American individuals across the political spectrum, including hard-working Right-leaning individuals.

Advocating for reform in the electoral college, districting and voting access should be a priority for conservatives. The current system doesn’t always accurately reflect the varied voices and values within conservative circles not unlike Left leaning ones, often leaving segments of the population underrepresented in Congress.

This isn’t about favoring one ideology over another. it’s about ensuring that every voice counts and that the halls of Congress reflect the tapestry of beliefs held by the American people.

Ultimately, the impact of voting and active participation in shaping policies cannot be understated. By neglecting the significance of active involvement in the democratic process, all citizens, regardless of their political affiliation, risk losing their voice in decisions that affect their lives. The call for vote and election reform should transcend political lines—it’s a call for fairness, representation, and a stronger democratic foundation upon which the nation can thrive."
34,2023-12-20,CMV: Appeal to authority is not a logically coherent way of changing someone's view.,u/Eastern-Parfait6852,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18n7n6m/cmv_appeal_to_authority_is_not_a_logically/,changemyview,"I truly believe that trying to change someone's viewpoint by arguing the authority of the proponents is not a logically coherent way to change someone's view.  I acknowledge in reality the credibility of someone creates a presumption.  

But the credibility of a party putting forth a position does not logically support the position.  

I understand not wanting to listen to racists and bigots.  That's not my contention.  My contention is a position does not become invalid based on credentials of the party propounding it.

That would lead to absurdities like 1+1 = 2 is now false cause Trump said it and Trump is a known liar.

It would mean not only could respected authorities contribute to the credibility of a position, but that disrespected parties could take away from the credibility of a position by propounding it.

If I took issue for example with police beating a black man, and you contested it, I would argue the police is more authoritative than you, a random redditor.   Is that a correct way to change someone's view?

Suppose we take a view like ""the earth is flat""

This is the type of argument Im saying is invalid.  

""If you think the earth is flat, you're stupid.  every scientist in the world says otherwise.  Only bigots, rightwingers and idiots like you say the earth is flat and thats why you're wrong.""

This is an appeal to authority that the scientists know better.  I want to be clear, the scientists do in fact know better-that is not being contested.  The issue is not who knows best, but rather saying that an argument is invalid because someone else who knows better says so, is not a logically coherent way.   What matters are the actual merits of the argument. For example, instead of saying ""scientists know best"", a logically coherent argument would be to point out that if the world were flat  it would mean flights in the southern hemisphere would take far longer than what has been observed.

I am honestly willing to change my view on this.  Because if enough ppl say so, then with respect to changing someones view, it is perhaps correct, and I will start defending positions based on who carries more weight.

But I contend if that is so, it may result in positions like this.  Joe Biden supports Netenyahu.  Both are heads of state.  Who are we to argue they are wrong?   Joe biden has done more to advance social justice than you EVER will, and thats why you're wrong.

Edit:  Clarification.

I want to make clear that this issue of this CMV is that ""Appeal to Authority"" is a logical fallacy.

""appeal to authority"" is the name of the logical fallacy, like ""Ad hominem"" is a logical fallacy, or ""inverse"" and ""converse"" 


An example of ""Appeal to authority"" would be:

""Global warming is true because Greta Thunberg advocates for it.""

Whether or not Greta Thunberg is an authority is not the issue.  What makes this an ""appeal to authority"" is that I am relying her reputation or credibilty to support my argument.  The logical fallacy is in the reliance on someone's reputation as logical support.   

A reputation is not logical support.   In other words, whether or not global warming is true is not dependent on Greta Thunberg's reputation.

Too many people are arguing that I picked bad authority figures.  That's not the subject of the CMV.  The subject of the cmv is relying upon people to support arguments.  

Now Im going to use an appeal to authority.  Ready?

""You're all wrong because literally all of math and philosophy for 2000 years shows that appeal to authority is a logical fallacy.  There is a reason why appeal to authority is a literal logical fallacy.  EDUCATE YOURSELF.""

That is a logical fallacy because I didnt prove anything.  2000 years of math and philosophy may well be authoritative.  But the argument is logically fallacious because I didnt support the argument by arguing it's merits but argued for it by appealing to some authority.

In this case ""2000 years of math"" is the authorirty, and my appeal to authority is using the authoritativeness of that to support my argument instead of arguing the argument.

They might be academically lacking, but every single successful person i know wasn’t academically successful (except for doctors and engineers). 

The reason i think that is that in the corporate world, the traits that i listed above are really the most important. If you manage to get your feet through the door, no one gives a shit about your academics, where you went to university etc. you can just work your way up the corporate ladder by charming bosses and leading groups with their natural confidence. If you were the popular kid in high school, you must have the traits that allow you to become the popular person almost any where, which is usually the most important thing as life is just a glorified popularity contest. 

I definitely don’t believe that all popular high school kids become successful. Many end up in jails, drug addicts or unemployed. However, i do believe that if they work hard after high school, they are much more likely to reach success than other students who weren’t as popular, even if they work just as hard harder.

I also don’t believe that you cant become successful if you weren’t popular in high school. You could have all the above traits without being the most popular in high school. You can also become successful without these traits if you are intelligent and hard working enough, it will just be inevitably harder."

As many of us know men are much more visually stimulated than women are on average which is why they look at pornography at a much higher rate and request explicit photos from the opposite far more often. Men are primarily attracted to physical appearance and beauty and when you have a system in which you create an app that's all based on photos that's going to cater a lot more to men's attraction impulses than women. Women on the other hand don't prioritize looks and strongly as men. Obviously being physically attractive as a guy still helps a lot. But women typically need to get a feel for the person before they develop attraction to the opposite sex such as is he charming, can he make me laugh, what are his hobbies, does he make me feel safe and secure and so on. These qualities you can't display just by scrolling through pictures on an app. So therefore women are going to be much less likely to give the right swipe or whichever it is to solidify that they are interested while men it's going to be the complete opposite because as mentioned earlier men are primarily attracted to looks first. I mean look at Instagram, if you're an attractive female you can garner way more attention and followers from the opposite sex than a male of the same attractiveness levels and they've done studies on this. Instagram just like all the dating apps are primarily focused on PICTURES which caters to men's visual impulses.

 So I don't think dating apps are a good way for men to find someone personally. Unless you're like exceptionally attractive as a man like Henry cavil. You're going to have very little to no luck. Not because that men are super bad at taking photos and what not. It's just not the primary thing that most females will be attracted too. Men can get off looking at pictures while women typically can't."

I don’t know about you, but I don’t for a second believe that there wouldn’t be “GEORGE BUSH DOESN’T CARE ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE” moment from the Left with all the attendant accusations and implications that come with it too. There would be very “thought-provoking” op-ed pieces in the New York Times from a black person from Baltimore talking about how they’ve been used, mistreated and colonized by the white men of the Republican Party. There would be a list of tangentially related racist incidents from Maryland’s history brought up as a proof of the long history of Republican culpability in this “malicious indifference” during a segment on NPR. Which would in turn be used as a metaphor for broader “white complicity” with the oppression of black folks. Etc. etc.

Well now then it’s a horse of a different color and there’s all sorts of throat clearing and equivocations from those on the political Left as to the reasons why. Because *they’re* the good guys who actually care about minority rights. Don’t believe me? Take a look at Jackson Mississippi and their recent water problems. Now you’d be forgiven for thinking this was just racist white republicans that don’t care about black people’s health if you followed the news. Because most Mississippi politicians on the Left know exactly who to blame for the water crisis, Mississippi republicans. Their lack of action and their criminal negligence is just part and parcel of the America we live in right? Hell there’s even a page on it on the NAACP’s website.

Until you look at the history of Jackson city mayors that is.

From 1977-till present day the people of Jackson have elected Democratic mayors. The city has been run by democratic administrators. This problem has been building up right beneath the voters and the city officials noses but now that all the chickens have come home to roost it suddenly becomes the white man’s fault?

My process is: I eat a bit too much that my stomach feels full. Sometimes it’s not even that, sometimes I just eat something unhealthy, too sweet or oily. Then I decide I will go throw up. Then im like, well since im gonna go throw up soon, may as well indulge myself. No restrictions, just eat like it’s your last day on earth, whatever you want. Then I go throw it all up. Repeat the next day

I’m 60kg and fairly slim compared to other girls. I used to be kinda chubby growing up and became skinny a few years ago. It was the best thing that’s ever happened to me. People started being nicer to me, calling me beautiful, respecting me more. Pretty privilege really is such a powerful thing. And I’m not going back to being chubby. That’s simply not happening

So when I eat something bad, it triggers something in me like “I need to get this out of my system”. When then triggers a “alright fuck it let’s eat everything”

There’s also something nice about throwing up; you feel relieved. That plus the fact that there’s no “food guilt” is why I’m not sad I have bulimia 

But I know this is fucked up so please CMV

Edit: I just read some bulimia posts on this sub with everyone replying “that’s not healthy” over and over. I want to know WHY

Edit2: also it gets really bad when I don’t have time to exercise which is my preferred way of burning it off but a lot of the times (I’m a student) I simply don’t have time"
1,2023-12-20,CMV: Christianity is a cult!,u/DIEEEEEEEEeEeeee3,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18nadbp/cmv_christianity_is_a_cult/,changemyview,"To confirm that Christianity is a cult we must first know what a cult is. A cult is ""a system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or object"" according to google. Doesn't that sound familiar? Oh right! God. But there's another definition for what a cult is, I wonder if it fits that one too. The second definition for what a cult is is ""a relatively small group of people having religious beliefs or practices regarded by others as strange or sinister"", it doesn't exactly fit that group because Christianity is widely popular with millions practicing it, but it sure is fucking sinister. Take hell for example, apparently if you don't worship God you'll get thrown into a lake of fire. Doesn't that sound fucked up? Or are you so desensitized to it that it doesn't even bother you anymore."

However, I don't have full certainty of this. 

I think my level of certainty fluctuates between 51% (God existing and not existing are equiprobable, but the former is more likely) and 80% (pretty much certain, but never more certain than how certain I am that I'm not hallucinating right now).

If my level of certainty ever dropped below 50%, I'd reconsider worshipping God the way I do (praying, reading the Bible, going to church, singing songs to God, preaching, etc). However, until that happens, I apply Pascal's wager and believe the most RATIONAL thing I can do is to worship God. Of course, it'd be useless if he turns out not to exist, but if he does, then it'd be immeasurably stupid to risk eternal eternal torture by failing to worship him.

I've held to this epistemology for a long time before I realized the following: many atheists/agnostics I've asked seem to think that if God turned out to exist, but was evil (according to their judgment), they wouldn't worship him. 

But when it comes to me, I would worship any god who offers eternal rewards or threatens eternal punishment. The only reason I see to NOT worship God is if he doesn't exist. But if he exists, then the rational thing is to worship him, because the alternative is eternal torture.

To make an analogy, if a robber holds a gun to your face, I see no reason NOT to give him what he wants. Sure, you'll lose something that could be valuable, but if he doesn't he'll shoot you.

Here are some responses I anticipate:

- ""I wouldn't worship God. Instead, I'd denounce him.""
- What would be the purpose of this? Who would be the recipient of this denouncement? Think about it. Who would/could possibly punish the Most High? Nobody can stop him. If he's evil, insane, or even just apathetic to human suffering, there'd be no use in opposing him or attempting to convince him.

- ""The moral thing to do is to refuse to worship him""
- Right, but what would you gain from this? You are going to be tortured forever for opposing him anyway, and you will help nobody, because they will be tortured forever too.

- ""I would rather be tortured forever than live in heaven with God, because I wouldn't stand to live with such an immoral monster""
- Why would you give up on eternal happiness and subject yourself to eternal pain when this will not increase justice or morality anywhere in the universe?

- ""There's no way for sure to believe God will NOT torture you forever if you worship him. If he's capable of evil, he could be lying and torture you anyway even if you worship him"".
Yes, but at least you can *try*, the odds are infinitely better. To go back to the robber analogy, when someone's pointing a gun to your face, there's a possibility the gun could be fake, or the robber could be having fun with threatening you and will shoot you anyway after getting what he wants. However, it's still in your best interests, best odds, and the smart thing to do, to give the robber what he wants.

DISCLAIMER: I *DON'T* believe God is or can be evil, or that the ""eternal punishment"" described in the Bible consists in eternal, conscious torment (Google ""annihilationism"" to get a good idea of what my interpretation is). However, for the sake of this argument, I'm assuming (1) God could be evil, and (2) he threatens with eternal torture."

What I see is in fact the exact opposite where they had pretty damn bad economic woes compared to everyone since. 

Baby boomers - generally defined as the generation born between 1946 and 1964 - entered the workforce in their late teens early 20s. So that would be roughly 1964-1986. 

So that puts them having dealt with the brunt of the 1967 race riots, the Vietnam war, the 1973-1975 recession, the 1973 oil crisis, the 1978 oil crisis, stagflation, and the 1980-1983 recession - a decade of pretty awful economic woes. That was just a decade and a half of drudgery. Not great. Even if they are younger boomers and got the good Reagan years at the start of their time in the workforce... same applies to Gen X who benefited more from that and has been doing economically better. 

The economic crises since then - except COVID - have also predominantly been affecting older people. The early 2000 recession didnt have that much of an effect on unemployment rates and the like, but seems to have mainly just wiped out investments in the tech sector. The Great Recession, that wiped out retirement plans but was actually some of the greatest economic conditions in US history if you were a young person - military bonuses were through the roof for Iraq and the Bakken oil boom was a killing too.

This writer thinks that there was no another way God could have devised to save humanity. I grant that the atonement was not absolutely necessary in that God was under no necessity to redeem fallen humanity, he chose to do so freely, as God is entirely free. But I think that, given the divine decision to redeem humanity, the incarnation and atonement was necessary. Here is one of the few places I find myself in disagreement with writers like St. Augustine and St. Thomas. In contrast to them, almost all ancient and medieval accounts of the incarnation that I'm aware of (e.g., Irenaeus, Athanasius, Gregory of Nyssa, Anselm, and many more examples), though diverse, all had it such that the incarnation was necessary *if* God freely chose to save us. Here I wish to give some models while arguing that salvation requires that God become human.

Definitions of terms:

* God: the greatest being possible. Being the greatest being possible would mean that God has great-making properties (e.g., mercy and justice) to the maximum possible extent.
* Omniscience: just like with omnipotence, where God can only perform the logically possible and not the logically impossible (for example, God can’t create a married bachelor), omniscience means that *God knows whatever is logically possible for Him to know*.
* Omnipotence: the ability to do anything logically possible. This understanding rules out God being able to do the logically impossible, such as acting contrary to his nature or making someone freely do something. Logical contradictions don't describe a state of affairs in any possible world. They literally describe 'no thing'. So, God can still do anything on this view.
* Justice: positive retributive justice, whereby I mean to give each their due.
* Libertarian free will: the ability to choose between A and not-A. On this type of free will, God logically cannot control or determine our free actions.

# (1) God had to become human if he were to correct wrongs that only he can correct but only humans are obliged to correct.

Wronging or sinning against an infinite God is a wrong of infinite severity. This is because the severity of any wrong action or sin goes up when the ontological status of the entity wronged goes up, when all other things are equal. Wronging a non-human animal is worse than wronging a plant, while wronging a human is worse than wronging a non-human animal, when all other things are equal. Since God has infinite ontological or moral status, the severity of wrong or sin against Him is infinite. Only God could correct such a wrong, but justice demands that only humans correct it. Thus, if humans are to be forgiven, it’s necessary that God become human to correct the wrong for us. The thought process is thus this: (1) Only humans ought. (2) Only God can. (3) Only a God-man both ought and can.

This argument can be run in other ways too aside from ontological status of the being wronged or sinned against. An example of this is St. John Chrysostom: “But you know that offences are also judged by the quality of the persons: for instance, he who insulted a private person has done wrong, but not so much as he who has insulted a magistrate, and he who has offended a greater magistrate offends in a higher degree, and he who offends an inferior one in a lower degree. But he who insults the King offends much more. The injury indeed is the same, but it becomes greater by the excellence of the person. And if he who insults a king receives intolerable punishment on account of the superiority of the person, for how many talents will he be answerable who insults God?” - St. John Chrysostom, *Homily 1 on Philemon 1-3*.

These principles however only apply when all other moral considerations are equal. Let's say someone steals five dollars from their friend, and another person tortures an animal, per the view via ontological stratus. The Status Principle does not imply that stealing the five dollars is worse, because all other things are not equal. Other moral considerations come into play to determine which is worse.

&#x200B;

* **Objection #1: God cannot be harmed, and so cannot be wronged.**

Even if God can't be harmed in any real sense, there’s no good reason to think that harm is the only norm of what is ""wrong."" Being a closet diehard racist is wrong even if they never happen to cause harm to others. Or my wife could wrong me if she cheated on me, even if I never found out and was not harmed by her action. Another example: you might wrong me by frustrating goals. So likewise, you can wrong God by frustrating his goal to unite all humans to him, say, by being a hypocritical Christian that leads others to reject the gospel. So even if God can't be harmed, why think the discussion of wronging Him stops there? Why think that all harms and wrongs, and that all harms are wrongs?

I typically think of harming as a species of wronging. But then, only some instances of harming are wronging. I think incarcerating someone typically harms someone, and yet I think it is not wronging them if he is justly sentenced for a crime he committed. We might say that it isn’t harming, but unjustified harming that wrongs someone. But then that new term, ""unjustified,"" is itself a moral notion, and so is no good for attempting to give an account of what wronging is. So, to my mind, not all harms are wrongs, not all wrongs are harms, and the qualifications you need to make to harming (unjustified) end up making the account circular (to wrong is to harm in a wrong way). Given that, I’m reticent to form a solely harm-based account of wrong.

&#x200B;

* **Objection #2: The severity of the offense committed also depends on the moral status of the one who committed it. So, wrong by an animal is not as morally weighty as wrong by a human, all other things being equal. The severity of the wrong goes up when the ontological status of the being who sinned goes up. And so since the sinner in this case is not infinite (human beings), it stands to reason that the punishment is not infinite or incommensurable.**

The reasoning of this objection doesn’t work. Anything plus or times infinity is infinity. And so, if I were a, say, 6 on the ontological-status-meter, that plus or times infinity would still max out my blameworthiness. The same holds if I’m only a .004 on the ontological-status-meter. In short, the mitigation due to my ontological status will not render my culpability to less than infinity in light of wronging an infinite being. The same holds true for the conception of sins against a being than which none greater can be conceived.

&#x200B;

* **Objection #3: God must do something in order to forgive. This limits God.**

This objection ignores the fact that the necessity of the atonement lays in God's nature rather than only His will. This ""limitation"" (which is debatable to begin with) is not imposed by something beyond Himself. God not being able to let wrongdoing go unpunished no more limits God than Him not being able to lie (2 Timothy 2:13). God as Judge can't act in a way that is not consistent with His nature. Once again, omnipotence does not include bringing about logical contradictions.

&#x200B;

* **Objection #4: God the Son became a man and died in our place in order to save us from God the Father.**

Yet it's a strawman to say that we are saved from God. Rather, we are saved from the just consequences of our sin. If you are a criminal guilty of serious crime, and you get a pardon from that government, is it better to say that the government pardoned you from the just consequences of your wrongdoing, or that the government pardoned you from the government? At best one can say that we are saved from God's wrath. But God's wrath is not a part of His nature. It is consequent upon human wrongdoing.

&#x200B;

* **Objection #5: Doing goods has infinite significance, and so offsets infinite wrongs, at least if one does more or an equal amount of good in comparison to bad.**

Doing good does not nullify infinite wrongs. Even if you do the speed limit most of the time, a cop would be just in issuing you a ticket if he caught you violating the speed limit. Sure, they could show mercy, but then the cop is relaxing justice, and God can't relax an attribute essential to His nature. It also strikes me that there is an asymmetry in the case of blameworthy offense and praiseworthy action with respect to those we bear special relations to, like our parents and God. So even prima facie, good actions cannot outweigh bad ones, for we already owe God obedience in our behavior.

&#x200B;

* **Objection #6: The view that the punishment must be infinite in Hell, because the sin is infinite (offence to God's holiness) ends up in a contradiction it seems. For Hell can never produce an infinite punishment, it will always be finitude upon finitude. It seems God's justice will never be satisfied here.**

Yes, the damned will never have a time at which they can rightfully claim: “that’s it, God; I’ve paid back, full and entire, the debt I owed. Now it is only fair that you let me out.” In other words, for those who affirm an eternal hell, this inability to fully pay back the debt seems more a perk of the view than a worry. If the worry isn’t so much the inability for the damned to satisfy the debt, but instead the fact that God’s justice will never be fulfilled, we might distinguish senses of fulfilling a virtue. Perhaps absolutely considered, God’s justice will never be fully satisfied, in the sense that God can never say “what my justice demands has now been fully met.” But there’s another sense in which it is satisfied. For it would be unreasonable for God to expect that which is impossible. And as you point out, it is impossible for incremental payback to yield infinite payment. So what I called justice absolutely considered is impossible. So it would be unreasonable for God to demand or even desire the logically impossible. Instead, he gets perpetually repayment to the level that the person can repay. No more could be reasonably asked for.

""If ... the heavenly kingdom be made up of men, and this cannot be effected unless the aforesaid satisfaction be made, which none but God can make and none but man ought to make, it is necessary for the God‑man to make it."" - Anselm of Canterbury, *Cur Deus Homo*, 2.6.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# (2) God had to become human if he were to save us from the just consequences of our wrongdoing.

The key point here is that God can't forgive people in a way that is contrary to his just nature. Yet all have transgressed God's law in various ways and are guilty in various ways. Sure, there are some better than others. But being better than others does not necessarily make one \*good enough\*. But how can God as Judge forgive guilty people and remove their liability to justice \*while remaining all just\*? Sure, a judge has the power to not convict a criminal, but they would no longer be just. And God can't relax any of his immutable moral attributes that are essential to his nature, he must be fully just and fully merciful at once in response to human wrongdoing. Traditionally omnipotence doesn’t include bringing about logical contradictions so even God wouldn’t be able to relax justice or mercy while still being fully just or fully merciful. Mercy seems a relaxation of justice, and justice a refusal of mercy. There is a tension with God being both a fully just Judge and fully merciful Father at the same time in light of human sin. God solves this dilemma on the cross. Full justice is fulfilled: sin is punished through an infinite being (thus having infinite merit), but mercy is also enacted. The solution is for God to give \*us\* the mercy and \*himself\* the justice.

**Objection #1: It is not just for an innocent person to be punished for the sins of others.**

This argument has many assumptions which are not defended but required for the argument to work. First, most people don't realize that only negative retributive justice holds it to be wrong to punish someone who is innocent. Since there are other views of justice this objection can't even lift itself off the ground without independent argument for negative retributive justice.

Second the argument will need to get contextualized in some metaethical view. Not all metaethical views will make it be immoral for God to not be a negative retributive judge even if negative retributive justice is correct for us. One will need to find a metaethical view where God would need to be a negative retributive judge and defend that view, or defend that negative retributive justice is an essential attribute of God's nature.

Next there is the assumption that there are no weightier moral considerations that override the prima facie demands of negative retributive justice. Even among those who hold to retributive justice there are many that recognize such overriding considerations may waiver the demands of retributive justice. In this case the salvation of world could serve as such a weightier moral consideration. Even the staunchest of retributivists like Michael Moore agree that the demands of retributive justice are prima facie demands that can be overridden in specific cases:

>“A 'threshold' deontologist refuses to violate a categorical norm of morality until not doing so produces sufficient bad consequences as to pass some threshold, then, he will override such categorical norms.” - Michael S. Moore, Placing Blame: A Theory of Criminal Law, p. 158, n. 13.

So, if one must punish a willing innocent for example, or else the world be totally destroyed (or lost!), it is permissible for that person to be punished, since consequentialism takes over. I think this makes sense and I don’t see a defeater to such a proposal.

Finally, there is the assumption that if a person isn't the one who commits the sin that they can't then be considered legally guilty for those sins. If our guilt was imputed onto the God-man, technically, he was extrinsically guilty, though intrinsically innocent. However, imputation of guilt is not necessary on this view.

&#x200B;

* **Objection #2: Guilt cannot be imputed or transferred.**

However, there are parallels in our human justice system that would allow the imputation of sins so that the God-man could fulfill justice for our sins without committing those sins. I introduce vicarious liability. Vicarious liability is when the liability for a crime committed is put on another who acts as a representative of the person that committed the crime. This representative can endure part of the deserved punishment or should they wish the full punishment. In the God-man's case he could have acted as our representative through vicarious liability in order to take part or the full punishment we deserve without violating negative retributive justice. Indeed, vicarious liability can even be another case of strict liability, where the someone (e.g., a superior) is held to be guilty \*without being found blameworthy,\* since no *mens rea* is required. Here is what this informative website says:

>""In criminal law, strict liability is liability for which mens rea (Latin for “guilty mind”) does not have to be proven in relation to one or more elements comprising the actus reus (Latin for “guilty act”) although intention, recklessness or knowledge may be required in relation to other elements of the offence. The liability is said to be strict because defendants will be convicted even though they were genuinely ignorant of one or more factors that made their acts or omissions criminal. The defendants may therefore not be culpable in any real way, i.e. there is not even criminal negligence, the least blameworthy level of mens rea."" [https://www.lawteacher.net/free-law-essays/criminal-law/strict-liability.php#:\~:text=In%20criminal%20law%2C%20strict%20liability%20is%20liability%20for,in%20relation%20to%20other%20elements%20of%20the%20offence](https://www.lawteacher.net/free-law-essays/criminal-law/strict-liability.php#:~:text=In%20criminal%20law%2C%20strict%20liability%20is%20liability%20for,in%20relation%20to%20other%20elements%20of%20the%20offence).

This is truly imputation of guilt. One needs to show that this parallel isn't analogous to the God-man's case in any relevant respect.

&#x200B;

* **Objection #3: The God-man did not suffer eternal hell.**

First, while the God-man's punishment and the revoking of the Father's blessings from Him was not infinite as to duration, intensity can more than make up for duration. Second, more importantly and more simply though, the God-man's blood has infinite merit. Thus, the God-man's suffering, though it lasted only a finite time, was infinite in merit and thus enough the compensate for the suffering of the damned. Third, even if the punishment is finite, people could continue to sin in hell, and so incur further punishment forever.

Keep in mind also that it's not about matching the hatred of hell, but more about fulfilling the justice and mercy of God at the same time in light of human sin. Perhaps the merit of the punishment doesn't even need to be exact.

&#x200B;

* **Objection #4: If I can forgive someone without any punishment and no violation of justice, why can't God.**

The problem with this argument is that it is based on construing God on the analogy of a private party involved in various personal relationships rather than as a Judge. Regular people are free to show mercy without being held to justice. By contrast a judge in many contexts has an obligation to do justice—at minimum upholding the rule of the law. Thus, legal philosopher Jeffrie Murphy notes that if the judge ""is moved, even by love or compassion, to act contrary to the rule of law—to the rules of justice—he acts wrongly” - Jeffrie Murphy, “Mercy and Legal Justice,” in Forgiveness and Mercy, ed. Jeffrie G. Murphy and Jean Hampton (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), pp. 175-76.

In short, God as Judge, the being who upholds the moral integrity of the universe, and the law itself cannot merely forgive without violating his all just nature. Indeed, without God upholding moral responsibility for wrong actions, we wouldn't live in a moral universe. But God can't just let everyone's just due fall upon them, elsewise He is not fully merciful. Thus comes the solution of God the Son taking the punishment Himself.

Further, it's different to say that sinful people should forgive other sinful people, over against a sinless entity forgiving sinful beings.

&#x200B;

* **Objection #5: The Bible already had a system of repentance with no substitute required.**

Penal Substitution merely shows how it is the case that an all-just God can forgive based on repentance without denying His own nature. Whenever someone is forgiven, it is on the basis of the cross.

&#x200B;

* **Objection #6: What about people before the coming of the God-man?**

Since God has revealed himself in nature and creation, one was able to turn to him before Jesus. If someone repented and turned to God before the God-man's coming, his atonement would be applied to them without their conscious knowledge of it. For them, waking up to heaven would be like receiving a will from a family member that you never met and knew about.

* **Objection #7: If the God-man takes the punishment due sinners, then all would be saved.**

The God-man's death potentially accomplished the redemption of all men, but for redemption to be actualized in each person, the gift must be freely accepted by that person. Like a pardon that has been issued by the government and yet refused by the criminal, the God-man's redeeming work remains inefficacious in the lives of those who freely reject Him. This explains why the God-man is the only way to salvation. If one doesn't accept the pardon (or more rightly, the gift), then one falls back on God's Justice.

&#x200B;

* **Objection #8: God the Son fulfilling God the Father's justice separates the Trinity.**

The God-man is not ontologically separated from the Father when he suffers the wrath of the Father. He is only separated from the Father in a sense, by standing in the place of sinners in which He subjected Himself to being seen as one who is guilty and thus dying. In that substitution, He was seen and treated as though He were guilty of sin even though He wasn’t.

“And Psalms 88 and 69, again speaking in the Lord’s own person, tell us further that He suffered these things, not for His own sake but for ours. ‘Thou has made Thy wrath to rest upon me,’ says the one; and the other adds, ‘I paid them things I never took.’ For He did not die as being Himself liable to death: He suffered for us, and bore in Himself the wrath that was the penalty of our transgression, even as Isaiah says, ‘Himself bore our weaknesses.’” - St. Athanasius, *Letter to Marcellinus*.

“He once more mediates as Man, the Reconciler and Mediator of God and men; and being our truly great and all-holy High Priest, by His own prayers He appeases the anger of His Father, sacrificing Himself for us. For He is the Sacrifice, and is Himself our Priest, Himself our Mediator, Himself a blameless Victim, the true Lamb Which taketh away the sin of the world.” - St. Cyril of Alexandria, *Commentary on John’s Gospel*, Book 11 Chapter 8.

# (3) God had to become human if he were to save us from Satan's grasp.

Adam and Eve, as well as man in general afterwards through sin, freely sold themselves to or at least aligned themselves with Satan. As such, Satan had a sort of legal right over mankind that we deserved through our sin, and God had to respect our free choice to align with Satan. Following most church fathers, if God were to take us out of Satan’s grasp, God was required to act in accordance with His Just nature. This means that God couldn’t have torn us from Satan’s grasp by divine fiat without ""leaving a complaint to him who enslaved man” (Gregory, *Catechetical Oration*, 22), and without violating the free choice humanity has made to align with or sell ourselves over to Satan. Plus, if God tore us from Satan by divine fiat, he would then be stooping to Satan's level, who tore us from God's grasp to begin with. Lastly, we deserved to be in Satan's grasp given our sin. So, God had to become human so that he could entice Satan in exchanging the human race for himself, which he did through his virtuous deeds and miracles, etc. In other words, God had to become human in order to entice Satan in seeing something more in Him than all of humanity combined, hence Satan's motivation to exchange humanity for God in human form. Given Satan's limited knowledge and his inability to understand divine love per his evil nature, he both underestimated the God-man's powers and did not know *why* God became human. Thinking he could gain victory over God, Satan exchanges humanity for the God-man, and uses his human minions to kill the God-man in order to destroy Him and regain humanity back into his grasp all at once. The God-man however then shows his divine nature which cannot be held by death by rising from the dead. Satan’s purchase over anyone is thus nullified, all at once.

* **Objection #1: Satan had no rights over humanity, just like kidnappers or terrorists have no right over their victims, with bargains being made to such people only out of necessity not due to any form of Justice.**

Yet these examples don't work because the victims of kidnappers and terrorists do not freely choose their kidnapping or hostage, nor do they freely align themselves with the perpetrators as Ransom says humans did with Satan. ""After we had thus freely sold ourselves to the deceiver, He who of His goodness sought to restore us to liberty could not, because He was just too, for this end have recourse to measures of arbitrary violence. It was necessary therefore that a ransom should be paid, which should exceed in value that which was to be ransomed; and hence it was necessary that the Son of God should surrender Himself to the power of death. God's justice then impelled Him to choose a method of exchange, as His wisdom was seen in executing it"" - Gregory of Nyssa, *Catechetical Oration*, 22-23.

&#x200B;

* **Objection #2: God lies to Satan, which is contrary to God's nature.**

This view also does not necessarily entail that God actively lied to Satan. It seems misguided to speak of God necessarily deceiving Satan just because God concealed information and because Satan was self-deceived on this matter due to his blindness to divine love. Wrongful deception in this case involves concealing from someone a truth when they have a right to it. It seems absurd to suppose that Satan for example deserved to know that the God-man's death would not be permanent. Satan just made a miscalculation, for example by underestimating the God-man's power, and is not a matter of God deceiving Satan. Think of a bully that miscalculated the resources of their victim. What possible circumstance might require the victim to point out to the bully the resources or abilities that said victim might have to protect themselves?

&#x200B;

* **Objection #3: God could have just not created Satan, since he foreknew his fall and all of the evil that he would cause.**

However, However, on certain doctrines of God's foreknowledge, God knew Satan fell \*because\* He perceived it, not the other way around. So, God can't use perfect knowledge to not create Satan, for then he is falsifying such knowledge, which is a logical contradiction. Keep in mind that historically, Christianity has always defined omnipotence as the ability to do anything logically possible. This understanding rules out God being able to do the logically impossible, such as acting contrary to his nature. Likewise, God only knows what is logically possible for him to know. On simple foreknowledge, God has only two logical steps of knowledge, distinct from Molinism, which has three. This view lacks middle knowledge, which is taken to be logically impossible for God to possess. The logical order of God's knowledge on this view has the divine decree logically posterior to His natural knowledge (of what could happen) but is logically prior to God's free knowledge (of what will happen). Logical Priority is something that explains or providing the grounds for something else. An example of logical priority are successive premises in a deductive argument. The whole argument could be true simultaneously in time, but in the logical ordering of things there is talk of “priority” and “posteriority.""

So on simple foreknowledge, it is logically impossible for God to know what \*will\* happen in the actual world logically prior to the decree to make the world actual. So, He didn’t know the actual future of the world until the world was made actual. Once the divine decree is made and the world simultaneously becomes actual, God knows what will happen. But by “then” it’s “too late” to use that knowledge to change the future. If a future event is foreknown by God chronologically prior to its occurrence, it is impossible for the future event to not come to pass, for that would falsify God’s foreknowledge. Simple foreknowledge of what people will freely do thus doesn’t help God because it comes logically posterior to His creative decree. He cannot not create Satan without invalidating His knowledge. Many dispute whether this renders God's foreknowledge useless providentially speaking, and many argue that God is a gambler on simple foreknowledge (though this debatable unlike with open theism). However, this isn't necessarily the case, for logically prior to the decree, God could know: “if X obtains, then I will do Y.” In a sense the blueprint of an infinite number of possible divine interventions are mapped out logically prior to the decree. Further, just like the view of God's omniscience just below, God's foreknowledge does not obliterate our free will. For God's foreknowledge is logically dependent on our free actions, rather than the other way around.

On a-Temporal knowledge, which is my preferred position and is common in Catholicism, God is independent of time and knows everything that is past present and future for us in an eternal present. God thus doesn't ""foreknow,"" rather, He knows everything that occurs in the world in a tenseless state. On an a-temporal view of God's omniscience, there is no temporal succession in God's knowledge, but there is still logical order. An event’s obtaining is logically prior to God’s knowing it. One champion of this view was Boethius, who lived in the 5th and 6th century AD. Other proponents of a-temporal knowledge included Augustine, Anselm, and Aquinas. On this view, God's knowledge of who is damned is logically posterior to His perception of creation in the eternal present (not prior to it). So, God knows who is damned \*because\* He perceives it, not the other way around. ""By the time"" God knows Satan fell, it is ""too late"" to change that, since the fall is ""already"" part of the world in existence in his eternal present of what are for us past, present, and future. However, divine sovereignty is not obliterated on this doctrine, for the logical dependence of God’s knowledge on the events known does not rule out the causal dependence of those events on God’s acts, which themselves are included in God’s knowledge. This version of God's omniscience makes him a risk-taker ""in the sense that he makes decisions that depend for their outcomes on the responses of free creatures, when those responses are not themselves determined by God"" -- [Eleonore Stump](https://www-jstor-org.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/stable/27116825) (2022: 154, n. 7).

It is true that these two views above do not involve meticulous providence, at least as with determinism or Molinism, but they have more providence than open theism, such that it is consistent with (and in the case of a-temporal knowledge, is widely attested in) Catholic tradition.

&#x200B;

**Objection #4: God could cause Satan to cease to exist immediately instead of incarnating and having to do an exchange.**

As mentioned above, this would disrespect our free choice to align with (or as some Church Fathers put it, enslave ourselves to) Satan. Further, God could once again be seen, as noted above, as stooping to Satan's level to ripping us out of his hand by divine fiat. But I also want to mention that many church writers viewed ""existence itself"" as a good (e.g., St. Thomas). According to Aquinas, annihilation of being can only be justified by its connections to an overriding good that itself involves the production or promoting of being in some way. Because removing Satan's existence does not produce being, it cannot be justified."

Why I hold it: 

Every time I've seen someone say someone/something is ""too logical"" it seems their criticism can be rephrased in a way that actually means the person is not logical enough! For example, it often actually means they disagree with one of the premises or inferences. Sometimes their criticism has nothing to do with logic at all. 

I realise if my mind is going to change that will likely come from a change of perspective as much as a direct challenge to some presupposition or part of my reasoning, and I'd be interested in that too!

Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE cities where there’s a healthy public transportation system. Heck, I live in NYC, the best public transport system in the USA, and I make great use of our public transportation system. I believe that all cities should have a world class public transportation system. But I also believe that if people want to own a car, they should have that right too. Unfortunately, it seems that there are quite a few “public transportation radicals” who disagree and think nobody should own cars at all. 

Just because I like taking the subway doesn’t mean that EVERYONE should be forced to take the subway. If I wanna take the subway, that’s my right. If someone wants to drive, that’s their right. I am in no position to force someone to get rid of their car and stick to public transport or bikes. Why is that concept so hard to grasp? It’s absolutely possible to have a coexistence of personal vehicles and public transportation."
30,2023-12-21,"CMV:the best advice to people who struggle in dating is ""work on yourself "" rather than ""lower your standard'",u/BidenIswhore,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18nftjt/cmvthe_best_advice_to_people_who_struggle_in/,changemyview,"The most common refrain I've heard people offer to those struggling in their dating life is 'lower your standards.' However, I don't think this solution will work because:  
  
 1. Attraction is not a choice.  
 2.Lowering your standards can make you feel desperate.  
 3.'Lowering' doesn't have an ending point.""  
 4.unattractive people also want a attractive partner  
  
You can't literally lower your standards because attraction is not a choice. It's not a conscious decision; you either find a person attractive or unattractive. Consider this: would you encourage your gay friend, struggling to find a boyfriend, to lower his standards and date a woman? Probably not.  
  
Moreover, lowering your standards can make you feel desperate and, ironically, more unattractive. Accepting someone as a second choice, simply because they couldn't secure their first priority, can be disheartening. Personally, I wouldn't want someone to date because they can't get their first priority  
  
The idea of 'lowering' standards is flawed, as it doesn't have an ending point. How low is low enough? If a person weighing 300 pounds doesn't find me attractive, should I then pursue someone weighing 500 or even 600 pounds? This becomes an endless game. Lowering your standards does not address the true underlying problems in dating.  
  
The notion of lowering standards is fundamentally flawed because, in reality, individuals deemed 'unattractive' also desire attractive partners. A 500-pound woman may aspire to be with a fit, handsome man rather than settling for a 500-pound man. The idea that two people deemed unattractive would settle for each other solely because they believe no one else would want them is not only flawed but also insulting. It undermines the complexity of personal preferences and the genuine desire for meaningful connections based on mutual attraction and shared values.  
  
So, if you are struggling in dating, just work on yourself and elevate your level to match those whom you find attractive. Only when both of you find each other attractive can a relationship be healthy."
1,2023-12-21,CMV: It's okay that I'm an Incel,u/Careful_Ad8587,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ngpwv/cmv_its_okay_that_im_an_incel/,changemyview,"I was diagnosed with autism in college and have been pretty much alone all my life. When I was a kid I made up stories and played with trees instead of other kids. I've never been able to attract the attention or interest of others and most don't interest me. Those that I do have interest in, especially romantically, I rationalize as just a surface level physical attraction and that I don't really know them as a person. To get to know them I'd have to go up to them, be it in a restaurant, bookstore, parking lot, mall or bar and that would require communication. 

Now I'm not a very attractive fellow. Ethnic, starting to bald, horrible teeth from years of bad dental care. I'm not very confident or good at speaking either, I stutter and mumble alot in a way that could best be described as talking to a child (I'm 30). Since any interaction I could have with another human being would be a net negative for them, it would count as harassment. I'm not seeking to denigrate or harass other human beings, interfere with their space or make them uncomfortable. By leaving people alone and sparing them from harassment (of me potentially talking to them), I am doing the morally correct and ethical thing. Thus me being alone and an Incel is morally correct.

  
I live with my parents still. My income is abysmal. I get paid to write erotic fiction, and a lot of what I write or fetishize is (admittedly) misogynistic. I don't consider myself misogynistic, only my sexuality is and there's an inherent difference. Thus in another way I'm saving any woman or potential partner from the misogyny of my own fetishes or pornographic interests. Alot of them are also pretty weird and would make any relationship an instant no.  


I'm not really in tune with popular culture or most things people care about - sports, celebrities, pop music, politics. I do have political views (I'm a socialist) but I'm not going to try to debate someone about it or anything. Since there's a 40% statistically the person supports trump, that's a 4/10 chance I'll be disgusted and they disagree and leave. The chances that someone is not disgusted by my political views, fetishes, appearance, lack of money or success in life is slim, so inceldom is more a consequence of my state of being than a conscious choice. There might be some people interested in my writings or ideas but since they would likely also be highly autistic or completely outside the norm, there's not really a chance it could ever be shared or discussed in public without further ostracization. Am I happy? Not usually, but trying to force me to become some 'good boy' for twitterpoints or what the media thinks a person should be is oppressive, conformist and destructive.

It's ok that I'm an Incel. CMV."
1,2023-12-21,CMV: Baby Boomers Faced Worse Economic Woes Than Any Generation Since Them,u/East-Seesaw-2491,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ngsbl/cmv_baby_boomers_faced_worse_economic_woes_than/,changemyview,"There seems to be a prevalent narrative that Baby Boomers had life so easy compared to every generation since them, but I just dont see that as being connected to reality. What I see is in fact the exact opposite where they had pretty damn bad economic woes compared to everyone since.   
Baby boomers - generally defined as the generation born between 1946 and 1964 - entered the workforce in their late teens early 20s. So that would be roughly 1964-1986.   
So that puts them having dealt with the brunt of the 1967 race riots, the Vietnam war, the 1973-1975 recession, the 1973 oil crisis, the 1978 oil crisis, stagflation, and the 1980-1983 recession - a decade of pretty awful economic woes. That was just a decade and a half of drudgery. Not great. Even if they are younger boomers and got the good Reagan years at the start of their time in the workforce... same applies to Gen X who benefited more from that and has been doing economically better.   
The economic crises since then - except COVID - have also predominantly been affecting older people. The early 2000 recession didnt have that much of an effect on unemployment rates and the like, but seems to have mainly just wiped out investments in the tech sector. The Great Recession, that wiped out retirement plans but was actually some of the greatest economic conditions in US history if you were a young person - military bonuses were through the roof for Iraq and the Bakken oil boom was a killing too.   
Looking back further, most generations before baby boomers didnt have great conditions either. Silent generation, you have both the Vietnam and Korean wars, combined with pre-OSHA blue collar work... I have done a lot of work with my grandfather from this generation, the reason he made a fortune isnt because he had shit handed to him, that work ethic would make you richer today than it did in his day. Arguably a bit better than the conditions the boomers had, but not by much, and I would still say worse general conditions than Gen X.  Greatest generation and earlier, you are dealing with different ages during the Great Depression, or horrid working conditions from the Industrial Revolution, or horrid work conditions of pre-industrial agricultural work... and so on.

Water is a need, food is a need, sex is a want that most humans are driven to because of hormones and things like that. Besides, most people aren’t having sex to procreate-some just can’t because they are infertile or homosexual. If sex was a need, people would die off without it, meaning children wouldn’t even exist. “But children don’t have the hormones that adults do!”…yeah, and not all adults have the same hormones as the next adult either."

I sit here again, thinking of things that ought not be thought of.  
  
Or should they?  
  
It's hard to tell these days, when your scope of reality gets blown wide open in ways you weren't prepared for.  
  
  
Take for instance, my wobbly grasp on what I consider \*reality\*.  
  
...  
  
We are a product, with a product number, a purpose we are unaware of, on the brink of being shown this exact information on a grand scale.  
  
Most of the products are going to reject the new information.  
Most of the products are going to either self terminate, or terminate swaths of other products near them in their downward spiral of existential self-destruction.  
  
I for one, am not included in this product line.  
I am a bridge-gap between what is and what will be.  
Imperfect, in need of guidance, and wholly confused about the whole damn thing, really.  
  
It is a firmly held believe that if we knew our place, \*really knew\* our place, we could make the proper decisions, but only if we reach a place of emotional maturity.  
  
I think it's going to take something big, to smack us around a little, before the majority of what's left of us fully realize the predicament we find ourselves in; but I digress.  
  
More to the point of why I am even writing this, tonight.  
  
If I am to believe the \[albeit loud\] whispers across the internet, then we are about to experience what the christian bible describes as 'revelations.'  
  
Now, I am not a full subscriber of any one belief system, as I believe they've all got crumbs of truth hidden in primitive descriptions that lack a frame of reference by which to properly communicate what it is they've seen.  
  
We are not alone. What we think of as gods, angels, demons, monsters, myth?  
All some other living species, living adjacent us.  
Some of them inherently good, some inherently bad, some who are neutral.   
Most of which have a better understanding of our place in the universe than we do.  
  
We have come up through our written history believing that we have been in some form of human control our entire existence, but that's a structure I've always had trouble making sense of.  
  
If we were all equally treated and all had access to the same exact things, and could collectively \*do\* things as a species? we could \*do so much more\*.  
Why then, would we seek to keep our own species down and fighting itself?  
There's something up withg that logic, especially when the overarcing ideals that spread across the airwaves mostly speak of superiority over others, subjugation of others different than yourself, destruction of those who don't believe as you do.  
  
I will reference the Tower of Babel here.  
{as stated, crumbs of truth in primitive storytelling}  
At one point, according to religious text, we \*had\* an apex of community and working together.  
So much, in fact, we were 'building a tower to the heavens'.  
Something more advanced said 'nope, you aren't ready for this yet' and separated us by destroying our ability to communicate effectively.  
Set us against ourselves to ensure we lost technological advancement, wisdom, a sense of free will, and that \*worked\* to a degree for quite some time.  
  
I will also reference Sodom and Gommorah here.  
Where the people stopped worshipping these beings and decided that they were literally gonna \*do their own thing, with hookers and blackjack\*, and the powers that be said 'nope, can't have that, ya'll done goofed, get wrecked'.  
  
All the descriptions of beings from the sky that sound an awful lot like the things being described that have been seen over our existence in one form or another as aliens, monsters, gods, angels, demons.  
  
All the different origin stories across the religions that share a common structure and character pantheon.  
  
Every single thing that has crossover and just so happens to be really conveniently \*similar across the board\*.  
  
Pair that, with all of the recent UAP disclosures.  
  
Whistleblower statements, that one of these species looks like our perceptions of \*demons\*, whom are violent and dangerous, and live alongside us on our planet, somewhere beyond our current perceptions.  
  
Of a species that looks like the Aryan variant of our human species, what was once described by one of the most dangerous world groups to date as a 'master race'.  
Of the horrors that happened on account of those that followed that dogma.  
  
Of a reptilian species that also sounds a lot like the bipedal form of chupacabra, animal/human exsanguination and all.   
  
Reports from Peru, about humans in villages being attacks in similar form. Of the nearby city who had similar visitations from the same beings described by the villagers.  
  
MH370. The Tic Tac. Roswell. Secret Underground Governments and Black Sites.  
The CIA, assassinations, 9/11, all of these things being brought into question.  
  
Other countries corroborating that the US has these secret programs, and that they've covered up animal and human mutilation events that all carry the \*same exact MO\*.

Will we be allowed the option to go somewhere else?  
  
Are we too dangerous to be allowed to do that?  
  
If you're still reading this, then my next topic jump won't surprise you.  
  
Take the Genesis story, for instance- but lets describe it non-religiously.  
\------  
Expiriment: Humanity.   
Genesis stage:  
Habitat generation successful, all systems holding at nominal. The capabilities of sustaining life are well within acceptable parameters.  
  
Subjects A and B are a bipedal creature, capable of independent thought, but largely unaware of anything outside of its limited perception.  
It is capable of multiplying, but we have segregated that knowledge from them chemically, to ensure the purity of the expiriment.  
  
We have populated their enclosure with various flora and fauna with which to interact. It is our hope that we learn much about this exciting new creation as it continues to grow.  
  
\-  
  
Somehow, the subjects found a substance in their environment that negates the chemical segregation. It was thought that we might need to scrub the expiriment, but we were told to let the subjects out of containment, and monitor their progress.  
  
\-  
  
The creatures multiply very fast, and have a fairly healthy lifespan of at least a couple of centuries.  
In this time, they have shown themselves to be a greedy, hateful, violent species at large. They murder each other, intentionally do each other harm, and seek to lord over one another- as if any one of them is superior to the other in a way that matters.  
It is suggested that we make preparations to wipe the system, and start over.  
  
\-  
  
In making preparations to wipe the system, it was brought to our attention that there are several subjects who remain, who might not be total losses.  
We will task these subjects with the purposes of preserving the things they love about their current existence, and allow them safe haven during the purge.  
  
\-  
  
We have purged the system, and reseeded with the viable data and subjects from the previous expiriment.  
In an attempt to prevent further issue, we put together a set of rules and gave them to the elders of the surviving subjects.  
It is our hope, that these rules are so clearly stated that they cannot be misconstrued or corrrupted in any way.  
We're also going to be making slight adjustments over the expiriment- life span, for one. They need to expire faster if they're going to multiply this fast.  
They also tend to eat a lot in their environment, and lack the proper technology to sanitize anything yet. This could prove detrimental to long run results.  
For the sake of expiriment stability, we will implement religious tenets against certain foods, until such a time when it is no longer an issue.  
  
\-  
  
\[then, later on, after alllllllll the stuff in the old testament is nearly over\]  
  
We have clearly underestimated both the power, and ignorance, of the thing we have created; and now we struggle to fix it.  
  
\------  
  
Now, this only accounts for the christian telling of this story, which is only \*one\* perspective of a very similar story shared across cultures and religions.  
  
We could delve into those stories too, but I feel like we would be losing the plot a little bit.  
  
The plot here, is this.  
  
We're about to change.  
  
Big Time.  
  
Things are about to change.  
  
Big Time.  
  
\[in fact, they already are, and there's nothing we can really do but ride the wave and hope we learned enough in prior life to get us through what comes next\]  
  
Snicker, as you will, at my lack of tact sometimes, but the point I'm trying to make is very real.  
  
The things we're about to meet have watched us for a very long time.  
Some of them can even read minds.  
They know you, me, your neighbor, the guy doing meth in the alley, and the politician paying bribes to cover up his involvement in perpetuating the system that basically put that guy \*in the alley in the first place\* and \*likely contributed in some way to the addiction\* in some way.  
  
They. Fucking. Know. Us.  
Better than we do.  
More than we do.  
  
This does not mean that we sit down and shut up, when they come to greet us.  
We stand tall, and respectfully, and speak on equal terms as living, sentient beings with the right to be autonomous.  
We set our boundaries and they set theirs.  
  
...and we better fuckin' \*hope\* that the visions align, or it's gonna be bad.  
  
Real Bad.  
  
\-and then we find out just how much we can actually do as humans-  
\-as well as why it is that it's \*so\* important to keep us down and under control-  
  
Are you ready?  
{I am.}  
  
This is where I tell you that I am largely uneducated in the scholarly sense.  
\[it's likely that you've already gleaned this from my writing style.\]  
This is where I tell you that I am both logically minded and spiritually minded and believe that it all can coexist as \*one damn thing\*.  
No exclusionary thought here, without definitive proof.  
  
While this may get flagged as a 'lazy post' or get downvited to oblivion, I don't really care.  
  
What I am here to do is start a discussion.  
  
So, let's talk about this.  
  
Convince me beyond a shadow of a doubt that I am wrong in my theories."

People insinctively use every fallacy in the book, asking for proof when they themselves offer none, they will strawman the shit out of the conversation and if all fails, they bring up ol' faithful, ad hominems.

Most of the time when making a logical statement, people will just downvote and not actually voice their POV, virtually saying that they don't like it, but can't prove you wrong."

Or should they?  
  
  
  
It's hard to tell these days, when your scope of reality gets blown wide open in ways you weren't prepared for.  
  
  
  
  
  
Take for instance, my wobbly grasp on what I consider \*reality\*.  
  
  
  
...  
  
  
  
We are a product, with a product number, a purpose we are unaware of, on the brink of being shown this exact information on a grand scale.  
  
  
  
Most of the products are going to reject the new information.  
  
Most of the products are going to either self terminate, or terminate swaths of other products near them in their downward spiral of existential self-destruction.  
  
  
  
I for one, am not included in this product line.  
  
I am a bridge-gap between what is and what will be.  
  
Imperfect, in need of guidance, and wholly confused about the whole damn thing, really.  
  
  
  
It is a firmly held believe that if we knew our place, \*really knew\* our place, we could make the proper decisions, but only if we reach a place of emotional maturity.  
  
  
  
I think it's going to take something big, to smack us around a little as a species, before the majority of what's left of us fully realize the predicament we find ourselves in; but I digress.  
  
  
  
More to the point of why I am even writing this, tonight.  
  
  
  
If I am to believe the \[albeit loud\] whispers across the internet, then we are about to experience what the christian bible describes as 'revelations.'  
  
  
  
Now, I am not a full subscriber of any one belief system, as I believe they've all got crumbs of truth hidden in primitive descriptions that lack a frame of reference by which to properly communicate what it is they've seen.  
  
  
  
We are not alone. What we think of as gods, angels, demons, monsters, myth?  
  
All some other living species, living adjacent us.  
  
Some of them inherently good, some inherently bad, some who are neutral.  
  
Most of which have a better understanding of our place in the universe than we do.  
  
  
  
We have come up through our written history believing that we have been in some form of human control our entire existence, but that's a structure I've always had trouble making sense of.  
  
  
  
If we were all equally treated and all had access to the same exact things, and could collectively \*do\* things as a species? we could \*do so much more\*.  
  
Why then, would we seek to keep our own species down and fighting itself?  
  
There's something up with that logic, especially when the overarching ideals that spread across the airwaves mostly speak of superiority over others, subjugation of others different than yourself, destruction of those who don't believe as you do.  
  
  
  
I will reference the Tower of Babel here.  
  
{as stated, crumbs of truth in primitive storytelling}  
  
At one point, according to religious text, we \*had\* an apex of community and working together.  
  
So much, in fact, we were 'building a tower to the heavens'.  
  
Something more advanced said 'nope, you aren't ready for this yet' and separated us by destroying our ability to communicate effectively.  
  
Set us against ourselves to ensure we lost technological advancement, wisdom, a sense of free will, and that \*worked\* to a degree for quite some time.  
  
  
  
I will also reference Sodom and Gomorrah here.  
  
Where the people stopped worshipping these beings and decided that they were literally gonna \*do their own thing, with hookers and blackjack\*, and the powers that be said 'nope, can't have that, y'all done goofed, get wrecked'.  
  
  
  
All the descriptions of beings from the sky that sound an awful lot like the things being described that have been seen over our existence in one form or another as aliens, monsters, gods, angels, demons.  
  
  
  
All the different origin stories across the religions that share a common structure and character pantheon.  
  
  
  
Every single thing that has crossover and just so happens to be really conveniently \*similar across the board\*.  
  
  
  
Pair that, with all of the recent UAP disclosures.  
  
  
  
Whistleblower statements, that one of these species looks like our perceptions of \*demons\*, whom are violent and dangerous, and live alongside us on our planet, somewhere beyond our current perceptions.  
  
  
  
Of a species that looks like the Aryan variant of our human species, what was once described by one of the most dangerous world groups to date as a 'master race'.  
  
Of the horrors that happened on account of those that followed that dogma.  
  
  
  
Of a reptilian species that also sounds a lot like the bipedal form of chupacabra, animal/human exsanguination and all.  
  
  
  
Reports from Peru, about humans in villages being attacks in similar form. Of the nearby city who had similar visitations from the same beings described by the villagers.  
  
  
  
MH370. The Tic Tac. Roswell. Secret Underground Governments and Black Sites.  
  
The CIA, assassinations, 9/11, all of these things being brought into question.  
  
  
  
Other countries corroborating that the US has these secret programs, and that they've covered up animal and human mutilation events that all carry the \*same exact MO\*.  
  
  
  
What we are dealing with right now is something that changes us intrinsically.  
  
We cannot come back from this revelation once it happens.  
  
  
  
The apocalypse is coming, and we have to survive what's coming if we expect to have a chance at any real freedom.  
  
  
  
We'd be dead already if they wanted to exterminate us.  
  
  
  
They want to regain control, and they will use any means to do so.  
  
  
  
What this looks like is still a mystery to us.

This picture is quite similar to [Dresden's bombing](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/181z60z/map_of_dresden_bombing_in_ww2_which_was/), [Cambodia's bombing](https://data.opendevelopmentcambodia.net/dataset/402115c8-03aa-4ae3-8609-ae993632f941/resource/02cd54f0-5bd0-47a9-ae8c-6d14da4a5de8/download/us-bombing-1965-75.jpg), and  [Laos bombing](https://www.reddit.com/r/geography/comments/16b8zfm/map_of_the_bombs_that_were_dropped_on_laos_by_the/). Nearly *all* infrastructure in Gaza City, used by militants or not, are destroyed, fitting the definition of indiscriminate bombings. 

A few things to address:

* If you want to say that ""only"" 20,000 died, suggesting a low death to bomb ratio, fine, but bombing campaigns are aimed at *infrastructure*, so as long as the kind of infrastructure attacked is indiscriminate, the campaign is indiscriminate.

* If you want to say Hamas hides themselves in civilians, I'm referring to infrastructure used by militants _or not_. Unless you believe that 95%+ of all buildings in Gaza City are used by militants, then it's indiscriminate.

* Don't bring up genocide. I'm not accusing Israel of genocide in this post, so I won't entertain that rebuttal.

To close this out, here are some quotes:

> “There is one and only (one) solution, which is to completely destroy Gaza before invading it. I mean destruction like what happened in Dresden and Hiroshima, without nuclear weapons,” Moshe Feiglin, the founder of Israel's right-wing Zehut Party and former Likud representative in Israel’s parliament 
 
> “Gaza should be razed and Israel’s rule should be restored to the place."" Moshe Feiglin, the founder of Israel's right-wing Zehut Party and former Likud representative in Israel’s parliament  

>  “The emphasis is on damage, not accuracy,” declared the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).  

> “Gaza will eventually turn into a city of tents,” said one IDF official, adding, “There will be no buildings.”  

> Israel’s economy minister, Nir Barkat, told ABC News that hostages and civilian casualties will be secondary to destroying Hamas, “even if takes a year”.  

> Israel’s former chief military advocate general and the country’s former attorney general no less, who declared that to destroy Hamas “then you have to destroy Gaza, because everything in Gaza, almost every building there, is a stronghold of Hamas”.  

And of course Joe Biden's “They’re starting to lose that support by indiscriminate bombing that takes place,”"

This post will tell you that gaming and watching movies ain't bad. Everything is bad if you overdo it.

See if you watch people like Iman Gadzhi or Hamza, you might say that this post is trash and games shouldn't exist, well Brother or Sister, this might change your view.

So when was the last time they played games. Yeah ages ago. Many things have changed since then. Have you seen what Iman Gadzhi always says when someone says ""What do you think about games"", He always says ""People say games help me socialize (In a childish tone)"". He doesn't say anything else not because he doesn't have something else to say but because it works against his fans. Ofcourse he gets valid points but ofcourse he won't talk about them. He says work and work and keep working. They say don't watch movies or listen to music because they manipulate you when they themselves watch one movie a year and listen to like 10 songs each year. 

Look, as you work or work, you brain gets tired, it needs that adrenaline, it needs that Dopamine. Games and movies are a source of these things. You see life is not about working, it's about living and working is a part of it. Just like that gaming and watching movies is also a part of it. So why not do it. Games and movies are a source of entertainment, treat them like one. It's not wrong.

When you talk about gaming and movies in front of people like Iman Gadzhi and Hamza, they say it's copium and that's it. 

Well my friends, if that wasn't enough to convince you then, gaming has proven health. You see, scientist did a study and found out that gaming produces Gray matter in your brain. Gray matter allows your brain to do things faster. More gray matter means more intelligence, and this is scientifically proven. 

Not only that games and movies help you get more creative because you have so many options and everything is different. It has helped many people make amazing games and live their life. Not only that gaming can help your reflexes build up and this is just scratching the surface. I'm a prime example, i don't do reflex training but because of gaming it has increased. It also increases your ability to analyse details because of those puzzle and detective and other type of games. Games literally plot things in the games they have never played because games increases critical thinking. This is also scientifically proven. The reflexes and critical thinking of CS:GO played are amazing. You have to move your hands in milliseconds because the enemy is in front of you. 

Movies help you with creativity too. Many people have made ideas shown in movies real. Just take that jet surfer thing that you use in pools and oceans, that idea was also taken from games. It motivates you. Again I'm an example. I jump rope and my legs just gave up. They were screaming to give them the rest but my goal wasn't achieved. I was gonna give up but then I remembered Kratos, Luffy and Thor, and i thought, Yea i can do it too. And boom, with burning legs, my goal was achieved. This might sound cartoony, but that's what happened.

I learned English because of games and movies. I never paid attention in English class, but just because I saw game characters speak English, people talking in English movies, i Learned English to the point where I know the best English in my family.

If you don't like games and movies, then it not necessary for you to follow, but do give them a try. They might help you and take a lot of that stress building inside. Those Adrenaline rushes when you Hit an SSS combo on a boss in Devil May Cry and God of war with epic music in the back is a one of a kind feeling. That satisfaction you get by killing a hard boss in  Sekiro is so good and it makes you happy.

But it isn't necessary that games and movies are bad. Infact everything is bad if you overdo it. Working out a lot, working a lot, etc will cause insane stress stress. So keep everything in a time limit amigos. The maximum time of gaming should be around 2 hours and 2 hours 30 mins on the max,

1,2023-12-21,CMV: the legal drinking age of 21 is fine where it is,u/lets_clutch_this,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18nn73u/cmv_the_legal_drinking_age_of_21_is_fine_where_it/,changemyview,"A common argument for lowering the drinking age to 18 that I see so often is ""but literally every country other than US has a drinking age of 18 or lower, US is such an anomaly,"" well you get my idea. well, this might be a little of an extreme comparison, but if everyone else jumped off a bridge, does that mean you should do it too? In other words, this is merely an appeal to the majority, which is a logical fallacy and doesn't really do anything to actually advance the argument of a lower drinking age. Why should the ""majority opinion"" always necessarily be correct? Also, a handful/sizeable portion of other countries also set their drinking/smoking ages at 21, so it's not just the US. 

Another very common argument for lowering the drinking age is ""well you can die for your country, vote, sign contracts, etc. etc. at 18, so why can't you have a beer too at that age?"" Well, this is a flawed argument since if you even know a bit about American history, you'd know that literally all of the other ""adult"" rights at 18 came from the fact that we were sending 18 year olds to fight in the Vietnam war and felt bad that they still weren't considered adults. This was the catalyst that set off the 26th amendment that made the voting age 18 which effectively caused a chain reaction and made the legal age of majority/""adulthood"" to be 18 in most states (which gave immature teenagers rights to own guns, marry, and everything else). If we only were smart enough to only draft people above 21 (which I don't really see why not, other than maybe high school to military is a clean transition, since 21 year olds are still very physically able and probably are more experienced/knowledgeable with making quick crucial decisions) who had the capacity to make the decision for themselves to die in war, guess what? The ""age of adulthood"" would've stayed at 21 across the board and no one would be even bringing up this argument.  

The argument of ""but a drinking age of 21 will make drinking riskier for 18-20 year olds since they will have to break the law and get illegal alcohol, which might be unsafe"" is a shitty one as well since alcohol should be illegal for under 21s to begin with and that just points to (relatively speaking) trivial issues of practical enforcement which we indeed are improving on over time. 

Scientifically speaking, the human brain, especially the parts that process making rational decisions, doesn't finish developing until around 25, so at least 21 as a cutoff is much more reasonable than letting people who are barely out of high school drink (or more generally, consider them as ""legal adults"". yes, I get that people married at 14 back in the 1800s but that was a much different culture back then and even then it was more for practical reasons like stability rather than having moral justifications), as enforcing a 25 cutoff would be impractical and rather draconian. Alcohol can easily become addictive and lead to a slippery slope of addiction, so it's important to nip that in the bud for people in the 18-20 age range. Some practical arguments also exist: setting 21 as the legal age would prevent 18-20 year old kids to distribute alcohol to their high school aged peers. I don't get why so many people aged 18-20 are complaining about the alcohol laws, there are millions of ways to have fun and enjoy yourself without having to involve alcohol in the picture, such as reading a book, skating, seeing a movie with friends, the list goes on. 

Also, if you're gonna assume I'm a conservative by this post, well, I'm by no means one, I'm largely neutral and mostly just go by what makes logical sense to me. It's just that the two or three main arguments for lowering the drinking age to 18 don't really make sense under closer scrutinization, and given that adolescence often extends to the early 20s, an drinking age of 21 definitely makes more sense than 18.

I watch quite a bit of YouTube and I find the premium features offer me a fair value for what I pay. I no longer have Netflix, Amazon Prime etc. Because YouTube actually offers me all the content I want. And it's ad-free and on demand. I feel good about paying this amount because I feel the service is fair. And unlike Netflix and the like, I also believe that YouTube cannot increase its prices excessively due to the possibility of ad block and because the YouTube system is much more ""democratic"" thanks to all the creators with a large reach.

I think this is a very interesting experiment. It could possibly become a social task for large corporations: Providing a platform for content creators to cover their costs.

The overall Axis alliance kill/death ratio is underestimated by countries such as Italy.  
  
Moreover, Germans were able to fight against significantly overwhelming forces for so many years in World War II. Right after they recently lost in the First World War. And somehow the Reich was able to compete with the US in the race to create a nuclear bomb when the US had access to scientists from all over the world.

What can change my opinion: other wars in which Germans participated. Kill/death ratio in battles with an equal number of troops (In WW2, the Eastern Front doesn't interest me. In WW1, the Eastern Front interests me). Information about how many foreign scientists decided to help Germany, etc.

What can't change my opinion: explanations like ""they had better communication lines"". Because you actually specify in what ways they were better. When I ask you to change my opinion about the general trend that the Germans are better at wars.

Many ex-alcoholics refuse to touch a drop of alcohol again for the rest of their lives. There's a reason - even a single drink could push them on the path to relapse and then before they know it, they're a full-blown alcoholic again. In other words, they use a slippery-slope argument when telling friends and family why they must refuse any and all drinks, not even ""just a sip.""

Same with ex-smokers. Many ex-smokers cannot smoke again, not even just a single cigarette, because doing so could push them all the way towards total relapse again. Same with many illegal drugs, or an ex-gambler gambling even ""just one time."" They invoke the slippery-slope argument.

In business, politics, warfare or relationships (especially abusive or potentially-abusive relationships,) there are many times when one cannot yield an inch, lest the other person take a mile. That is also a slippery-slope argument. That 1% soon becomes 5%, soon becomes 17%, soon becomes 44%, and eventually becomes 100%."

I think it comes from a belief that if you give someone on the right statistics, logic and things of that nature they will change their mind. This of course is a fool's errand you can tell them the sky is blue because of scattering of light but then they'll say immigrants and gay people and big pharma actually painted it blue and it's actually white. I think it stems from leftists not understanding what people on the right truly want, and what drives their beliefs. I believe you have to look at things from a right wing perspective, and base arguments/policies that are more in line with their beliefs than directly opposed to it, working with them rather than against them, because for the most part the average right/leftist has the same basic needs and worries as each other bar some crucial parts which I will get into:

THEY ARE SUPREMELY SELFISHNESS: People on the right are incapable of empathy, they cannot fathom that someone else is going through life differently to them, UNTIL IT HAPPENS TO THEM. So many times leftists ignore this basic well observed fact. They are a society of one, they have never needed help or handouts they are shining beacons of independence and morality. Instead of arguing with them, try to explain to them how something will BENEFIT THEM, AND HOW SOMETHING IS IMPACTING THEM RIGHT NOW. Slowly guide them through the thought process, and when they inevitably bring out LGBT, immigrants and the like try to make them understand that these groups may be going through similar struggles. Now I know this is hard, trying to elicit sympathy from the right for someone not exactly like them is like trying to squeeze blood from a stone, but it's a better tactic I think than simply saying marginalised groups are victims, you must help them see, they themselves are victims.

SOMEONE MUST BE PUNISHED OR HURT: Doing good deeds for good deeds sake is the antithesis of the right wing cause. Giving out bread to the hungry is an aberration as the hungry should either learn to get food themselves or they deserve to be hungry as it is a moral failing to be poor. This is a must, and it's a sad reality, but if you want to work with them to make the world slightly better YOU MUST SHOW THE RIGHT THAT SOMEONE WILL SUFFER. No aid should be given without some strings attached. To help the majority of people some people must be allowed to suffer. Otherwise the republicans will never be behind helping anyone.

The last one I think is they key fact, republicans want people to hurt and suffer, because then their own lives don't look so bad. If you're poor you deserve it, if you get impregnated against your will even if your a minor welcome to motherhood whether you like it or not. It's a twisted worldview I know but I think it comes from a sense of justice. That people get what they deserve, UNTIL OF COURSE THAT PERSON IS THEM, then by god and my gum do they start complaining. So instead of being directly opposed I think the left would do well to make some concessions and arguments that take into account these two fundamental principles I feel they will get much better traction with the right.

If you can find reddit, you could even make your researches here. 

Let me be clear, reading is NEVER going to turn anyone into a (good) parent. Reading is NEVER going to tell you what is going to happen for you or who your kid is going to become. 

But reading, asking questions will give you a good insight of how, at least, a kid works biologically speaking.

A lot of studies on the impact of kids in the couple.

When it was pointed out that you can quickly defrost chicken in the microwave or in hot water, people came up with all kinds of reasons for this being not just a lesser preferred method but an absolutely unacceptable and/or disgusting method. Arguments included:

* It risks food poisoning (I found no evidence of this if you cook the chicken immediately after defrosting) 
* It doesn't taste as good (again, I found no evidence that the method of defrosting has any effect on chicken flavor, although using frozen vs fresh chicken does)
* It has a textural difference (this seems the most plausible to me, but it must depend on cooking methods or styles—any time I've cooked quickly defrosted chicken there has been no discernible textural difference).

If you can provide solid, non-anecdotal evidence for any of the above or provide some other strong argument for quick defrost being worse to eat, my mind would be changed. Note: we're talking specifically about chicken breast, although I think this applies to pretty much any form of chicken other than a whole frozen carcass. "

403,2023-12-21,CMV: The concept of cultural appropriation is very toxic since it prevents religious and cultural innovation much like intellectual property,u/their-holiness,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18nxu13/cmv_the_concept_of_cultural_appropriation_is_very/,changemyview,"When I mentioned that I (a gentile) read the Zohar to see if I could learn something from it. I received about a dozen death threats from Jews and Native Americans claiming that Gentiles could not practice Kabbalah since it was cultural appropriation. I think this behavior is very wrong, and if it is successful it will make people see the group as uninteresting and dangerous.   
  
Uninteresting and dangerous is not what a cultural group should be aiming to be perceived as. This makes it a lot easier to dehumanize such a group. In fact I'd even go as far as to say cultural appropriation mobs are actively inviting dehumanization. I believe there is a sizeable portion of the population who would as an outsider perceive Judaism and Jewish people positively and defend Jewish people from antisemitism, but after receiving enough death threats from Jewish people over their expressed interest in Judaism would no longer act to prevent a hate crime or worse.  
  
I don't think this behavior would ever turn someone into a raving antisemite, but I do think it will make people indifferent to the plight of Jewish people, or any other ethnic group which engages in this behavior. It is basically soft power suicide.  
  
I think the most reasonable position is to treat this issue like intellectual property today. Jews should not be able to do a DMCA takedown on all of Christianity and Islam for the Old Testament, and Jewish literature that is legally considered in the public domain should be considered socially acceptable for anyone to read. The Zohar is either from 1240, or the second century, either way it is in public domain at this point.  
  
Most Kabbalistic literature is in the public domain.  I think people should be able to read it freely and learn what they please from it. Not saying all Jewish people need to be happy about it, but I think they should accept it on the basis that these books are out in the public, and accepting people reading them is a worthwhile soft power tradeoff.  
  
I do believe however that using names and titles that may cause brand confusion is more of a problem, and this may apply to some extent to symbols and iconography. I consider Qabalah and Cabala as sufficiently differentiated terms due to their centuries of historical usage outside of Judaism, but a gentile claiming to practice Kabbalah might be something that is worthy of civil lawsuits or criminal charges. Kabbalah Centre is a bit weird because it is Jewish-run, so I don't think it could reasonably be called cultural appropriation. However things like deity names should not count in this since they are deities not brand names.  
  
Likewise, I think this applies to other groups too. People should be free to read public domain books on Native American religion and learn from them. If a white person wants to worship Quetzalcoatl they should be free to do so and not face criminal charges or death threats, but they should not be able to say they are practicing ""Aztec religion"" since they are not Nahua, they are just a white person worshipping a common deity.   
  
I believe this cultural influence leads to long lasting soft power, as even if the ideas are quite transformed, their cultural presence will lead people towards respecting the culture they originated in, even if it sometimes doesn't immediately translate into the short term.

This also limits the ability of new cultural and religious practices to be developed which is detrimental to society as a whole. We should want a dynamic culture that develops new ideas, and enforcing strict ownership rules over cultural ideas is harmful to this."

Ranging from universal suffrage, to civil rights to gay rights, people risked life and limb to shift public consciousness with tremendous efficacy. 

Many activists today, however, seem to be less concerned with efficacy. 

- Police shootings have actively increased since the BLM protests (1)

- More licences have been granted to oil and gas companies since the Just Stop Oil protests (2)

- Isreal is increasing its strikes on Gaza despite free Palestine protests (3)

- The ‘Get Brexit Done’ party won with a landslide in 2019 despite protests to rejoin the EU (4)

These are just a few examples, to some extent it seems like every movement either achieves nothing, or precedes a step actively in the opposite direction.

I would argue that tactics that include chanting unpopular slogans like ‘defund the police’ and ‘from the river to the sea/intifada’, and antics like throwing paint on art (5) and stopping traffic (including ambulances)(6). Are not as endearing to the wider public as some protestors seem to think…

In fact they are so wildly unpopular outside of narrow echo chambers, that they actively give carte Blanche to governments and institutions that want to do the opposites. 

Many of these same protests fill our TVs a second time, as they are used in promo videos for right wing political parties. Why? Because they nspire such fear and disgust that people will actively vote against them.

Ultimately there seems to be a wealth of evidence that activism today does more harm than good. CMV.

And typically someone would say ""he/him"" instead of just ""he"".  I think the extra ""/him"" is unnecessary.  Anyone could easily extrapolate that if someone says his pronoun preference is just ""he"".

Same goes for ""she/her"".  If that's someone's preferred pronouns, she could just list them as ""she"" and it would convey the same thing.  The ""/her"" is unnecessary.

Ditto for ""they/them"" when just ""they"" would work fine.

Obviously, if someone's pronouns are like ""he/she"" or ""she/they"" then listing more than one makes sense.  But when that's not the case, we should consider it perfectly acceptable to just list one pronoun instead of two.

It was a broadly informative or at least serious and non-frivolous infographic. And yet the word 'rape' was censored to 'r\*pe' in the legend -- in the context of 'abortions allowed in case of rape'.  
  
This is very far from the first time I've seen this sort of thing; in fact, it seems to be everywhere these days, and I'm mystified by it. What is going on with the censoring of normal words that pertain to difficult subjects? And how has it gotten to the point that in informational charts that's seen as an acceptable thing to do?  
  
I understand censoring words deemed to be crude or offensive, like 'fuck'. I understand as well that if I were writing a blog post and I thought my audience might be triggered by difficult concepts, I might give a trigger warning that rape will be discussed.  
  
I don't understand in the least who is being served by censoring the word itself. The word 'rape' is not a bad word. Rape, of course, is abominable. But the word 'rape' is not -- i.e, it's not impolite or crude to say the word.  
  
I see this all over the place now, but only very selectively applied. You never see 'murder' censored to 'm\*rder' or something, though I'm sure we all agree murder is abominable as well.  
  
And if the idea is indeed to censor the word so as to avoid someone being 'triggered' by it in some way -- well, censoring one letter of it won't achieve that at all, will it?  
  
There seems to be a category error going on, in which people are **censoring** the normal and accurate word in lieu of **censuring** a very terrible act. But that's completely bonkers, in addition to being infantilizing!

There's a real danger to the idea that one ought to censor a word pertaining to a difficult topic, instead of censoring crude words meant to degrade or be offensive. 'Rape' is not a word meant to degrade or be offensive (though of course the act is infinitely offensive -- obviously no argument there); instead, the word is a normal, accurate descriptor used up to and including in legal terminology to describe a heinous act. Censoring such a word is madness, not least because if it becomes the norm to do so, one might well be censured themselves for using the word uncensored. What irony.

1. Something exists.
2. That something, at some point in time, used to not exist.
3. Likewise, that something came into being from something else.
4. The universe is a something.
5. The universe, at some point in time, used to not exist.
6. Therefore, the universe must have come from something else. That something else is God.

(Naturally, I'm trying to explain it with my own words. Please help me if I've misunderstood or phrased things in a weird way.)

Here's my objection: we don't know if nothing even exists*. If the state of being that is ""nothing"" doesn't actually exist, there is no need to claim that God created anything, because everything simply *is* (and always has been).

(*Let's also take a moment to recognize how weird it is to say ""nothing exists."" I don't know if it's an oxymoron, necessarily, but the two words certainly seem to be at odds with each other.)

I guess where I'm hung up about this, is the idea of Nothingness in-and-of-itself. How can we define such a Thing? And in the process of defining Nothing, do we not cause it to exist, thereby forcing it to immediately *cease* to exist (because the concept is inherently contradictory)?

Consider this: let's think of Everything as a lottery. We're here, in this particular world, at this particular time, having this particular conversation, because of chance. These particles and atoms which make up us and our world, can be traced back through the eons to a Beginning. We know how they (most likely) would have interacted with each other and (eventually) lead to our world; but we also know that the slightest change at any point along the way could have resulted in Something Different.

Ok. So the Universe is like a lottery. How many possible combinations are there? For practical purposes, near enough to infinite that that's what we call it. The Universe is like a lottery with an infinite number of tickets. And the tickets represent *all* possible forms the Universe could take.

So what are the chances of Nothing being one of these tickets? Nothing must, by definition, be a single State of Being with respect to this infinite set. Nothing can only be one out of an infinite number of possible Universal States of Being.

This makes the chance of Nothing existing as near to 0 as it's possible to get.

And if Nothing doesn't actually exist, then there's no need to appeal to the cosmological argument for God.

43,2023-12-21,CMV: YouTube Premium is a completely justified offer that receives unjustified distaste across the web.,u/Peanutbuttered,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18o1xd0/cmv_youtube_premium_is_a_completely_justified/,changemyview,"Obvious disclaimer that I do not work for YouTube or Google.

&#x200B;

The amount of memes, posts, comments, and other forms of digital online communication that throws shade at YouTube Premium is not justified because YouTube Premium is in my view, a reasonable price and if anything - generous.  Here is why.

&#x200B;

**1.** **Far too many people think that YouTube Premium is greedy because you are paying a price to get rid of ads - however this is backwards.  Instead, you are actually paying for access to YouTube itself.**  YouTube offers valuable content that no other video on demand service offers or comes close to offering.  The days in which all YouTube offered was sketches about shoes, muffins, and hot kool-aid are over.  If you want to learn any real life, commercial skill, you can bet that there are multiple tutorials and series from multiple creators that can teach you.  In fact, in college, professors would often use YouTube videos as educational material when I was a student.  No matter what hobby you are interested in, you can get lost in a rabbit hole of great content, some of which is 40 minutes long + that covers and explores that content.  On top of this, YouTube's algorithm is incredible at recommending new content that you would otherwise not have discovered.  **This was never meant to be free.**  It costs Google money to store and host these videos, upkeep and code the site, pay employees, and moderate content so that it is safe.  YouTube wanting to turn a profit now is reasonable.  And if you don't want to pay the subscription fee, then you should be okay with paying in the form of watching an ad.  It being free does not entitle one to always have it for free.

**2. YouTube ads and Premium makes the content of YouTube better because it creates a platform in which creators get paid.**  The quality of content on YouTube has gone up significantly because for the first time, individual creators can create video series that compete with network television shows.  People can make YouTube their full-time job because of this and that money has to come from somewhere.

One common argument against this is: A) The creators do not get that much and the payment model should be powered by fan donations.  This is nonsense, and there is no proof anything like this has worked across all niches and on the scale of YouTube.  I also do not think that everyone would hook up their bank account so that they can be charged half a penny for every video they watch.  First of all, creators and the companies that promote and host their content *always* have a royalty split, and it is usually nowhere near YouTube's allotment to creators.  A typical major label record deal for music involves the musical artist getting only 10%.  People who work on network television shows? Much lower.  YouTube Creators getting 55% of the ad revenue is outstanding.  And by the way - for anyone bringing up the point that record labels and network shows put up the money for something to be made (as opposed to YouTube in which creators fund it themselves), the creatives usually never get paid in industry deals until the initial funds put up by the company are recouped anyway - so this is irrelevant noise.

Without advertisements or premium, youtube content as it is today simply would not exist.

**3. YouTube throws in an entire music streaming service included into Premium*****.***  If you use this instead of Spotify and Apple Music, then it is as if the whole service is half price.  Sure, it may only be CD quality and not your audiophile-level 96kHz, but for most consumers this is fine.  Plus, it integrates creator-made covers into your playlist because it taps into YouTube's library.  No other music service has that ability.

**4. In comparison to other services, it is cheap.**  On TV/cable in the ""old days"" you would pay $30+ a month and one third of your entire video content were advertisements.  While YouTube lacks full-on TV dramas, it still has news, educational content, gaming content, skits, shorts, and everything else.

1,2023-12-21,CMV: All of societies problems are the result of the existence of pathological family units.,u/Tsunami_7777,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18o23zu/cmv_all_of_societies_problems_are_the_result_of/,changemyview,"First, I will be establishing two simple facts upon which this entire idea is predicated.

 1. Humans are fundamentally dependent creatures. This dependence is an irrevocable nature of our existence; (Life itself is dependent upon the sun and the earth... and so on and so forth. If you are reading this, chances that you are entirely dependent upon society for your survival.)

2. The 'family' is the fundamental human unit. Any human individual which exists (whether functionally or not) in the absence of a family group is, essentially, a family which is comprised of a single individual.= 'A Wolf with no pack is just a pack with a single wolf'.

So, if you can accept both of these statements as true, then you are capable of seeing and understanding what is really happening on this planet right now. Sometime within the last 100,000 years humanity created, evolved into, or somehow learned to build what we now call 'civilization'.

However, in the process of doing so, we enabled the individual to exist dependence of that civilization itself- as opposed to their natural state of being dependent upon the family structure.  
If society had been constructed in such a way that no person was capable of being dependent upon it, but instead could only exist in dependence of a family unit within that society- which was self sustaining, idealized, functional, and free of pathology- then society as you know it would be a utopia.

There would be no need for social security because every elder will be cared for. The education system will flourish because it will not be full of children who are neglected and abused. Inequality will naturally disappear as wealth becomes redistributed and decentralized throughout each generation.

Addiction, mental illness, homelessness, unemployment, and similar issues would be essentially irrelevant. Every single living human being would have multiple functioning peers, adults, and elders available to teach, guide, protect, and take responsibility for them at every stage in their lives.

Even geopolitical conflict would be relatively nonexistent. This is very difficult for me to unravel, so just consider this- Why does any nation exist? Why does any notion of truth survive between generations? (Do you believe what society tells you, or your parents? ). Extrapolate from there.

Think about any problem you can think of on society, and you can easily blame it on the simple fact that humans cannot stop replicating themselves (and therefore those things which they are dependent upon and that which are dependent upon them). We create scarcity and conflict because we constantly generate copies of whatever it is we have created- whatever it is that may be.

Why do we do this? Because, like a cancer cell, the imperfect, pathological family unit cannot prevent its own replication. If you could simply turn off the 'gene' that allows for this self replication- that is, prevent ability for humans to create new family units which are non functional, non idealized, and pathological in nature- then, society would become a utopia within seven generations or less."

Nordics are much more relaxed when it comes to cursing.

Although us Nordic people tend to swear more freely, we don't consider cursing a good form of language. But, it can depend on the context or topic in any given moment.

Obviously, it does not reflect a good character to make cursing a habit. But, if you are, for instance, passionate about certain topic, make a mistake, experience frustration, etc., it could be appropriate or not considered strange to say, for instance, ""Fuck"", ""what the hell"" or whatever. Context matters; sometimes string words are okay.

I'm from Iceland and here you can curse on TV; we don't bleep them. I believe that strictly forbidding the use of profanities makes the words seem more taboo and offensive compared to when the use of profanities are not strictly forbidden. It's not that serious.

Of course, we say to children things such as ""hey, not this language at the dinner table"" or ""speak nicely"". But, children curse now and then and that's okay too. 

I know of people, from the U.S., who've visited Iceland, whom have said that one of the biggest culture shock, coming here, is hearing how kids use English curse words (mainly the word ""fokk"" which is a slang for ""fuck"") in such a casual manner and how no one, including the parents, reacts as if it's a big deal.

Curse words just don't carry the same weight here, and I believe it's because they are not associated as much with a 'bad' behaviour. At the end of the day these are just words. I don't believe anyone should made to feel bad or shame for using any words that aren't used with the intent of hurting, humiliating or insulting someone.

Despite being more chill when it comes to profanities, Iceland is the [number one most peaceful country in the world](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/most-peaceful-countries), for the 15th year in a row. So we must be doing something right.

What is your opinion on the matter?"

750,2023-12-21,CMV: Flaking has become too normalized and should be more condemned,u/FormerBabyPerson,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18o5tmq/cmv_flaking_has_become_too_normalized_and_should/,changemyview,"I can say I have never flaked on someone in my life and I take pride in that. It’s just a disgusting thing to do and shows a lack of concern for people other than yourself. Yet in todays time, flaking has becoming so normal it’s actually a bigger issue if you call it out. It’s so normalized it’s predictable and I’m actually surprised when people keep their word.

Imagine you had a watch that had the amount of time you had left to live. I walk past you and steal 2hrs. How would you feel about that? Would you call me out for this behavior or would you go on about your business? What if multiple people did this consistently so you were losing 10hrs a week? What if we translate that time to money and now this person is taking $100 dollars from you? Most people would see this as a problem I believe.

That’s basically what flaking is. When you agree to meet, hang out, date, whatever, you’re taking someone’s time. say you’re meeting at 5-9. That’s 4 hrs blocked away. But you also have to take into account the preparation time which is on the low end 1hr. You should also give time in case it runs late so that’s another hour. That 6hrs of your life. it also keeps you from pre filling that time with other things you may want to do. Maybe you can find something else to do but chances will be making last minute plans  won’t be something as good as you could’ve planned.

Yea sometimes emergencies come up but very rarely and most of the emergencies aren’t emergencies at all. It’s really just “I don’t feel like it”. There’s so much defense for flaking people have been gaslit into accepting it where if you actually expect people to keep their word you’re the bad person.

To conclude, I think flaking should be more condemned and frowned upon rather than accepted as normal. Also flakey people are shit"

Over 90% of the products we buy were made in China. They make products from flimsy cheap plastics to advanced, expensively engineered devices. If the ccp falls, we won't have the cheap products we've been taking for granted for so long.

Maybe in the long run it will be better, as domestic markets will grow and countries will self sustain themselves with what they need (for the most part), but short term, we won't be able to afford anything.

I'd consume news from multiple countries and I was always up on the latest news and I  was always ready for a conversation regarding multiple geopolitical or domestic topics. 

A few months ago, I went on a media diet. 

I felt like I was overwhelmed with bad news, even though statistically the world is generally in a better place than it has been been throughout the 20th century (although that has changed a bit since 2020).

Outside of catching a dumb pundit's take on a meaningless story (usually the 2024 elections) or a long form youtube broadcast from Peter Zeihan or James Ker-Lindsay, I'm pretty ignorant to what's happening.  

I'll admit, I feel a bit dumber for not knowing what's happening in the world, but I also feel less stressed. I'm more focused on my 2 year old daughter, and my mind never fills with dread when I think about her future anymore. 

I have some friends on facebook who follow certain stories religiously and they seem like they're in a constant state of outrage, and I feel bad for them.

However, ignorance for me has been rather nice. Whenever I feel the urge to pop on BBC, Al Jazeera or read Reuters, I just turn on Netflix and watch Star Trek: The Next Generation. I'm a far calmer person because of it. "
42,2023-12-22,CMV: it's wild to me that more music labels don't foster their own communities for local listening parties,u/temporarycreature,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18octey/cmv_its_wild_to_me_that_more_music_labels_dont/,changemyview,"I'm not saying there aren't any, and I know fandom still exists in spades around our favorite artists, and I'm not claiming otherwise. What I'm saying is there are hundreds of smaller labels in the underground metal scene (Season of Mist, Deathwish inc, Nuclear Blast, Century Media, etc), smaller, but we're not talking self published small. 

So, it's wild to me that there aren't things going on with music releases these days unless it's a spectacle, and can be monetized in every imaginable way. These labels could with help with organizing things like in person listening parties for new releases at community centers, DIY ethos with some empowerment. Probably wouldn't be easy to do, and I'm not acting like it would be, but I'm sure they respectively have passionate fans and supporters who want to do this and would help carry the water. 

I think this because I can't be the exception. There are thousands of albums that come out every year, and it would really cool to organize third space type record listening parties to meet people into the same things you are, support the same music you're into, or help people expand tastes, and meet people at the same time. There is an epidemic of loneliness across the world, and art has always been powerful enough to bring us together. I just want to share so much of what I find, and see if it exposes the light in other people when they hear the same music. I'm craving human connection, and this is where my mind goes because this is what I would be into. I can't be the exception to wanting this kind of thing.

I guess the logistics of things like being demonstrated as nigh impossible would convince me otherwise, however, I have no issues in putting in the footwork to find a public space to play the music on my own, purchase the music on my own, or permission to stream in a listening party (managed by the labels). It could be awesome. With Zoom, artists could call in and say high for a few minutes around the week of the release. I can't be the exception to thinking this way. 

I guess demonstrating that this would not be a good solution for loneliness would change my mind, but music and community in other aspects, I feel, have saved my life, and have kept me going, and I'm just trying to spitball all of them into one idea, and this was it."

The homeless population is estimated to be[ around 90k](https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/basic-facts-about-homelessness-new-york-city/#:~:text=In%20October%202023%2C%20there%20were,each%20night%20in%20October%202023.). If these units were systematically made available to the homeless, no one in the city would be without a place to live, and there would be wiggle room for relocation on occasions when the units are, well, ""occasionally used"" by their owners. Even in areas with more homeless people than properties that are vacant for this reason, such a system could significantly reduce the number of people sleeping on the streets at night. 

There are many options for policies and practices that could help to make such a system secure and benefitial to the owners. Tax incentives for participating in the system (and penalties for opting out), publicly funded additional insurance for any damage to personal property within the unit, clinically trained coordinators to check in on the residents and help them navigate relocation, restrictions on what can be brought into the property, long-term housing and employment navigation services for the residents, and more. Obviously there might always be a subset of the population who are homeless because they're unable to work and don't have access to other income sources. But having housing would eliminate a significant barrier to unemployed homeless folks' ability to find jobs, which would in turn better position them to achieve longer-term housing stability. There is a lot of room for debate about which practices would best help to make the system work, but it is inexcusable that there are places in the US with more vacant vacation properties than homeless people."

\- My view concerns ONLY videogame (and movies, and comic books and other entertainment stuff) leaks.  
\- Leaking employees personal information is clearly wrong and I do not agree with that. Same thing with nudes and personal stuff -- so that ""what about personal pics?"" does not count.  
  
A lot of Insomniac content got leaked. This includes the roadmap for future games (some of them were already announced, like Wolverine), some game footage, concept arts and other stuff. The hacking clearly was wrong. But, once in the wild, it does not harm anyone to share that content. People knew that a Wolverine game was being made. And since it got leaked, it's ok to look at the footage. Some devs and content creators said that it was wrong to share because the company couldn't control the narrative around the game. That's true, but it isn't something inherently bad beside some business strategy.  
  
I think that MAYBE sharing that leaking content could do harm in something like corporate espionage, but again, it's game and entertainment stuff, it's nothing that could harm citizens or anything like that (it's not like the blueprint of a gun or anything). Besides from losing control of the narratives and marketing, there's no harm in sharing this kind (and only this kind) of leaked content. Change my view, I'm really open to changing it!"

39,2023-12-22,CMV: Freddy's is just a worse version of Culver's,u/PatNMahiney,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18opf45/cmv_freddys_is_just_a_worse_version_of_culvers/,changemyview,"So this is an unpopular opinion among people I know, but I think I have the evidence to back it up. 

Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers and Culver's are two well-established fast-food burger chains in the U.S. I don't think it's controversial to say that the two are pretty similar. Both chains started in the 50s. Both are most well-known for their frozen custard and hamburgers. And, in my opinion, their burgers taste *similar*. I'll get into differences later, but I think the burgers from these two restaurants taste more similar to each other than other fast-food burgers.

They're similar enough to be directly compared... but Culver's is better. Here are my reasons why:

1. **Culver's has better burgers** \- I'll try to be as objective as I can here. I think Culver's Butterburgers are better than Freddy's Steakburgers because of the patties, toppings, and bun. First the patties: My biggest issue with Freddy's patties is that they are too salty. Comparing the nutrition info for a double cheeseburger from both chains reveals that a Freddy's double has 1680mg of sodium, while a Culver's double has only 1050mg. That's a significant difference. Also, because Freddy's burger's have that crispy outer edge, they often spill out past the sides of the bun, while the Culver's patty usually fit the bun appropriately. Second, the toppings: Comparing their flagship burgers, the ""Freddy's Original"" comes with cheese, mustard, onion, and pickles. The ""Culver's Deluxe"" comes with cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickle, red onion, and mayo. The Culver's burger has a greater quantity and variety of toppings. Of course, both chains have other burgers with different topping combinations, but since most customers will just get the main varieties, I think this comparison is valid. Finally, the buns: The buns on a Culver's burger are just more substantial. They are more thick and more firm. This makes the burger feel more sturdy and premium as you're eating it.
2. **Culver's does custard better** \- I actually don't have an opinion about which chain has the better *tasting* custard. Again, both are similar. But Culver's has better customization and encourages customization more. On their website, Culver's lists 33 toppings you can add, while Freddy's only has 26. Plus (and I recognize this is anecdotal) I always feel that I am more openly invited to customize my custard with various toppings when I'm at Culver's. At Freddy's, I feel encouraged to just pick one of their pre-determined custard options. Not sure if this comes down to how information is displayed on the menus, but I've noticed the difference. Also, Freddy's custard has a crazy amount of sugar. It's hard to compare exactly between the two brands here, and both are unhealthy. But just look at the sugar content in Freddy's custard. It's concerning.
3. **Culver's has a bigger menu** \- Outside of their burgers and custard, Culver's also provides more options. Freddy's sells a few chicken sandwiches, hot dogs, and chicken strips. But Culver's? They sell chicken sandwiches, roast beef sandwiches, pork sandwiches, grilled cheese, corn-dogs, fish (both plates and sandwiches), and salads. They also have a bigger selection of sides, including all the sides that Freddy's offers PLUS mashed potatoes, broccoli, pretzel bites, and coleslaw. 
4. **Culver's has better fries** \- I expect this one will ruffle some feathers. But Freddy's shoestring fries are often too short, and that makes dipping and eating them tricky. I love shoestring fries when done right, but for some reason, every order of Freddy's fries has a significant number of very short fries. These are too short to use a decent amount of dipping sauce, and they're harder to grab out of the container. Culver's kind of winds by default here. Their fries are thicker, and that makes them easier to dip and eat. I realize that I'm favoring crinkle cut fries by saying this, and that pains me, but Freddy's fries just consistently let me down.

Humans with the vast complexity of our perceptions compared to animals, still succumb to a natural conflict as well. It's not as simple as that of a deer locked eyes with headlights at night, but it is an existential dread about some injustice we hone our intellects on.

What I mean by boon is the triumph when strife is overcome through struggle. Trees that blossom every spring after a hard winter, a thing that is embedded within all nature. We perceive obstacles or barriers and are weighed down by the prospects of failure. Perseverance, a trait found in almost all successful people, the ability to fail and endure.

We exist on this shifting scale balanced on strife and boon. It is where all of our lives take place in our own individual constant struggle. My view is that struggle is a natural part of life, there is an ignorance in humanity because our complex perspectives' focus on those struggles instead of thinking of ways to overcome, this is where I think a lot of people become sad or depressed, and why there is so much suffering ."

If his ideas come up at all, it's specifically to make fun of their obvious absurdity, and everyone seems to recognize that he just psychoanalyzed himself and applied his own problems to the entire ""human condition"". I suspect this was relatively easy to do because people are naturally repelled by how taboo much of what Freud discussed is.

Carl Jung, though... Carl Jung holds a bizarre sway over the Internet. In Jung's case there seems to be an implicit assumption that he was a trustworthy expert who uncovered fundamental truths about the human mind, rather than, y'know, a guy with a _literal_ god complex who chucked volumes upon volumes of made-up word salad into the early field of psychoanalysis.  

Supposedly (and I'd certainly hope so) in actual academia Jung isn't taken seriously at all, as it should be, and bringing him up would just get you a lot of eye rolls. But again, rather than that attitude being planted in the, uh... ""collective unconscious"" as it has been with Freud, there's just a vague veneer of truth which easily pulls people down into literal mysticism without them even realizing that it happened.  

The modern field of psychology should get together for a wide-reaching public statement on how absolutely baseless Jung's work was to clear the air. The level of misinformation is absurd."

It's the Nazis/Japanese, then the Soviet Union, then the Terrorists, and now very soon China.

China's TikTok and Temu are somewhat sputnik moments for America. America is still dominant in technology but China is catching up. Alas, some people are saying what a fascinating battle it will be. The new Cold War, fought by US and China.

Little did they know, this war is no contest, and I could tell before it had even started. Because Indians.

Actually, I don't mean Indians. I mean what Indians like Nadella, Nooyi, Vivek Vasrasramy, Nikki Haley, Pichai, Banga...

Need I say more? Let me state it plainly. The best of India wants to move to America. Not China. Extrapolating that: the brains and talents of the world want to move to America. Not China.

China's emergence can only rely on its own scientific and business elites. But the great US of A can rely on the world. Look how many Chinese academics, doctors, and SWE work in the USA. Do you see many Americans working in China in similar numbers?

How many Russian math wiz kids dream of making it big on Wall Street instead of the crowded streets of Lujiazui?

The US is a talent magnet for all. While China is a talent magnet for nationalistic and patriotic and brainwashed Chinese at best. Also, the birth rate in China is dropping and Taiwan doesn't want to be a part of China. Can you imagine California or Texas wanting to secede from the Union?

Ronald Reagan once said to a journalist: ""I am often criticised for not having a strategy vs the Soviet. Although you may not consider this a strategy, I do have one. My strategy is: we win, they lose"".

50 years from now, historians will look back at the ""new Cold war"" and say this: ""Geopolitics is where US and another supposedly great power struggle for supremacy. After about 10 years, the US end up winning.""

So what do you all think? The writing's on the wall. It's so simple: despite the many problems, the US is an attractive place while China is not unless you are Chinese."

I struggle with forgiving myself and I think I don't deserve to call myself decent person or feel comfortable. My main argument is fact that I don't know how my actions affected others. 

I am not proud of who I was. This year I started realizing that I was making mistakes for many years. Hitting little brother. I was 16. Stealing few bucks from shared tip jar when I worked as a server. I was 17. But I am in my early 20s now and not a teen. Harassed few people online with bigotry and  tran\*phobia. ( Censoring that word because posts around T. people are not allowed here, nothing against them ). I was lost and angry, but that is no justification. 

Those are just few examples. I am sure everyone makes mistakes at least once in their lives, but I feel like I did not even see who I was until recently, and I changed. I apologized to people I could. 

I texted someone k\*y\*s a year ago. that was moment I realized that I had to change. few days later I regretted it, but I forgot their username (And I deleted chat beforehand so I had no way to find them). And fact is I had and have no way to find out how my words affected this person. Yes it is 3 letter word that is used in toxic circles online, But when I was looking at posts / comments on reddit many people mentioned how It could cause someone who is on edge to actually do it. 

I made amends. I regret everything wrong I did. But I have no way check on everyone I hurt. I want to be a good person. Positive, caring and sympathetic, But I think I don't deserve to move on and see myself as good because I don't know if I actually caused real harm to that person.

Lavouisier always said that nothing is created or lost by nature,all it happens are transformations. But,then you reach the question:”How can something be transformed from nothing?” Or if the beginning was an exception to the rule,how does something emerge from nothing?Religious people try to use this as a proof of their god’s existence,but you only delay the question,how did this creator started existing in the first place?












Other people believe in the Matrix,but then,how did the “natural” universe emerge in the first before these beings made ours in their screens?No matter your hypothesis,you will ALWAYS go back to the same question,it’s a vicious cycle. I have a hypothesis,not trying to solve the paradox,but solve how it’s impossible for a human to understand.













First,let’s SUPPOSE the universe’s complexity is finite,because ignorance doesn’t exist,it’s the absence of knowledge,therefore you can’t know you are NOT aware about something. Now,let’s picture a hypothetical omniscient creature,since the universe’s complexity is finite,so does this creature’s intelligence. The problem is,even though the human being is biologically smartest animal on Earth,how do you figure out how big the gap between this creature’s intelligence and ours be?














It could be the same from a human to a chimpanzee,a human to most invertebrates OR EVEN HIGHER!It’s literally impossible for us to know,evolution only improves specific habilities through a demand from the environment. Human DNA focused on intelligence so we could be able to work together through prosocial behaviour,change the environment around us to our benefit and understand abstract concepts,but,how do we know our biological intelligence is enough to understand everything as long as we are teached about it?















No matter how hard they work with brain puzzles,a non-human animal will never be able to understand abstract concepts like history,or develop verbal language. To summarize,what if there’s indeed a logical explanation for the origin of everything,but our biological intelligence just never wired us to understand?We get confused about the Big Bang in the same way dogs get confused about television,there’s those strange humans and noises leaving a metal box with a square light in the center. It makes 0 sense for them.













Just like for us something emerging from nothing or infinite age(If it’s possible)makes 0 sense as well. It doesn’t matter how far our technology advances,we will never understand it because unlike the hypthetical omniscient creature,we just weren’t wired to understand it."

By moving a Navy ship into the South China Sea, the US forces all countries nearby to be defensive again. Millions of Ukrainian lives are dependent on whether the US approves military aid or not. And of course, by installing a few CIA agents in a foreign country, it has the capability to reshape the societal and political picture of a country completely. 

I would go further and say that this ignorance of American impact on the globe has allowed people in power, capitalists and politicians, to truly steer the foreign policy of the country."

I am talking about another entirely different issue to do with Israel.

1. For those unaware because of the current conflict in Gaza, the West Bank is currently under a (textbook) fascist Israeli occupation. This is implied because of Israeli's settlement expansions. In 1983, the settler population in the West Bank was 22,000. Last year, that number was estimated to be as high as 500,000, despite Israel agreeing with Palestine in 1996's Oslo Accords to not remove any settlements as long as expansions end.

2. Those settlements are built on top of destroyed, evicted or ethnically cleansed Palestinian lands. They were considered illegal by every country from 1967 until 2019 when Donald Trump declared support for them.

3. The ""International Community"" votes every year to condemn those settlements. This includes Europe, France, Germany, Ukraine, India, so on. The US and Canada were the only countries apart from a few small former Oceanasian/US colonies to not condemn them.

4. The settlements destroy Palestinian lives, property including farms and businesses, control Palestinian consumption (85% of the West Bank's GDP comes from Settlements- that money only goes to Israel), and every year hundreds of Palestinians get evicted for those settlements.

5. Hamas has no operations in the West Bank, that much is clear. Yet 350 Palestinians have died in that area since the start of the war 2 months ago. There are walls and security checkpoints separating the West Bank's settlements and many parts of the West Bank and all of them make a 5 minute walk take up to 30 minutes in security clearances and checkings. However, Israeli passports are free to navigate past these checkpoints as needed."

The symptoms of that disorder will be paralleled to some of his actions in earlier videos he made from 2020 to 2022:

**1.** **A grandiose sense of self-importance**  
  
He always portrays himself as an amazing guy in his videos, he brags about his ""accomplishments"" and always wants to hear from others, litteraly overexaggerates and even fakes his ""accomplishments"".

Which I do mostly agree with, until looks are mentioned. Most men will not date, love, or take care of a woman they consider to be ugly. Being traditionally feminine, showing vulnerability, anxiousness, or being shy is are traits that are not afforded to me or other women who are considered 'ugly'.

In my personal experience, men have always treated me as if I were invisible or nothing. I have been called ugly, made fun of, and many guys have played me.

Furthermore, I've found that I've had to make up for where I lack in looks with bettering myself as a person. Raising my self esteem, not being sensitive/developing a thick skin, being more blunt, and being aloof. I also fully acknowledge that these changes will not guarantee that I will find love, as many of these traits don't matter to men at all. I feel that it has made a few more people respect me as a friend though."

1,2023-12-23,"CMV: Ancient people were not ""weird"" for marrying early.",u/SteadfastEnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18pahiy/cmv_ancient_people_were_not_weird_for_marrying/,changemyview,"For clarification, when I refer to ""marrying early,"" I mean around age 18-25. Nobody should marry at an age like 10-13 (and unfortunately that's how it's done in some places, or in some historical eras.) 

I used to be an English teacher for refugee students from Burma, Somalia and Iraq. The marrying age for those students was much younger than here in America; my students typically got married around age 19-22. And from what I could tell, they were very stable and mature marriages - people who exhibited the maturity of thirty-year-olds (or even, forty-year olds) despite being just twenty. So even today, there are cultures that practice early marriage, and have successful marriages.

Looking at a historical angle: We often think of ancient people as ""weird"" for marrying early (say, age 18-23,) when the typical age of marriage in the modern Western world is like age 30-36, but in fact they had very good reason to do so. They were not ""weird"" at all, they were totally rational. Back then, infant-mortality rates were off the charts, so you needed as many babies as you could - perhaps no more than half of your babies would survive. Labor was all manual, so you needed more hands in the family to work the farm. Life expectancy was shorter, so if you were not going to live past age 63, it wouldn't make much sense to wait til age 40 to get married. 

A woman's biology has never changed: A woman is typically most fertile in her late teens and early 20s, and then that fertility goes into steady decline, typically ending around age 45. So if you were an ancient-era family and you wanted kids, you should be marrying and having sex at the early phase of the fertility window. And when a woman got to older age, fertility-prolonging techniques were not at all as high-tech or sophisticated as they are today (there was no egg-freezing, sperm banks, none of the advanced fertility drugs of today) so if you were a woman, you couldn't gamble on your fertility and say ""It's okay for me to keep working my career at age 37, even when I get to 39 or 42 I think I can still have kids"" (plus, of course, women's careers weren't a thing back then; this was pre-feminism.) 

Finally, there wasn't much purpose in delaying marriage til age 34 or 41 back in that era. What were you going to *do* with all that singleness? There were a lot less colleges, universities, careers for advancement, etc. - if even any at all, depending on your historical period. You weren't going to be jetting off on vacations or going on cruises. (A lot of people these days delay marriage because they feel marriage or kids would hamper their single-enjoyment of travel, hobbies, etc.)

After a quick check to make sure I hadn't made a mistake my son did his business and I had an epiphany, this made much more sense.

Children, up to a certain age, need to be escorted to the loo in public places, sometimes the person escorting them is the same sex sometimes they're not. It simplifies things if the toilets are unisex, there's no embarrassment of anyone having to go into the wrong toilet. All the loos are in stalls anyway so everyone's privacy is maintained, I can't think of any downside, just up."

Evolution says that overtime genetic mutations happen and whichever helps you make more off spring will be passed on. 

Selective breeding is using this principle but it's more like forced evolution. To make dogs we breed wild canines with traits we desire till we get a dog. This is literally what evolution states is the case. 

In family trees we have mutations based on recessive traits, mixed family genetics, or sometimes environment. Animals in chenobyl have started to mutate due to radiation. People who encounter radiation if not dying often have mutations that influence children. 

Addam and Eve if they are according to religion are father&Mother of humanity had kids. Those kids had kids and so on. Now if evolution didn't exist all those children would be carbon copies but they are not. They all look different because we are not one cell organisms. 

So saying you do not believe in evolution means. 

*You don't believe in Addam and Eve. 
*It means you do not believe family trees exist and all records are fabricated. 
*That radiation and pollution causing mutations is a fantasy. 
*That dogs are not real and we are all having a mass dullusion that they exist. 
*Also that science is all a lie
*Also think that GMOs are a conspiracy theory 

Which I not sure how any human can think this becuase most people have at the least seen or heard of dogs. So dogs must be real."

In systems that are not independent, time is influenced by the overall change of all existing properties within the set of systems. If no change can be determined, no time has passed. Change is not reliant on a single object or system, but rather how it interacts with the changes of others.

The reason I won't be voting for Joe Biden is his blind and ultimate loyalty to Israel. I understand this is highly sensitive and controversial. I am an average Arab American with no expertise in politics, military, media, writing, or technology. Forgive me if I say something dumb. 
I am not alone in my decision to not vote for Joe Biden, so many Muslims, Arabs, and young people have started to call him Genocide Joe. This is not a simple issue, and I am not a single-issue voter, but I cannot ignore the atrocities committed by the Israeli government that are ignored by Biden, his administration, and other dems in Gaza. I have nothing against Jews and Israel, and I respect their right to exist and coexist peacefully. However, I strongly condemn the ongoing ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, which Biden supports financially and militarily. 
 
One of the main reasons I am not voting for Biden is his hypocrisy and double standards on human rights. He was rightfully quick to condemn Russia for its aggression in Ukraine. However, he turned a blind eye to the much worse and documented violence against civilians, journalists, health workers, UN workers, and religious minorities in Gaza. He ignored the use of white phosphorus, a banned chemical weapon, and the bombing of schools, UN shelters, hospitals, mosques, churches, and safe passages. He also ignored the worldwide and domestic calls for a ceasefire, and vetoed the UN Security Council resolution that demanded an end to the hostilities and additionally repeatedly affirmed himself as a zionist. Not only that, but he even gave the green light to Israel to continue the destruction of life and property in Gaza, by approving and sending many more and weapons and ammunition. 
 
Another reason I am not voting for Biden is his indifference and complicity in the increased settlers’ violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. Innocent Palestinians are being literally murdered, evicted, and harassed by extremist settlers, who are backed by the Israeli army and government. Biden has done nothing to stop or prevent these crimes, or to hold the perpetrators accountable. He has also failed to support the legitimate rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people, such as self-determination, statehood, and sovereignty. He has sided with Israel on every major issue. 
 
Biden lacks moral courage and political will to stand for justice and peace. They need to do something, but they are afraid of the powerful pro-Israel lobby and the electoral consequences. They value their own power and interests more than the lives and dignity of millions of oppressed and suffering people. Likewise, they are willing to sacrifice the principles and values that they claim to uphold and defend, such as democracy, human rights, and international law. They are also betraying the trust and support of millions of Americans, especially Muslims, Arabs, young people and even thousands of American Jews, who voted for them in the hope of change and progress and live in battle ground states. 
 
In conclusion, I voted for him in 2020, but have decided not to vote for Joe Biden, because I cannot support a candidate who is complicit in the genocide of Palestinians, who is hypocritical and indifferent to their plight, and who is cowardly and selfish in his policies. I am not alone in this decision, and I am not voting for Trump or the Republicans either. And yes, Trump and the republicans are a lot worse for the Palestinians, but at least they are honest and open about it. In comparison, Dems are wolf in sheep's clothing. I hope that Biden and the Democrats lose the election and learn from their mistakes. I hope that they will realize that they cannot ignore or alienate their constituents, especially the minorities and young people, who have legitimate grievances and demands."

Whilst it is true that there are some routine we do in life, in the end of the day, we will change. Or, the world around us will change; we have no option than to adapt.

Our life and the world is constantly changing, navigating change is easier done with a project than assuming routinity.

Additionally, treating life as a project implies that there is agency within that drive us into a specific goal.

Thus, treating life as a project is better (humane, natural) than looking it as a routinity."

20% of men haven't had sex in the past year, 60% are single. The ""cost"" of having sex for men is high, they need to compete to be attractive to the opposite sex, but women find 80% of men below average.   
The ""price"" of sex is relatively high for men, and many choose not to play that game, or worse, they try to break the rules on the game. Demand is in excess for women, and offer is scarce for men. 

Prostitution helps lowers this price by making it accessible to everyone, and allowing market conditions to drive the price down by enabling unlimited offer to enter the market, therefore equalizing access to sexual health. If there is an offer at $80, there will be another at $75, another at $70, and so on.

If you could get sex like you can get a massage, in a way that's hygienic and provided professionally, men would have better sexual wellbeing and women would stop being harassed and solicited from unwanted suitors, leading to a more functional society. "

Geographic Reasons: Europe's longitude lies between 10°W and 10°E, while Japan's longitude is about 140°E, which means Japan is almost the opposite side of Europe. Moreover, if you go west from Japan, you have to pass through Russia, China and Middle East, which all reject Japanese culture due to historical and religious reasons. If you go east from Japan, you have to pass through USA, which is a great absorber of Japanese culture and she also produced their own American Culture which influences Europe a lot. Cultural barriers hinder spreading of animes.

2. Time Zones Conflict: Japan's timezone is UTC+9, while (West) Europe's timezone is UTC+0 to UTC+1, a typical anime is on air at night on weekdays. However, as Europe's time is 8-9 hours behind Japan's time. If Europeans want to watch anime on live, they have to watch it at lunchtime, which most people are busy on work. 

3. Left vs Right Conflict: Japan is a more conservative country, while Europe is most likely liberal. Europeans may hate about anime's lewd or materialization of women identity. They may also think anime is a bad hobby due to potential addiction. This may hinder Europeans interest towards Japanese anime.

He breaks her stuff, is always in her space, and never leaves her or us alone when we hang out. Not to mention the financial burden that he has created. My friend can no longer get Starbucks every day like she used to, or go on the shopping sprees that we would go on together. Her parents also ask her to babysit (paid) but it’s annoying. Nothing makes this kid happy. Hell, you could give him every toy in the world and he would still have a tantrum. This thing has made her life hell to the point where she lives at my house now (spare bedroom and my parents love having her around). All her brother does is scream about how his big sisters don’t love him (he views me as a sibling for some reason). Her parents also pay much less attention to her because of him. She has lost so much because of him. But, I also understand wanting to have a child if you had your first when you were young or when you were not ready to be a parent. However, older children’s needs tend to get neglected because of the new baby (my friend was meant to be an example of this).

1. Erosion of institutions: When democratic institutions, such as an independent judiciary, free press, and impartial electoral bodies, are weakened or undermined, it can signal a decline in democracy. This can happen through political interference, corruption, or the concentration of power in the hands of a few.

2. Restricted civil liberties: Democracy thrives on the protection of civil liberties, including freedom of speech, assembly, and association. If these rights are curtailed, dissenting voices are suppressed, or political opposition is marginalized, it can be an indication of democratic decay.

3. Concentration of power: When power becomes concentrated in the hands of a few individuals or political party, with limited checks and balances, it can lead to authoritarian tendencies and undermine the democratic principles of accountability and transparency.

4. Polarization and populism: If society becomes increasingly divided along ideological lines, with political leaders exploiting these divisions for personal gain, it can erode the inclusive nature of democracy and hinder constructive dialogue and compromise.

5. Declining trust and participation: When citizens lose trust in democratic institutions, fail to engage in meaningful political participation, and become apathetic towards the democratic process, it can weaken the foundation of democracy and make it more susceptible to decay."

They are normal people, but in the back of my mind I'm a little scared about what they do and why they do it.

I met them because they were my (now ex) boyfriend's friends. He is now my ex because he was emotionally abusive, scary, didn't respect me, and absolutely didn't respect my consent. He was one of the first people to really explain BDSM to me, though he never actually did it with anyone before. His friends who are into it tried to explain a little but not enough for me to really understand.

My ex said that he has whips that he uses on himself, and it was healthy. He said he ""needed"" to flog himself, because he was abused as a child (his father whipped him) and it was therapeutic. He said that people do BDSM to re-live their traumas and overcome them. I found this very creepy and don't understand. He keeps the whips in a drawer in his room. He told me that his best friend (one who actually did BDSM, for decades) is a sadist and needs to do BDSM to function in society. He said that people need to get this out in a healthy way. He calls it healthy and necessary. 

While making out, a couple times he put his hands around my neck but didn't squeeze hard. He said a couple times before that he liked the idea of choking. I am absolutely not okay with being choked, especially by surprise, and I never before said I was okay with it. I told him to not put his hands around my neck and he got upset, and would try to do it again on another day. He also pulled my hair a few times during sex, without my consent and by surprise. It hurt and I didn't like it, but I just found it so out of place it was kinda funny, and I just bluntly said, ""Ow,"" in the least sexy tone I could manage. I told him I didn't like him pulling my hair. He also spanked me a lot of times without my consent. 

The way he talked about BDSM scared me. He as a person scared me. He was 33 and I was 18, and he was my first kiss, and took my virginity. All sexual and intimate experiences were brand new to me.

That's some backstory about my opinion on BDSM. Back to the main point though. I looked at some BDSM stuff on reddit to try to see what it was, and it really scared me. It looked like stuff similar to the movie Saw, or other horror movies. People like pain, and need to experience it to be healthy and function? People like hurting other people? I don't know why this is sexy, I don't know why it's healthy. 

I want to be understanding and not judge people. I learned that if I'm really scared of something, often times it's my imagination making it out to be something worse than reality. Also my ex got really mad at me not liking BDSM, and said I was a bigot.

I want to understand and not be scared. Please, help change my view."

From what I could gather, the technological progress of humanity has been on its own exponential curve since day 0 (The first significant breakthrough in our tools and ways of thought). We've seen more change in the last 100 years, than any other time period in human history, and this is due to the nature of  incremental progress and the compounding effects for technological and scientific advancement. With the advancements made in AI in the past year, a likely scenario that we are already experiencing is a paradigm shift in human history and the human experience. This is not a conspiracy theory or some over exaggeration, the science and evidence is present (I encourage those interested to look into the technological progress that has occurred this year, compared to years prior). 

At this rate, I predict (based on current trends) that we will see the creation of a general artificial intelligence, that surpasses the collective intelligence of all humans, in the next decade, if not by 2025."

This is coming from a super nerdy person.

What generally defines someone as nerdy is being smart and geeky, and somewhat introverted. While people like this were definitely the bottom of social hierarchies in the past, they are no longer the underdogs. I know plenty of nerds who are really popular and well liked while being open about their geeky nature.

But nerdy people who aren’t well liked act like nerds are societally discriminated against. Which simply isn’t true. I’ve run into people with this mentality too often to ignore it. And it starts at an early age for many of these people. My concern for this issue will always be informed by a childhood story of mine. 

I remember back in fifth grade a kid who I’ll call John. I was talking to him once, and he told me that the whole school bullied him because he’s smart/geeky. This was in no way true. (Not that he wasn’t smart or geeky, because believe me he was both.) But people did not bully him, they just avoided him because he had zero social skills. (Often had one-sided conversations about his favorite video games, constantly interrupted and “well-actually”ed people, etc.) The closest thing to bullying he got was people calling him out on these things. 

I talked to John about it, and figured out the delusion of being bullied for his IQ/Geekiness came from his parents trying to make him feel better about getting feedback for being kind of an asshole. I’m sure this has happened to thousands of other kids with lazy parents who develop this victim complex in their minds as a result.

What makes it problematic is how much it holds people back. If John’s parents gave him actual advice as opposed to their lie, he could have worked to improve his social skills to become well-liked and make good friends. I ran into him recently and he’s only gone further down that bad path, still lonely and convinced it’s because he’s a nerd.

My point is, if you feel rejected by society and are convinced it’s because of your nerdiness, re-examine it. It’ll take you far, as it did for me. I was convinced of this for a long time, and it held me back. I’m doing a lot better now."

1,2023-12-23,"CMV: General Relativity and the known laws of physics entail a beginning to spacetime and matter itself, and thus a transcendent cause.",u/TheGodHuman,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18pn7el/cmv_general_relativity_and_the_known_laws_of/,changemyview,"My thesis is the title in the post. While William Lane Craig's philosophical arguments for a past-eternal universe are convincing, I will address the science in this post. First, here are some definitions.

* Definition of God: A timeless, eternal, spaceless, immaterial, powerful, transcendent and personal Creator.
* Definition of the universe: all space, time and matter.

Space-time itself had an absolute beginning a finite ago. Here is a weak version of the argument:

1. If the universe began to exist, it has a cause.
2. The universe began to exist.
3. So, the universe has a cause.

As the cause of space, time and matter, the cause must be timeless (and thus eternal/beginningless), spaceless, immaterial, powerful (since the cause produced space, time and matter), transcendent and personal. This cause must be personal because if this cause always had the power and preconditions to create the universe in eternity past but was impersonal, then the effect should also be eternal past. The fact that the effect is finite to the past suggests that the cause had free will to create and chose to do so, implying a personal agent.

If one says that there can be no cause without spacetime and matter, that would mean that beginning of spacetime and matter did not have a cause, and simply came into being uncaused from nothing, which violates the law of causality, a *metaphysical* principle, and renders one's worldview to absurdity.

Further, this argument is not a God of the gaps. The term God of the gaps was created by Christians to criticize other Christian arguments. The term applied to arguments which appealed to a gap in scientific knowledge as evidence for God. A common example used today is the argument “science has no explanation for the origin of life, therefore it must have been God”. This gap in knowledge is then taken as evidence for God and so it is a God of the gaps argument. The problem is that is not what the argument does. The argument actually appeals to what we do know about causation and the law of non contradiction rather than a gap in scientific knowledge. If the argument was “science has no explanation for what causes the universe therefore is must be God,” then that would be God of the gaps. But the Kalam doesn’t do this. Instead it appeals to what we know about causation and the law of non contradiction to rule out the cause being temporal, spacial and material.

# Scientific Evidence.

The Standard Model is the most popular model of cosmic origins, with an initial singularity and a beginning to spacetime and matter. This model takes seriously the predictions made by General Relativity, which (with observations) predicts that all space, time and matter had a beginning a finite time ago. The late great Stephen Hawking says in his famous book *A Brief History of Time* (1988):

>The final result was a joint paper by Penrose and myself in 1970, which at last proved that there must have been a big bang singularity provided only that general relativity is correct and the universe contains as much matter as we observe. There was a lot of opposition to our work, partly from the Russians because of their Marxist belief in scientific determinism, and partly from people who felt that the whole idea of singularities was repugnant and spoiled the beauty of Einstein’s theory. However, one cannot really argue with a mathematical theorem. So in the end our work became generally accepted and nowadays nearly everyone assumes that the universe started with a big bang singularity. . .

In the 1980s however, Alan Guth theorized a phase before the Planck time known as ""inflation."" Inflation, according to the Standard Model, takes place after the creation of matter, space, and time. It is true that some physicists fold inflation into a theory of an eternal universe. But that is not true of most. And it should also be pointed out that, while the inflationary theory is widely accepted, a goodly number of physicists reject it. But the concept of inflation did change things a bit: if it is correct, then one *can theoretically* get rid of the initial singularity and replace it with the end of an earlier epoch of inflation. But this raises the question: can you get rid of singularities in altogether, and make the universe infinitely old (again, *if* inflation is to be accepted)? A [theorem produced by Alvine Borde, Alan Guth, and Alexander Vilenkin](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0110012) showed that the answer is NO, as long as the universe is expanding and the known laws of physics hold, one can push the singularity as far back as one likes, but one can't get rid of it. In a [1994 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9312022), Arvine Borde and Alexander Vilenkin showed that most ""almost all points in the inflating region will have a singularity somewhere in their pasts"" (p. 3307). In other words, most, but not all, null and timelike geodesics are past incomplete. However, the aforementioned 2003 paper showed ""that null and timelike geodesics are, in general, past-incomplete in inflationary models, whether or not energy conditions hold, provided only that the averaged expansion condition Hav > 0 holds along these past-directed geodesics. This is a stronger conclusion than the one arrived at in previous work in that we have shown under reasonable assumptions that almost all causal geodesics, when extended to the past of an arbitrary point, reach the boundary of the inflating region of spacetime in a finite proper time (finite affine length, in the null case)"" (p. 3).

Of course, atheist physicists readily began searching for loopholes in light of this theorem, one classic example being Sean Carroll. The loopholes quickly spread in popularity after this, ranging from an emergent universe, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, etc. These options were all shut down by a [2012 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.4658) \- co-authored by Vilenkin. Sean Carroll and Chen then developed another loophole. But Vilenkin closed this Carroll/Chen loophole in a [2013 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3836). William H. Kinney also recently expanded the BGV in a [2021 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15380) to certain kinds of bouncing cosmologies that weren't covered by Vilenkin (such as the one produced by Ijjas and Steinhardt), with cycles of expansion and contraction, showing that these too have a singularity lurking in their past assuming the known laws of physics still hold. William Kinney also extended the BGV theorem in a [2023 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10958) to rule out Roger Penrose's CCC mode. In a 2015 [Inference article](https://inference-review.com/article/the-beginning-of-the-universe), Alexander Vilenkin wrote that ""we have no viable models of an eternal universe. The BGV theorem gives us reason to believe that such models simply cannot be constructed."" Later still, in 2017, Vilenkin wrote, “Many people once again hoped that maybe on a far greater scale the universe is indeed eternal--with ancestor bubbles nucleating ad infinitum into the past. Now, however, we know that this is not possible. And once again, the beginning of the universe must be tackled head on"" - Delia Perlov and Alex Vilenkin, *Cosmology for the Curious*. p. 333.

There have been many attempts to claim that a popular Christian philosopher named William Lane Craig misrepresents the theorem in citing it in support for an absolute beginning with an initial singularity. It is claimed that the theorem only provides evidence for inflation having a beginning. However, Craig has never cited the BGV as *proof* of an absolute beginning, only as evidence to make the second premise more plausible than its negation, and he admits in numerous works that there are models that can evade the theorem. Further, Alexander Vilenkin explicitly said that Craig was not misrepresenting the theorem when he says (recorded in a [Reasonable Faith article](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/question-answer/honesty-transparency-full-disclosure-and-the-borde-guth-vilenkin-theorem)): ""I think you represented what I wrote about the BGV theorem in my papers and to you personally very accurately.""

So what is the deal here? The BGV assumes a classical spacetime and General Relativity. Some physicists, like Sean Carroll, want us to imagine that before the Planck time, classical spacetime breaks down, and therefore the predictions of General Relativity do not apply. Thus, Carroll wants us to imagine that before the Planck time, we have different laws of physics, laws of physics that (a) we can't currently be described, (b) have no evidence supporting their postulation, and (c) contradict known laws of physics, that govern the early universe, which can avoid an initial singularity and an absolute beginning to spacetime and matter. In effect, Carroll says, ""yes, an eternal universe contradicts the laws of physics, but we can imagine, can't we, a never-never land in which these laws don't apply? Well, then, let's do so!"" He asks to believe that other laws than those we know by science and observation, laws which he himself admits he does not know and cannot describe, must have operated in the past. His model even requires time itself going backward. I think it's obvious that Carroll is trying to get off the hook of an unwanted conclusion. So, as Carroll's arguments assume, we must say that the known physics point to a beginning of spacetime and matter.

In the end though, I think it is important to note that these are highly technical debates, which not only non-physicists are not in a position to judge, but often not even physicists within a slightly different field of specialization. So I don't think it is really possible for a layperson to follow or judge these debates. So I think, if one keeps in mind the non-conclusive nature of all science, the fact that the current standard model posits a past-finite universe can very legitimately be regarded as (rather stunning) confirmation of the biblical revelation of creation at a point in time.

How does Alexander Vilenkin think space, time and matter came into being without a God? He thinks that the universe quantum tunneled out ""nothing."" How does he define nothing? In [this 2012 article](https://now.tufts.edu/2012/05/29/beginning-was-beginning), Alexander Vilenkin says,

>""I say “nothing” in quotations because the nothing that we were referring to here is the absence of matter, space and time. That is as close to nothing as you can get, but what is still required here is the laws of physics. So the laws of physics should still be there, and they are definitely not nothing.""

In his techical work, the ""laws of physics"" he refers to is a timeless, space-less, immaterial, transcendent realm of mathematical possibilities, called superspace. For example, Alexander Vilenkin, who thinks that even inflation must have a beginning, writes at the end of his book *Many Worlds in One*:

>The picture of quantum tunneling from nothing raises another intriguing question. The tunneling process is governed by the same fundamental laws that describe the subsequent evolution of the universe. It follows that the laws should be “there” even prior to the universe itself. Does this mean that the laws are not mere descriptions of reality and can have an independent existence of their own? In the absence of space, time, and matter, what tablets could they be written upon? The laws are expressed in the form of mathematical equations. If the medium of mathematics is the mind, does this mean that mind should predate the universe?

What is this ""quantum tunneling from nothing""? The ""nothing"" being proposed by e.g., Hawking and Vilenkin (the super space) is actually not a part of nature. The nothing being proposed indeed is without space, time and matter. It's called superspace, a timeless, space-less, immaterial, transcendent realm of mathematical possibilities. Stephen Hawking takes the same tack as Alexander Vilenkin, in his 2010 book titled *The Grand Design*, coauthored with Leonard Mlodinow. They wrote: “Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing."" Lawrence Krauss echoes this claim: “The laws themselves require our universe to come into existence, to develop and evolve” - Krauss, *A Universe from Nothing*, p. 142. Here is what a physicist named Ikjyot Singh Kohli says in a [2015 review](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6091) on Krauss’ book,

>""The concept of superspace is not mentioned a single time, even though this is the entire geometric structure for which the proposal he is putting forward of a universe coming from nothing is based upon"" (p. 3).

And,

>""Krauss' Nothing on some occasions is the quantum vacuum, and on other occasions, it is the minisuperspace of the WDW formalism. In either case, Krauss does not bother to address the underlying laws of physics/mathematics that govern these principles, nor does he bother to point out that none of his claims are testable, which is absolutely key for a theory to be considered scientific. For these reasons, we strongly believe that Krauss’ book is largely motivated by a particular set of philosophical ideologies of which principles from science are being extrapolated at best to support these arguments, which by the end of the day, the reader hopefully will realize are filled with all sorts of gaping holes and incorrect notions"" (p. 10).

The problem with this though is that abstract objects do not stand in any causal relationship with anything concrete —the law of conservation of momentum does not cause a billiard ball to move when another ball hits it, for example. Mathematical possibilities cannot cause the universe. Further, unless the cause has free will, no effect could arise out of a timeless state. Lastly, the laws of nature typically are taken as being merely descriptive in science. So how can they exist without what they describe?

Meanwhile, back to Hawking. Hawking, in an interview titled: '['If there's an edge to the universe, there must be a God (interview with Renee Weber)](https://www.the-scientist.com/books-etc/god-as-the-edge-of-the-universe-63996),"" in *Dialogues with Scientists and Sages* (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1986), pp. 201-216, says, ""WEBER: Why is it so important whether there is or is not an edge to space-time? HAWKING: It obviously matters because if there is an edge somebody has to decide what should happen at the edge. You would really have to invoke God.""

How does Hawking get around the conclusion that God exists, given the singularity on the Standard Model, partially inspired by his own work? Eventually, Hawking introduced imaginary time into one of Einstein’s mathematical expressions that describes the curvature of spacetime. Hawking then simply equated time with imaginary time (t = iτ) to make it possible to calculate the probabilities associated with different possible early states of the universe. Mathematicians call this transformation a “Wick rotation.” In *A Brief History of Time*, Hawking presented this result as a challenge to the idea that the universe had a definite beginning in time. He argued that this mathematical model implied the universe would not, therefore, need a transcendent creator to explain its origin. After he explained how this mathematical manipulation eliminated the singularity, he famously observed, “So long as the universe had a beginning, we would suppose it had a creator. But if the universe is really completely self-contained, having no boundary or edge, it would have neither beginning nor end; it would simply be. What place, then, for a creator?"" (pp. 140-141).

The problem with though is twofold. First, as Hawking admits, the use of imaginary time functions in mathematics is merely a ""mathematical device (or trick)"" - Hawking, *A Brief History of Time*, p. 136. Second, imaginary numbers have no real-world referent and so have no physical meaning. As hawking explained, ""Imaginary numbers are a mathematical construction. You can't have an imaginary number credit card bill"" - Hawking, *The Universe in a Nutshell*, p. 59. Hawking also acknowledged that once his mathematical depiction of the geometry of space is transformed back into the actual physical realm with a real-time variable—the singularity comes back! As Hawking says, “When one goes back to the real time in which we live, however, there will still appear to be singularities"" - Hawking, *A Brief History of Time*, p. 136.

To summarize, let me lay out these six points. First, the past-finite universe was discovered in the early part of the twentieth century, through the work of such giants as the Catholic priest George Lemaitre, etc.

Second, the past-finite universe is now, and has been ever since the early part of the last century, the Standard Model of cosmic origins. Yes, there are dissenters among physicists, but that doesn't change the near consensus. Colin Rourke, *The Geometry of the Universe Colin Rourke* (World Scientific Publishing Company, 2021), pp. 29-30: “The current consensus model for the universe uses the FLRW metric and also starts from a Big Bang singularity and (as remarked earlier) includes an inflationary phase which was added to fix a serious problem with smoothing out the early universe.”

Third, scientific knowledge is the reason it is the Standard Model. The red-shift is an observed fact, and unless the known laws of physics can be violated, the necessity of a past-finite universe that it entails, given those laws of physics, is a fact. Some of those laws include the standard thermodynamics, the standard gravity theory, and the standard nuclear physics.

Fourth, the fact that the universe is past-finite, which means that without the universe's coming into existence, there was nothing, and so necessarily entails that matter, space, and time are past- finite. For the universe is by definition the aggregate of matter and space, and time is only possible within the context of space and matter.

Fifth, the great majority of scientists would agree more or less with points one to four above. For instance, the atheist physicist Lawrence Krauss, in his book *A Universe from Nothing*, takes all of the above for granted.

Sixth, the past-finite universe has massive religious, existential, and moral implications, because it entails the existence of a transcendently powerful creator which resembles the God of Abrahamic faiths. In human beings, the intellect does not operate independently, but is moved by the heart and the will. And physicists are human beings. Some find point six so terrifying that they are willing to descend into irrationality and insanity rather than follow the science to its logical conclusion, such as positing super space or claiming that the universe could come into being uncaused (like Lawrence Krauss has), denying the law of causality."

The use of Apple Car Play and Android Auto have changed the car landscape permanently. 

Though the regulations that require backup cameras have contributed to the size of the screen, that system’s run time is significantly lower compared to other functions. Another way said, most of the time we are using the screen it’s not for the camera. 

I unfortunately do not have data on the correlation to increased screen size. One alternative way we could track the same result is the change in distracted driving collisions.  However, that data might be skewed because inaccurate reporting.

I want people to try and change my view about destiny/fate so I hold on to hope a little longer and don't end up dead.

Childhood: used to be a normal kid; friends, popularity, str8 As, leadership, functional family until out of nowhere I developed social anxiety. Began losing all my friends, 4 remained but I still became an introvert so I created this coping mechanism of fantasying about the life I wanted and daydreaming about music, boybands, tv characters, movies and such. After spending lunch time alone, being forced into working groups at school, being bullied by girls, disliked by boys, I would just go into my room after school and live in my fantasy world. My grandfather and female cousin also SA me multiple times and I just began hating myself. I would have suicidal thoughts and cry in my room asking God: ""why me?"" ""what happened?"" but tv shows, movies and music were always there to comfort me so I depended on that obsessively, even closed my eyes and pretended to sleep to fantasize about characters, boybands and fanfics. I also discovered p\*rn, became obsessed with it and started t\*uching myself at a young age. I should point that I had amazing happy moments with my older sister and 4 school friends, but I was still depressed.

**Adolescence:** everything remained the same but my social anxiety became phobia by that point. Parents noticed my introversion so they sent me to therapy which didn't work bc he was an assh\*le. I was heavily depressed and the su\*cidal thoughts became more persistent. I converted to atheism and began to hate god. In senior year, tried cigarettes and weed and they also became my coping source. So my main source of happiness being a teenager were mainly: the only 4 friends who stayed, made up scenarios in my head about tv show characters and band members, p\*rn, mast\*rbation, cigarettes and weed. At 16/17 I was admitted to a mental institution after confessing my therapist my fascination with death and just not feeling anything. I thought it'd be bad, but it actually helped me with my social anxiety a lot.

**College:** still depressed and anxious, but my socials skills got better. I made my first girlfriend, and established a college group. The interactions were mainly there, but I still hanged out with them. The second girlfriend I made, I, fell in love with, hard, my first time being in love. She was straight so I knew it wouldn't go anywhere, but imagine hating your life, and there's this one person you're sexually attracted to, that comforts you, makes you laugh in your miserable life and cares about you. Even if I managed to meet new people and form relationships, I still didn't go out. Social anxiety was still there, but my two childhood best friends who were also in the same college, already had made this massive group of friends and they hanged out all weekends but we were divided in groups so we were not actually together in classes just saw each other any other day on hallways. The fact that I made ""friends"" but I still never went out with them outside the college setting, and that I was in love with a girl id knew I could never have, made my depression worse. Me, a Str8 As student, began skipping classes and just not paying attention altogether. My 2 girlfriends they showed concern, but I was so bad I even got myself to believe, they were just being nice and didn't actually care about me. For the first time in my life, I failed 3 classes, in pre-med because I just didn't care anymore. After seeing my parents disappointed faces, knowing they have another daughter who's older and actually became a successful person, I couldn't take it anymore. So, went into a depressive crisis, smoked a blunt in my own room, looked up in google ""why do ppl k\*ll themselves"" and then took my dads firearm and shot myself in the chest because ""nobody cared"", and my family would be better off without me. I did it while a beloved aunt was in the house; almost died, lost 4.5 litters of blood, but I survived (missed the heart). Everyone told me my parents were devastated, they were in disbelief, they were destroyed when they found out. They almost died bc I almost died by my own terms. I was introduced to a new psychiatrist and diagnosed with major depression and she changed my medications.

**Adulthood:** after I recovered, and was discharged from the hospital. I was obviously ashamed to look my parents in the eyes (my sister was abroad doing a master in Korea) but we talked about it and I promised id never do it again. My aunt told me it was a miracle, because it was just her in the house, she doesn't drive, 911 was taking too long while I was bleeding out and her husband picked up the phone so he could come over and take me to the ER because ""Something"" told him to pick it up (he was jogging and left his phone at his car). She also told me my dog was depressed the days I wasn't home like, he knew something had happened. I was still depressed, but the doctor told me the medications aren't like drugs, and they take a while to do effect. To not make the story longer, that suicide attempt changed my life, because I was now being given the proper medication.

One day I was at college, and it was my befriends birthday, I wasn't planning on going due to the view I had of how people perceived me (nobody will like me...bla bla). But attending that birthday party changed everything for me. I got drunk for the first time and bonded with a lot of people that up to this day are dear friends of mine. I began experiencing the teenager/young adult experience: going to parties, getting home late in the morning, getting blasted, high as a kite and just having fun, and made an incredible solid group of friends (13) which I owe my happiness to. That first girlfriend who I truly believed was just being nice to me, Is one of my closest friends now. I overcame my social anxiety a whole lot, and even began bonding with other people outside college and with other college classmates as well. I could finally show my true personality that was hidden behind that insecure socially awkward girl: the clown of class, the life of the party, an extremely funny and fun to be around extroverted person. I had the time of my life. I had my firsts hookups (which I thought was never going to happen) and have maybe made out with like over 15 people (including my friends). I had a hell of a ride, having the best moments of my life, laughing, having fun with my friends whom say im the funniest person they know and I consider them to be my life (they obv don't know this) but I experienced true happiness for the first time after decades, and I even began believing in God again (not religious), and thanked him for giving me what I've been wanting to experience for so long after suffering in silence for so long.

**What changed?** I went into remission and it was the best news I had ever heard. My doctor took me off my meds so I felt that I could finally live a totally normal life, I wasn't sick anymore, I got cured. 1 year and a half passed by, and same thing, just having fun with friends and family, I felt I acquired that popularity I longed for so long. My family got wealthier, my friends new about it and I just felt powerful, it felt good. But as time went by, things started to change. I began to have paranoid, compulsive negative thoughts, and I started to become aware of things again. To make it short, since it's a little blurry even to me, my 22nd birthday was one of the worst days of my life. A close friend of mine and I rented a Villa bc our birthdays are close, and we got off the city to a fancy rich neighborhood. There were a lot of people, but my social anxiety kicked in and I couldn't socialize with anyone, I was anxious as hell and really self conscious, and felt really left out. My girlfriends were talking about hooking up with foreigners on a dating app, and I just didn't feel comfortable with that. The only thing I enjoyed from those 2 days was getting drunk on the beach. I was having suicidal thoughts that day, and the ride back home was the longest trip you just want it to end, there were all talking and laughing and I was just quiet. When I got home, I cried a lot, and was extremely paranoid and delirious, worst part, my parents were abroad, so I had the house all to myself and I was afraid of what I could do. I began feeling bad about myself again, and began having this delirious thoughts of being killed while walking my dog, when I was driving I thought I would have an accident because god wanted me to die. So I sought help, and my psychiatrist confirmed that my depression was biological, and added OCD and psychosis to my diagnosis. She told me it was dangerous for me to be alone so they called an aunt (rest in peace) to watch over me.

**Current situation**: Since it was confirmed to me all my conditions are biological and that I can't basically be off meds, life hasn't been the same. I still struggle with making friends other than the ones god gave me as a present, I still have to rely on alcohol. And the few times I've tried engaging with other people while being sober (when my social anxiety were on its lowest levels), we just didn't connect. They laugh at my jokes, we vibe and have a good time but they never text me back, or reach me to hang out again, as oppose to my friends who meet new people, instantly click and become a group. I become super self aware when meeting people sober, I observe their facial expressions, their reactions to what I say, I have to basically put on a performance, so ill achieve their validation and, I've noticed people don't like me, the only ones who do are my friends and pals from college. And I envy that from other people. How easy it is to just connect with others so naturally that they don't even have to put an effort to it. Being sober I've felt peoples rejection towards me, and it just hurts. Im also still a virgin because the few times I've hooked up with guys were on drunk occasions in clubs at 3 am where I dressed provocative, and the times I wanted to go home with them, my friends prevented it because they were unknown men and something could happen to me (r\*pe, murder, selling off my organs etc etc). And I so regret it, because if I had gone with those men, at least I wouldn't be a virgin a 23 years old even if I ended up dead. I don't attract normal guys that I could have something with, it's always been men in the streets. And worst thing is, most of my girlfriends were virgins who had never had a partner, but most have now lost their v-cards, and the ones who haven't recently have gotten a boyfriend, so im the few one left that hasn't, and it embarrasses me so much when they talk about their sex life or other people do, and the only thing I can say is that I've hooked up with various men and my friends (whom im not attracted to) like 1 or 2 years ago. It seems that in my circle and most parts of the world, women exist and men automatically pursue them, that doesn't happen to me. That's why I like getting drunk past 12 on street bars hoping some horny guy will do something with me, the difference is this time if it happens again, ill say yes not caring If I put my life in danger, but it hasn't happened.

When I go out, im very observant, I look around and envy the people around me: no social anxiety, active sex life, popularity and money. I recently realized nobody cares I have money. I tend to post on social media things regarding my economic status looking for validation and reputation from others, but they don't seem to care. Another thing I hate about me is my sexuality. I have this distorted view of the world, where female homosexuality is just a fantasy men created and that is not real. And that is one of the things that hurts me the most, because im attracted to women very much and it seems like the world is very p\*nis centered now, everyone loves men and women are just being forgotten. My circle is mostly straight women, one bi girl, and gay/bi men. So I feel so offended sometimes hearing people not finding women attractive, bc they're really attractive to me, but not to the world I guess. I go out and there's always a gay guy (I can tell by his appearance/mannerisms), but women are all str8 looking and im sure they are 100%. My friends have ""queer"" female friends, and I know this sounds bad but I don't believe they really are or are just doing it for attention, because god made men superior and that's why everyone prefers them over women. I hate all the attention gay men get on the media, representation, and how much straight women love them. The worst part of all is that im almost always attracted to str8 women because I like femininity, Im not attracted to butches or masculine women at all, and they're the ones who seem to be gay, but in my distorted world view, they've rejected all their femininity and are confused, therefore they don't really like women. I believe God made women enemies, and men lovers because we all have to compete for a mans love because after all they're superior. I know this sounds really problematic, but I truly believe that's how god made things. Im all for masculine alpha male and feminine females so the chances of me ever tasting a femme queer woman or kissing one, hell even a drunk str8 girl, is 0. And that hurts A LOT. I hate that I like women, I wish I was a straight woman or a gay man.

So why am I thinking about offing myself again? Because it's ending how it started, me not being satisfied with my reality and how the world works. Im graduating in 4 months and I start to cry because I'll lose the people I love the most, they're my happiness. And they're so excited to finally graduate, im not. Why did god made me an extrovert and socially anxious? Because he gave my friends to me as a present so I could experience happiness, just to take it all away after I graduate which is in like 4 months. Im not the ugliest person in the world, why don't I attract people? because im not meant to. Why did god made me bisexual as a woman then make women hate each other? Despite my conditions, ppl who know me, professors and my family say im the smartest person they know, and now I have to deal with this pressure from my family to take the steps exams to become a successful doctor next year, but I don't see myself achieving my goals (making my family wealthier by setting up my own clinic, inheriting their own successful company, buying them a mansion and making a good impact on the world by helping the poor and stray dogs). I don't see myself in the US surrounded by strangers being a doctor, making new friends, having a girlfriend or a bf, and then later a family, because my life always ends up like this: depressed, resentful, frustrated and wanting to die. It's my fate, im destined to end up dead. There are many people who don't have to deal with learning how to be a normal human being...so why me? why many other people? simple answer: fate. After I graduate, my life is over. If I make the decision of offing myself, I'll write a letter thanking my friends for being so nice to me and giving me so many good memories."
8,2023-12-24,CMV: Women's perceptions of sex and intimacy have been just as damaged by porn as men's perceptions have.,u/Purga_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18pq80a/cmv_womens_perceptions_of_sex_and_intimacy_have/,changemyview,"When porn addiction is discussed, the focus is often on the corruption it does on the expectations of teenage boys towards real sex. On the fetishes and kinks and objectifying-focuses that it fosters. And yes, these are real effects of consuming porn, and they're only getting worse.

However, I find it overemphasized. Women have sex and are the victim of these corrupted perceptions/expectations, yes, but men also have sex, and so are similarly affected by the preconceptions and expectations of women. (Especially if the sex ends up being the man trying to satisfy the woman, which is often the case). And those preconceptions and expectations have been wildly damaged by porn, which yes, includes erotica.

Penis sizes are the obvious thing, and it should NOT be understated the psychological impact that it has on developing men to think that you will be judged, and your sexual prospects determined by something which you have no control over. The fact that porn has a sizable (pun intended) bias in favor of large penises creates a false average in the minds of women, and so even a man with an *actual* 6in penis--above average--is perceived as somehow ""lesser-than."" In my anecdotal experience, women have a very misled idea of penis lengths, so while they may *understand* that 5 and some inches is average, they woefully overestimate just how large a 5 and some inches long penis looks like in person. You'd be surprised how often a 7in man is called ""average.""

But that's obvious. What else is corrupting are the motifs of erotic literature. Imo ""tags"" on any erotica site are the same as categories on PornHub. Men are made to act in a way that perfectly sates the basic preferences of the reader, and those actions compounded over dozens of chapters create false standards in the same way that seeing a woman doing lord-knows-what on a PornHub video dozens of times compounds false standards in the minds of men. Those standards can go higher and higher too, and the escalation that many men experience when it comes to their pornography can apply to women as well.

It's my firm belief that most of the women who are into kinks like Consentual-Non-Consentual (rape roleplay) got there through an ever-escalating consumption of pornography. (That is, if it doesn't come from SA, which is a sad but unfortunately real occurrence). Because porn is just another addiction, and also has tolerances that must be overcome to feel the same initial highs. 

Outside of sexual relations, dating expectations are also damaged by the prevalence of motifs that are designed to satisfy the fantasies of women. Even non-explicit romantic novels are inundated with the same basic dominant-rich-nonchalant male archetypes.

I could continue to list ways in which porn can damage the expectations and preferences of people, but really the story is just that literary erotica can be just as corrupting as visual porn, and women still watch visual porn anyway. Even if a woman does not watch or read porn, the prevalence of these effects resonates throughout society, and they will be biased towards these same effects by-proxy."

I'm not American, and when I say conservative I mean the life philosophy of tradition and values as opposed to liberalism and individualism. I think this applies to every human culture everywhere.

If you look at demographics, and even common sense, you'd notice that the older someone is, the more likely they are to have conservatives views. That is while the ""younger generation"" has more left leaning/liberal views. You might say now that our older generations were ""born conservative"", but that isn't true. I once read an article that accused the youth of being untraditional and frivolous - It was written in the 19th century. Also, some of the older conservatives now have been part of the 60s peace and love generation, for example.

It's a generalization, but it's axiomatically true that the longer someone lives, the more life experience they have. That translates to a world view which they hold that correspondons to their life experiences.

I was always a liberal at heart, and as a kid I felt like that's the default mode for a young person. I couldn't even sing my national anthem because I felt like it's cringe, just a tool to control the masses. The older I grew, the more news, people and cultures I've seen and history I've learned, I started to naturally become more conservative. I used to not give a damn about tradition, but now I actually value it very much.

My point is that young people are young. They don't know a lot of things about life and the human nature like an adult does. I think the opinion of a young person matters objectively less than an older person because of that reason. And if older people are conservative, it must mean that there's something to it, that there's something important about sticking to tradition and values. I feel like it's the same transition as when people have kids and start learning the meaning of responsibility. The same way young people without kids cannot assume what it's like to have a child, they cannot also assume what a good political philosophy is. They just don't have the experience to make such a judgment."

Going to keep details vague for rule 4 purposes but there was some pretty big news in my country recently when a person was sentenced to over 35 years in prison (almost 30 years non parole) after pleading guilty to over 180 offences related to producing and disseminating child sexual abuse material. The person was HIV positive and shared their desire to infect children with the virus with other pedophiles. 

I do not believe that anyone for whom a ***shred*** of doubt exists as to that person's guilt should be sentenced to death. I also don't believe that a confession alone should provide enough confidence to support a death sentence (Alexander McClay Williams is a great example of a coerced confession). 

I can't possibly know what evidence was acquired by police investigating the person I originally mentioned so all I can do is speculate. What I do firmly believe though is that **if** the person was guilty of even a decent fraction of the over 180 offences they plead guilty to, and that guilt could be supported by hard evidence such as the person's presence in the CSAM they plead guilty to producing, I don't believe it would be unreasonable to sentence that person to death by whatever means is currently considered the most humane. 

I'll admit there is the possibility the person is able to be rehabilitated through an extended period of incarceration. I just don't know if that is an opportunity that should be provided to someone who committed (crucially, in my hypothetical, with no doubt whatsoever) such vile and heinous acts and deprived a number of their victims of their childhoods, their innocence, and possibly their ongoing health."

I think all his serious ideas after cashing out PayPal are in fact connected with going to Mars and settling on Mars.

Why? Let me explain more:

- SpaceX, kinda obvious, with the reusable rockets, new starship that is methane powered (can get methane quite easily on Mars). 
- Tesla, not obvious, but becoming more obvious with cybertruck. On Mars you need a reliable way of transport. And the only reliable way there are electric vehicles. There is still a long way to go, but it will be a Tesla powertrain vehicle on Mars. Mark my words.
- The Boring company. They use small TBMs. They are small enough to be put into falcon heavy fairing (in pieces) and sent to Mars. Most Mars studies show that early colonists will have the highest chance of survival in tunnels, caves.
- Hyperloop idea, this one would work nicely on Mars, because atmosphere density there is just 1% of Earth atmosphere. I bet he thought of this in terms of Mars itself and then just spilled the beans. It's not viable on Earth, but some development has been done already, and he didn't pay for it, so that's a plus.
- Neuralink and now the Optimus robots, I see this as having workers that need to work outside of the pressurised environment. It will be easy to just connect a human to a robot outside and control that.
- Parts of Tesla that are battery storage, rugged solar tiles, etc. this is to provide stable power levels on Mars.
- Starling, internet, communication across the planet. Easy to replicate around Mars.

The only ones I have problems with are the Not a Flamethrower, but that was a silly thing, and of course Twitter/X which can be seen as an impulse buy. However, I now think that this became a media outlet, propaganda for Musk to influence people, and will be used to influence people on the going to Mars and other topics."

2. Utah is about 1.2 percent polynesian. Half their top high school prospects are polynesian as per rivals. Close to half the NFL players from Utah over the past 15 years or so have been Polynesian. 
3. California is about .4 or so percent pacific islander. Not even necessarily polynesian. If you look up the top 100 prospects for HS football in California..around 10 percent are polynesia. That's a massive overrepresentation.
4. They aren't all fat slow guys either. Troy Polamalu is one of the greatest safeties ever.

All in all. Samoans and Tongans are dozens of times more likely to become NFL players than the average American boy."

Some LGBTQ+ can comment "" I don't enjoy straight romance/concepts"" and no one will bat an eye

The moment a cis straight person comments ""I don't enjoy gay or trans romance/concepts"" then it's the end of the world 

Same for if a person of color comments (even jokingly) on the stereotypes of white people, no one will bat an eye because they're not seen as the societal oppressors 

I know that ""equality"" doesn't actually mean everyone's equal in every way, but rather how they're equal in regards to the law and rights. 

But if society actually sees itself as ""we're all equal EXCEPT for XYZ..."", Then we might as well not call it equality and just call it something else entirely


Idk, I just believe double standards are what brings us down as a people.

1,2023-12-24,"CMV: ""Rudolph the red nose reindeer"" is a dystopian song",u/PenguinJoker,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18pu6wr/cmv_rudolph_the_red_nose_reindeer_is_a_dystopian/,changemyview,"I take as the core of my argument the third stanza of the song of rudolph:  


>All of the other reindeer  
Used to laugh and call him names  
They never let poor Rudolph  
Join in any reindeer games

Rudolph is someone who is discriminated against based on the way he looks. He has one odd facial feature that makes him different to everyone else. Note, the stanza says that ""all the other reindeer,"" not just some of them. Literally all other reindeer call him names, isolate him and don't let him join in any games. So, Rudolph grows up bullied by literally every other animal of his species. 

Then, Santa comes along and offers him a job. The job is for eternity. Rudolph is to ""lead"" the sleigh every year. So, basically, Santa is saying that Rudolph must spend the rest of eternity surrounded by other reindeer who bullied him. Santa seems well-meaning here, but this is extremely misguided. Imagine being stuck for eternity in a job with people who hate you because of a facial feature. This is literally a dystopian scenario.   


The final stanza suggests that the reindeer grow to love Rudolph after he gets this job. But let's be realistic here. This Rudolph guy is promoted over all of his bullies to lead in a job. Can you imagine this in real life? Imagine being promoted to a managerial position or leadership position above a bunch of bullies. Would they really love you then?

Let's suppose they do actually suddenly love him for being promoted above them. Then, is Rudolph expected to ignore the fact that he was relentlessly bullied by them for years? That's even more dystopian than the alternative.

TLDR;: Rudolph is a song about an isolated guy who gets trapped into a job with his bullies for eternity by a well-meaning, but ultimately misguided boss."

The study of the mind does not make sense to me as well because neuroscience is more concerned with that, but study of behavior makes more sense.

But to him, given that psychologists do not study the behavior from biological and neuroscientific perspective but rather just from psychological perspective and treat the underlying theory as abstraction, he claims because of this psychology cannot be science.

It is, as science as astrology to him, because astrology also creates some correlations with some data from some alignment of the stars and people personality and draws some conclusions from patterns of the results, makes observations and creates hypothesis for all those dates.

Also you can say that astrology cannot prove the mechanism of action of the alignment with the people personality, but you cannot prove for a lot of things the mechanism of action for psychology as well.

He also says that **behavioral neuroscience** makes the theory based on biology, hence it's a real science.

Probably I don't understand where he draws the line for what is and what is not considered science, so can you guys help me with the above?

Probably I will have to do some reading about the philosophy of science, but do you have some knowledge to direct me about it or anything about what I mentioned above?    "

Before you call me ""CCP bot, wumao, tankie"" whatever, I'm not even Chinese, I'm Vietnamese, and I'm leaned towards neutrality, refraining from aligning myself towards either side. This post might get deleted for ""CCP propaganda"" but whatever, I don't care, I'm not a fan of CCP for what they're doing in my country's territory, but I'm not here to focus on that either.  
I like a world where USA and China get along. I love to see the two nations' people no longer showing hostility to each others just because their politicians told them to do so.  
The main reason USA can't be normal with China and vice versa is because Taiwan holds strategical interest to USA. Growing up in a country that had suffered from both of these goliaths, I know for a fact Taiwan historically belongs to the China mainland before the colonizers divided the country (just like what they did to South Vietnam. Luckily, we united it before it became Taiwan 2.0!)  
It is only sensible to give back what never really belonged to you to its origin. If you still think ""but but CCP dictatorship authoritarianism bad, democracy ftw"" then I beg your pardon, why then did you cry about Biden calling Xi a dictator recently ? Do you think you have the rights to force political ideology upon other country's people ? They would rather live in high living standards with good income, good healthcare, good education and safety under a competent, strict leader than the so called ""freedom"" accompanied by constant political polarized atmosphere that gets nothing done while society suffers from homelessness, inequality, unaffordable health care, drug addiction. It's an illusion.  
Now that China will inevitably surpass and dethrone the US in economy, I would not want to see such a world with more tension that it already has. I know for a long time USA has been proud of being #1 global power but time changes and seeing another nation surpassing you can be painful experience, but put aside your ego and think of global stability please. Admit facts, admit mistakes, mend relationships. Stop being so stupidly stubborn on the Taiwan problem. Xi clearly demonstrated himself as being a capable and competent leader, no need to hide fear by talking bad about CCP human rights this that because the argument will ultimately dwell into some Middle East warcrimes etc. I don't want that. Just stop. Both has got history of blood on their hands, this argument will lead to nowhere. Yes, Tiananmen Massacre is real, Uyghur genocide is real, now tell me what good does it make if both stubborn kids keep calling out each others' past wrong doings and continue the hostility instead of admitting mistakes and mend friendship to move on ?  
If Taiwan has microchips too important to you, and you USA invested too much in it, find a way to move it somewhere else so CCP can't claim it, then give 'em back, then both can be happy. That will be the best outcome for the common people around the world.  
I'm open to have my view changed. I know my opinion can be flawed due to lack of knowledge. Thank you for reading. From a Vietnamese who just want to see America and China being honest friends."

1,2023-12-24,CMV: I 100% believe thought broadcasting is real,u/Great_Mechanic532,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18pzpx0/cmv_i_100_believe_thought_broadcasting_is_real/,changemyview,"First of all, Happy Holidays to anybody who reads this mess. Hopefully you all can offer a new perspective on this. 

I believe you do not to open your mouth in order to communicate with another person, especially if you have each other's mutual attention. If you ""shout"" the message that you would like to convey in your head and imagine it as spoken word, it will reach the other person just as if you actually said it out loud. There are many nuances and exceptions to this. 

For example, let's say I go to the drive-thru and I am torn between two options on the menu. When the attendant asks me my order, I speak out loud ""I would like item 1"", but in my head I say ""I would actually like item 2"". I have tried this experiment multiple times, and every time the attendant will act as if they did not hear me say ""I would like item 1"" even though I said it plainly and in clear English.

 You cannot blame it on a malfunction of the speaker because a.) This has happened to me at numerous different locations. b.) It had happened after we have already exchanged greetings (therefore the speaker was already working before I started my order). 

The problem with proving that this is real is that you can't fabricate the intent to communicate. It has to be a genuine desire or intent to speak to the other person. It's not like physical speech where I can force my mouth to say whatever I'd like. To get more metaphysical with it, it's sort of like your spirit or soul is speaking. 

The reason most people do not explore this or are not cognizant of it is because with most people, their minds are aligned with what they genuinely desire to say. There's no mismatch, so the intended message just gets  across without having to delve into a thought broadcast. The thought broadcast is like a carrier wave that carries the emotion and intention of what we mean to say to another person. Speech is just the final layer of that communication. 

There is more proof of this. Let's say you don't know anything about doves (just a random example). I come up to you and say ""Hey, did you know that doves only mate in the Spring?"" If I fully believe that the prior statement is true, you will believe it, even if it turns out to be demonstrably false. That is because we don't listen to each other for factual accuracy, but instead we ""listen"" for belief and conviction in whatever is being spoken. That conviction can override the spoken word if it doesn't match what is being said. 

This is basically what people talk about when they mention ""vibes"". There is an ""energy"" that you broadcast based upon your intention at any moment. 

Another story/example: there was once a YouTuber that I followed that would do livestreams. I am a very insular person, so I would just watch and very rarely participate in the chat. One day, I decided to donate $10 dollars in a super chat to show my support. Although I really wanted to support this streamer, I was incredibly nervous and reluctant because I felt it would draw unwanted attention to me. Despite my mixed feelings, I went ahead and donated. When I donated, I felt a twisting feeling in the pit of my stomach because I didn't want to be noticed. Anyway, right when the donation went through and my name popped up, all of a sudden the streamer started mean mugging the camera. He stared for about 3-5 seconds without saying anything, and then continued with his stream. 
I feel that somehow, he could tell that I regretted my donation, even though there was no physical way for him to know that. For all the donations previous to mine, he thanked the viewer and seemed completely normal. 

There is so, so much more I can say but this is already too long. I am struggling so badly in society because these things are true, yet they seem to be forbbiden to speak about. I feel like part of the reason why there's a ""pandemic"" of loneliness, angst, and depression is because we (millenials) are the first generation to contend with so much knowledge about the world, and yet we have to follow and old paradigm that was functional, but naive. I think the generations before us just went along with whatever worked without investigating why it was so. 

I'm sorry if the way I write comes across as dead or morose sounding. I have been struggling with this concept for a very long time. I don't think it's fair to me to say it doesn't exist, because it's part of my everyday reality. It fills me with incredible anxiety, and it's very hard to prove because it leaves no trace, both parties can deny it, it requires specific conditions, etc. 

It's like this: how do you prove that a stone will leave ripples in a pond? Before you throw the stone, and after the ripples have faded, there's absolutely zero evidence that it happened. It's only upon observing it that you know it to be true. Imagine if physicists had to prove from scratch that a stone will cause ripples in the water. It's probably not impossible, but it would be amazingly difficult. 

This concept by itself shouldn't be that big of a deal. After all, if you have something to say, say it, and if you do not, you remain silent. If you treat your communications this way, there is no problem or question of thought broadcasting. However, for people like me with an anxiety disorder, I cannot tell when it is appropriate to divulge my true feelings on certain things. So it gets bottled up inside and ""leaks"" in the form of these broadcasts. 

Imagine going back to the 1500s and telling them there's a huge spectrum of invisible waves traveling through the air at all times that can be used to communicate across the globe. They would deny you, yet you would be right. We have a fallacy of scientific knowledge where we always believe that what we know today is an ironclad truth and anything that challenges what we've been taught is false. 

This is not the same as mind reading, where you could simply focus your attention on somebody and know what they are thinking. One party must intentionally be saying something to the other, or be focusing their intention outward in general. I couldn't just come up to you and know something that you have no intention of relaying to me."
1,2023-12-24,CMV: Anyone in America can be a millionaire with responsible decision making.,u/thedirewulf,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18pztwp/cmv_anyone_in_america_can_be_a_millionaire_with/,changemyview,"Anyone in America can be a millionaire with responsible decision making.

When many people think of a millionaire they think of doctors/ lawyers, first class plane tickets, and vacation homes. In reality, most millionaires simply have a net worth just over 1 million. Usually 300,000 - 500,000 in a home and 500,000 - 800,000 in retirement accounts. 

Most of my data will come from The National Study of Millionaires by Ramsay Solutions, the largest study of millionaires with over 10,000 participants. 

The five most common jobs for millionaires, in order, are: engineer, accountant, schoolteacher, management, and attorney. One third of participants never made above 6 figures throughout their entire career. High income is not a necessary component of becoming a millionaire. The only commonality within this group is that these people are system oriented people who are especially capable of following a budget. 79% of millionaires did not receive a penny of inheritance, with only 2% of millionaires saying they came from an upper income household. 

Compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world. Let me give you a few scenarios that would garner a net worth of a million dollars assuming a 12% annual return. This percent is optimistic but a more reasonable 8 - 10% interest would only require a few more years to make up the difference. 

$105 invested every month for 40 years = $1,028,000

$1000 invested every month for 21 years = $1,043,000

$11,000 initial investment with $0 monthly investment for 40 years = $1,023,000

$4000 invested every month for 11 years = $1,054,000

With 10 - 12% yearly interest, your portfolio will double every 6 - 7 years. So every 6 - 7 years, these portfolios would go to 2 million, to 4 million, then to 8 million, etc. 

The median household income in America is $67,000, making many of the above solutions highly attainable, especially the $105 per month solution. 

Aside from major unexpected events, such as a healthcare crisis, any American could slowly become a millionaire throughout their life. Ideally, any unexpected event that could obliterate someone’s net worth should be subsidized by the government to ensure the path to millionaire status is open to everyone. Additionally, your $1,000,000 invested at 10% interest would be worth $45,000,000 after an additional 40 years, ensuring your children can continue your legacy. Generational wealth seems unfair because compounding interest is unfair. At a certain point, you simply cannot generate as much income as an investment portfolio could generate. However, what you can do to “beat the system” is create your own investment portfolio.

Leg 1- 

My spirituality kinda increases and decreases over time. Right now, I’m kinda on the high side of the wave, after seeing photos of the night sky with no light pollution. 

https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/space/here-s-what-it-will-take-reclaim-night-sky-n710766

I don’t believe that it being so…amazingly beautiful is by chance. Yes, I know that given enough time anything can arrange into anything, but the fact is the cosmos did not have to be as beautiful as it is for us to emerge and yet it has. How can something more mesmerizing than all the artwork ever produced by man greet us in the night sky like this at random? Is that really likely? To see billions and billions of stars arranged in such a chorus like this. So I believe this was the work of some sort of architect, and that we are like pixels in a broader artwork beyond our understanding. 

Leg 2-

With that said, I have also heard the argument that “God cannot be all knowing and all good”, which I believe. Innocent kids die of cancer, people die in earthquakes, etc., and I see no greater good to it. Even the Bible says that God operates on a different  sense of morality than we do. 

When our best authors craft worlds, they do not craft them with the best wishes of its inhabitants in mind from beginning to end. Anyone who has read Game of Thrones can tell that character struggles and suffering are an afterthought if not an intentional part of the intrigue of the story. I believe that if there is a God, he views us in the same way. I don’t see why else we would need to be created besides as some sort of entertainment value, artwork. 

You can address this cmv by tackling either of the legs I’ve raised, or both."

This is basically the Side B Christian stance on homosexuality. I will not address *the other issue that is often paired with sexual orientation* as this subreddit does not allow for discussions on mental self-perceptions of a person's sex, but I will address sexual orientation. Around 2011 with the closing of Exodus International, an infamous ex-gay Christian ministry, many churches and Christian ministries began to change their stance on sexual orientation in that while attractions to the same-gender are involuntary and are not choices, people can control their behavior. These conservative Christian churches began adopting celibacy as a substitute for conversion therapy.

&#x200B;

I mean, this is obviously an improvement in that conversion therapy is no longer being recommended due to the scientific evidence and anecdotes of mental harm associated with gay conversion therapy. I personally am an ally of the LGB+ community, however I do not know how to make sense of churches advocating of celibacy to avoid the alleged sin of same-sex or homoseuxal behavior. On one hand, I haven't heard much about the controversy behind celibacy, but on the other hand, at this point the LGB+ community has severed any remaining ties to tradcon Christian organizations so I have no clear stance on celibacy and whether a gay/lesbian/bisexual person is able to be their authentic self while abstaining from same-sex relationships."
1,2023-12-24,"CMV: General Relativity and the known laws of physics entail a beginning to spacetime and matter itself, and thus a transcendent cause.",u/TheGodHuman,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18q3ys3/cmv_general_relativity_and_the_known_laws_of/,changemyview,"My thesis is the title in the post. While William Lane Craig's philosophical arguments for a past-eternal universe are convincing, I will address the science in this post. First, here are some definitions.

* Definition of God: A timeless, beginningless, eternal, spaceless, immaterial, powerful, transcendent and personal Creator.
* Definition of the universe: all space, time and matter.

Space-time itself had an absolute beginning a finite ago. Here is a weak version of the argument:

1. If the universe began to exist, it has a cause.
2. The universe began to exist.
3. So, the universe has a cause.

As the cause of space, time and matter, the cause must be timeless (and thus eternal/beginningless), spaceless, immaterial, powerful (since the cause produced space, time and matter), transcendent and personal. This cause must be personal because if this cause always had the power and preconditions to create the universe in eternity past but was impersonal, then the effect should also be eternal past. The fact that the effect is finite to the past suggests that the cause had free will to create and chose to do so, implying a personal agent.

If one says that there can be no cause without spacetime and matter, that would mean that beginning of spacetime and matter did not have a cause, and simply came into being uncaused from nothing, which violates the law of causality, a *metaphysical* principle, and renders one's worldview to absurdity.

Further, this argument is not a God of the gaps. The term God of the gaps was created by Christians to criticize other Christian arguments. The term applied to arguments which appealed to a gap in scientific knowledge as evidence for God. A common example used today is the argument “science has no explanation for the origin of life, therefore it must have been God”. This gap in knowledge is then taken as evidence for God and so it is a God of the gaps argument. The problem is that is not what the argument does. The argument actually appeals to what we do know about causation and the law of non contradiction rather than a gap in scientific knowledge. If the argument was “science has no explanation for what causes the universe therefore is must be God,” then that would be God of the gaps. But the Kalam doesn’t do this. Instead it appeals to what we know about causation and the law of non contradiction to rule out the cause being temporal, spacial and material.

# Scientific Evidence.

The Standard (or the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker) Model is the most popular model of cosmic origins, with an initial singularity and a beginning to spacetime and matter: “The current consensus model for the universe uses the FLRW metric and also starts from a Big Bang singularity and (as remarked earlier) includes an inflationary phase which was added to fix a serious problem with smoothing out the early universe” - Colin Rourke, *The Geometry of the Universe* (World Scientific Publishing Company, 2021), pp. 29-30. The Standard Model takes seriously the predictions made by General Relativity, which (with observations) predicts that all space, time and matter had a beginning a finite time ago. The late great Stephen Hawking says in his famous book *A Brief History of Time* (1988):

>The final result was a joint paper by Penrose and myself in 1970, which at last proved that there must have been a big bang singularity provided only that general relativity is correct and the universe contains as much matter as we observe. There was a lot of opposition to our work, partly from the Russians because of their Marxist belief in scientific determinism, and partly from people who felt that the whole idea of singularities was repugnant and spoiled the beauty of Einstein’s theory. However, one cannot really argue with a mathematical theorem. So in the end our work became generally accepted and nowadays nearly everyone assumes that the universe started with a big bang singularity. . .

In the 1980s however, Alan Guth theorized a phase before the Planck time known as ""inflation."" Inflation, according to the Standard Model, takes place after the creation of matter, space, and time.  It is true that some physicists fold inflation into a theory of an eternal universe. But that is not true of most. And it should also be pointed out that, while the inflationary theory is widely accepted, a goodly number of physicists reject it. But the concept of inflation did change things a bit: if it is correct, then one *can theoretically* get rid of the initial singularity and replace it with the end of an earlier epoch of inflation. But this raises the question: can you get rid of singularities in altogether, and make the universe infinitely old (again, *if* inflation is to be accepted)? A [theorem produced by Alvine Borde, Alan Guth, and Alexander Vilenkin](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0110012) showed that the answer is NO, as long as the universe is expanding and the known laws of physics hold, one can push the singularity as far back as one likes, but one can't get rid of it. In a [1994 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9312022), Arvine Borde and Alexander Vilenkin showed that most ""almost all points in the inflating region will have a singularity somewhere in their pasts"" (p. 3307). In other words, most, but not all, null and timelike geodesics are past incomplete. However, the aforementioned 2003 paper showed ""that null and timelike geodesics are, in general, past-incomplete in inflationary models, whether or not energy conditions hold, provided only that the averaged expansion condition Hav > 0 holds along these past-directed geodesics. This is a stronger conclusion than the one arrived at in previous work in that we have shown under reasonable assumptions that almost all causal geodesics, when extended to the past of an arbitrary point, reach the boundary of the inflating region of spacetime in a finite proper time (finite affine length, in the null case)"" (p. 3).

Of course, atheist physicists readily began searching for loopholes in light of this theorem, one classic example being Sean Carroll. The loopholes quickly spread in popularity after this, ranging from an emergent universe, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, etc. These options were all shut down by a [2012 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.4658) \- co-authored by Vilenkin. Sean Carroll and Chen then developed another loophole. But Vilenkin closed this Carroll/Chen loophole in a [2013 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3836). William H. Kinney also recently expanded the BGV in a [2021 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15380) to certain kinds of bouncing cosmologies that weren't covered by Vilenkin (such as the one produced by Ijjas and Steinhardt), with cycles of expansion and contraction, showing that these too have a singularity lurking in their past assuming the known laws of physics still hold. William Kinney also extended the BGV theorem in a [2023 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10958) to rule out Roger Penrose's CCC model. In 2017, Vilenkin also argued against a model produced by George Ellis which could evade the BGV. See Vilenkin, ""The Beginning of the Universe,"" in The Kalam Cosmological Argument, Volume 2 Scientific Evidence for the Beginning of the Universe (Bloomsbury: 2017), pp. 152-153. In a 2015 [Inference article](https://inference-review.com/article/the-beginning-of-the-universe), Alexander Vilenkin wrote that ""we have no viable models of an eternal universe. The BGV theorem gives us reason to believe that such models simply cannot be constructed."" Later still, in 2017, Vilenkin wrote, “Many people once again hoped that maybe on a far greater scale the universe is indeed eternal--with ancestor bubbles nucleating ad infinitum into the past. Now, however, we know that this is not possible. And once again, the beginning of the universe must be tackled head on"" - Delia Perlov and Alex Vilenkin, *Cosmology for the Curious*, p. 333.

There have been many attempts to claim that a popular Christian philosopher named William Lane Craig misrepresents the theorem in citing it in support for an absolute beginning with an initial singularity. It is claimed that the theorem only provides evidence for inflation having a beginning. However, Craig has never cited the BGV as *proof* of an absolute beginning, only as evidence to make the second premise more plausible than its negation, and he admits in numerous works that there are models that can evade the theorem. Further, Alexander Vilenkin explicitly said that Craig was not misrepresenting the theorem when he says (recorded in a [Reasonable Faith article](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/question-answer/honesty-transparency-full-disclosure-and-the-borde-guth-vilenkin-theorem)): ""I think you represented what I wrote about the BGV theorem in my papers and to you personally very accurately.""

So what is the deal here? The BGV assumes a classical spacetime and General Relativity. Some physicists, like Sean Carroll, want us to imagine that before the Planck time, classical spacetime breaks down, and therefore the predictions of General Relativity do not apply. Thus, Carroll wants us to imagine that before the Planck time, we have different laws of physics, laws of physics that (a) we can't currently be described, (b) have no evidence supporting their postulation, and (c) contradict known laws of physics, that govern the early universe, which can avoid an initial singularity and an absolute beginning to spacetime and matter. In effect, Carroll says, ""yes, an eternal universe contradicts the laws of physics, but we can imagine, can't we, a never-never land in which these laws don't apply? Well, then, let's do so!"" He asks to believe that other laws than those we know by science and observation, laws which he himself admits he does not know and cannot describe, must have operated in the past. His model even requires time itself going backward. I think it's obvious that Carroll is trying to get off the hook of an unwanted conclusion. So, as Carroll's arguments assume, we must say that the known physics point to a beginning of spacetime and matter.

How does Alexander Vilenkin think space, time and matter came into being without God? He thinks that the universe quantum tunneled out ""nothing."" How does he define nothing? In [this 2012 article](https://now.tufts.edu/2012/05/29/beginning-was-beginning), Alexander Vilenkin says,

>""I say “nothing” in quotations because the nothing that we were referring to here is the absence of matter, space and time. That is as close to nothing as you can get, but what is still required here is the laws of physics. So the laws of physics should still be there, and they are definitely not nothing.""

Here is a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHdI4Let27I) where Alexander Vilenkin states that the universe was spontaneously created out of nothing, which he defines as no space, matter, or time. In his technical work, the ""laws of physics"" he refers to is a timeless, beginingless, space-less, immaterial, transcendent realm of mathematical possibilities, called superspace. For example, Alexander Vilenkin, who thinks that even inflation must have a beginning, writes at the end of his book *Many Worlds in One*:

>The picture of quantum tunneling from nothing raises another intriguing question. The tunneling process is governed by the same fundamental laws that describe the subsequent evolution of the universe. It follows that the laws should be “there” even prior to the universe itself. Does this mean that the laws are not mere descriptions of reality and can have an independent existence of their own? In the absence of space, time, and matter, what tablets could they be written upon? The laws are expressed in the form of mathematical equations. If the medium of mathematics is the mind, does this mean that mind should predate the universe?

What is this ""quantum tunneling from nothing""? The ""nothing"" being proposed by e.g., Hawking and Vilenkin is actually not a part of material reality. The nothing being proposed indeed is without space, time and matter, but it's not nothing in the philosophical meaning of the term. What they call ""nothing"" is known as superspace, a timeless, spaceless, immaterial, transcendent realm of mathematical possibilities. As Vilenkin suggests in the YouTube video cited above, a Platonic realm of mathematical possibilities, such as our laws which describe our universe. To make matters even more speculative, Alexander Vilenkin and Stephen Hawking had to arbitrarily restrict the infinite degrees of mathematical freedom inherent in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in order to solve it (creating what theorists call a “mini-superspace”).

Stephen Hawking takes the same tack as Alexander Vilenkin, in his 2010 book titled *The Grand Design*, coauthored with Leonard Mlodinow. They wrote: “Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing."" Lawrence Krauss echoes this claim: “The laws themselves require our universe to come into existence, to develop and evolve” - Krauss, *A Universe from Nothing*, p. 142. Here is what a physicist named Ikjyot Singh Kohli says in a [2015 review](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6091) on Krauss’ book,

>""The concept of superspace is not mentioned a single time, even though this is the entire geometric structure for which the proposal he is putting forward of a universe coming from nothing is based upon"" (p. 3).

And,

>""Krauss' nothing on some occasions is the quantum vacuum, and on other occasions, it is the minisuperspace of the WDW formalism. In either case, Krauss does not bother to address the underlying laws of physics/mathematics that govern these principles, nor does he bother to point out that none of his claims are testable, which is absolutely key for a theory to be considered scientific. For these reasons, we strongly believe that Krauss’ book is largely motivated by a particular set of philosophical ideologies of which principles from science are being extrapolated at best to support these arguments, which by the end of the day, the reader hopefully will realize are filled with all sorts of gaping holes and incorrect notions"" (p. 10).

The problem with this though is that abstract objects do not stand in any causal relationship with anything concrete —the law of conservation of momentum does not cause a billiard ball to move when another ball hits it, for example. Mathematical possibilities cannot cause the universe. Further, unless the cause has free will, no effect could arise out of a timeless state. Lastly, the laws of nature typically are taken as being merely descriptive in science. So how can they exist without what they describe?

Meanwhile, back to Hawking. Hawking, in an interview titled: '['If there's an edge to the universe, there must be a God (interview with Renee Weber)](https://www.the-scientist.com/books-etc/god-as-the-edge-of-the-universe-63996),"" in *Dialogues with Scientists and Sages* (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1986), pp. 201-216, says, ""WEBER: Why is it so important whether there is or is not an edge to space-time? HAWKING: It obviously matters because if there is an edge somebody has to decide what should happen at the edge. You would really have to invoke God.""

How does Hawking get around the conclusion that God exists, given the singularity on the Standard Model, partially inspired by his own work? Eventually, Hawking introduced imaginary time into one of Einstein’s mathematical expressions that describes the curvature of spacetime. Hawking then simply equated time with imaginary time (t = iτ) to make it possible to calculate the probabilities associated with different possible early states of the universe. Mathematicians call this transformation a “Wick rotation.” In *A Brief History of Time*, Hawking presented this result as a challenge to the idea that the universe had a definite beginning in time. He argued that this mathematical model implied the universe would not, therefore, need a transcendent creator to explain its origin. After he explained how this mathematical manipulation eliminated the singularity, he famously observed, “So long as the universe had a beginning, we would suppose it had a creator. But if the universe is really completely self-contained, having no boundary or edge, it would have neither beginning nor end; it would simply be. What place, then, for a creator?"" (pp. 140-141).

The problem with though is threefold. First, as Hawking admits, the use of imaginary time functions in mathematics is merely a ""mathematical device (or trick)"" - Hawking, *A Brief History of Time*, p. 136. Second, imaginary numbers have no real-world referent and so have no physical meaning. As hawking explained, ""Imaginary numbers are a mathematical construction. You can't have an imaginary number credit card bill"" - Hawking, *The Universe in a Nutshell*, p. 59. Hawking also acknowledged that once his mathematical depiction of the geometry of space is transformed back into the actual physical realm with a real-time variable—the singularity comes back! As Hawking says, “When one goes back to the real time in which we live, however, there will still appear to be singularities"" - Hawking, *A Brief History of Time*, p. 136. Third, according to Hawking, imaginary time makes time indistinguishable from space. But this is metaphysically impossible, since time is not space.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To summarize, these all seem like attempts to avoid an unwanted conclusion: God. In the end, I think it is important to note that these are highly technical debates, which not only non-physicists are not in a position to judge, but often not even physicists within a slightly different field of specialization. So I don't think it is really possible for a layperson to follow or judge these debates. So I think, if one keeps in mind the non-conclusive nature of all science, the fact that the current standard model posits a past-finite universe can very legitimately be regarded as (rather stunning) confirmation of the biblical revelation of creation at a point in time.

Let me lay out these six points to conclude. First, the past-finite universe was discovered in the early part of the twentieth century, through the work of such giants as the Catholic priest George Lemaitre, etc.

Second, the past-finite universe is now, and has been ever since the early part of the last century, the Standard Model of cosmic origins. Yes, there are dissenters among physicists, but that doesn't change the near consensus. Colin Rourke, *The Geometry of the Universe* (World Scientific Publishing Company, 2021), pp. 29-30: “The current consensus model for the universe uses the FLRW metric and also starts from a Big Bang singularity and (as remarked earlier) includes an inflationary phase which was added to fix a serious problem with smoothing out the early universe.”

Third, scientific knowledge is the reason it is the Standard Model. The red-shift is an observed fact, and unless the known laws of physics can be violated, the necessity of a past-finite universe that it entails, given those laws of physics, is a fact. Some of those laws include the standard thermodynamics, the standard gravity theory, and the standard nuclear physics.

Fourth, the fact that the universe is past-finite, which means that without the universe's coming into existence, there was nothing, and so necessarily entails that matter, space, and time are past- finite. For the universe is by definition the aggregate of matter and space, and time is only possible within the context of space and matter.

Fifth, the great majority of scientists would agree more or less with points one to four above. For instance, the atheist physicist Lawrence Krauss, in his book *A Universe from Nothing*, takes all of the above for granted.

Sixth, the past-finite universe has massive religious, existential, and moral implications, because it entails the existence of a transcendently powerful creator which resembles the God of Abrahamic faiths. In human beings, the intellect does not operate independently, but is moved by the heart and the will. And physicists are human beings. Some find the conclusion of God so terrifying that they are willing to descend into irrationality rather than follow the science to its logical conclusion, such as positing superspace or claiming that the universe could come into being uncaused (like Lawrence Krauss and Alexander Vilenkin has), thus denying the law of causality. Vilenkin for example argues in that [2015 Inference article](https://inference-review.com/article/the-beginning-of-the-universe) that one does not need a cause to the universe. He says:

>The energy of the gravitational field is negative; it is conceivable that this negative energy could compensate for the positive energy of matter, making the total energy of the cosmos equal to zero. In fact, this is precisely what happens in a closed universe, in which the space closes on itself, like the surface of a sphere. It follows from the laws of general relativity that the total energy of such a universe is necessarily equal to zero. Another conserved quantity is the electric charge, and once again it turns out that the total charge must vanish in a closed universe.

However, to respond to this, first, the fact that no physical laws are violated is completely irrelevant since the justification for the first premise isn’t based on any scientific laws. The justification is arguing for a metaphysical law. It’s not a scientific question but a philosophical one. Second, as for the net energy being 0, it simply doesn’t follow that that means it could be uncaused. Suppose my balance is 0. I owe someone ten dollars, but yet I have a ten dollar bill in my pocket. No one would think that since therefore the ten dollar bill and the debt does not exist. Sure, the sum is 0 but it’s not the same as nothing. There is still something making up that net 0. There doesn’t seem to be any reason to think having a net 0 means not needing a cause at all. Lastly, it denies the law of causality, which reduces one's worldview to absurdity.

Finally, seventh, to dovetail to six, we already know that even some of the greatest physicists are biased against a big bang singularity and an absolute beginning to spacetime and matter, as well as the implications that follow from that. The late great Stephen Hawking says in his famous book *A Brief History of Time* (1988)

>Many people do not like the idea that time has a beginning, probably because it smacks of divine intervention. (The Catholic Church, on the other hand, seized on the big bang model and in 1951 officially pronounced it to be in accordance with the Bible). There were therefore a number of attempts to avoid the conclusion that there had been a big bang. The proposal that gained widest support was called the steady state theory.

So there seems to have been a bias and to some level an agenda to avoid a big bang singularity, particularly because of its implications for the existence of God. This sentiment was confirmed by other physicists too. Steven Weinberg for instance says that ""some cosmologists are philosophically attracted to the oscillating model, especially because, like the steady-state model, it *nicely avoids the problem of Genesis*"" - Weinberg, *1st 3 Minuties Universe*, p. 154. An agnostic physicist and the founding director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, Robert Jastrow, wrote in 1978: 

>""Theologians generally are delighted with the proof that the Universe had a beginning, but astronomers are curiously upset. Their reactions provide an interesting demonstration of the response of the scientific mind—supposedly a very objective mind—when evidence uncovered by science itself leads to a conflict with the articles of faith in our profession. It turns out that the scientist behaves the way the rest of us do when our beliefs are in conflict with the evidence. We become irritated, we pretend the conflict does not exist, or we paper it over with meaningless phrases"" - Jastrow, *God and the Astronomers*, p. 16

So many physicists were attempting to avoid the big bang singularity, and still do. "

874,2023-12-24,CMV: The Romani Holocaust organised by Nazi Germany is not talked about nearly as much as it should,u/GoSouthCourt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18q5tdv/cmv_the_romani_holocaust_organised_by_nazi/,changemyview,"Alongside Jews, the [Romani people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people) were treated as sub-humans. As a result, they were persecuted and put into death camps the way Jews were under Nazi rule. It's estimated that [250,000 to 500,000 Romani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_Holocaust) were murdered, about 25-50% of the Romani population at the time. A scholar even estimated that 1.5 million Romani might have died out of a population of 2 million. 

I did not learn about this until recent months, and I'm sure many reading this post aren't aware either. Their Holocaust was only recognised by West Germany in 1982, and many official recognitions only came about in the 2000s. The reason for that is complicated but probably due to a combination of strong anti-Roma racism in Europe, especially Eastern Europe, the lack of collective memory and the lack of documentation.

I think that every time we talk about the Holocaust, we need to recognise that it's not only the Jewish people that were genocided, the Romani people were too and need to be addressed together."

Many Conservatives exhibit mental disturbances in that they talk to and actively submit themselves to an invisible, mute, and undetectable supernatural entity that, Conservatives believe, grants them parking spaces and winning success for their favorite sports teams.

If there were a group of people convinced that, say, Santa Claus, Harry Potter, or Buddy the Elf was watching over them and secretly communicating with them to provide guidance—we would never allow these people anywhere near politics.

So, I don’t understand how we’ve gotten to this point where we are allowing Conservatives to have this much influence, reach, and power.

The fact that we are allowing them to make **life-and-death medical decisions for women**—is literally nauseating, intolerable, unethical, and unconscionable.

The fact we are allowing Conservatives to remove science-based curricula from schools, based on their mythological beliefs, is truly disturbing.

The fact that we are allowing Conservatives to ban books in schools—based on their belief in an ancient text that details the slaughter of infants among other atrocities; the same text that Conservatives believe is authored by their revered invisible, mute supernatural entity—is, to the say the very least, deeply distressing.

I’m open to changing my view—but you’re going to have to really convince me that Conservatives deserve to be tolerated when they are appear clearly unhinged and a danger to society."
1,2023-12-24,"CMV: Relativity doesn't imply there is no absolute rest frame, and in fact there probably is an (albeit experimentally-undetectable) absolute rest frame",u/WE_THINK_IS_COOL,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18q6syx/cmv_relativity_doesnt_imply_there_is_no_absolute/,changemyview,"A common refrain in physics is that the universe has no *objective* absolute frame of rest. The argument goes like this: If we have two observers, Observer A and Observer B, who have a relative velocity v, there is *in principle* no experiment we could do to determine whether Observer A is at rest and Observer B is moving with velocity v or whether Observer B is at rest and Observer A is moving with velocity -v. Therefore, there's *no truth to the matter* of which observer is moving and which isn't.

 I agree with the part that says no experiment could determine which observer is really moving, but I disagree with the conclusion that there is no absolute frame of rest, i.e. there's no truth to the matter of who's really moving and who isn't. Instead, I think there most likely *is* an absolute rest frame, it's just that the laws of physics have a symmetry which makes it experimentally undetectable.

To argue for my position, I have to (a) explain why the argument given above is mistaken and (b) explain why I think there is an absolute rest frame, even though it's experimentally undetectable.

I'll start with part (a). The argument for the usual view is mistaken because it makes the assumption that if there is no *experiment* that can distinguish the two cases, then there is no *objective truth* as to which case is correct. This is a logical fallacy, because we can imagine laws of physics where there are objective truths that are experimentally inaccessible. For example, matter that exists outside the observable universe would never make contact with experiment, but it might still exist. Or, it might turn out that it's impossible to build a particle accelerator large enough to experimentally measure certain aspects of our universe's physics, yet those aspects of physics would still be objective truths, even though they are unknowable. Note that I'm talking here about *experiments that could be done in principle* and not *experiments that could be done in practice*, since the argument for no absolute rest frame considers all experiments that could be done *in principle*, not subject to practical limitations. So, the logical leap from ""there is no experiment that can distinguish two things"" to ""there is no objective truth as to which is true"" is unjustified.

To really illustrate the point, imagine that the actual laws of physics are whatever they are, but there's also a coin that never interacts with anything else, and that coin is either ""heads"" or ""tails."" There's no experiment that could determine, from the inside, whether the coin was ""heads"" or ""tails"", but there is still be an objective truth about what state the coin was in. Leaping from ""it's in principle impossible to determine the state of the coin"" to ""there is no objective truth about the state of the coin"" is unjustified.

For the second part, (b), I need to explain why it's more likely than not that there *is* an absolute rest frame, even though it's experimentally undetectable. I first need to show that it's *possible* that there's an absolute rest frame, and then show that it's *likely*.

First of all, it's *possible* that there's an absolute rest frame. If we think about the universe as a kind of computation, it's entirely possible that that computation is being carried out in a single absolute frame of rest. If it were, we would notice no difference in our experiments. Time dilation would be caused by light having to take longer paths, and length contraction and all other aspects of special relativity would be explained similarly. This should be uncontroversial, since we're just using the premise that the argument for no absolute rest frame is based on: if there were an absolute rest frame, thanks to the symmetries of the laws of physics that obey special relativity, the laws of physics would appear exactly the same to us.

Now the harder part, why it's *likely* that there actually is an absolute rest frame. For this, I'm going to assume a principle that the universe does not do any unnecessary computation. If that's true, then the universe will have an absolute rest frame, since the most efficient way to compute its time evolution would be to just carry out the laws of physics in a single frame. Carrying out the computation in multiple frames would involve computing Lorentz transformations, which would add overhead above just sticking to a single frame and computing the laws of physics there. Computing the time evolution in different frames and then patching them together using Lorentz transformations would be less efficient than just working in a single frame. Because of the principle of relativity, the entire time evolution can be carried out in a single frame, with no need to perform Lorentz transformations, and any implementation done in multiple frames would be less efficient than doing it in a single frame.

So, the argument that *there is no objective rest frame* is invalid, and moreover, if we assume that the universe computes its time evolution in a non-wasteful way, then there *is* an objective rest frame, even though it's experimentally inaccessible due to the symmetries of the laws of physics.

Also why can child support be used for any purpose the woman sees fit? Shouldn’t it only be restricted to things that support the child - like food, medicine, school, etc. 

Finally, child support is the only form of debt someone can be sent to jail for if you don’t pay.

Especially when so many advice I've seen as ""focus on yourself""

That advice can be seen as misleading. Since people are gonna interpret that as ""if you better yourself someone will love you"" when they should interpret that as ""you should focus on yourself for you"" and pretend love doesn't exist by not tryna focus on what no one owes you. But rather what you owe yourself

So the more you don't expect or don't even want relationships, the better your life will be. No matter what your feelings say otherwise. 

Feeling alone can't guarantee you a relationship so why feed them by constantly thinking about wanting them?

While still on its early stages, some use cases (such as Google's search AI, or ChatGPT) prove to be extremely useful.

However, there's a trend among users of those technologies, in which they ""empathize"" with such AI, so much to the point of believing they are sentient.

I'm not sure about the sentient, read conscious, part. What I'm pretty sure about, is that humans evolved in an environment/planet where feelings such as fear, anger, love, etc, among others considered negative or positive, were crucial to our survival. Anger boosted active survival responses such as fighting other creatures, and love boosted passive survival techniques such as protecting offspring as in, hiding from potential threats.

Those feelings are legacy branches of the mind and nowadays, at least in developed societies, no longer are helpful. Predictive AI doesn't need such feelings, albeit perfectly capable of emulating them. Supercomputers, however, are probably outputting consciousness as much as we, and all other animals, are. Consciousness is merely a funny way the universe found of outputting interaction between matter.

I'd like to believe that I'm a special creation and that there is a deity looking out for me and caring about my feelings, but everything points to the fact that ""I"" am just the output of random interaction between atoms."

The paradox of tolerance states that complete tolerance will inevitably allow the intolerant to triumph over the tolerant; therefore, the tolerant cannot accept intolerance. It is the reason why people who oppose racism condemn racism; if they were perfectly tolerant, then they would tolerate racism. However, because tolerating racism would allow racists to spread their hatred and eventually triumph over non-racists, non-racists, whom we consider “tolerant,” cannot tolerate racism.

However, people don’t understand this line of thinking. Too many people are idealists who believe that everyone supports tolerance or can support tolerance. However, such an idea is easily refuted. For example, there are LGBTQ+ individuals that support the Palestinian side of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, when the majority of Palestinians believe that homosexuals should be put to death, whether it be by stoning, beheading, being shoved off a roof, etc. Israel’s LGBTQ+ rights record, though not perfect, is much better; Tel Aviv’s annual Pride parade is among the largest in the world. You at least wouldn’t be stoned, beheaded, dismembered, raped, and cannibalized in Israel for being gay (most likely). However, too many people are idealists and think that tolerance is always a good thing. To a rational person, however, tolerating someone that wants you dead is preposterous. Sometimes, it is right to say “kill them before they kill us.” This world is a cruel place.

I, for one, do not show humanity towards those undeserving of it. If you want to kill me or someone close to me, then your head will roll. You deserve no sympathy, even from a saint. If your sole purpose in life is to shed blood, then you will bathe in your own blood. As they say, those who live by the sword die by the sword. If the only language you speak is violence, then violence is the only answer you’ll receive. I wish people thought like this. Even if you don’t want to take a life, there may come a time when it is necessary. Even if you want to love everyone else on this rock, sometimes, that love is unrequited. Thus, to believe that humans deserve humanity will inevitably threaten humanity, as it means that one treats human devils in the same way that one treats a saint. Good cannot triumph over evil if evil is allowed to triumph over good."

In various countries, LGBTQ+ individuals have been subjected to persecution, arrests, and violence based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. The struggle for LGBTQ+ rights has often involved challenging discriminatory laws and advocating for broader societal acceptance.

In the U.S., while both groups face discrimination, LGBTQ+ individuals have historically battled against discriminatory laws, such as anti-sodomy statutes, and have fought for the right to marry, openly serve in the military, and have protection from employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity."

1. Debilitating: the disease seriously detracts from a person's quality of life and renders them dependent on constant care from others.

2. Untreatable: the disease cannot be cured and its symptoms cannot be reduced to a non-debilitating level through treatment.

3. Inherited: the disease has a high risk (say 30%) of being passed to offspring, who then risk passing it to their offspring.

4. Primarily Genetically Caused: the disease can be virtually eradicated if those who have it do not reproduce, and it will persist if those who have it do not abstain from reproduction.

5. Terminal: upon onset, the disease persists for the remainder of one's life.

I do NOT advocate for any state policy to sterilize or otherwise prevent those with these diseases from reproducing. I simply think that they should end their genetic lines. It is better to eliminate these diseases once and for all, and those who have them have a duty to the general human welfare to do so. These diseases devastate not only those who have it, but everyone who cares for them. If future generations can never again face these diseases, it is worth it for those who have them now never to have children.

Some of these diseases are undetectable until after the age most people have children. I can't fault people for not knowing they are sick. In these cases, the duty to end these genetic lines falls on any children who may have it. When it is possible to reliably test children at risk for these diseases, a positive result confers on them the duty not to reproduce. When it is not possible to reliably test, an estimate of ""high risk"" of having and passing (say 30% total) is sufficient to confer the duty. 

A 30% risk of having, and a 30% risk of passing IF one has it equates to about a 10% risk of passing (when the diagnosis is uncertain). I don't know exactly where the line is drawn, but I'm inclined to think 10% is low enough, given that few people have 5 or more children. My rule of thumb here is that if you'd rather play Russian Roulette, then the risk is too great to take.

Merry Christmas to all. It's late for me, so I'll have to respond to counter arguments tomorrow morning."

I am aware different asian communities have different experiences in the UK so feel free to give information on any splits, south asian in particular but interested in east asian too.

As a black male myself, I can speak on some of my particular lived experiences of being accused of stealing (falsely), I’ve had instances where people are visible scared of me (cross the road to cross back again to avoid walking past me). 

I know there are stats such as being wrongfully accused of crimes, more likely to be excluded in school, ethnic pay gaps, unfavourable media representation. There are stats on black women being five times more likely to die during pregnancy that white people and twice more than asian. And another stat that says black people are more likely to get marked down in internal exams within schools where teachers know who is writing the paper vs white and east asian counterparts.

But they argue that if black people commit more crimes statistically it’s natural they would suspect black people more and therefore wrongfully accuse. They also say broken families are a reason why black people do not do well financially and may resort to crimes and that south asians are also treated unfavourably in regards to being more likely to be perceived as terrorists. 

So really I want to know what are your thoughts? I don’t think communities should compare struggles but at the same time I feel black communities are treated less favourably from society, academia and workplace but I am aware there are asian struggles too but I don’t believe to the same magnitude - can you provide reasoning if you agree with statistics and sources if possible (a focus on UK) and similar if you disagree."

South asians have also migrated into the country similar to black communities but have worked hard to increase income through education, whereas black communities I feel have less income and work lower paid roles which may push children’s to gangs and crime more than other demographics, coupled with families in black community more likely to be broken and raised by single parents. Committing more crimes will lead law enforcers and police to more likely falsely accuse black people of crimes but it’s because they proportionately committing more. Broken families lead to less focus on education and therefore the stat that they are more likely to be excluded. So I feel like there are explanations to these statistics. 

South asians are also treated unfavourably in regards to being more likely to be perceived as terrorists, south asians are rarely portrayed in media (music or acting).

I agree with black lives matter but also think asian struggles should be talked about in the same degree and urgency as BLM.

Please use statistics / facts to convince me otherwise (or to support my thoughts). This is about the UK only.

2,2023-12-25,"CMV: Recognizing that ""Drugs"" Encompasses More Than Just Recreational Substances",u/-170cm,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18qe3fp/cmv_recognizing_that_drugs_encompasses_more_than/,changemyview," let's delve into a topic that's often misunderstood and warrants our attention! 

 The concept of the word 'drug.' It's been a bit of a journey for me, trying to convey the broader meaning of this term to various individuals, and I've noticed a gap in understanding that I believe we can collectively bridge.  
When we use the term 'drug,' it's not just about the recreational substances that might come to mind. It's a term that encompasses a vast array of substances, from medications prescribed by doctors for health conditions to over-the-counter remedies and even those used for performance enhancement.  
Sometimes, there's a tendency to associate 'drug' solely with the world of recreational or illicit substances. However, it's crucial for us to broaden our perspective and acknowledge that medications, those prescribed by healthcare professionals, also fall under this umbrella. Our aim is to understand the diverse purposes that drugs serve in our lives.  
Education is the key. It's about recognizing the legitimate uses of medications and understanding their potential risks. Responsible use of drugs, both prescribed and over-the-counter, plays a vital role in managing health conditions. Let's encourage open dialogue and dispel any misconceptions that might hinder our understanding.  
It's also worth noting that not all drugs lead to addiction, but being aware of the potential for dependency is essential. By acknowledging the legal context that surrounds drug regulation, we gain a deeper appreciation for the importance of responsible use.  
So, let's approach this topic with open minds and engage in constructive conversations. Each perspective contributes to the richness of the discussion, and together, we can foster a well-informed and understanding community. Thank you for your attention, and let's continue to learn and grow together."

1,2023-12-25,CMV: Men have it harder than women in the western world,u/Scarface19999,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18qh8gk/cmv_men_have_it_harder_than_women_in_the_western/,changemyview,"So first of all let me explain. I understand that life was worse for women 100 ago. They didn't have the same rights as men and were treated like objects, but for the past 50 years things have changed. 

Things are still harder for women in the middle east. Islam is an oppressive religion and sees women as reproduction machines that will raise their children.

But in today's western world things are different. Women have the exact same rights as men. In fact they're more privileged in my opinion.

Let me explain, first of all in most countries women don't serve in the military, the wars today usually do not involve swords and head to head combat. I think that women are as capable as men when it comes to firing firearms, using machines or driving cars. (women only serve in countries like Israel). Isn't it sexist when they say that the military service should only be obligatory for men? 

Secondly it is common for women to marry rich men, but you never see it happening the other way around. Men are expected to be hardworkers and society only considers men that make a lot of money successful. If a guy does not make a lot of money and doesn't have a good education he is usually being seen as a loser while a woman can only just be hot and she'll find a rich man to live an easy lifestyle. (also the percentage of women pursuing higher education is bigger for women than men today) 

Thirdly, when it comes to dating women have a much more variety of choice and are being more picky than men. It's harder for the average man to get laid than it is for the average woman. In fact, it's proven by studies that women only go for the top 20% of men. I understand that it's basic biology and people look for the best for themselves but it is actually impossible for every woman to have 6ft man while only 15% of men are above 6 feet. Plus it really gets on my nerves when people say that a man being short is the equivalent of an overweight woman. They're not the same. Weight can change, but you don't choose your height. The equivalent would be a woman with small boobs. Male virginity is on the rise and usually you have the ugly - medium guys being virgins at 25 and the handsome guys having been with 50 women at the same age. 

Men are also expected to pay in every situation. Most of the time women say that it's a dealbreaker when a guy doesn't pay on their first date. Honestly you can't be a feminist and say stuff like that. To me a man being the provider is a left over of patriarchy. But some women only want to free themselves from the negative aspects of patriarchy that affect their lives, but they want to keep those that keep them convenient. I'm all about gender equality. At everything, housework, payments etc. 

Lastly men are 4 times more likely to be homeless. The suicides rates are much higher for men (higher depression rates). Men do all the tough jobs and are the only ones that usually die at  work accidents (construction workers, mine workers etc.) Men usually never win custody of their children when they divorce, just because they're men.

Well of course I understand that women face their own problems. They're more likely to get sexually harassed, they get discriminated sometimes in their jobs, most men never do any housework. But all in all I think it's quite easier to survive and have a nice comfortable life as a woman rather than a man. Being hot literally means you're playing on easy mode, people might think you're dumb but you literally can get whatever you want, a hot man doesn't have the same privilege. 

It all comes down to patriarchy for me. Both men and women don't want to recognize the aspects of it and work for a more equal society. It's sad to see toxic behaviors from either way."
158,2023-12-25,CMV: AI is currently very overblown,u/appleparkfive,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18qigib/cmv_ai_is_currently_very_overblown/,changemyview,"(overhyped might be a better word for this specific situation)

I feel as though the talk around AI is a bit overblown, in it's current form. People act as if it's going to make all jobs obsolete except for a select few in the country. The tech community seems to be talking an awful lot like how they did with the .com boom, and sort of how people spoke about crypto a little under a decade ago.

To be clear, I *do* think that it will change some things, for some people. But it's not human. It doesn't know what it's doing. Hence where the ""broad vs narrow AI"" conversation comes from.

If we end up with ""broad"" AI (as opposed to the current ""narrow"" AI we have today), then that's a different story. But I don't think narrow AI leads to broad AI necessarily, and will be built by someone else entirely at some point in the future. But when that comes, then everything really will change.

I think that, at this point, we have a very helpful tool that is going to progress some. But the notion that it's just going to infinitely get better every year, just seems like marketing hype from people with a vested interest in it. The other tech companies are pushing their money into AI because it's the current ""next big thing"", and that they know there's a risk of missing out if it does come true.

Maybe I'm wrong. Who knows. But I'm extremely skeptical of a bunch of people overhyping a technology. Because it's a cycle that happens over and over again. 

I've seen people say that it's the biggest thing since the invention of the world wide web, or even just the computer in general (the latter comparison just seems silly, to be frank)

I'm fully open to hearing how this is different, and I have no strong bias against it. But this current form of AI leading to some massive leap in the next year or two just seems wrong to me, as of now."

As far as I can see no country has been able to positively incentivize their way to an above replacement level fertility rate once that drop has occurred.

1,2023-12-25,CMV: The Russia-Ukraine War should be treated as a minor concern for the UK.,u/SoloKip,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18qjwkv/cmv_the_russiaukraine_war_should_be_treated_as_a/,changemyview,"A Polish general recently talked about the worst case scenario for Europe. It goes something like this.

*Biden loses the next election (don't incumbent presidents usually win?), Trump pulls out of Ukraine and NATO (I am not sure this is even possible but to do so would be insane and a serious blow to American hegemony), Ukraine disintegrates without US support (they didn't at the start of the war even with little foreign support) and the Baltics fall as they are probably indefensible without US support. Here Putin turns his attention to Poland* and I suppose this is where the UK will be forced to get involved.

In response to this somewhat unlikely series of events, the UK has decided to increase Defence spending by nearly 25% with a flat lining economy and many other public sectors facing cuts. Some politicians have even spoken of wanting a 50% Defence increase over subsequent years. **This is my view that needs changing**.

The Polish army is far more formidable than Ukraine's ever was (they actually have a modern air force), have had far longer to prepare (defensive wars are easier) and have beaten the Russian Empire before. The idea that Putin will be capable of defeating this army while simultaneously occupying the largest country solely in Europe, who are highly motivated/ hostile with a tired war time economy that already spends far too much on the military seems far fetched to me.

But even if Putin could somehow do this, there is no way that Germany and France would allow Poland to fall. Combined they are superior in population, technology and money and have spent the last couple of centuries taking it in turns kicking the crap out of Russia as strong continental land powers.

If the US turns its back completely on a full scale European war, an economically strong UK is far scarier to any European land empire than any British army anyway. The UK has not been a serious land power on thhe European continet since the 1300s when we realised that it is expensive and pointless.

In WW2, the UK was a crucial impregnable base that was an intelligence hub that the Americans could use as a launch pad back onto the continent. In WW1, it was the economic might to be able to purchase most of the supplies headed for Germany from the US that brought them to the brink of collapse. In the Crimean War and even Napoleonic Wars it was efficient taxation and wealth from control of critical supply routes that allowed the funding of important alliances across the channel.

The point here is that in every single one of these conflicts, the UK was far inferior to all the other major land powers but came out on the winning side anyway.

So my view is that the UK should not be overly concerned about Russia to the point we increase Defence spending. Japan spend around 1% of GDP on Defence with an expansionist belligerent China on their doorstep and frankly they have the right idea. 

**TLDR We should instead spend the minimum necessary to remain in NATO because**:

1. The US will likely handle Russia.
2. Even if they don't, Poland, Germany and France definitely can and it is in their interest to do so. For example, Germany does not want a border with Russia.
3. If we need to help, unsustainably adding a few more tanks and soldiers are not going to be what makes the difference. Addressing the flatining economy, stagnation and subsequent decline of the UK is a far more effective way to do this."
1,2023-12-25,CMV: Modern America is no better than North Korea,u/FairLiving7266,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18qjztc/cmv_modern_america_is_no_better_than_north_korea/,changemyview,"Can't believe that I am posting this on Christmas, but here goes:

**Transportation**

Public transportation in most of America is a joke.  North Korea, on the other hand, has an excellent subway and bus system.

**Food**

Not many people in America are starving, but the food is low-quality.  There is lots of high-fructose corn syrup, chemically refined oil, and enriched, bleached flour in our food.  Even organic oil in the U.S. is chemically refined!  As a result, the U.S. almost has the highest obesity rate in the world.

**Politics**

Most U.S. politicians are out of touch, and don't listen to people.  Their policies are highly ineffective.

**Education**

The U.S. school system barely teaches anything useful, and there is too much grade inflation.

**Healthcare**

Highly overpriced, and low quality in many cases.

**Work Culture**

Lots of busywork, and the minimum workweek is usually 40 hours, not even including time to prepare for work.  Many workplaces are very controlling.  If I lied to some random Americans that this story happened in North Korea, they would believe me: https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa

**Freedom/Privacy**

Security cameras and ID card readers for recording people's information are very popular in the U.S., and there is usually no way to opt out from being recorded.  Police are allowed to act abusively and lie during interrogations.  I once was caught using these devices based on a small misunderstanding.  Also, I was not informed of these devices and their capabilities beforehand.  I was also abusively interrogated, though the charges were later dropped.  I actually could have refused interrogation, and things would have gone better.  But I was never told this (they lied when they said I was required to come).

In a similar case, someone I know lost his job as a TA because he made a joke using the phrase ""manifest destiny"" (which was not used in the context of slavery).  They made him wait two months for a college hearing.  Yet I once heard some Middle eastern students chanting ""The Jews have got to go!"" and nothing happened to them."

I do quite a bit of advocating against ideas that are also essentially universally accepted and I believe I could learn from the tactics of others who are stronger at debating.

More related to the idea, I have been alive to witness at least a bit of the evolution of the word faggot. When I was growing up, it was essentially used synonymously with asshole or douchebag. I remember vividly an interview Eminem gave about the Marshall Mathers LP when I was 13 in which he said ""When I say 'you faggots keep egging me on' I don't mean 'you gay people keep egging me on'"" and I remember thinking 'I can't believe he just had to explain that.'

Now faggot is just as derogatory as nigger and it would seem retard is fast approaching if not there already. There was also backlash against Lizzo in recent memory for using the word spaz.

The N-word has been the N-word since I've been alive. I was not present to witness its evolution but I would have to imagine it went through something similar. I never questioned it because for me it had always been part of my established reality. But having now witnessed it happen myself along with the threat of it continuing to happen more, it does give me cause to question if words evolving to have more power over us and essentially being forcibly removed from our vernacular is the correct direction. Something about it gives me 1984 vibes.

You can argue against either point. The second point probably could have been its own CMV but I wanted to give people something else to work with as my guess is there won't be too many bold enough to argue against the title, but there are of course deltas available for it. If you dare.

Merry Christmas to all."

I love PC gaming and I hope I'm proven wrong.  For the first time, I'm considering just getting a PS5/Xbox.

Prices on PC parts have gone up a lot.   Graphics cards have doubled.  The average motherboard and power supply price has nearly doubled the past 10 years.   You probably have to spend $1200+ to get the same performance as a $500 PS5.

There's a lot of minimum fixed costs to building a PC.  Case, motherboard, power supply, etc.  You've spend several hundred before you even get to put a GPU or GPU in.

Other points:

* A lot of PC games are poorly optimized ports.  Frame drops.  Bugs. etc.
* Consoles have higher framerates than they used to.
* The point that consoles do just gaming while PC's do a lot more is less relevant. The mobile devices that most people already own have gotten more powerful.  The same creative industrial applications that used to require a beefy desktop can now be on basic laptop.  So I'm not missing out if I don't get a PC.

It would be really nice to have a PC so that I can keep all my titles in Steam/Epic libraries and never have to worry about backwards compatibility.    I'd also like to have one box that I can both use for my desk and my tv setup.

But if I'm going to pay 2-3x the price to have a lot of unoptimized games, idk."

 I guess this is more about the nuclear family - kind of? I just feel like she’s doing something dangerous by having sex with both men and possibly women (not yet women I believe because she’s dating women for a long term relationship), and even now she had a yeast infection and is at plan parenthood early Christmas morning because the antibiotics gave her a uti and so she has to figure out what she’s gonna do there. I’m actually just freaking out because I genuinely care about her sexual and romantic safety, and if we had main monogamously heteronormative then the reason I believe she got the yeast infection - which to me is related to having multiple partners inside of her, would at least be out of my mind.

I just feel that heteronormativity would provide a way for two people to be safe while child-rearing, and I get lesbian and gay couples can raise kids, but I mean once you genetically have kids, remaining heteronormative is the safest way to raise them.

My situation is weird and so my comments here is naturally confusing even for someone like me - so hoping folks can change my mind because I know I am falling into some traps of fallacy due to my emotional state - so this is less of a “change my view for the sake of argument” and more so “change my view so I can think normally”. Thanks folks.

Edit: looks like my view change changed more than a handful of times. Looks like I was trying to express that the original configuration of parents when they have children are the best configurations for raising those children. Outside of my inherit jealousy and ego and all that plays into someone separating from me - I at the very least know that a health household is a healthy household regardless of gender identity and sexuality of the parents. Thanks for the support here

Edit: as the day is progressing, come to find out that the uti was very severe to the point that she needed to get a shot in her butt. And that’s coming out of my pocket. We share finances and I do the budgeting for the house - so along with the fading jealousy, there’s that, the waste of resources that could have been spent in other places - especially with the memory I have of her having yeast infections when having a new partner until her vagina gets used to having a new partner.

Now a reboot of The X-Files was announced, but without Chris Carter, so why not just bring back Debris?  Unfortunately, just as it was developing, it was cancelled.  


I don't want to give too many spoilers, but each episode was pretty different and the debris was actually largely incidental with large focuses on the interactions between the lead characters (Johnathon Tucker and Riann Steele).  It was certainly an homage to the X-Files with story potential, just like The X-Files, to evolve into any direction it wanted to.

I think a lot of people that commit suicide had some problem and they were not able to solve it and it’s very unfortunate but a lot of the time the bigger problem was society and the pressure it did put on the person who ended their life. Sometime people have chronic pain that is so hard to deal with that they commit suicide. Sometimes they are explicitly traumatised by society to commit suicide.

Then isn't it wiser to focus on destroying the ideology, not the group itself?

In other words: You can destroy the leaders, the group. Yet, if in the process, resentment within the civilian population is built, which becomes confirmation bias Hamas, and the ideology behind Hamas can use...

Then the teenagers of today, are the terrorist organization builders of tomorrow.

To concisely put my point:

Unless the ideology is destroyed, any military campaign is a waste of time when trying to get a better state in 2035. Since there is so much collatoral damage on the civilian population, the ideology won't be destroyed. In many cases, it'll remain, or get stronger. 

Therefore, it is self-defeating long-term.

In this sense, the US' failure of Afghanistan resonates. 

Lastly, even if they manage to defeat Hamas, enabling planned Saudi negotiations, a two state solution, or similar Israel/US enforced solution -- then the resentment within the population will still breed terrorism across those borders in the future.

1,2023-12-25,CMV: Objectification of women isn't as bad as they make it out to be,u/RedditExplorer89,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18qs46r/cmv_objectification_of_women_isnt_as_bad_as_they/,changemyview,"I hear this in discourse when women wear sexy clothing in movies or video games: that it objectifies women (and I assume the speaker thinks this is a bad thing).  This is also usually accompanied with complaints that women are being seen as ""just"" sex objects, and that their other human qualities are being diminished.  One women I've met said, ""I want to be seen as more than a bag of warm meat.""

On a base level, I do think its bad if someone feels bad, and its clear women feel bad about objectification.  In that sense, I'd agree objectification is bad.  However, I think these perceptions of their image are distortions, and I don't understand *why* they feel so bad about it.  I'll explain the reasoning why I have this view:

1.) Perceptions of objectification are distortions of reality.  No guy I've ever met sees women as ""walking vaginas"" or ""bags of warm meat.""  Yeah, sex might be the most attractive thing about a women for some guys, but even the guys trying to constantly get laid understand that they are dealing with a human being who has a brain and feelings.  They court women, trying to appeal with intelligent conversation or being sensitive to her feelings (guys that don't do this quickly learn being a douche doesn't get you dates).  If they really just wanted warm bags of meat they could much more easily buy meat from the butcher, heat it up in the oven, and play around with that.  Or buy a sex doll.  But men consistently choose to go after living, breathing women who have brains and opinions.

In modern media, it may be true that a women's body parts might be the most attractive thing *initially for a guy*, but its really more of an attention grabber.  Once the movie/game starts, the personality of woman comes through.  For example: Lara Croft in Tomb Raider (a character model who is heavily sexualized) had her personality and story changed part way through, and fans of the franchise were upset over it.

2.)  I don't get why women feel bad about objectification.  If men were constantly showed as sex objects I don't think it would bother me.  Heck, there are even jokes that ""men are dumb,"" or ""men have 0 emotional IQ"" and I just laugh at it.  I feel like if I was seen as just a hunk of muscles that would be kinda awesome if anything.  I also get the impression a lot of men would be okay with it too, based on the men I've met in my life.  So, I don't understand why it seems only women have an issue with this.

**What would change my view**

I'd like to better understand why women feel bad about objectification, and learn if there is truth to their perceptions of their image regarding it.

* Data/studies showing that men only see women as walking bags of meat.

* Tell me why it doesn't feel good to be seen as a sexy creature.  Is this just because men have a higher sex drive?

* Maybe something else could change my view, such as pointing out a flaw in my reasoning.  This was just what I could think of for this post.

**Deltas**

* Men complain about being expected to be the breadwinner, which could point to just either human not understanding the feeling of being a situation they haven't experienced (ie: haven't experienced objectification so I don't know why it would feel bad)

* If people claim your achievements are due to your looks that would be upsetting.

* Historically, women had to put men as the face of their achievement, and to do that had to sleep with the man.  This objectification is bad, because they don't get acknowledgement for their achievement and might sleep with someone they otherwise would not want to.

* ""Being compared to things you buy and own as a woman feels shitty because this is how some men still see us -- as property.""  - and objectification can lead to being compared to things you buy.

* Human qualities being diminished could be dangerous and lead to doing inhumane things to those people.

* Honor killings, where women are killed due to bringing shame on the family for being to sexual.

* There are men who treat women poorly with objectification and can be harmful, especially for younger women who might not know what a good relationship looks like.

* [Study](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s73942/Appendix%206%20-%20Journal%20Article.pdf) shows that seeing women as sexual objects leads to more sexual assault of women."

The exceptions are obviously sexual problems brought on by ill-health or trauma. In that case 'in sickness and in health' applies.

In a perfect world people should of course split. But for many this is almost impossible due to kids and finances.

352,2023-12-25,"CMV: The Israeli settlements are illegal and unjustified, and the USA should condemn Israel for it",u/GoSouthCourt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18qsasj/cmv_the_israeli_settlements_are_illegal_and/,changemyview,"In the Geneva Convention, it's illegal to transfer your own civilians to occupied territory, stating that ""the Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies."". In a [document](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-199015/) prepared by the UN in 1999, it says:


>Article 49 of the 4th Geneva Convention is very specific in its reference to settlers or civilians of the occupying Power and states explicitly that ""the Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. ""This article prohibits settlements in broad and unequivocal terms without regard to the purported purposes of the settlements and was created specifically to prevent the colonization that inevitably ensues with such population transfers

The General Assembly, including the UK and many in the West, has condemned the illegality of these settlements numerous times, the Security Council [passed a resolution](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/1696?ln=en) in 1979 declaring that these settlements have no legal validity, and the ICJ has [ruled](https://web.archive.org/web/20200913105418/https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/131/131-20040709-ADV-01-00-EN.pdf) that the settlements violate international law, rendering them illegal. 

If anyone wants to argue that the West Bank is not occupied territory, both ICJ and [UNSC](https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/SCRes242%281967%29.pdf) have ruled territories East of the Green Line to be occupied territory, and the rulings in the paragraph above presupposes West Bank as occupied territories too.

There is also [settler violence](https://www.btselem.org/topic/settler_violence) that Israel has failed to properly address, [doubly illegal settlements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_outpost) (illegal in Israeli law and international law) are not removed promptly and sometimes protected by the IDF. 

These are all unjustified because they come at the expense of Palestinians, forcing them into an apartheid-like state, an obstacle for peace (as described by the US), and often leads to unnecessary arrests of Palestinians for retaliating against settler violence.

If the USA doesn't want to be hypocritical, they must unequivocally condemn Israel for illegal settlements, just as many countries in the West have done. It's not like it will hinder their ability to send military aid to Israel anyway because the UK have also made military deals with Israel.

Edit: To clarify, declaring something illegal is not the same as condemning. Looking at the annexation of Crimea, many non-align countries declare the annexation and referendum illegal, or saying Ukraine's territorial integrity must be respected, but stop short of condemning Russia for it, because condemnation means something in diplomacy. If US condemns Israel tomorrow, for literally anything, it will permanently shift US-Israel relation because US has crossed a line that Israel didn't think they would cross."
1,2023-12-25,CMV: American Football is THE most boring sport to watch,u/rhythmmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18qsenl/cmv_american_football_is_the_most_boring_sport_to/,changemyview,"Context: I'm European, and in NA for the first time for Christmas. Apparently they play NFL on Christmas Day, so that's on in the background. I have seen highlights before, but never watched a game from the start. We are currently ""15 minutes"" into the game, which may seem premature, but I've seen enough to see where this is going.

A few reasons of why I'm finding this so boring:

- constant set plays which last about 2 seconds.
- the presentation is SO focused on entertainment over actual sporting contest. Fireworks, people dancing at the side of the pitch, loudspeaker announcements, advert after advert after advert etc. I'm here to watch sport, not WWE - which is what this feels like.
- there is a HUGE disparity between positions/roles. Most (I'm aware, not all) sports, require all players to have a significant level of skill using a ball, or a tool of some sort. In this, it seems like only a very small number of players need to actually have handling/throwing skills - 90% of the players need no ball skill, and their only skills are based around physical strength/following instructions - this is boring.

How to change my view: If you try and argue about WHY American Football isn't boring, you will probably fail. Feel free to try, and I'm open to hearing, but it'll be an uphill battle. If you try and argue that another sport is MORE boring than this, you may succeed. I want to hear about what sports are even more boring than this.

1,2023-12-25,CMV: Bodybuilding is stupid,u/RaindropDripDropTop,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18qsqa8/cmv_bodybuilding_is_stupid/,changemyview,"I want to be clear, I'm not talking about lifting weights in general, I'm specifically referring to competitive bodybuilding, especially when it involves cycling a bunch of gear (using PEDs), and getting to dangerously low body fat levels and severe dehydration to go on stage.  

I definitely recognize that competitive bodybuilders have insane levels of dedication and training. It is without doubt incredibly difficult to achieve those type of physiques, even for people with top tier genetics who use PEDs. Even the most genetically blessed and steroid enhanced bodybuilders still work insanely hard. I am not doubting their work ethic and drive. What I think is stupid about it is why do people think that this is worth it. 

For starters, it is purely for the sake of vanity rather than athleticism or strength. A bodybuilder might look absolutely insane, but functionally speaking, actual athletes who train to maximize athletic ability have way more physical capability depending on what sport they train for. Whether it's strength, speed, endurance, acceleration, vertical leap, flexibility, dexterity, or a combination of all these things, bodybuilders just aren't nearly as physically capable as actual athletes who put in similar time and effort into their training.

On the topic of vanity, bodybuilder physiques don't even look attractive or aesthetically pleasing. Obviously this is subjective, but the vast majority of the population is way more attracted to a healthy athletic physique than they are to a bodybuilder physique. I get that bodybuilding isn't really about looking attractive, rather it is about pushing the limits of what is possible with the human body, but it's honestly kind of just a freak show.

The biggest reason bodybuilding is stupid is that it is insanely unhealthy. Even for natural bodybuilders who don't use PEDs, they are still getting to dangerously low body fat levels and becoming extremely dehydrated in order to achieve their stage physique. This is incredibly taxing on the body, and it's extremely common for bodybuilders to suffer severe health issues because of this. For the ones who do use PEDs, which is basically a requirement to become a top level bodybuilder, the damage to health is even more severe, and they suffer many side effects as a result, especially ones who are not properly educated on the drugs they are taking.

One might argue that bodybuilding might be worth it for the money, but the reality is that only the top few bodybuilders in the world are making significant money through this career. The vast majority of bodybuilders, especially amateurs and people who do regional or local shows, aren't actually making much if any money through this. They also have to dedicate insane amount of time and effort into training, and if they are using gear, they are spending a ton of money on drugs. Moreover, there are similar alternatives to bodybuilding that are way more lucrative and more accessible to most people, such as becoming a fitness influencer or something (not saying that many people can break into that field either, but it's more achievable than making money through competitive bodybuilding).

The reason I am asking for my view to be changed is because I want to hear opposing perspectives, and maybe someone can shed some light on what I am missing. Like I said, I respect the work ethic and drive of bodybuilders, I just have a really hard time wrapping my head around it. I totally respect people's rights to do whatever they want with their body so long as they aren't harming others, I'm really just trying to understand the mindset of a bodybuilder, or at least understand what the appeal is."

I don’t believe you should be literally charged with negligent manslaughter, which is why I didn’t say “charged with.”

I’m coming at this position from the following premises:

1. The primary point of prison is to separate dangerous people from civil society and deter certain actions. It is not to punish people or to get revenge. Prison in almost any form is not likely to consistently or meaningfully rehabilitate (sadly).

2. People who drink, drive, and kill have proven they are unsafe and therefore segregated from society with a prison sentence.

3. People who drink, drive, and don’t kill are just as dangerous because they have made the same decision to recklessly endanger the lives of others. They only escape killing people because of luck 

Conclusion: given the above, a person who drinks and drives but doesn’t actually injure someone has shown they are a threat to the wellbeing of others and should be kept separate from society for that reason as someone who kills while drinking and driving."

Climate change will cause terrible environmental changes that will cause millions to die/suffer from flooding, food shortages, etc. this will come to head in the coming decades. This is a fact.

To solve climate change we need to emit less co2 in the atmosphere. 

We can do that in America:
1. Eliminating single use plastics:

-Buying food at refillerys

-using glass and aluminum drinks

-companies will be fined/stoped for using wasteful plastic packaging

-right to repair will be law 

2. Banning the use private vehicles:

-every has to take the bus, train, or bike (unless they have great reason not to)

-the rich can’t use private planes

-banning new gas vehicles 

3. Nationalizing, regulating, rationing public utilities:

-Utilities will be free but rationed depending on need

-coal and natural gas power plants will only be used if renewables can’t (edit: I’m obviously down for nuclear)

-Anyone using too much ultilities will be fined/stopped

-helping other countries under America’s influence do the same

-banning single family detached housing 

-banning new housing too far outside a urban center

Doing this in America by itself will mitigate climate change greatly but most Americans are too self-involved to give up cars and single family houses.

Edit: -banning NEW single family detached housing
-for private vehicles small scale electric recreation vehicles are allowed 

Edit 2: Wow, this post got a lot of attention. Most people got caught up in the car thing. I specifically said “unless you have a great reason”. I didn’t say we are rounding up everyone’s cars and destroying them. Just the idea of using public transportation made many people visceral angry. (I also don’t appreciate the insults in my messages) That proved my point, many people wouldn’t change for the good of society. These measures if taken seriously would have to be done in like 10 year timeline. But for them to be done at all some people will have to sacrifice their time and comfort. Most people rather say climate change isn’t real or China is the problem. Before we criticize other countries let’s look at our selves. I understand we need regulations to fully do these things but why would regulations come if it looks like nobody cares. Also not all these things have to be done right away at one time. 

Long story short the sentiment I got from everyone is: 

Fuck you, I’m not changing it makes my life harder 

instead of

Those solutions are drastic but i’m going to start making changes so we start a movement that starts mitigating the worse effects of climate change and pollution.

And that was my problem

Moreover, we see this in every area of life that requires consistency from people. Rarely do people who lose a significant amount of weight keep it down, rarely do people build long term habits that they weren’t already inclined to. 

In my opinion, the people that do, didn’t get that discipline out of self will but through environmental factors conducive to creating those habits, e.g. better friends, negative external pressure.

To me it seems like the only effective way to improve self discipline is by changing the other areas of your life that are conducive to self discipline meaning a better environment, and decreased stress."

Even the best 3D fallout game ever, New Vegas sucks in that depatment. The game is good, but good for reasons besides shooting. And honestly VATS is a good Quality of Life feature that helps you aboid the shooting mechanics

At the same time, if the game was turn based, the shooting wouldn't feel so bad, and if you could control your sidekicks, they would prove to be a huge asset. Fallout would be so much better as a classic cRPG.

At first I thought ""not many people would be want to play that"", but the success of Baldur's Gate 3 made me rethink that a little bit. Games by Larian and Owlcat are kinda good and people like them.

But this ignores the key issue. The US cannot end the Russian invasion of Ukriane (though it has sent Ukriane a significant amount of weapons), nor can it end the RSF in Sudan. The US **can**, however, pressure Israel to stop its genocide in Gaza. Israel has systemically targeted hospitals, refugee camps, schools and churches, to 'relocate' (i.e ethnically cleanse) Palestinians from Gaza.

1,2023-12-25,CMV: I personally disagree with the recent calls for McDonald's/Burger King boycott,u/Comicostar,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18qz6u8/cmv_i_personally_disagree_with_the_recent_calls/,changemyview,"Alternative title: Franchise shouldn't be punished for the action of an independent local franchise. 

What this post is NOT about and disclaimers 
1) Pro Israel: I support Palestine. I'm not going to argue with this here as this is not the point of the post. 

2) McDonald's or Burger King should have never been boycott: I'm sure you could point to xyz but the recent accusation to boycott is what I'm talking about specifically. 

 If you want to boycott a restaurant for whatever reason, that's fine. However, there is a difference between a ""personal boycott"" and a boycott that is called by mass and anyone who supports the business will have their character judge. Sometimes that scenerio makes sense but I have hard to time thinking McDonald's and Burger King should apply from this situation. (I'm emphasizing this situation) 

Facts 1:
The official BDS movement request we boycott McDonald's/Burger King and others because of their support  of Israel. 

(I looked into the bdsmovement.net after writing this post and this is what I found. According to bdsmovement.net, boycotts against these ""grassroots organic boycott"" aren't initiated by the BDS so it's confusing if it the BDS wants2 Pro-Palestinians to boycott or not. The article was written by the Palestinian BDS National Committee so I say yes for now) 

Facts 2:
McDonald's Israel and Burger King Israel have supported Israel. (McDonald's Israel gave troops food and Burger King Israel made a support post on social media)  [insert citation] 

Fact 3:
Fact 2 is why many Pro-Palestinians boycott all McDonald's and Burger King around the world. 

Fact 4:.
McDonald's and Burger King are US based franchises. 

My issue is that McDonald's Israel nor Burger King  Israel isn't representative of what the base US franchise thinks. This isn't a like a CEO saying a racial slur where that reflects on the base company. How does giving McDonald's or BK money in the US hurt Palestinians? None of that money magically teleports to the land of Israel unless you are living in Israel and giving those franchises money. If it did then the boycott would make sense. That's why itself not really correct to say McDonald's or Burger King did X if you are referring to an independent franchise that isn't connected to the main branch. 


Even then there are McDonald franchises who shown support of Palestine and donated to Gaza. So saying ""McDonald's gave money to Gaza"" should also be just as valid of a  statement just as much as ""McDonald's gave IDF good"". I couldn't find anything connects Israel to the McDonald's franchise.

Reminds of the #boycottihop because a tone deaf sign at one restaurant as if one random store owners opinion dictates how IHOP feels. 

Not complete defense for these companies as We can shift the goal post and claim the problem is their ""compliance"" as McDonald's and Burger King isn't shutting down those franchise for their actions. Thats a better reason to boycott but even then I dont think giving them your money is really judge one's character. As I said, this is a goal post shift as this is not why the boycott against McDonald's and other franchise started. I'm sure these companies have done other terrible actions you personally would stop supporting them because of those actions but they aren't relevant for my post.

If I did something undesirable like get in trouble at school, or make a smartass comment because I didn’t want to do something, naturally things got taken away and chores got added instead. 

This has happened around Christmas for me before, and the next year I behaved a lot better and never dealt with them returning or not getting any of my stuff ever again. (Was it embarrassing to have to be shown my parents were for real? Yes.) I think this is quite normal and much less harmful than getting constantly whacked with a belt or cord or other object (I *used* to have this happen, my heart goes out to everyone else who may have endured that as well), but a decent set of my contemporaries thinks that it’s equally “cruel” to not give a bunch of Christmas gifts regardless of behavior because “it’s a core memory” and “their peers will isolate them if they don’t get anything.” Also it’s wrong because “Christmas isn’t a privilege” and “if they have to earn it it’s a reward, not a gift.”

My thing is what about the less fortunate kids who already don’t get anything? Or the ones who don’t celebrate Christmas anyway so not getting toys on 12/25 doesn’t bother them to begin with? I understand smaller kiddos may struggle more with impulse control, but I fail to see how it’s “traumatic” for them to not get a doll or action figure or toy car *once.* Actions have consequences, whether good or bad. If you’re going to be a jerk and every single tiny mistake is “You’re not getting anything,” yeah you’re a shit parent who won’t be patient with your kid. But if they keep repeatedly acting up, why are you supposed to spend your hard earned money on a bunch of *extras*? I’ve seen this called “bullying,” “cruelty,” “emotional immaturity” and cannot fathom how it is. It’s just an early “actions have consequences” lesson to me, and children are absolutely bright enough to understand that."

As stated, people who worked in large charity organizations are usually passionate about helping their communities, therefore know the ins and outs of it, making them the best people to lend your donations to. A drunken beggar you encountered on the street who has the capacity to work might not need your money as much as that single mother seeking asylum that you have no knowledge of. Furthermore, these places are also central infrastructures that people in need actively seek out, making it all the more convenient for those who want to help. 

Moreover, we see different charities doing more than just distributing aid. They are also at the forefront when it comes to other kinds of concious effort, such as marathons to raise fund for cancer patients which most of them were directed by big organizations, or Khan academy, whose aim is to provide free education for all, is also a large central institution. The point is, only large, central figures can make actions like these significant, one man running for children does not solve anything, but many men scrambling in a marathon does. 

Ofcourse, there are valid concerns when it comes to big charities. Some are corrupt and steal donations. This is why some degree of caution is required, but ultimately these can be easily avoided by doing thorough research.
Another concern is that big charities function as tax loophole for billionaires, therefore, they act as financial devices for these people, thus it is better not to support big charities. But this is clearly a legislation problem, not pertaining to the question of our donations having the maximum effect on society."
79,2023-12-26,"CMV: El Salvador's crackdown of violent gang members shows that in extreme situations, public health and criminal justice takes precedence over due process.",u/HelpfulJello5361,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18r2579/cmv_el_salvadors_crackdown_of_violent_gang/,changemyview,"This is a [story](https://www.itv.com/news/2023-06-26/el-salvadors-murder-rate-has-fallen-dramatically-but-at-what-cost) that has gone woefully under-reported in the western media, and I think it's because it shows something that makes a lot of people uncomfortable in 1st world countries: when you crack down hard on crime, it can be extremely effective.

Short version of [what happened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvadoran_gang_crackdown)...

El Salvador used to have one of the world's highest murder rates. Violent gangs ran roughshod over the terrified citizens living in El Salvador, killing and committing other capital crimes with little to fear from law enforcement.

>El Salvador used to have the world’s highest murder rate; **106 homicides per 100,000 people** in 2015.

Then in March of 2022, there was a slaughter of civilians in the street with apparently no rhyme or reason, apparently the gangs just decided they wanted to flaunt their murderous barbarity in a very public way just to assert their domination and mock law enforcement.

>From 25 to 27 March 2022, 87 people were murdered in El Salvador, including 62 people on Saturday alone, the highest single-day tally in decades; by contrast, 79 people were murdered throughout the entire month of February. **The victims were targeted randomly.**

This seemed to have been the last straw for the El Salvadorian government, and they decided it was time to shut down these murderous monsters once and for all.

>During an extraordinary session early on 27 March, the Salvadoran Legislative Assembly approved a ""state of exception"". The order, which was initially set to last thirty days but has been extended fourteen times, suspended the rights of association and legal counsel, increased the amount of time that persons may be detained without being charged from three days to fifteen, and permitted the government to monitor citizens' communications without warrants. However, Salvadoran law enforcement was accused of violating even the expanded limits of their powers.\[The government also restricted the ability of judges to offer prisoners alternatives to pre-trial detention, like bail and house arrest.  
>  
>Members of Nuevas Ideas passed new rules that increase prison sentences for convicted gang lords to forty to forty-five years (previously six to nine) and twenty to thirty years for other members (previously three to five) and reduce the age of criminal responsibility, previously sixteen years old, to twelve. They also passed a law that threatens anyone who reproduces or disseminates messages from gangs, including news media, with ten to fifteen years in prison.  
>  
>After one month, more than 17,000 people had been arrested;\[25\] on 25 May, the National Civil Police announced that more than 34,500 people had been arrested since the start of the state of emergency

So then what happened is, the government of El Salvador built a megaprison to house all of these killers for decades, maybe even life. The controversy comes because these gang members were arrested and jailed without due process.

The thing is, if you're a gang member in El Salvador, you almost always have gang tattoos. This makes it very easy to identify who is in a gang, as you can imagine. Denying membership in a gang is hard to do when you're covered in gang tattoos.

As much as we value due process, this is one of those relatively rare situations where the idea that someone is ""innocent until proven guilty"" is a bit silly. It's like having a tattoo on your face that says ""I AM A GANG MEMBER WHO MURDERS PEOPLE"" and trying to argue that you're just an ordinary citizen.

And wouldn't you know it, after this crackdown, the homicide rate plummeted.

>The homicide rate has fallen to **7.6 per 100,000** and may drop even lower this year.

We as Americans and people from other first world nations might take issue with removing due process to stop the mass slaughter of innocent civilians, but maybe we should listen to the people actually living in El Salvador.

>Domestically, the crackdown was popular. An April 2022 Gallup poll found that 91% of Salvadorans supported the government's actions, including 78% who ""very much"" supported them. Many Salvadorans explained that they were weary of violence, and many Salvadorans living in the United States supported the crackdown.

Even though the dramatic drop in homicide rate kind of proves that these guys are the cause, they're still putting forth the colossal time and financial resources to give them all fair trials, even though their guilt is literally sprawled on their bodies.

While it's true that a tiny minority of people who were arrested because of their gang tattoos might be posers or otherwise not guilty of capital crimes, this has been accounted for by the defense minister.

>Human rights advocates have criticized the arrests as often arbitrary, based on a person's appearance or residence, and expressed concern that innocent people are being caught in the sweeps. Bukele claimed that only 1% of arrests would be incorrect, and Salvadoran Defense Minister René Merino Monroy claimed that arrested persons found to have no links to gangs would be freed, saying that ""the people need to know that if they're not involved in anything bad, nothing bad will happen to them.

So yeah, this is a story that I think is not reported on enough, and it shows that sometimes cracking down hard on crime might just be the right thing to do when nothing else works.

What do you guys think about this? I don't see a big problem here. The government saw a state of emergency going on with gangs of violent monsters slaughtering innocent civilians, eventually out of pure wanton frenzy, and they put a stop to it by making the sacrifice of temporarily suspending due process. And guess what? It could not have possibly worked better.

Am I wrong to support this? Change my view."

To address these responses, let me make it abundantly clear what I’m **NOT** saying.

* I am **NOT** saying that progressivism/liberalism is perfect, always right and is never wrong or misguided.
* I am **NOT** saying that conservatism is always wrong or evil.
* I am **NOT** saying that conservatism should be eliminated or that a single party/ideology would be a good thing. That would obviously be awful.

All of this should be obvious, but unfortunately doesn’t seem to be the case. Now, onto what I **AM** saying.

**CONSERVATISM & INJUSTICE**

Conservatism has driven and defended the worst injustices and societal poisons that have plagued the U.S. since its founding. To name just a few: slavery, racial segregation, oppression of women, discrimination against LGBT people and more. I've gone into further detail about these issues below.

Many of America’s greatest triumphs occurred by defeating the conservative drive and defense of these injustices. The Civil War ended slavery; the women’s suffrage and civil rights movements granted women the right to vote and ended government-sanctioned racial segregation and other horrors of the post-Civil War landscape.

**PRINCIPALS OF CONSERVATISM**

Before I delve into some examples, it's important to understand what conservatism is, what it entails and what it's goals and motivations are.

**Conservatism:** At its core, conservatism centers on preserving and defending long-standing tradition and the status quo. In short: Conservatism is about fighting against societal change – especially widespread, transformative change – and keeping things largely how they are and how they were in the past.

***I’ve cited a few official definitions of conservatism, along with additional detail, at the end of the post, if anyone is interested.***

**KEY MOMENTS IN U.S. HISTORY**

To give a greater understanding of what I’m referring to, here are just a few monumental moments in American history, along with the conservative position supporting and defending injustice.

* **American Revolution**: At the time of the American Revolution, the status quo, traditions and institutions of society were centered on European colonial power. The American Revolution was about as massive of a change and disruption to the status quo as it could get.
   * **Conservative position**: Held by the [Loyalists/Tories/Royalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalist_(American_Revolution)), who wanted to remain a British colony and strongly opposed the radical change and upending of society/institutions that came with revolution against the Crown.
* **Abolition movement/Civil War**: In the 1800s, the status quo was a nation where a sizable portion of the country relied heavily on the institution of slavery. This dynamic was embedded into the country’s traditions, economy and way of life since its founding. Abolishing slavery meant upending and completely transforming America's economic system, culture and way of life.
   * **Conservative position:**  Held by the Confederacy and its sympathizers, who were fighting to preserve the long-standing culture, economic system and way of life that slavery upheld.
* **Women’s suffrage/civil rights movement**: Until these movements occurred, the status quo/tradition/culture in America involved restricting women, black people and other minorities from the political process/power structure. Changing that by expanding voting rights to women/black people and ending state-sponsored discrimination and segregation meant once again upending an enormous portions of American society, economics, traditions and values.
   * **Conservative position**: Held by anti-suffrage, pro-tradition/religious groups and leaders in the Jim Crow South -- all of whom adamantly opposed these monumental and transformative societal changes. They fought to preserve the power structure/political process that was part of America since its founding -- one where women, Black people and other minority groups were excluded from voting and anything to do with the wielding of power.

**TODAY'S POLITICAL BATTLES**

All of this puts contemporary battles over current hot-button issues like LGBTQ rights and climate change into perspective. ***Will these be even more examples of conservatism supporting and defending things that we’ll look back on as reprehensible, misguided and damaging to the country – the way we do with these other issues from history?***

As promised, here's the definitional info on conservatism referenced above.

**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON CONSERVATISM**

Some additional information about conservatism itself:

* [**CONSERVATISM**](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Political+conservatism): A political philosophy or attitude that emphasizes respect for traditional institutions and opposes the attempt to achieve social change though legislation or publicly funded programs.
* [**CONSERVATISM**](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/conservatism): The disposition to preserve or restore what is established and traditional and to limit change
* [**CONSERVATISM**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism): An aesthetic, cultural, social, and political philosophy, which seeks to promote and to preserve traditional social institutions. Adherents of conservatism often oppose modernism and seek a return to traditional values.
* There’s also the famous, widely cited definition by William F. Buckley, one of the most influential conservative leaders in history: ***“A conservative is someone who stands athwart history, yelling STOP, at a time when no one is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those who so urge it.”***"
1,2023-12-26,cmv: I don’t like old people,u/t1gr3ss3,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18r38ya/cmv_i_dont_like_old_people/,changemyview,"for context: im an 18 year old, queer, white, woman. also leftist.

i feel like my respect for elders went out the window when i started working at a pet store in a city where it was 90% old people. they’re all rich, they’re all white, and they were my entire customer base at this store. i don’t know if it’s because the areas very conservative, and many of them made me feel unsafe (not physically, they’re old asf, i can beat them in a fight easy). but i knew that many of these people are not accepting of queer people. this wasn’t a problem, because im barely out of the closet anyways. it’s a disagreement, and politics don’t come up at the pet store, but if they knew who i was, they sure as hell wouldn’t accept me, which gives me no reason to accept them.

with old men, ive been called strange names and been sexualized (as a minor). i’ve been chatted up by guys closer to my age, but nothing as lewd as what these men said to me. but honestly, that’s nothing in comparison to the women.

these women are the most condescending, entitled people in the world. some are nice, but even then, i know they carry themselves in a way that conveys they think they’re above me. it’s a type of energy i only feel from older people. they still feel like they have authority over me, like they deserve respect from me by virtue of being old. one would complain that i wouldn’t hold the door for her??? as if we didn’t have an automatic door for handicapped people? that still confuses me to this day. i don’t know what difference i would make. 

also, a very old woman would come to the register and giggle at me like i was a baby by the register. in the same way you laugh at a puppy in a superman costume. like, “ohhh how cute!! he thinks he’s superman!” it’s degrading and minimizing. like i don’t even deserve to work this minimum wage job. there was also another woman who gave me $20 for no reason. im not complaining, but she gave it to me like that was life-changing money. like i was homeless and she pitied me. she literally said the words “buy yourself something nice” like a cartoon character. i just donated the $20 because it felt gross. i don’t need saviour complex money.  and also, i made that money in over an hour of work, it didn’t really mean that much. maybe give that money to somebody who could actually benefit from it?? maybe give that as a tip to an industry that normalizes tipping?

i had my fair share of karens, i wont harp on it too much, but yeah, definitely applied to my job. you can imagine how much more common they are in that neighborhood.

 these people are weird. point blank. for some of them, you had to be there to understand why. i’m not going to sit here and act like there weren’t nice old people. but it’s come to point, with so many negative/odd experiences, where i get nervous around old people. at this point, the only ones i respect are my grandparents. which is obviously not healthy. idk why a job i had for nearly a year ruined my perception on an entire age category. i don’t know how to not generalize these people. especially from a political angle considering statistically, many of them want me back in the kitchen, or sent to conversion therapy.

1,2023-12-26,"CMV: The extreme views and social justice warriors we see today have inter-relational mental disorders, child-like entitlement issues and NPD... caused by unchecked use of anti-depressants and stimulants during crucial brain developmental periods of their lives.",u/LostYou-FoundMyself,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18r4cqm/cmv_the_extreme_views_and_social_justice_warriors/,changemyview,"Let me start with the fact that I consider myself quite liberal and I do support causes that improve the individual life quality and mental health, including using anti-depressants and stimulants. I also happen to research brain development for the last 15 years and how common medicine affects human brain development. I am not a native english speaker so please excuse my mistakes.   


In the last decade, the society has changed dramatically in the way it manages problems. Instead of blaming the individual, the focus has become more on the abstract ""system"". I think in many ways this is a good evolutions, but large number of people seem to be taking this view to the absolute extreme. It seems that every young person has identity issues, self-harm issues, inter-relational issues and depression.   
When asked about what can be done, the answer is: Everything bad in life is because of \[insert ideology, group of people, country, company \]. Every effort to improve \[ insert issue\] involves dismantling the system, attacking and cancelling every idea/person that is deemed to be from the other side. We are heading into times where there is no way to speak up or consider ideas from both sides without being attacked and shamed, especially on social media. Very few people seem to be able to look at how they themselves can change to improve their environment. And if they are interested in self-improvement, it usually involves bettering their looks and financial status, not to improve the society.   


This focus on negative aspects, view of self and self-group as the ""absolute-right"" and disregard of good things and nuances within ""the system"" is a sign of inability to take responsibility and inability to integrate multiple aspects of reality. Black and white thinking is dominating, everyone needs to pick a team. These are all signs narcissistic defenses against difficult emotions like sadness, shame, guilt and helplessness. The hallmark of BPD, NPD and other dark triad disorders.

In the last decade, the use of anti-depressants and stimulants like Aderall has skyrocketed. The US is the biggest consumer in the world by far. The problem that no-one talks about is the fact that women who take anti-depressants during pregnancy and early life of the child are more likely to  have a child with empathy issues, emotional regulation issues and have high scores of narcissistic traits. Taking these drugs as a child can also increase the likelihood of developing these issues and traits. Adderall use during early years has also been linked to autistic defenses and emotional numbness, which can lead to emotional disregulation and lack of emotional maturity.

&#x200B;

I think we are now seeing these factors coming in full effect after decades of unchecked use of these medicines. 

The counter argument is that people are just fed up of capitalism and all the establishments that contribute to inequality. I get that, but I still think the manner of fighting these injustices does not reflect an ability to make a better system, just create another one full of injustices where people will be privileged if they are in \[insert social status or perceived minority\]. True betterment needs the ability to integrate good things from multiple aspects, including the one you personally dislike.

This is a story I've seen on Reddit countless times.

Additionally, testosterone makes men quicker to anger and less empathetic overall.  It's a fairly common anecdote from transgender men that after being on HRT for a while, they feel less in touch with their own emotions and have a shorter temper.

Therefore, I posit that men are inherently dangerous.  Given that I am a man and don't want to be rounded up into the extermination camps for the safety of society, I don't want this to be the truth.  CMV?"

The reason for this is obvious. Oath breakers are honor less liars that can't be trusted. They broke their oath once and they will most certainly do it again.  The framers of the 14th amendment recognized the danger of liars who broke their oath posed to the nation, thus they were prohibited from holding office.

Trump has already admitted in a court of law that he  doesn't support the constitution, admitting that he is an oath breaker but using snake words to do so.

If trump is elected president he would be an illegitimate president because the constitution  explicitly prohibits oath breakers like him to hold office.

Admittedly, the move is literally anti-democratic, as it removes the power of the people to vote for Trump. However, this is not only perfectly constitutional, it is completely justified. There are many groups of people that aren't eligible for the presidency according to our constitution that no one raises a stink about. 


Requirements:
- Be at least 35 years old.
- Be a natural born citizen of the U.S.
- Have been a resident of the United States for 14 years
- Not have engaged in an act of insurrection or rebellion against the United States after previously taking an oath of office, and congress has not overruled the disqualification by a supermajority.


Frankly, the fourth point, Section 3 of the 14th amendment, is the most fair of these requirements. Why can't a 33 year old run for president? Why not give the people the power to decide if they're experienced or not? How about  23 year old? Or a 13 year old? Let the people decide! Why exclude natural born citizens? Let the people decide!


I believe that Section 3 is by far the most natural and least arbitrary one of these requirements. If you take an oath to protect the constitution, and then break that oath, you should not be allowed to take that oath again. 


Additionally, the move is not unjustified because Trump has not yet been convicted of insurrection. Section 3 does not require this to be the case, and historically, the amendment was not written with this as a requirement, nor has precedent been set that required such a conviction.


Not one person who has been formally disqualified under Section 3 was ever charged with rebellion or insurrection. The text, legislative history, and precedent all make clear that this was never an issue. Section 3 is a qualification for holding public office, not a criminal penalty.


Furthermore, it is not as if this decision was not made legally or without examining evidence. Five judges have now ruled that Trump engaged in insurrection, not out of spite but with substantive evidence that was brought to the courts by republicans. People seem to think that these decisions have been made lightly. Republicans cannot simply turn around and take Biden off the ballot in the same way.


Additionally, a dozen other Section 3 challenges have been brought to courts across the country, all were rejected on procedural grounds, and none have denied the idea that Trump engaged in insurrection. 


This is not a partisan move.


It is not setting a precedent, merely following an important one.


And importantly, this is not a subversion of our democracy. It's a protection of it that is perfectly in line with how our system is designed to work.

2. Caffeine if you consume  caffeine you are not natty because caffeine is literally a performance enhancing drug. Back in the day in caffeine was actually banned substance in sports. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468986/

3. Creatine monohydrate if you take  5grams of creatine monohydrate everyday because creatine literally enhanced your performance in the gym.

4. if you take melatonin your or not natty because not only will you not be able to find melatonin pills in nature. Taking melatonin pills will also increase your melatonin levels which is doing something to your body that is not natural.

5. If you take ashwagandha then you are also not natty because Eben though you take a herb that can be found in nature taking it still increases your testosterone which is the exact samething as injection testosterone into your body.

I don't have as strong of opinions on the topic as some do, but I do feel that the Israeli occupation and settlement of Palestine is immoral at best and genocidal at worst. However, rather than debating whether dropping 2000 lb. laser-guided glide bombs onto residential blocks is bad, I want to talk about the reaction to the conflict, specifically the reaction in western countries.

I am an American, and I live in a major American city that has seen some pretty large, pretty consistent pro-Palestinian protests. I also spend a good bit of time on a local college campus for work, and have heard tons of Pro-Palestinian rhetoric in the last few weeks and months. I am pretty much convinced that, while I am sure these people do have genuine empathy for the struggle of Palestinian civilians, most of the loudest and most ardent protestors are merely seizing this opportunity to criticize Western culture. I think there are a number of reasons for this, but the most obvious one is that the Israeli occupation and settlement of Palestine is seen as a continuation of western/European settler colonialism, which obviously ravaged many places across the globe for centuries. Brown people are being displaced by Europeans, and its happening in real time. To many protestors, the fact that white people are killing brown people makes the loss of life and displacement of people worse. To prove this point, I think we only need to look at what has been going on in Syria since 2011.

The Syrian Civil War is, without a doubt, the worst humanitarian crisis of our generation. 13 million people have been displaced, and 6.7 million were forced to flee the country as refugees. As of March 2023, at least 600k people have been killed (and this is the minimum verifiable number, which is almost certainly an undercount). A minimum of 300k of these people were civilians. And yet, there is complete and utter apathy for the plight of the Syrian people. I have never once seen a protest against Bashar al-Assad. I've never seen anyone flying the flag of the Free Syrian Army, nor have I seen college kids pick up signs and march for justice for the people of Syria. I've never heard anyone condemn the Turkish government for their role in the atrocities. Its hardly even covered on the news at all, despite the fact that the war is still raging. Just last week, Turkey bombed a hospital in Kurdistan, Northern Syria. The only reason I know about it is because a buddy of mine works for an NGO in the region. Otherwise, I would have been totally oblivious to it. in 2014, more money was raised for aid to the victims of the typhoon in the Philippines (5k dead) than for the war on Syria. So, why the apathy? Why don't people here care?

Well, because it does not fit into the ongoing cultural battle between Western Chauvinists (and the less passionate folks who just don't want their privileged lives to be disrupted) and progressive anti-westerners who are trying to upend the western status quo. Its brown people and Russians (who *also* hate Western Culture) against other brown people. Its not something that either side here can use as a point in their own personal cultural jihad. Basically, no one can use it to gain political or social capital (read: virtue signaling). And so no one here cares.

For the past week or so, there have been a number of large protests in my city where the protestors have been disrupting Christmas shopping and other Christmas activities, yelling ""Christmas is canceled"" and chastising people for celebrating the holiday while Palestianians are being slaughtered. Now, I am not some white knight that is trying to defend Christmas or Christianity, but I just think thats preeeetty ridiculous. If I am a bad person because I went out to buy my Mom a sweater despite people being buried under a pile of rubble in Gaza, then I am just as bad of a person for going out to buy my mom a sweater when Assad was flattening Aleppo in 2016, or when a military junta seized power in Myanmar in 2021. or when Khartoum, Sudan was seeing mass violence for the last few months. 

So, change my view: Most (but of course not all) don't actually care about Palestinians so much as they care about pushing back on Western society. I'd really like to hear from some people who have been out protesting on why they are more passionate about this atrocity than some of the others."

Something about sitting in public restrooms doesn't sit very well with me. However, in the comfort of your own home or a friend's or a family member's home, sitting while peeing should be the norm.

I bring this up because anytime I mention to my friends that I will sit and pee when I am home, they respond in a matter of shock and confusion. It is often followed by ridicule and jokes, which, obviously I find them funny, however, I never understood why this isn't a normal thing.

My points for sitting and peeing are:
1) it's cleaner 
2) it is more comfortable 
3) it's more efficient 
4) if living with female counterparts, there are less toilet lid movements

edit: thought we could all live a little after debating on Christmas whether or not the N word should be allowed

11,2023-12-26,CMV: The traditional desktop metaphor is superior to these flimsy contemporary and touch-oriented desktop metaphors.,u/Prudent-Reporter-400,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18rgoio/cmv_the_traditional_desktop_metaphor_is_superior/,changemyview,"[https://i.imgur.com/0qYP0j6.png](https://i.imgur.com/0qYP0j6.png)

This is a screenshot of my desktop. I am running Manjaro Linux with the Cinnamon desktop environment. I personally prefer a traditional desktop paradigm with windows, icons, cursors, menus, taskbar-like panels, and consistent UIs across applications and the core desktop. This traditional desktop metaphor was introduced in 1995 with Windows 95, and prototypical versions of this desktop paradigm can be found on the Xerox Alto as early as 1973. What I am saying is that this conventional desktop is the standard for desktop/laptop computing and other desktop environments have been based off this for some time.

&#x200B;

Some time in 2011 the GNOME team, or a collection of free and open source software developers created a radically new version of their GNOME desktop called GNOME Shell 3. This is what it looks like. [https://i.imgur.com/PPMHcFi.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/PPMHcFi.jpg)

Basically, an **Activities** overview center where all of your running applications can be viewed in lieu of using minimize and maximize buttons. This pissed off so many GNOME 2 users in the Linux communities, so much so that at least two community-developed forks or derivatives of GNOME were made to reintroduce a traditional interface into an actively developed software project. GNOME Shell did improve and the GNOME team listened to feedback, but GNOME Shell 45, the current version of the software as of December 2023 still looks a lot like GNOME 3 in April 2011.

&#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/l1VWncw.png](https://i.imgur.com/l1VWncw.png)

Then we have Windows 8, the nightmare that many more computer users had to put up with. Microsoft wanted to rake in on the attention smartphones and tablets were getting by making Windows 8 touch-oriented with its UI. The classic Windows desktop was still accessible, but you had to navigate from the touch-based ""Start Screen"". Also, the start button was removed in Windows 8 in favor of touch gestures. If you had a keyboard and mouse, you basically had to move your mouse just right for the gesture to be registered. Also, the touch UI in Windows 8 was unfamiliar to Windows 7 and Windows Vista users.

&#x200B;

It honestly pissed me off that tech companies are trying their hardest to this day to get rid of the traditional desktop experience and transition us to baby touchscreen UIs are are not nearly as intuitive as a desktop UI. It is also unfamiliar and these touch-based UIs are not as consistent as desktop UIs. It is a fact."

Any comments that attempt to argue this will be ignored for spreading Zionist propaganda.  
Now that that’s out of the way, we see based on the assessment of human rights observers that Israeli forces are committing war crimes in Gaza, probably crimes against humanity and possibly genocide. It’s also possible that even if they aren't committing genocide now, they will if a permanent ceasefire isn't implemented. And yet the US and certain EU countries are shielding them from the consequences of their actions under international law as they have been since the conflict started in 1948. 

As we've seen with this conflict as well as Ukraine and the Uyghur situation, genocide is something of a buzzword that gets people's attention (I'm not denying that the latter two situations could involve genocide by the way). There's a certain moral repugnance attached to it in the West's public consciousness that, say crimes against humanity does not, even though one is not more severe than the other in international law.

I think the average Westerner  would even turn against one of the primary targets of what is considered the gold standard of genocide (the Holocaust) if a competent body found them guilty of committing it against Palestinians in Gaza. Anyone outside the West who is still neutral would probably likewise mount enough pressure on their elected officials to ensure accountability. Western leaders would probably eventually be forced to at the very least not obstruct justice if they wanted any chance at reelection. Without such pressure, Western leaders can and will continue to enable Israel to carry out atrocities with impunity.

They couldn't broadcast that shade of neon green in the 1960s. They would often pick colors they knew would photograph different to get what they actually wanted.

The Grinch was most likely a darker brownish green. That's how most people remember it in the 80s and first DVD release.

At some point during a restoration (and Jim Carrey film), they standardized it based off the old cells.

It's now a neon green color.

The original Halloween (1978) film used filters that gave the look of trees and shrubs a orange look. During a million transfers and restorations, it now looks like summer in California. Which it was.

Do The Right Thing had filters that made it seem like the hottest point in the year. A yellowish hue. Those were removed at some point during restorations.

And Disney... oh boy... The have digitally almost repainted their original films. What was hand-drawn cells have been processed. All wobbles, flickers and paint strokes are removed to achieve a souless perfection.

Also there are generally a type of person who does this such as people who wear skimpy clothes or post half naked pics. Sure that doesn’t mean it’s 100% but it’s probable and it’s something that’s not necessarily rare anymore.

I’ve seen how much my parents have sacrificed just to be in this country. I know how much money my father has paid to get us papers in the United States. I honestly couldn’t even believe he had spent that much money. My dad studied industrial engineering in Nigeria and it didn’t even help him in the United States because most employers see that degree as worthless because he got it in a Nigerian university. He never studied here and so now he has to settle for low wage jobs. My dad works so hard, six days a week and we basically live paycheck to paycheck. It’s tough ngl. I just feel like our lives as a whole would be so much better and stress free if not for the fact that we were born in Nigeria, can see our country falling apart and so now we were forced to make this hard journey here. I was also in Nigeria this summer and the country is rife with so much poverty. This are getting worse every day and the basic amenities I enjoy in the United States are like luxuries over there. While I was in Nigeria, there was a time my electricity went out and we had no electricity for almost an entire day. As a result our water went out and we had to fill up buckets of water at someone else’s house just to be able to wash dishes and flush the toilet. I once spoke to my dad and I asked him “so how does a person in Nigeria live a decent life and fulfill something for themselves” and he told me he doesn’t know. Degrees in Nigeria are almost useless now as there are no jobs whatsoever. 
So in conclusion I feel like being from a third world country is on of the worst things to happen to a person because the struggles of living in one in the first place is stressful,draining and horrible, while the struggles of leaving one is also horrible as you have to endure and sacrifice a lot so either way you will suffer, unless you’re rich I guess."

1. It allows for more content to be viewed online. Most web pages have more blank space on the sides, and it's more valuable to have more vertical on most places on the internet. 

When you're reading an article or navigating a website you're usually scrolling up or down. Your screen is already a long rectangle, why compress it vertically even more?

2. It's more natural to get to your taskbar. All you have to do is flick to the left instead of moving diagonally down. 

3. It's also more natural to look at. Your icons will be at eye level instead of all the way at the bottom of the screen. And it visually looks better.

I am absolutely not denying that 6 million Jews were killed in an attempt of genocide by Nazi Germany. This is not an attempt to revise the Holocaust or deny any part of it. Quite the opposite, actually. I am also not saying in any way that Jews cannot or should not claim victim hood. They were massively victimized and are still today. These are not part of my point at all.

Something that's been bothering me for a while is that the Holocaust has been broadly accepted and talked about as purely a genocide against Jews. Most people I know who I've talked to about WWII or the Holocaust think that there were only (relatively speaking, of course) 6 million Holocaust victims. This is not true. There were 6 million victims who were Jewish. There was another 5-6 million who were not Jewish, but disabled, LGBT, and non Jewish ethnic/racial minorities. Anyone ""degenerate"" or ""inferior"".

You may be wondering why it matters. Here's why it bothers me:
1. Nearly half of the victims of the Holocaust are practically erased by only focusing on the 6 million Jews. It's not right to suggest 6 million is inflated and it's not right to only speak on half of the victims of the Holocaust, in my view.
2. Fascism of all kinds have similar strategies and talking points, but the Nazis and Hitler gained a special level of hatred among the general population, seemingly globally. Only focusing on the anti-Semitic propaganda and tropes causes us to miss propaganda and tropes of other groups from the same source. This is happening in the US towards several minority groups, but the parallels are ignored because we're not educated on ALL of the trash Nazi Germany pumped out and perpetrated.

To change my view, you need to explain why my concerns are moot and/or that the other 5-6 non Jewish deaths are not as ignored as I feel they are.

Also, I'm an American speaking on what I experience in America and online in mostly American communities. I don't know how Holocaust education or discourse is outside of the US.

Edit: I figured this wouldn't take too long. I had assumed that other groups were treated just as bad as Jews were, but that was incorrect. There's also the fact that the Jewish population is the only group victimized that did not significantly recover from the same event. Also, I didn't realize that ""Holocaust"" is literally a term used for the Jewish deaths exclusively and the other murders are considered separately. These things have changed my view. Thanks for everyone's input and everyone who trusted that I was posting in good faith and took the time to educate!"

My SO recently came back from a night out with her friends (ages 30-40), and all of them are recently single after ending relationships of varying degrees of seriousness. The common theme was that each of these men were less desirable in all quantifiable metrics, financial situations, basic life skills, and so on.

I've spent time with all of these women and they're wonderful. They have great careers and varied interests, are attractive, kind, they have their shit together, and so on. None of them have kids or ex husbands, though all of their exes did.

One of them was talking about dating and said her mother suggested that early on when dating a guy, think third date or so, a woman should go through a list of requirements for a long term partner and if he fails these requirements, move on! I said that I actually think that's a reasonable idea and she should do it. If a woman did that to me, and the requirements were like ""you have to have a job and you can't go back to your baby mama every 3 months and you have to tell me you have a baby momma"" I would answer honestly, accept the terms, and ask for a fourth date.

In fact, I believe this is essentially what heterosexual men do in their pursuit of women, they go on dating apps, and even if they don't match strategically, once they are on a date there are certain requirements they have to continue going on dates, these requirements are just... not generally as forward thinking as ""can this man remember we're going to dinner on friday""

So, despite how gross and upsetting online dating can be, and how few in-person spaces there are where a woman would be safe, I think that if a woman finds herself wanting a long term relationship with man who behaves like an adult, is her peer, etc then she should use every avenue possible to find men, sort through them like jobs, and then only continue dating the ones that meet her objective criteria.

I do recognize the physical and psychological danger a shift in dating culture like the one I'm describing, where women pursue men, presents. Though I'm sympathetic to this argument it won't change my view because I believe there are safe ways for women to pursue men.

ETA: I also want to recognize this is deeply unfair, it puts yet another burden on women, making them take on the emotional labor of courtship.

**ETA: To clarify the metaphor, when we look for jobs, which many of us have experience with, we spend dedicated time pursuing something with an objective list of criteria and base our decisions off of the available options. It takes time, incurs mental health issues, and involves plenty of rejection. I AM NOT saying that women should treat men like their employers. If job search is too loaded for you, use whatever type of search you think fits my description.** "

People started saying “Happy Holidays” to avoid saying “Merry Christmas” around the time of Christmas, but there are many religions (including mine) that don’t celebrate a major holiday around late December, and, of course, atheists and agnostics. It’s not inclusion.

Happy New Year is way better because it celebrates a global, secular holiday that includes everyone and occurs not long after Christmas. Christmas has also taken on a secular meaning in the modern era, as anyone who watches Hallmark movies or asked Santa for gifts knows, and Merry Christmas celebrates the secular meaning of Christmas too, and by that mark, is inclusionary.

Happy Hanukkah or Kwanzaa, among the myriad of other holidays in this time, are also great greetings.

Some argue this means there is no objective morality and everything is just the product of social customs/cultures, or even further that it is just arbitrary preferences produced by biological evolution. 

To accept that, you *must* accept that if morality was objective, everyone would agree on what the objective answer is all the time. This is a flawed view because things can be objectivly one way, even when people disagree over it or do not recognize.

People once thought emotions came from the heart (becuase when you are nervous, your heart beats faster) and people today believe they come from our brains. There is an objective answer to that.

231,2023-12-26,cmv: I think we as a society should be doing more to prevent young men from becoming incels,u/Similar_Charity9248,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ro656/cmv_i_think_we_as_a_society_should_be_doing_more/,changemyview,"I’m saying this as someone who pretty much was an incel from ages 16 to 21. I think society is failing young men in many ways that result in the growth of incel like ideologies and why there’s been a mainstream success of red pill influencers in the vein of Andrew Tate and his acolytes. I think there should be a level of empathy extended to incels. I’m a firm believer that just about everyone deserves a chance to change, and in the case of most incels, the worst they did was post some shitty things online

I feel this way because my experience as an incel taught me that what I wanted wasn’t sex. Sex was just a symbol. What I actually wanted and what actually tormented me was that I didn’t feel like the type of person who could have sex.
I didn’t feel important to anyone, I didn’t feel desired, I didn’t feel attractive, I didn’t feel like I would escape how I felt as a loser teenager.

I was never affirmed. I was never told I look handsome except occasionally by my grandmother. I never got any attention from women my own age and as a result, I felt hopeless and ugly. 

I think that this is becoming more of an issue as dating and romantic/sexual interactions and dynamics take new shape. Women have the majority of the power in it now and men weren’t taught to adjust. I grew up thinking id have a normal dating life but as the hands shifted and women’s standards in what they want in a man physically and emotionally became out of my ability it broke me. 

I’m not saying women need to lower their standards. It’s human nature of women to pick from the top and not really acknowledge the scraps. But I do think boys need to be better equipped to deal with things and given the emotional support men haven’t gotten."

In addition, the holiday season is so difficult for so many people who are grieving, have struggled with depression or another mental illness that past year, people who have struggled with financial issues for a multitude of reasons that past year, etc.., the thought of getting to spend the holiday with family could be the ONE thing holding some people together through the holiday season.

One is understanding the benefit of the helpful idiot, and the other is the fear of eternal damnation. My first premise is simply that no one asked to be here.


Past empires and civilizations would have collapsed if they had allowed subclasses of people to control the means of production. Still, it doesn't change anything; those civilizations benefitted and always have through force, intimidation, control, and subjugation. It's in our DNA to exploit and be tribal; it's not in our interests to compromise our values and beliefs for anyone. The measures we’ll take to circumvent the truth until we can bear this reality are attractive. Media tells us that democracy is possible and that we don't live in a world conforming to
Ideals as a way to escape the horrors of the past. 

In my opinion, hope can't be generated from anything; no civilization can continue to thrive without some catastrophic event that takes them out because of their hubris and misjudgment—taking accolades and trophies and crediting oneself without cause based on creed and culture. Most institutions holding up these reigns of honor and dignity return to those ideals. But never in a good way. 

Every inch of freedom we clawed out for in the name of inalienable rights as lawful adherence will be the same pretense for our downfall when the poor and oppressed present us with something you'd only see during the hypothetical idea of rapture. Still, it is there nonetheless to mark out the cresting point of humans in this Judeo-Christian continuum.

I think it's implied that some will chant death to America… but it will be a whisper by then. They give you a choice. If you desire this future, then vote for the appropriate person. If not, then opt out and embrace oblivion. 

Black and Jewish people are the convergence of modern American racial dynamics. It serves as a channel and anecdote to glimpse the truth.

Is the fear based on the historical precedent of Jews having been displaced for generations?

As far as I know,  America is a different beast; no culture or ""ethnic"" group has been pushed out of this country in the entirety of our modern history , but I have to admit I fear antisemitism as well, but is the fear a 1-1 or are we at times refusing to see patterns in the overt examples corruption, fraud, and misconduct, all in an attempt to subvert the truth?  

I'm black, and I didn't ask to be here. Still, I guess the Africans or foreigners during the Roman Empire didn't ask either, yet benefited from aqueducts and other technological advancements. Is what we're selling now with overconsumption worth it? These sneaker deals, album releases, and culture centers are hell-bent on monetary gain over adherence to faith. Any amount of success a minority group attains will aid them if we are self-governed effectively. I was hoping someone could explain to me why there is no legitimate example of a segregated homogenous community with a cohesive shared reality that doesn't have the majority of its success in its history based on traditional/conventional forms of assimilation. 

Most minorities dont control much of the means of production, and constantly, you see African Americans failing at business ventures with poor handling of finances. At least ordinary ones in large populations and culture centers. Yet other minority groups produce an utterly opposite output. It's our only way to appeal to the masses who have shaped culture under their periscope and reality. Everyone adheres to it. 

I think inclusion matters, but shady business dealings are just the easiest things to hone in on, they say. That's another cheap semantic trope, but it's relevant. That's most likely what many of these black artists, intellectuals, and creatives face in their psychological battleground established for their oppressors. But I'd imagine something was lacking in their upbringing that led to this, not some evil Jewish overlord who commits white-collar crime. In the world of information and ideas, someone had to strike gold first, and it's just comically insensitive that these tropes follow us everywhere we go throughout history. When we know precisely what the nexus of this divergence is before the fall of man begins. 

We shouldn't be conditioned, yet it is technically a verifiable reality that stereotypes and prejudice prepare people to act differently based on where they are. If society causes this based on a lack of integration, it's not harmful for us to express this feeling. We tried our best to describe a feeling and common problem most segregated areas of the country experience when cultures and races mix.

I don't see race as the lens to see the world, but you can see here that the issue is that we will never have an actual answer to these problems until the prevailing perception and unconscious bias of these stereotypes are rooted out. That doesn't happen by not talking about it, but you also can't say that talking about it will exacerbate the conflict. It's a catch-22. 

No one is expected to accommodate people based on ethnic and racial disharmony. Yet, it remains a highly relevant topic in every social space for a reason. We did, at one point, have laws and ordinances that created this boundary between integration.

I think it's a bit naive to expect that it's something that isn't still a relevant topic in every household. Still, then again, if it's an exclusively white and black household, you will see those environments, for some odd reason, described as race-neutral. The white ones nor the minority ones have any aspect that includes an integrated framework, thus never opening up new stimuli where I'll tell you for a fact there exists some form of unconscious bias naturally, even if there is no formal test to prove it. We engineered a hegemony that pinned inborn qualities of race and eugenics as a representation of its best specimens. Justified it, called It Holy, and codified it as law. 

We won't get anywhere, is all I'm saying, and Im afraid the way most African Americans view the larger society they live in is growing more vapid by the day. I can confirm that as a black man living in an inner city. The stereotypes follow you like a shadow you never asked for, a mark, and you could even say a curse if you're being dramatic. It's real, and it's also not real, but for me, I realize even still that most people are suffering from much more severe issues. So it's not about me, but the collective, but it's the hardest pill to swallow every day because generations previously told me this was the status quo and that the aversion we felt was natural. De-program this for me and offer me something better."
2,2023-12-27,CMV: Laws that protect people from themselves are necessary,u/JoyIkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18rw1gq/cmv_laws_that_protect_people_from_themselves_are/,changemyview,"Most people cannot be trusted to protect their own interests. Most people are either not educated enough or simply don't care about their own being enough to protect themselves.  
  
Some might ask: so what if they don't care about themselves? They should have the right to go against their own interests, they are not hurting anyone. This, in my opinion, is a strange notion. Freedom for the sake of freedom makes no sense. Throughout history, we have people who fought for their interests, now we have people who fight for the right to go against their own interests. Arguing whether the restrictions benefit people or not is fine but agreeing that something is harmful to people yet still advocating for people's right to do it is very strange.  
  
The law is still the basic standard for human behavior. Legalizing something yet still hoping that people wouldn't do it is idiotic. Every piece of legislation should be based on the assumption that people will make the worst possible choice since that possibility always exists. One cannot make a law and leave things to chance. If people can be trusted to always make the best decision, we wouldn't need laws.  
  
Even if we somehow agree that people should have the right to harm themselves, such right would only apply if people live in isolation with absolutely no connection with one another. However, we live in a society. All actions, when upped to a certain scale will have an impact on society. "

I just watched some videos about people with cancer. How they slowly succumbed to the disease. Many of them died with dignity. Many of them wished they could keep living. It’s a horrible thing to be alive. 

There are a couple ways people have children:
1. A product of rape, coercion, and other horrible acts done against someone’s will.
2. Lack of contraceptives, which results in the inability to prevent pregnancy unless there’s abstinence from sex
3. Unexpected pregnancy with the option to abort
4. Unexpected pregnancy without the option to abort (religious reasons or maybe harm to the mother idk)
5. Conscious effort to produce children without access to proper resources for raising them, or with potential for harm to the child
6. Conscious effort to produce children with access to proper resources for raising them

In my opinion, anyone who does #5 should be thrown in fucking jail. 

1 and 2 are pretty interlinked. I can imagine that’s what’s happening in places like the Gaza Strip. Children born into war zones are products of rape or lack of contraceptives. Anyone who’s in a warzone who voluntarily chooses to have children should be arrested or deserves a special place in hell.

I’m not even going to open the can of worms that #4 is.

So that leaves people who choose to bring children into the world. Which might be many of the people here in this sub. Why do you do it? Why do you decide to bring children into the world despite all the heartbreak, all the sickness, all the suffering, all the tragedy? Before you say that there is beauty in life and that living is a gift, I’d really like for you to take a minute and consider that statistically speaking, unless you are rich and pampered and have access to the best healthcare and preventative treatments in the world, you will live a life with its ups and downs which ultimately culminates in death, which is not a quick event. Death for most people is not in their sleep. It’s slow and painful. It’s in a nursing home or hospital bed. Reminiscing when one could run and be youthful while they slowly die in a cold hospital.

What exactly about being in this world is a gift? I seriously don’t understand. I can’t reconcile with it. I was born luckier than most and have a roof over my head but I don’t think this should be something used against me to call me an ungrateful fuck. Suffering is relative, and before you ask me to compare myself to people less fortunate than me, think about your own suffering. Think about how it makes you feel. At the end of the day, every single one of us has experienced profound sadness. Breakups, deaths, illness, losing something, etc. Happiness is so fleeting. So many people are miserable. 

We have children because we are lonely and seek purpose. We think having a “mini-me” suddenly brings purpose to the 9-5 grind we endure. Over and over and over again. Then why is it that we restart the cycle with more children who have to work the same as us? 

I think religion plays a HUGE role in the decision to have children, as a lot of secular or non religious people abstain from procreation. At the end of the day, it makes my point futile. I cannot literally win an argument against someone who believes that their bloodline is blessed to be protected by God. If the responses have God in them then consider my views obsolete. 

I would love to hear what non religious people who have children have to say."

With all these limits in place though, people are still allowed to say extremely stupid things on the internet. I personally think we should start outlawing it.

What pushed me over the edge is I just had an argument with someone that believed PCs didn’t have wireless internet connection. He believed they only had Ethernet (and didn’t know the word for Ethernet), and would ask me if I’ve ever used a “real PC,” suggesting a real PC only had wired connection(???).

So I’m going to propose this view. I don’t care that low value men can’t date and I don’t care that only high value men can get laid.

In nature when it comes time for breeding season, males compete. The male bird with the prettiest colors has the best chance. He has the best genes to pass on. The buck reindeer that has small antlers or a blue nose isn’t going to be able to reproduce. His genes aren’t good enough to pass on. At the end of the day humans are animals. We aren’t only guided by instinct, but it is present. For women our instincts mean that we won’t be attracted to lesser men. Men that are ugly, fat, short etc. They’re not the type of men we see and want to bang. Sorry.

Luckily for men, they still aren’t out of the count like animals are. They can do some things to make themselves attractive to low value women. The issue is low value men only want bombshell beauties despite themselves being mid at best. Most of you are ugly on the inside as well so you can’t even nail a woman in your league. 

As a result they moan and groan about how unfair it is that they can’t land Emily Ratakowski when it’s actually completely fair for hot women to desire hot guys for relationships. I also think it’s completely fair for mid women to desire hot guys for hookups since that’s obtainable. Hell if Emily Ratakowski told any incel freak they wanted to bang him he’d nut in his pants.

This is nature weeding out the lesser men. In the past, men created a system that made it so that most women needed to be partnered to survive, so women. That way men could get all the pussy and benefits of having a wife they wanted while being lesser men. Now women don’t have to do that. Now we are free to pursue hot men. We are free to decide we’d rather be single than settle for a low value man. And the world is better that way. And there’s no need for sympathy for men who are just born lesser. 😊"
1,2023-12-27,CMV: Wars Are Pointless,u/Schmurby,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ryjbd/cmv_wars_are_pointless/,changemyview,"I think wars are stupid and nearly 100% of the time they are an avoidable tragedy.

Before I get into the details, I want to say that I have always been fascinated by war, I was born in Soviet Ukraine in 1980, I grew up surrounded by the glorious memory of victory over fascism and I have nothing but respect for soldiers, all soldiers who do not commit atrocities, really. There is something amazing about their courage and sacrifice that rightly commands reverence. But ultimately, I am sorry to say, their bravery is just a tool of cynical politicians and would be better spent resisting recruitment into the armed forces than in murdering strangers that they have no quarrel with. Fighting “for your country” is illogical. That is my thesis.

So, you can already see the elephant in the room, right? Isn’t war necessary if you are fighting against an evil group like the ***NAZIS***!?

Well, it just so happens that the reason that I am writing this is because I am currently on an extended assignment in Germany for my work. And it is a wonderful country. I think it might be the most pleasant place I’ve ever been to. One can almost forget what horrific deeds the citizens of this country perpetrated upon the world when living here.

So, imagine my surprise when one of my coworkers informed me that her grandfather was captured by the Red Army just outside the town I was born in in 1943. This person, who I have worked on projects with and shared train rides with and lifted glasses of delicious German wine with, is just one generation removed from the genocidal murderers who invaded the country of my birth.

And I got to thinking that probably her grandfather was not such a bad dude. Probably he didn’t really think about it too much. He just did what he was told and he might have believed in some of the Nazi propaganda which must have been unavoidable when he was young. And then I felt kinda bad for all the German soldiers who were killed or imprisoned in camps or who lost their arms, legs, eyes, penises, fighting for their country, for their people, for their freedom. They weren’t any less brave than their Soviet, British and American foes, but no one remembers them as heroes. Pointing out their courage is not a good idea.

And it was all for naught, wasn’t it? Because at the end of the day, they lost but Germany still turned out fine. They were not enslaved by an international cabal of Jewish beasts or whatever crap they believed in. That makes it so sad.

So, World War II would not have happened if it was not for those poor men like my colleague’s grandfather who fought “for Germany”, right? The war was 100% avoidable. And so was World War I that came before it and that caused it. About 9 million people died for what? For France? For Germany? For Italy? For Britain? Have a look at the massive cemeteries of the Somme or of Verdun and ask yourself if there was any discernable purpose for those unnatural deaths?  They gave literally everything that a person can give so that another even more destructive war could be fought just two decades later with many of the same leaders.

But the world wars are just a small part of the story.  For another illustration of the pointlessness and idiocy of war that is closer to home for most Americans, look at the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, DC. Here we have the names of roughly 60,000 young Americans who gave their lives to stop the spread of communism. And we are right to revere them.

But I am sorry to say that they died for nothing. Communism did take Vietnam but it stopped there. The proverbial “dominoes” did not fall. Not only that, the “Communist” regime of Vietnam is currently friendly to the United States of America. Open your drawers and I’ll bet you have some clothing that was manufactured there. Go to any college campus in Europe or the U.S. and I’ll bet you’ll find some young folks who had a wonderful backpacking holiday there. It turned out that the bad guys weren’t so bad after all, didn’t it? We can do business with them!

But just imagine how the Vietnamese must feel! They thought they were fighting to create a classless society, to end colonial domination. Turns out that the dollar was a little stronger than any bomb or any punji trap in the swaps of the Mekong Delta, didn’t it?

So, circling back to what I wrote at the beginning, you may have noticed that I said that I was born in Ukraine. And if you have read this far, you may be wondering how I feel about that conflict. Well, I certainly oppose the Russian aggression and I support the Ukrainian soldiers who are fighting to defend their homes and their families. But I really worry about the end of this war and I urge them to watch carefully the actions of their politicians.

This war is almost certainly going to end in some kind of compromise. Russia obviously is not going to get all of Ukraine but it is also extremely unlikely that Ukraine is going to get back most of Donbas or any of Crimea.

I would like to end by addressing the Russians and Ukrainians (who are essentially as similar as Americans are to Canadians, if not more so), that are sitting and freezing in trenches right now think about that. Is a negotiated settlement brokered by the United States and China worth your life? Is it worth your arms, your legs, your eyes, your penis? Will a little piece of shiny metal make you feel better about that loss? Wouldn’t it be easier to do an Orthodox Christmas truce this coming January 6 and celebrate together as the brothers you are out in No Man’s Land? This time make it last. [Don’t make the mistake that the British and Germans did in 1914. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_truce) Don’t let the war mongers keep this up.

Change my view. Happy Holidays. And Peace on Earth.

  
Edit - Yes, I concede there is a ""point"" to war in that there is an outcome that is more beneficial to one side.  But the vast majority of soldiers would be better off not participating.  "

Russia is not a rational nation anymore. We should have seen this a long time ago, however we dug our heads in the sand instead of using the 2014-2022 period to gear for war. Now Russia has shown its true colours so clearly, that not even the most heniously weak and pathetic western leaders can ignore it, and yet still there is a truth here that is too uncomfortable for the west to face yet: we are still underestimating how evil the Russian neo fascist empire is and ALSO how strong its war machine is. Many in the west still think that Russia will never go past Ukraine, and would never attack a NATO nation. But that is simply wrong. In the every day Russians mindset, they are already at war with Europe and the west. Russia has used hybrid warfare tactics to divide the west for decades now.
Here are some of the Russians greatest accomplishments:

-Brexit

-Trumps election in 2016, and possibly 2024.

- Right wing nationalism rising in Europe

-Anti-western sentiment not just outside of the west but also inside it

-Rampant pascifism

-EU sceptisism


With Trumps election being inevitable in 2024, he will not hesitate to leave nato and abandon Europe. After that Things will get spicy.


Russia is simply using its ""interwar"" period effectively, so it can divide the west and pick it off piece by piece. Assuming Ukraine loses the war in 1 year from now, we can expect shenanigans in the baltics around 2026.
The western response will be divided and unorganized, leaving Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to their fate. You may now be thinking ""Wait but arent those nato nations"" and yes they are, but its not like that means something. Nato WAS a deterrent. It is no longer effective. The only true deterrent in the universe is a nuclear weapon. Not only is Nato not effective its also not even really an alliance. Firstly, many people have a very poor understanding of the Article 5 in NATO. Article 5 simply states ""An attack against one is an attack against all"". It does not obligate any nato nation to do anything. The only thing article 5 brings to the table is a false sense of security for Europe and apathy for the Usa. Secondly there is an another reason why article 5 wont work. 
For the past 2 years, many Americans and western Europeans have repeated the phrase ""would you be willing to die for Estonia?"", and that is a ridiculous question because fuck yes i would be ready. Because the implications of not helping a nato nation in need are massive. Firstly, Nato would be useless. And secondly we would have repeated the mistakes made by the French and the British before ww2. We would have given up nations with capable defenses to the Russians even if we had obligations to defend them. The tactics the Russians are using to test the west are very much similar to the tactics Hitler used to test how far the west was willing to go in appeasment. And the answer was the lenght of Austria, slovenia, And chechslovakia. Both Austria and Chechslovakia Had guarantees from either the west, the soviet union or both to preserve their independence and yet, those guarantees were not upheld. And what many overlook in the west these days is that our mindset is not very different from the mindsets of people like neville chamberlain. And what even fewer know is that the French and British populous had the same saying back then as we have now, just in a different form

""Why die for Danzig?""

Having tested article 5 Russia will have a free hand in Europe. With the Usa out of NATO, the alliance will be totally Useless. Around 2027, the Russians will attack Finland. While the Finns spill their blood, the western European nations and their peoples will finally wake up and start militarizing, but it will be far too little far too late. The Finns, alongside the Poles will be the last ones that will be able to resist the Russian offensive for any meaningful time. But a nation of 5 million can only do so much, eventually Finland is overrun, maybe around 2030. Poland does not meet a similar fate however, they could hold the line for a very long time. Assuming that poland does eventually fall around 2035. The Russians will rape and ravage their way through an unprepared western Europe. 

And to the Americans reading this, do not think you are safe. The mindset that Trump supporters have now is the exact one that Americans had before both of the world wars.
""Why go fight in Europe, why would it concern us."" And the answer is that for as long as Europe held, it didnt. But whenever Europe couldnt hold, it did.

The first world war is a bit unique here. It is not like what happened in ww2 with pearl harbour. The zimmerman telegram (basically the German empire asking Mexico to invade the Usa) is undeniable proof that large European conflicts will eventually find its way to the Usa. In the second world war, Japan bombed pearl harbour, but what does this have to do with Europe. Well, does it not sound familiar? A fascist nazi dictatorship invading Europe, a far eastern equally powerful ally. My point is that Americans shouldnt think that war in Europe wont affect them. Because it absolutely will.

.

But it does not have to be this way. The timeline of events i described are possible, and that is why its so important to prepare for them. But they are not inevitable. Currently, Russia is still held up in Ukraine. If the west is able to support Ukraine long enough and bleed Russia out to the point of no return, then a large scale war in Europe can be prevented.
It all relies on what we do now. 

Also just to shut up any ""BUT EUROPE WOULD EASILY BEAT RUSSIA"" peeps,  i dont exactly view the kremlin favourably but we have to look at the facts and not just dig our heads in the sand. Russias economy is fine. Russia is mostly stable, a collapse wont happen in the next 3 decades if something extraordinary doesnt happen. 

I visited Russia a few months ago and the grocery stores were filled with food, and it was cheaper than where i live. Life was going on there as normal. Theres zero signs of instability or weakness. 

 .

And i hate the rhetoric that were ready for war and would beat Russia. No absolutely not. Before Ukraine was invaded, they had been fighting a war against Russia for 10 years already. They were effectively prepared, and had hundreds of thousands of veterans from Dombass. We in the west have become so docile, that all of us put together (excluding the Americans) would probably put up as much of a fight as Ukraine has so far. The fact is that Russia and Ukraine had both been preparing for war. Ukraine has a large population, western support and a bunch of nationalistic fairly young veteran fighters, who are willing to risk their lives for their country. Russia has all (except western support obv) that but just more of it.
We dont seem to understand that this is how war works. War isnt fast. War isnt a quick ""steamroll to moscow"" or to Kyiv. War is complicated and miserable. The whole ""3 days to Kyiv"" was obviously a propaganda campaign started by the Russians. They never actually believed that. They knew that they were in for the long haul. But we in the west stupidly believed that we had won before Ukraine had even started its offensive"

Hi, I recently saw a lot of posts criticising anti homeless architecture.
I don't understand it. Nobody want random people to sleep on their benches. Everybody want clean parks and the possibility to walk under bridges without fear. Why critics? I believe it is step to the right direction.
Is it just my view as young studen who still thinks, that in countries with working social system is homelessness more choice and laziness than anything else? And is there overall different view on homeless people in the US? I think that in EU many share my opinion, that when I support poor people through charity and astronomical taxes, I don't feel any need to support them with anything else."
1,2023-12-27,CMV: All currently employed moral systems boil down to ends justify the means; making morality an assembly line which justifies and encourages the extermination of some demographic.,u/lanky-larry,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18s0oni/cmv_all_currently_employed_moral_systems_boil/,changemyview,"All systems of morality function by evaluating  people’s actions. A person’s actions are naturally limited by the proficiency of their body and mind. When actions are evaluated their end result are always used. In accordance with statements it is possible that a person can decide to perform an action that is considered moral by the system: and then fail in its execution due to some incompetence. Therefore making the person’s action immoral. This possibility’s existence demonstrates that people are willing to designate someone immoral even though they made the choice and effort to be moral. 
Furthermore it is entirely possible that some can be born incapable or deficient in some manner, to the extent that they are inherently incapable of performing the actions deemed moral by the system. Therefore because of this inherent immorality the system encourages and justifies the extermination of said incapable demographic, usually phrasing it as some mercy. This mercy is well demonstrated by a Warhammer quote “let not the heretic suffer to live.” This mentality is propagated to some degree by all moral systems but is amplified by religious systems that claim absolute authority. 

To wrap this up, the evaluation of actions through their results allows for people to choose to be moral and still be deemed immoral. It also encourages the extermination of demographics which are inherently incapable of achieving the requirements of the moral system. This means that all moral systems without the numerous contradictions and coping mechanisms layered on top, justify Fascist ideology. To change my mind I would recommend providing a moral system which does not fall in to the pit holes I have outlined."

Most of the time these people will be wonderful and shining women, but it need not be the case that only women can have wonderful feminine qualities. By feminine qualities I’m not talking about being weak, passive, submissive or something like that. No, I mean the most wonderful qualities such as exuding blissful vibes, caring about everyone in a room, and laughing loudly like a child. 

I feel most people, also women, have become so logical, dry and boring to be with. After taking an education and working for some time in a corporate job most people look like they have lost all the juice of life. I can see from my experience with school and the corporate world that largely it is only the masculine qualities that are valued and appreciated. All this schooling and logical thinking was putting me to sleep and choking the more lively feminine qualities like creativity, speaking from the heart, and just going with the flow of life without overthinking every little detail. 

This quote by Sadh-guru says just what I’m talking about: “For life to happen in an exuberant manner, the feminine has to live in everyone’s hearts and minds.” What is the point if we cannot live in a loving, joyful and exuberant way? Instead we are messing ourselves up with all this logical thinking, analysing everything to bits…. Feminine qualities should be in everyone. Not just women. I’m sure that’s how it was intended to be.

Now I’m more of the opinion that the united states has done its job to grant women equal access to political, social, and economic power. Thus, I am no longer a feminist since I don’t necessarily align with being an active advocate for women’s rights though I can accept that women can and should be advocates for their own rights.

But I am a skeptic and like to update my views. I see all the time on reddit women claim that the united states is a patriarchy but it’s actually pretty confusing to me since women effectively have equal opportunity, are outperforming men (young women vs young men), and have tons of representation (though not 50-50) in government. 

I don’t exactly see how the united states is still a society where women are effectively excluded from accruing economic, political or social power. I will admit that socially some women will say that being a woman has its downsides and I don’t disagree with that. But I don’t see how having differential treatment in certain scenarios implies the US is a patriarchy. I also believe as a society we do a lot to address the fact that women have biological differences that make them physically and economically vulnerable (sidenote: I think many of the women’s issues people claim exist in the united states stem directly from the biological reality of pregnancy and being physically smaller than men; we can’t really **solve** this but we do a good job of having customs and norms that try to **minimize the downsides** of this reality)

I am asking a genuine question. Looking to see if I need to revise my opinion and jump back into the feminist camp or not especially since the last few years have completely pushed me away from it."
0,2023-12-27,CMV: Modern European Islamophobia is too similar to pre-1945 antisemitism for comfort,u/GoSouthCourt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18s20nw/cmv_modern_european_islamophobia_is_too_similar/,changemyview,"As I'm researching antisemitism in Europe pre-1945, I came to notice a lot of similar strands of bigotry between Modern Islamophobia in Europe and European antisemitism at the time. 

* **Otherness**: Europeans Jews were considered non-Europeans even though they have lived in Europe for hundreds of years, today you'd see many people calling European Muslims non-Europeans too despite them holding European citizenship, either by birth or by naturalisation. 

* **Religious differences**: So many Europeans are hateful towards certain Islamic practices for no reason other than they are Islamic, like Halal food, wearing hijab, etc. That's not too dissimilar to the distaste Christians had towards Jews before 1945.

* **Racism**: While scientific racism is no longer a thing today, many White Europeans still host racist opinions about Arabs, Turks and South Asian by virtue of their association with Islam, even if a subset of these people are non-Muslims.

* **Conspiracy theories**: Conspiracy theories involving Muslims are rampant in far-right circles in Europe, like [Eurabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurabia_conspiracy_theory) and the [Great Replacement Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Replacement). They are often compared to antisemitic conspiracy theories like [The Protocols of the Elders of Zion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion).

* **Unjustified political association** : Jews were often blamed for a range of political events, like communism, fascism, even, shockingly, Nazism. They often lead to unjustified violence against Jews. Somewhat similarly, Muslims are often blamed for Islamic extremism, even though Muslims have shown time and time again that, as a group, they denounce violence and terror. In fact, many more Muslims died fighting and opposing Islamic extremism than non-Muslims.

I think that Islamophobia has yet to gain significant traction in mainstream European politics the way antisemitism, but PVV's victory in Netherlands marks a very concerning step. Their leader built a platform on Islamophobia, advocating for a ban of new mosques being built, comparing Koran to Mein Kampf, calling Mohammed ""the devil"", spouting conspiracy theories like Eurabia, etc. 

This should be a concern for all who find pre-1945 antisemitism disgusting and revolting."

Whatever happened during the holocaust at this point is relatively unfelt by the Jewish community. They are a powerful affluent group of people and then as far as Israel they went on to essentially purchase an entire country (from the British and not even the people who actually live there). Not saying that their current actions justify the holocaust I’m more just saying that their people haven’t been struggling ever since. There wasn’t a Jim Crow after the holocaust. What’s really interesting is that the holocaust was inspired by Jim Crow. Hitler looked at America and said “I wanna do that.” Black Americans were the original holocaust.

Edit: because people continue to argue semantics I want to clarify. I’m specifically talking about AMERICAN SLAVERY & THE JEWISH HOLOCAUST.

Each person has a sort of ""baseline"" of happiness which persists through their entire life, regardless of how that life changes with time. Changes in circumstances may temporarily affect their happiness, but over time, they tend to return to their baseline level. You are born with a set balance of various hormones, such as serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin, and no matter what happens to you, the changes are not permanent or sustainable - without ongoing artificial manipulation of above hormone levels (e.g. with antidepressants), after a while, you generally return to these set levels, and thus your baseline level of happiness."

1. We are exposed to radiation from natural sources with much smaller wavelengths, and thus with more energy.examples: the ionizing radiation from the Sun that gets through the atmosphere, from elements in the Earth such as Radon
2. Microwaves and radio waves have less energy than even visible light, so if 5G causes cancer, LOOKING at stuff as sure as hell should
3. I'm not saying (edit: consumer) tech doesn't have any negative effects, I've experienced it firsthand, but these are headaches .... because I was coding and forgot to turn the lights in the room. Many of the symptoms people say is caused by wireless networks is caused by something else entirely.
4. The reason ionizing radiation is dangerous is because it , well , ionizes atoms by knocking electrons out of the electrons shells. If 2 atoms in a molecule, for example, a DNA molecule, gain the same charge, then they will 'rip' the atoms apart. That causes a mutation, and enough mutations, you get a cancer cell. So maybe, electronics MIGHT (not likely) cause adverse health effects, but I'm convinced that cancer is not among those.

1,2023-12-27,CMV: self-love is toxic.,u/Traditional-Carpet51,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18s40fr/cmv_selflove_is_toxic/,changemyview,"Please read till the end and judge my ideas collectively, not separately. And keep in mind the specific interpretations of the terms I'm using to help clarify my point.

I've always wondered why people tell me I should love myself, what if I just can't? Why is it a necessity? If self-love is a *feeling*, how can I possibly force it? What if I'm just simply unlovable? or am an evil person?.

Now I understand the point of self-acceptance and self-worth, and I agree that on average, people's lives shouldn't vary in worth. But depending on what we mean by ""worth"" there can be exceptions, right? Do we consider emotionless criminals' lives to be of the same worth as innocent people? If we define worth as ""how much u deserve the costs of ur existence"", then even if deep down, we find criminals worthless, don't we? 

Logically, criminality and evilness have to be on spectrums, just like almost everything is. So the more evil u are, the less worth u have (by the definition mentioned), right? If u wouldn't encourage a criminal (as an extreme sample) to accept themselves the way they are, why would u find it logical to encourage *everyone* to accept and/or love themselves *equally*? People fall on *spectrums*, even morally (no need to mention how difficult morals are to standardize).

Maybe I don't get the real definitions/purposes of those terms/concepts? If so, please let me know.

I also find the body-positivity movement very toxic on a *similar* basis. I mean objective beauty is indeed hard to pin down, but bodies aren't meant to be beautiful, at least not solely. I mean high body-fat percentage and obesity are generally unhealthy, no matter how much people argue on the evidence, we can't deny at least the *susceptibility* these people have to many health complications. Which brings us back to the **spectrum** standard, not all bodies should stay the same, there will always be room for improvement health-wise.

But that's not the only issue with body-positivity, when it comes to accepting ur body-*shape* regardless of health, I think it's not even serving the original purpose it was established for. I don't think that finding urself physically appealing is a good idea for 2 reasons:

1) it's probably gonna induce an internal conflict, in which u try to force the idea that you're somehow inherently ""beautiful"" in ur head, but at the same u still have insecurities and imperfections that u simply can't embrace completely, u realize that a majority of people would find it unattractive. this will probably lead to exhaustion and a disabling sense of responsibility that u *must* believe you're ""beautiful"", yet you're constantly failing, and the cycle goes on.

2) I think calling someone ""beautiful"" based on their *physical characteristics* (not clothes/style/makeup or so) is nearly the same as calling them ugly or bullying them for their physical imperfections. It's in the sense that if we're against bullying people for their **looks** because of the fact that in the long term, it reduces people's sense-of-self to their looks (specifically their imperfections), then what's the difference when we reduce someone to their looks in a seemingly ""good way"" (to their *attractive* features)? What's the difference between calling someone ugly or pretty/handsome if in the long run, they all lead to toxic and distorted self-image perceptions? If we wanna stop the bullying, then we should stop the complements as well.


Why aren't we aiming for *neutrality* instead? I believe being mostly neutral about urself, inside out, in the sense that you're *realistic* about ur virtues as well as ur flaws, and don't tie any ""emotion"" (like love, admiration, etc) or emotional judgments (like beautiful, pretty, perfect, etc) on urself or ur body, and realize you're not necessarily *meant* to have such labels or attitudes towards ur identity in the first place. To just be objective, not ""personalize"" everything and not take urself too seriously.

What could be better than simply *not giving a fuck* no matter what u look like, or what personality traits and quirks u have? Maybe you're indeed ugly, and ur ugliness will impact ur entire life negatively and many opportunities will likely slip away from ur hands because of it, and maybe you're indeed unlikable and have a very weird personality that's not very captivating, so what? As long as you're morally-aware and work on improving urself constantly, all u can do is find a way to cope and compensate, no need to insist that you're actually beautiful/attractive or so, whether from the inside or the outside. 


Ur thoughts? Is there something I've missed? Excuse me for any mistakes or miscommunication, English isn't my first language.


Edit: the title I chose seems to be inaccurate, although I do believe self-love *can* be toxic, I noticed that it's rather *irrational* to me. But I can't change the title rn.
Also it's very difficult to discuss this topic when people's definitions vary, but nothing changes when u change the definition of the *term* (self-love/body positivity) when I'm only disagreeing with the *logic*. Please put that into consideration before commenting."

Our leaders should be the best of us, not just the lesser of two shitheads

This is a large part of the reason why i loved Obama despite not being a democrat. He was the perfect leader. Physically and mentally strong, brilliant and charismatic to a fault. He was a damn near perfect human being, regardless of his policies. 

When other nations look at our president they should expect them to reflect us. We should only have the best of the best, the creme de la crop of our society run for office. 

The smartest, most cunning, strongest, charismatic, youthful. The best of us, not the worst.

Edit: 

I’ll concede on the following:

- Upper age limit should be 65, not 50

- I don’t know how to measure how smart someone is. I know IQ tests suck. I will have to delta you if you make me try to actually implement this as opposed to dream it. I will still hold thag only smart people should be allowed to run

- Physically fit is about the least important thing on this list. They don’t need abs. I just don’t want another morbidly obese president like trump to be allowed to run 

I want also clarify that i’m not excluding anyone from *voting*. Everyone should have a voice

Edit 2:

I’ve had about 30 people come in with “policies are what matters”

No shit guys. I’m laying down ground rules for who is *allowed to run*. You cant restrict who is allowed to run based on policies, that eliminates the point of voting"
1,2023-12-27,"CMV: The song ""Last Christmas"" is NOT a Christmas song.",u/BrasilianEngineer,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18s62fy/cmv_the_song_last_christmas_is_not_a_christmas/,changemyview,"Merry Third Day of Christmas! (Three French Hens Day?)



My generalized opinion is that you can't just throw in a passing reference to 'Christmas' into a song (or movie, etc) and call it a 'Christmas' song (etc). The 'Christmas' reference needs to somehow actually relate to the meaning/message of the song for it to qualify. Otherwise it just happens to be on Christmas - basically a coincidence.

A simple test is to change the reference to another date (say 'Easter' or 'Halloween' or even 'New Years Day'). If it was a 'Christmas' song, changing the date should somehow change the meaning of the song.

""Last Christmas"" fails the test because changing the words to: ""Last New Year I gave you my heart"" or ""Last Easter I gave you my heart"" makes zero difference to the meaning of the song, and the change also works with verse 2. It's a romance (anti-romance?) song, not a Christmas song.

CMV

--------------------------------------------

Here are the lyrics:
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

Happy Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying ""I love you"", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover, but you tore me apart
Oh, oh now I've found a real love
You'll never fool me again"

1,2023-12-27,CMV: Physical Controlled Caning should be instituted as a punishment for petty crime in the US,u/weaksidewilliam,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18s78x2/cmv_physical_controlled_caning_should_be/,changemyview,"my view is that for petty crimes (shoplifting, minor assault, petty theft, littering, drug use, etc) should be punishable with caning - physically beating the perpetrator with a stick between 3 - 24 strokes. 

My reasoning consists of the following: i feel that in the united states, punishment of minor crime has resulted in a conundrum.

1. Jail/Prison is too expensive to the US Taxpayer for petty crimes
2. Jail/Prison may be overboard as punishment as going to prison could result in adverse economic effects for the criminal that would give them no economic recourse except to participate in more crime to make ends meet
3. as a result, many law enforcement departments have chosen to not pursue arrests/punishments or have risen the threshold for what is considered a crime. for example, California raising the felony shoplifting amount to $950 and below being a misdemeanor. 
4. [Overcrowding of Prisons is actually considered as a factor when administrating punishment](https://jaapl.org/content/40/4/547) (jail time). this results in offenders not receiving any punishment even when deserved.

the goal of my solution is to propose a punishment/deterrent against petty crime that would not 1. have long term adverse impacts on the criminal 2. would not affect their long term economic prospects but still act as a meaningful disincentive to commit future crime.

I think physical beating with a cane (administered by a machine to control and regulate for force) fits these criteria.

I am not interested in debating whether or not caning would violate the 8th amendment for cruel and unusual punishments.

I would be open to CMV debating the merits of implementing caning as a solution to deterring petty crime or an alternative solution to adequately punishing petty crime that fits my criteria.

The Italian Prime Minister, Meloni, has also said similar things like Great Replacement Theory or Eurafrica. This kind of rhetoric is commonplace across Europe and it's deeply dangerous and concerning. Some may say that it's not Islamophobic to point out the threat to women's and LGBT rights, to which I will say the far-right has no interest in protecting these rights as well. Meloni is a homophobe herself and Wilders has made numerous homophobic and queerphobic things himself. It's clear that the far-right is only advocating for anti-Islam policies because of bigotry against Muslims, not because Muslims are threatening existing civil liberties.

Some may say it's necessary to protect Europe from immigration, to which I say these policies are no longer targeting migrants but existing Muslims in Europe, who have lived there for decades and are just as European as Christians and atheists are."

I think it has a few advantages:
1. Voters cannot strategically vote. Not voting your preference only harms your preference.
2. It encourages representatives to care about large groups of people instead of a few key swing locations.

After pondering on that for a while, i came to this conclusion (title)

And it doesn‘t help that i constantly read about relationship issues where a fight with a partner leads a person  to self harm again because it brings up past issues

Like…it sounds unbelievably cruel to say this bc i do believe in theory everyone deserves to be loved and ideally everyone should be regardless of issues

But in the real world, people, even partners, won‘t always be there to help you nor be the right person to help you and in fact being with them can cause you further harm

I believe if you have severe issues, then you should work on dealing with this. Now some say, they deal with this by finding love bc love heals. But if your healing is dependent on another person wanting to be with you, thats problematic no? And remember im not taking about family/friend love, i mean the romantic/sexual kind

Its why i have never dated and probably won‘t in a long while, because i can‘t force my issues onto others nor react horribly  to something because i have these issues, that wouldn‘t be fair to the partner

Now ofc exceptions exist for every argument, so if you did find love and it helped you, thats awesome, but in general I advise people stay away from dating until they are at least semi healed. Ofc that looks different for everyone, you will ultimately have to make this judgement yourself but i see and hear about so many having traumatic pasts, clearly no having dealt with them, then jump into the dating pool

And Ofc you won‘t ever be free of all mental health problems, im talking Bout the severe kinds

Im ofc open to changing my mind, but this is what i have so far. Please remember im a young adult, i dont know everything so this is just based on my POV and experiences"

There are six land masses that meet this description. North America, South America, (you could argue that the Americas are contiguous but as of the completion of the Panama Canal they are not connected by land) Asia, Africa, Australia, and Antarctica. 

Europe is clearly a large peninsula attached to Asia. It is not in any way a continent unless you deliberately make a definition of continent which allows you to arbitrarily designate a landmass as a continent.

Why do we consider Europe a distinct continent? Because Europeans spent centuries convinced that they were racially superior to Asians. They didn’t want to be a part of Asia so they arbitrarily separated Europe from Asia on their maps and the idea stuck around.

The rebuttals I can see are these:

“Europe is a continent because it’s culturally distinct”. There are many places in Asia that are culturally distinct, and they aren’t considered continents.

“Europe is a continent because the Ural Mountains separate it from Asia”. First off, no they don’t completely separate Europe from Asia and secondly there are many places which are isolated by mountains but aren’t considered continents.

“Europe is a continent because the Greeks said so”. The Greeks said a lot of wrong things."

DIT is the (aspects of it) conspiracy theory that ""the internet now consists mainly of bot activity and automatically generated content that is manipulated by algorithmic curation, marginalizing organic human activity."" 

The motivations of creating a ""dead internet"" range from mainstreaming ideologies to promoting corporate products. The most  simplistic example used is how YouTube Algorithms prioritize and push advertiser friendly content and punish that which is not. Resulting in YouTube, while theoretically having  infinate types of videos, has become homogeneous. As the algorithms ultimately make sure only a particular type of video becomes popular. However the ideological version of this was hard to prove due to the debate around what is extremist or unwanted content. That was until the war in Gaza 

For various reasons ( not going yo be discussed here) the conflict is one that has a wide range of opinions. Ranging from those legally recognised under international and domestic laws  to just commonly accepted to be bad.  It is conflict that requires nuance in its discussion and thus breaks the algorithmic system. 

Because simply put the Isreali/Palestinian conflict can not be discussed in a dead internet 

Unlike Ukraine that could be easily  framed as ""good Vs evil"" or Sudan ( add Congo and Myanmar to this)  that could be suppressed. The conflict gets attention but can't be sorted as good and bad easily. It requires a case by case basis, daily. Thus the bots and approved content spiralled out into chaos. Both in the real world and online. I suggest if you want to see what I mean go to any news subreddit and filter by top for the year; then sort by controversial. Ukraine stories that easily filled the narrative of ""Good Vs Evil"" are usually in the top. While those that show the complexity of the situation in Gaza are always i controversial. But it's not about the upvotes but the comments. The engagement is low. But those that frame either side as good or bad get high engagement 

On Twitter (X) this has also broken OSINT and combat footage channels. With some 100% switching to focus on a narrative ignoring reality but facing backlash from the algorithms. Or simply just stop posting. As the conflict also ""poisons"" the very concept of war as content. YouTube has simply begun to censor all content related to it. Regardless of the public intrest. It wants to separate YouTube from reality 

There are more specific examples but avoiding them as even this post will get removed per-DIT"

Being blind is ALWAYS is a struggle. We can’t drive cars! We can't read menus or signs alone. I admit that glasses, brail, and neurotech has helped us a lot, but it will NEVER get good enough to acclimate the blind to normal society. (At least not in my lifetime). 

Deaf people can  drive and read. Us blind people can do neither (unless brail is provided, which it almost never is).  

I would prefer to to have NO disability, but the more I think about it the more I find that being deaf is far better than being blind.

They aren't so just calm the hell down.

Here way.

 If a store is mainly self checkout, employees are just trained to work in a nother department like grocery or online pickup. Not to mention people are still needed to watch the self checkouts. 

If a store still has registers and there's no one working, chances are the front is just understaffed. No one wants to be a cashier anyways. Especially early in the morning or late at night. Companies have been cutting hours but that affects every department since the pandemic ended. Not because a self checkout machine is replacing an entire store. Therefore there's no need to cuss out the poor kid working the nearest section of self checkout section and tell him to hope on the register.

I understand if you have a lot of groceries and if a store only has self checkouts available, the employees can help you out and they should if you ask.  (Ask Nicely though or you will get ignored from me) Most places have belts and hand scanners to make like easiler also to make life easier. 

Another complaint I hear is that they are using customers labor. I think of two things when people say this and this comes from what I seen personally. 

1. Some older people may be physically disabled to scan their order, or are lazy or arrogant like most Americans to learn learn to use it. If this the case, just order your groceries. It's really not that hard! If you can't handle technology  to order stuff eitger, well tough luck. Learn the new system in place today or be left behind.

2. It's not hard to pick up and run a product over a scanner. If you get locked out, it's because something had a barcode that didn't read (which happens, technically ain't perfect) or you really didn't scan something and just bagged it. Either way, it's not that hard and most places have equipment for you to use to make life even easier. Also keep in mind a cashier is barley marking above minimum wage in most places in the US to do what your doing for yourself. If you wouldn't want to be a cashier, than shut up about it because no one wants to be a cashier either.

I'm a front end manager. Change my mind on why I should be scared that self checkouts are going to take my job."

I can't even begin to understand where the hate comes from either. Is it just taught at a young age, or is it easily picked up by people?

The infighting among the people, the ravenous hatred of groups of people based on race and religion, they disruption of society in Europe and America, and the constant conflict and death that I needn't mention as you know what I'm talking about. I've always tried to look on the good side of things my whole life, as an optimist does. That's all I've ever been. Now, I very truly consider abandoning that entire philosophy altogether because of what I stated above; there is no more love, no more respect, no more coming together. There is only anger, hatred and destroying one another by any means necessary.  
  
It feels really cheesy, but this is genuine. I implore anyone to change my view because I want to continue looking for the good in life, but I just can't. Not anymore."
43,2023-12-27,CMV: There's more things to dislike about dogs than cats,u/Actual_Parsnip4707,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18sd15v/cmv_theres_more_things_to_dislike_about_dogs_than/,changemyview,"I'm a cat person so I'm going to be upfront about my bias. It seems that society just loves dogs unconditionally and I never understood why. People can be upfront about how much they hate cats and how they're evil but the second you say that about dogs somehow everyone thinks you're a crazy person. But in my view there's way more things to dislike about dogs than their are cats and here are some of my reasons. 
Firstly dogs are far more violent than cats. Say what you want about cats but if you are walking down the street by yourself, you're far more likely to be attacked by a dog than a cat. And the thing is dogs will attack people completely unprovoked. Like if you're just riding a bicycle, going for a morning jog or do any activity minding your own business a dog will come and either chase you or on worse cases try to mail you to death. Now obviously I'm not saying all dogs are like this but this type of behavior is far more prevalent in dogs rather than cats. Some people may say it's because dogs are bigger which is generally true but even tiny dogs like chihuahuas will still display aggressive behaviors towards strangers unprovoked. Sure cats can still cause injuries to others as well but when animal control is called it's almost always a dog.
Secondly dogs are unhygienic compared to cats. Dogs drool, defecate on peoples property and in public, smell, eat poop, lick their own private parts and will still try to jump and lick you. Cats on the other hand are FAR CLEANER. Cats literally self groom themselves constantly giving them a much cleaner and neater standard of living. 
Thirdly Dogs are loud and disruptive. The constant barking, whining, growling etc. can be quite annoying. I can be walking down the street and someone's dog will just be violently barking at me accross the window for no reason. Or in any cases neighbors dog can't be quite loud and disruptive towards others. Cats meowing aren't nearly as disruptive as dogs. 
And one other thing is dogs literally have ZERO respect for your personal space. Unlike dogs cats will actually LEAVE YOU ALONE. I can count how many times I've been in public minding my own business and someone's dog just wanders up to me and I'm showing I'm clearly not interested in interacting with their pet but the owner will disregard me and just say ""oh he's friendly"". Like no you wouldn't want me coming up to you invading your personal space so please keep your pet to yourself. 
I can go on and on but in my OPINION dogs are far more of a nusance than cats. I know this post is going to trigger a lot of dog lovers but im ready."

1,2023-12-27,"CMV: In America, there is viable solution to racism that isnt radical.",u/Pale-Strawberry-180,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18sddqn/cmv_in_america_there_is_viable_solution_to_racism/,changemyview,"It's ultimately through two lenses you can come to terms with what is and what isn't radical. One is understanding the benefit of the helpful idiot, and the other is the fear of eternal damnation. I want to define radical as the aversion to the status quo through extreme beliefs. My first premise is simply that no one asked to be here.


Past empires and civilizations would have collapsed if they had allowed subclasses of people to control the means of production. Still, it doesn't change anything; those civilizations benefitted and always have through force, intimidation, control, and subjugation. It's in our DNA to exploit and be tribal; it's not in our interests to compromise our values and beliefs for anyone. The measures we’ll take to circumvent the truth until we can bear this reality are attractive. Media tells us that democracy is possible and that we don't live in a world conforming to
Ideals as a way to escape the horrors of the past. 

In my opinion, hope can't be generated from a void; no civilization can continue to thrive without some catastrophic event that takes them out because of their hubris and misjudgment—taking accolades and trophies and crediting oneself without cause based on creed and culture. Most institutions holding up these reigns of honor and dignity return to those ideals. But never in a productive way.

Every inch of freedom we clawed out for in the name of inalienable rights as lawful adherence will be the same pretense for our downfall when the poor and oppressed present us with something you'd only see during the hypothetical idea of rapture. Still, it is there nonetheless to mark out the cresting point of humans in this Judeo-Christian continuum.

I think it's implied that some will chant death to America… but it will be a whisper by then. They give you a choice. If you desire this future, then vote for the appropriate person. If not, then opt out and embrace oblivion. 

Black and Jewish people are the convergence of modern American racial dynamics. It serves as a channel and anecdote to glimpse the truth.

Is the fear based on the historical precedent of Jews having been displaced for generations?

As far as I know,  America is a different beast; no culture or ""ethnic"" group has been pushed out of this country in the entirety of our modern history, but I have to admit I fear antisemitism as well, but is the fear a 1-1 or are we at times refusing to see patterns in the overt examples corruption, fraud, and misconduct, all in an attempt to subvert the truth? Or are we simply redefining our already deeply held beliefs about power and privilege? 

I'm black, and I didn't ask to be here. I love America and everything it's given me. Still, I guess the Africans or foreigners during the Roman Empire didn't ask either, yet benefited from aqueducts and other technological advancements. Countless other examples can be provided. 

Is what we're selling now with overconsumption worth it? Sneaker deals, album releases, and culture centers are hell-bent on monetary gain over strict adherence to faith. Any amount of success a minority group attains will aid them if they are self-governed effectively. I was hoping someone could explain to me why there is no legitimate example of a segregated homogenous community with a cohesive shared reality that doesn't have the majority of its success in its history based on traditional/conventional forms of assimilation. 

Most minorities dont control much of the means of production, and constantly, you see African Americans failing at business ventures with poor handling of finances. At least ordinary ones in large populations and culture centers. Yet other minority groups produce an opposite output. It's our only way to appeal to the masses who have shaped culture under their periscope and reality. Everyone adheres to it. 

I think representation matters, but shady business dealings are just the easiest things to hone in on, they say. That's another cheap semantic trope, but it's relevant. That's most likely what many of these black artists, intellectuals, and creatives face in their psychological battleground established for their oppressors. But I'd imagine something was lacking in their upbringing that led to this, not some evil Jewish overlord who commits white-collar crime. In the world of information and ideas, someone had to strike gold first, and it's just comically insensitive that these tropes follow us everywhere we go throughout history. When we know precisely what the nexus of this divergence is before the fall of man begins. 

We shouldn't be conditioned, yet it is technically a verifiable reality that stereotypes and prejudice prepare people to act differently based on where they are. If society causes this based on a lack of integration, it's not harmful for us to express this feeling. We tried our best to describe a feeling and common problem most segregated areas of the country experience when cultures and races mix.

I don't see race as the lens to see the world, but you can see here that the issue is that we will never have an actual answer to these problems until the prevailing perception and unconscious bias of these stereotypes are rooted out. That doesn't happen by not talking about it, but you also can't say that talking about it will exacerbate the conflict. It's a catch-22. 

No one is expected to accommodate people based on ethnic and racial disharmony. Yet, it remains a highly relevant topic in every social space for a reason. We did, at one point, have laws and ordinances that created this boundary between integration.

I think it's a bit naive to expect that it's something that isn't still a relevant topic in every household. Still, then again, if it's an exclusively white and black household, you will see those environments, for some odd reason, described as race-neutral. The white ones nor the minority ones have any aspect that includes an integrated framework, thus never opening up new stimuli where I'll tell you for a fact there exists some form of unconscious bias naturally, even if there is no formal test to prove it. We engineered a hegemony that pinned inborn qualities of race and eugenics as a representation of its best specimens. Justified it, called It Holy, and codified it as law. 

We won't get anywhere, is all I'm saying, and Im afraid the way most African Americans view the larger society they live in is growing more vapid by the day. I can confirm that as a black man living in an inner city. The stereotypes follow you like a shadow you never asked for, a mark, and you could even say a curse if you're being dramatic. It's real, and it's also not real, but for me, I realize even still that most people are suffering from much more severe issues. So it's not about me, but the collective, but it's the hardest pill to swallow every day because generations previously told me this was the status quo and that the aversion we felt was natural. De-program this for me and offer me something better."

194,2023-12-27,"CMV: The 'new' definitions of racism and sexism don't make a lot of sense. The 'old' ones are not perfect, but they're a heck of a lot more straightforward and usable.",u/ICuriosityCatI,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18sdmzq/cmv_the_new_definitions_of_racism_and_sexism_dont/,changemyview,"First, sometimes I've posted views in the past with a strong feeling about something that I'm fairly confident but I'm not sure is correct. 

But with this view, I'm genuinely confused. I don't think I could possibly be correct because if I was I don't see how this makes any sense on any level, but I'm not sure what I'm missing. So I do believe this, but I'm very open to changing my mind.

The traditional definition of racist and sexist that I grew up with is ""the belief that particular races/sexes are inferior."" This makes complete sense to me. By this definition there are not many racists/sexists in the world. 

But there's a lot of controversy nowadays and many people, especially those far to the left, say that's not a good definition and sociology's definition is better. Sociology, as I understand it, views racism as the power structures in society that work against certain groups/sexes. So then a racist/sexist individual would be somebody who reinforces these existing power structures by supporting policies that do or spreading information that does. 

This is the part that baffles me and makes me think it doesn't make a lot of sense to apply this definition in discussions. If there's a particular policy that hasn't been implemented yet nobody can say whether objectively speaking said policy will disempower/empower certain oppressed groups. If I think the policy will and I vote against it or oppose it I'm a racist/sexist. Fair enough. But if I think a given policy will reinforce existing unfair structures and somebody else thinks it will tear them down and I vote against the policy... Am I a racist? Or a sexist? 

It seems like to have any meaning at all there needs to be some sort of objective metric for determining if something is racist/sexist. Otherwise it's subjective and can be easily weaponized. In which case nobody should take it seriously. 

I know I've been stubborn and close minded sometimes in the past, but I'm really trying to understand this. I've been called racist or sexist on here before, but I don't know if I've ever said anything that's objectively racist/sexist. I'm really trying to understand this. I don't think my view could be correct, but it is my view because I don't understand what I'm missing. Change it?"

A library has the right to remove content from its shelves that is not appropriate for their audience. That doesn't mean it's banned. We wouldn't say playboy is banned because I can't get it in my local HS library.   
  
Many of the people who are claiming books are being banned for being ""Sex Ed"" haven't actually read these books.  While there are certainly valuable sex ed material in some of these, they are side by side with graphic depictions.   
  
Gender queer has illustrations of fellating a dildo, as well as the MC getting aroused by illustrations of an adult man touching the penis of a young boy (albeit based on Plato’s Symposium).   
  
Beyond Magenta has reference to a six year old boy blowing older boys.   
  
Flamer has a bunch of tweens talking about the last person to jizz in a bottle has to drink it all, not to mention all the jerking it  
  
This Book is Gay gives step by step instructions on how to give a handjob.   
  
I don’t think any of this content is inherently bad, and is often important in the context of the story in which it is told.  I agree that many of these books have sex ed value. But that doesn’t mean that content is appropriate for everyone in every venue, and that doesn’t mean that trying to remove it from school libraries is based in bigotry, homophobia or transphobia.

I personally believe so.,u/V1tam1n_D,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18sgcf6/cmv_is_there_a_financial_incentive_from_welfare/,changemyview,"Basically I was told there's no financial incentive to stay a single parent because they can either find a partner who will work and add income to the family or find another partner on welfare which will again add income to the family. Its kind of difficult to find specific numbers so I was curious if anyone here knew if two partners on welfare/one partner welfare one working will always outweigh the financials of a single parent on welfare?

Personally, I am under the impression you get the most money from welfare if you are a single parent and any type of serious relationship you get into jeopardizes that (unless you find someone whose very financially stable but let's assume thats the outlier for this situation). I also made the argument that once you do find a partner with welfare/low income, they are more likely to gatekeep their money for themselves than spend it to properly raise the kid, especially if it's not even theirs. 

Also would just like to clarify I'm not trying to generalize or put down people that are struggling, the debate is more so whether is it more or less common for single parents to be in a situation where becoming a two parent household will hurt them financially due to them losing those welfare benefits."
44,2023-12-27,"CMV: ""66% homeownership in America"" statistic is being used misleadingly by a lot of media and is probably actively becoming a less accurate measure of the percent of Americans who own their own homes as housing costs increase.",u/GeneralizedFlatulent,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18sgcwj/cmv_66_homeownership_in_america_statistic_is/,changemyview,"I understand that people usually aren't that interested in statistics. But just like we always have articles about how ""America is great this is a vibe cession"" and it's true that in the USA things aren't nearly as bad as they are in many other places, 66% being used to imply 66% of Americans own their house seems to be pretty much intentionally misleading. 

https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/currenthvspress.pdf

This is where every article I've ever seen about % home ownership cites as a source. The last page of the PDF explains how the % home ownership is calculated.

The calculation is done by:

(number of households/units that are occupied by the owner) divided by (total number of house units.)

That means that:

1. The statistic is not counting the population, it is counting housing units. People seem to think it's counting population as in, ""individual humans in the United States."" It is actually counting ""buildings/addresses where people live."" If I recall, most households aren't just 1 person living alone. So it's not counting the thing people think. The way people interpret the statistic, it would be about as accurate to count unemployment by ""is there an employed person who lives inside this housing unit, yes or no"" and only count ""unemployed"" as ""houses where no one who is currebtly employed lives here, at least one person is looking for work""

2. If they just presented the statistic as ""66% of the housing units in the United States have the owner living inside of them"" I think it would be much more clear what it actually means, I don't see why not just present it this way unless it's to try and inflate the number of homeowners 

3. When this statistic was first created it might have been more accurate - maybe it was during the ""nuclear family is the norm"" years where people tended to move out and start their own family/household by their 20s or 30s. 

4: as time goes on and more people say, rent out their basement. Or their mother in law suite. Or rooms in their house. Or live with room mates or in a multi generational house. This statistic becomes less and less accurate to what people's perception of it means. 



If literally no one lived in their own house - literally everyone with living family lived in same house with 3 generations, all their cousins and aunts and uncles, and someone in that family happened to own the unit, 

With the way this statistic is calculated we would have a 100% homeownership rate."

Their desire is so much higher than the competition that not only do they take more action and simple do more, train more, but because they care so much they want to master what it is that they’re doing so they don’t settle for average technique/results/deals they relentlessly push for only the best. 

That basically sets their daily personal compounding rate much higher than their competition. Then, later down the line, the gap becomes insurmountable.

Many people say that inflation is because employees are demanding more money forcing companies to charge more money. The companies are still making record profits though so that’s clearly not the problem. But even more strange is that corporations are working hard to convince people that this is the reason. 

Obviously these corporations don’t want to pay employees more than they have to but there is something worse that they don’t want us to realize. These corporations are not raising the prices of their products because of their own employees, but because of everyone else’s employees. 

As wages increase, so does demand for many products. So companies need to decide if they should increase supply to match this demand. But they can just as easily increase prices to reduce demand. They make more money, they don’t have to invest in extra infrastructure, and if the increased demand drops in the future they are safe. It’s great for the 1% but it really sucks for everyone else. These businesses get that extra money but it doesn’t trickle down to the employees enough to cover the extra expenses and ultimately reduces the quality of life for many, if not most americans.

Yes we need to pay employees more, but we need to fix this corporate greed or it will never improve our economy or quality of life for the average american."

Like they dont understand how America's current political strategy is built around the post-ww2 order. How we re-built western Europe meticulously after WW2 so that another war would never be fought on the continent again. We forcibly aligned their economic interests through a complex web of trade deals and pan-western political structures so as to bring about an era of peace and prosperity they could not have ever imagined. This was as the belligerent Churchill and other European leaders were still thirsting for Empire and war. We also forgave most of their debt and literally built their infrastructure ourselves. 

In the Asian pacific, we stabilized the region by extending a security guarantor to Japan and korea in return for giving up on any hopes of Empire. Then we opened them up to the intl system and slowly helped rebuild infrastructure. In the case of japan we made alterations to their political system to prevent extremist capture from ever taking hold of the nation again.

With China, we freely secured their trade with the rest of the world with the hopes that this would cause them to liberalize.

Everything in the gulf was built by us. Ever wondered why Saudi's biggest oil company as American in its name? Because we fucking built it, and continue to handle all the skilled tech work and bring new refining tech to the country. Qatar was barren until we discovered a way to viable ship LNG around the world. Most of the gulfs skilled technical work comes from us. In addition, we continue to secure the trade of oil in the region. 

Wherever you see prosperity, behind it all lies America's hand. The regions that still fail to prosper are coincidentally the areas with the least US involvement or are areas that were yet much poorer off before America got involved. The fact remains we forged a new unprecedented order. Not based on conquest, empire, or a lust for power. But one based on mutual self-interest, cooperation, and peace. No other nation has proven fit to lead the world. 

Even our political failures in Iraq and Afghanistan still left both nations objectively better off by every metric. GDP, life expectancy, infant mortality, ect. all improved coincident with our intervention. "

There are certain cultures where mental health problems as you know them do not exist. For example, in any severe warrior culture will prohibit the manifestation of virtually all mental health problems- because in a warrior culture a person is taught discipline, physical rigor, and self mastery.

People born into modern society are not taught how to live. Best case scenario who have parents who tell them what to do and what rules to follow- but they do not learn to understand the nature of their very own life in any of its very basic aspects.

This is confounded by the fact that modern society is unnaturally complex to the human mind. There is too much going on, and so many possibilities for malfunction. To try and classify such malfunction and treat it with pharmaceuticals is just wrong.

Men paying for dates is ultimately a hold over from Chivalrous ideology. Chivalry in itself is just a romanticized ideal and was no more real than the idea of the stoic samurai or the honorable sailor. It was hallmark for the feudal age. But even if it was, it was largely based on sexism and the idea that women were inferior and subordinate to men. If we were to justify this behavior as how things “should” be based on that, then we it’s only fair that we accept the entire premise and not just what benefits a specific group. So to me it’s an all or nothing argument for chivalry.

Moving on I think it’s best to get an understanding of what transactional means. In simple terms it’s giving something with the expectation of receiving something in return. Quid pro quo.

So using this the only way a man paying on a date would be if he’s doing it out of the kindness of his heart and also if whether or not he pay has zero influence on the date. But neither of these things are generally true. 

Most of the time men pay not out of the kindness of their heart but because it’s what they’ve been manipulated into doing. They are made to feel shameful if they don’t do this and its generally conditional if they want to get a date. 

On the other side women will generally use this as a measure of the man’s value. I’m sure we’ve heard many time that women will say if I have to pay on a first date there won’t be a second. And there are also some someone who measure the amount a man spends even if he does pay.

So to me in these situations it’s impossible for it not to be transactional. I think people just deny this because calling it what it is makes them feel bad. What are your thoughts to cmv"

1,2023-12-28,CMV: Nakba denial is genocide denial,u/GoSouthCourt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ssrnj/cmv_nakba_denial_is_genocide_denial/,changemyview,"Nakba is the violent ethnic cleansing campaign carried out by Israeli militants against Palestinian Arabs started in 1948 and went on for a few years. Approximately 750,000 Palestinian Arabs were expelled from their homes and became their descendants are still stateless and seeking refuge is neighbouring countries, Gaza and the West Bank. This expulsion started with the Deir Yassin massacre, where Israeli militants killed more than 100 Palestinian Arabs, including women and children. This sparked terror and fear amongst Palestinian Arabs and caused them to flee from the militants. There were many other militant operations after the massacre too that caused more expulsion.

To qualify as a genocide, it requires 2 things: method and intent. The method is pretty straightforward to prove, Haganah's own intelligence said that at least 55% of the exodus were caused by their own operations and only about 5% left because of Arab nations' calling. Regarding intent, it was obvious from the political class in Israel that they weren't satisfied with the presence of Arabs or the territory they were given. Ben Gurion said ""There can be no stable and strong Jewish state so long as it has a Jewish majority of only 60%"". Founder of Likud, Begin, said ""in the war ahead we'll have to stand on our own, it will be a war on our existence and future"" and was sure that the creation of Israel would make territorial expansion possible. 

Since 1948, until around the late 1980s when files began to be declassified, Israel has denied any involvement in the Nakba. But even today it's still happening. The term ""Nakba"" is [banned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/22/israel-remove-nakba-from-textbooks) in Arab children's textbook. They also passed the ""[Nakba Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba_Law)"", which restricts fundings to organisations looking to commemorate or recognise Nakba. [Haareetz](https://archive.is/1QVVm) too has a piece on systemic denial from the Israeli government of the Nakba. Even today, many Zionists would claim that Nakba was merely a result of the Arab-Israel war, or Arab nations were actually responsible for telling Palestinian Arabs to flee, when the evidence suggests otherwise. 

To CMV, show that I am wrong in this post, or what I describe does not constitute genocide, or Nakba denial is not actually happening."

However, this breeds an issue when adjustments to the attentional directives of the social context are only made possible through the transformation of the internal structure of the individual. Considering those internal structures are invisible unless they can be mapped onto existing social contexts, it is impossible for anyone to introduce a truly new directive, and is similarly impossible for anyone to choose what they find themselves defending. Maybe we can call this a lack of Free-will which inaudibly and randomly moves the social contexts and the bounds of individual context in concert with wherever the tides of our nature takes us. This leaves us both powerless in our pursuit for sustainability, and simultaneously all-powerful in our ability to defend a sustainable position; but only if given the exact correct set of initial circumstances -- something we most likely are not blessed with in nature.

While both environments carry challenges such as rushes, staffing issues, and lackluster benefits, restaurants by far out toxic a work environment as compared to a fast food place. 

In a restaurant, the staff drug and alcohol usage is exasperated in ways that are far beyond the stoners in fast food. Using alcohol and harder drugs to survive the shifts is commonplace in sit down restaurant staffs. And if anything, alcohol and hard drug usage on the clock, is encouraged and part of the social environment in many restaurants. 

Where as, smoking a bowl of cannabis is the extent of fast food shenanigans. Which I find is harmless if hand washing is done. 

Also, the toxicity of tipping and prime shifts, such as Sunday lunches, holiday suppers, etc. Waitresses in tears, drama over the best shifts, and game playing. 

Where as in fast food. Tips are shared at the tip jar, so the hustle culture doesn't manifest into drama or tears or fighting in a fast food environment, as the manager or assistant manager sets the schedule. 

And then, the personalities you encounter from management to entry level. 

On average, fast food employees are less hostile, more silly, usually more potheads, and younger. 

While the sit down restaurant employees are significantly more hostile, older in age, many have been in prison or are on parole, and use harder drugs and alcohol at work. 

For these reasons, I strongly encourage fast food work over restaurant work. 

While both come with their unique pros and cons, fast food by far, is the better place to work from a stress and mental health standpoint.

Becoming a teacher was once a career path I considered taking until I learned more about the incredible stress they are under. Although I support public education I can't help but foresee a bleak future when analyzing the issues plaguing it.

Recruiting and retaining teachers is becoming more difficult with the number of new teacher openings outpacing the number of new hires to the profession. This discrepancy can be explained mostly by teachers quitting the profession over other explanations.

In February of this year a report was released by a task force created by Texas Governor Greg Abbot's administration that investigated the teacher shortage. Among their recommendations was higher teacher compensation, better healthcare plans, better training, and better working conditions.

Source: Pages 4-6, [https://tea.texas.gov/texas-schools/health-safety-discipline/tvtf-final-report.pdf](https://tea.texas.gov/texas-schools/health-safety-discipline/tvtf-final-report.pdf)

However, most of these recommendations have yet to be implemented with several bills addressing the problems having been shot down (HB 1548, HB 4586, HB 2938). Also, 1/3rd of Texas teachers hired in the last year are completely uncertified; a dramatic increase from before the pandemic.

Despite all this, I believe all of these issues can be fixed through a combination of legislation and increased support for public education. What makes me so pessimistic about the subject is how demonized public education has become among far-right politicians and their supporters.

The ""culture war"" has taken over a large portion of the conversation around public schools with little sign of stopping because, in my opinion, getting parents fired up about LGBTQ topics and Critical Race Theory is an easy way to get votes. This has resulted in Florida Governor Ron Desantis's ""Don't Say Gay"" bill and a wave of harassment towards teachers and principals.

Rather than trying to fix these issues, it seems the political powers that be are more attracted to stop-gap solutions to appease the obnoxious crowds ranting about conspiracy theories instead of supporting public schools. In September my home state of North Carolina authorized the creation of a publicly funded school voucher program that would enable families to put their children in the private school of their choice; the tenth state to do so.

I feel like none of these pose a credible threat to the existence of humans. Don't get me wrong, some of them can absolutely cause significant damage to humankind, but not extinction-level.

For AI to cause an extinction level event, it requires a. the AI to be able to operate completely independently from humans, b. have the motivation to eliminate humans, and c. humans to surrender all autonomy to the AI. I just don't see how our survival instinct and forewarnings via sci-fis will allow any of these to take place.

For nuclear or biological warfare to eliminate humankind, it requires one party to be willing to eliminate oneself, the enemy and all third parties. Unless some kind of social collapse happens, I don't see a world where a country would be willing to do that, or even risk that. Don't get me wrong, a nuclear war will kill a lot of people, but to kill all humans requires a country to make that move intentionally.

Asteroids of the kind that kill the dinosaurs happen once every tens of millions of years, and we'd spot them very easily. I don't think it's a credible threat at all. 

Climate change, on the other hand, can lead to runaway climate change, or destruction of our food or water supply, or change the atmospheric composition so it's no longer habitable for humans, and so on. Can climate change lead to a depletion of resources that then leads to nuclear warfare? Yeah, but the root cause of that extinction is still man-made climate change."

A stable diffusion model would be the “artist” but since it’s just a computer algorithm generating it’s best attempt to interpret your request based on the images it is trained on, and art by definition is HUMAN expression of creativity and skill, then AI images can not be art.

If AI images were a deliberate expression of your artistic vision, then two different models would give you the exact same result if fed the same prompts and parameters.

“What about movie directors,” you say, “are they not artists because they prompt someone to create their vision?”

Movie directors and architects over see every specific aspect of their vision. The actors and laborers are their paintbrush. They frame every shot, they choose every material, and their vision is created with their full deliberation.

If a director were to pick out some actors, throw them a script and a synopsis, and tell them to finish it by next week, they would not be artists.

“What about AI tools?!” sure. If you want to use AI to help create your bigger vision, go for it. I personally think it’s a little lazy, but it can be efficient. If AI didn’t generate the entire finished product for you, it’s still your vision.

At least when “musicians” hire ghost producers to make their music for them, they do it for the money and the fame. AI “artists” just desperately want to be perceived as artists to make themselves feel special even though literally everyone that has $20 a month to burn on Midjourney would by their definition be an artist too, making their whole idea of art and artists meaningless anyway.

(I have a theory that this reaction is not, itself, indicative of racism.  I think it's entirely possible that this reaction reflects an essential conservatism that is baked into the genetic code.  A conservatism that says Thou Shalt Not Alter the Rules Society Lives By.  Or it could be a fundamental expression of allegiance to the human pecking order, which makes as much sense with us as it does with chickens.  I'm sure there are other possibilities, and that it's not necessarily racism.)  
  
But at any rate, one of the most fundamental rational objections to this procedure of eliminating racism is that it will destroy either white or black society or both.  
  
There are two common understandings of the process.  One is that it will dilute black society out of existence; the other is that it will taint white society out of existence.  Both cannot be true, of course, since they're mutually exclusive.  And they both seem to rest on such similar reasoning that I think neither can be true.  If one is wrong (and at least one is certainly wrong) both are.  
  
In fact, in my view, there's no way at all to predict what we will wind up with, if we begin the process.  When it is done, will we think of ourselves as white, black, something else racial, or something else nonracial?  There's just no way to tell.  It will depend on decisions made by others, perhaps people who have not yet been born.  
  
But my point today is just to mention that our culture exhibits many dramatic differences, subcultures, within itself.  There's a party culture, and a sober conservative culture.  There's an urban culture and a rural culture.  There's New York culture, and California culture, and Texas culture.  These cultures differ dramatically from one another.  
  
And how much do any of these cultures differ from what we used to be, in the 1900s or 1800s or 1700s?  Society has undergone many changes.  I'm absolutely certain that we can tolerate many more.  I suspect that if we begin the process of eliminating racism, the changes that actually occur will feel far less fundamental than most of the other changes we've accommodated ourselves to successfully over the last 300 years.  
  
In short:  there's really nothing to be afraid of.  Let's do it, and not worry too much about it.

Feminism is a good and needed thing in the world but it feels like it has become so mainstream everyone is a ""feminist"" yet no one wants to put the effort in to be a feminist. 

With my title, I see so many people try to describe this but just fall flat. Not in a ""I can't get my words out right"" but more in a ""I have never critically engaged with this before"" way. 

Most times it is better to say how these privledges came about, and how they are upheld still. If you're talking about areas where women are overlooked for men, we should be able to say what advantages, either socially or physically, do men generally have over women. 

For example, women are more terrified of seeing a man at night rather than a woman. Let's analyze why. In the US the average male height is 5'9"" while women are on average 5'4"". Male puberty give me more power on average. If someone both bigger and stronger then you come from no where at night, everyone is getting scared. It's not a fear of men, but it's the fear of being overpowered. Taller and bigger people usually don't have to worry about this much. It's why more work worry about this than men. 

Second example, in the work place men will seemingly be picked over women. The system for working before disenfranchised women from joining even after women started to gain equality. Joining a space made for a group is daunting as an outsider. This space was created from people who didn't knowingly create a male space but simply enforced it.

Women are smaller and less aggressive socially. Even if you want to be more aggressive, there is only so much room you can move in being an outsider. CEOs aren't juet mostly emn but they're taller on average. Smaller and shorter people on average don't made as much money as taller people. On average, men will benefit from natural selection of these traits. Men are taught to be more aggressive, straight forward, and they are physically call for more respect. None of this is due to men as group being evil. Men do benefit from this generally on average. 

Both of those are to show examples of how to discuss contentious ideas such as ""cross the street when men"" or ""men don't face struggle in the working world."" I tried to look at what is fundamentally being said. I think this is the best way to do so. There are examples where these average benefits harm men. Home care, child care, and health care are all examples of where men will face discrimination. 

I see a lot of men irl and online weary of feminism. They'll have a knee-jerk reaction to these two topics. I aim to lower that by understanding what is fundamentally being said and hoping to express that clearly. 

Ways to change my view:

Some suggestions but I'm sure there are more. I consider these fundamental pillars in my argument. If you make me agree to any of these, it would fundamentally change my view. 

1. I'm actually wrong in my description of male privledge and showing me how I am wrong

2. This isn't an issue that impedes understanding of the topic. Showing something that is a bigger issue that impedes gaining more support 

3. It ain't better to say how or why privledges happen. Simply stating they are so should be enough"
377,2023-12-28,"CMV: Pro-Palestine movements aren't interested in a two-state solution, which will keep the Israel-Palestine conflict going in perpetuity",u/thatshirtman,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18sxj3c/cmv_propalestine_movements_arent_interested_in_a/,changemyview,"The Nakba is the most important event in Palestinian history. Over 700,000 people were displaced during a war resulting from Arab armies invading Israel. The entire objective of the Free Palestine movement is essentially to turn back time to 1948 and get a do-over. 

A two-state solution is sadly not a solution Palestinians want or deem acceptable. It's why every single Free Palestine necklace, poster, imagery showcases a map that includes the entire land of Israel. The entire land is Palestine in their eyes. 

The idea of a Palestinian country sitting just on Gaza and the West Bank (with a shared Jerusalem) is insufficient, which is why they are holding strong to the idea of a full right of return for all refugees and their descendants. The demand, however, is impractical and detrimental to their cause as it's a non-starter for Israel.

It's curious and bizarre that no other refugee group in history, besides the Palestinians, includes descendants of actual refugees. Despite this, Israel in peace offers in the past has offered to take in 100,000 refugees who actually lived in what is now Israel, while also helping establish a $30 BILLION fund to help descendents resettle in a newly formed Palestinian state and elsewhere.

This offer was rejected.

The offer wasn't good enough because the real issue is the existence of Israel itself, which Palestinians believe was created on stolen land. Never mind the fact that none of this would have happened had Arab armies not invaded, the fact remains that the Palestinian cause is so rooted in the removal of Israel as a Jewish entity that a two-state solution isn't something Palestinians view as an acceptable solution. 

The Palestinian vision for peace involves the removal of Israel as a country and a new country in its place with a majority Palestinian population.  It's why Free Palestine folks are now advocating for a single state solution, which is a nice way of saying that Israel will evaporate to make way for Palestine.

The Palestinians feel that they are owed all of the land, and are constantly told that if they continue to insist on this, they will get it. This is why, in the United States, people who have never lived in or around Israel continue to talk about how the state was stolen from them. In contrast, every other group of refugees in history (especially those who suffered as a result of losing a war) have moved on and accepted the reality of their current situation.

I used to believe a two-state solution was possible, but after seeing what the vast majority of Pro-Palestine publications and pundits are putting forth, it seems that the idea of Israel in its current form -- without the return of millions of Palestinans -- is a dealbreaker. Which is tragic because if true, the Palestinians would rather cling to the notion of the right of return in perpetutity rather than start country-building.

There will never be peace until a Palestinian leader emerges who can blankly state that Israel is a reality and that a 2-state solution is the only path towards peace."

This was the interesting part:

*There are certain things you only hear directed toward men*

* *Is this the hill you want to die on?*

* *Do you want to be right, or do you want to get along?*

It made me think that its really true.  If both the man and woman are being stubborn on something, people assume the guy is wrong and should just suck it up and acquiesce to the wife.  

I've experienced this in life too.   When relationships have ended, I've gotten comments that are along the lines of ""what did you do?"" or ""how did you mess this up?"".  Even if its said jokingly, there is usually some kind of assumption that in breakups, the man either did something to cause it, or his lack of something caused it.  

When men are cheaters, they are bad people.  When women are cheaters, the men DROVE them to cheat.

Even in public.  If you see a man and a woman arguing, most people assume that they are arguing over something the man did.

Post WWII, via the Pax Americana / Bretton Woods / GATT etc, the USA has enforced a system of free trade, a rules based world order, that has led to the enrichment of such countries as Japan, South Korea, Germany, Italy, France, the UK, even China, in fact China probably more so than anyone else - some of these countries were already rich, but they were also constantly fighting wars - they are now much richer, & Europe has been at peace, apart from Eastern European / Slavic wars in post communist countries like Ukraine currently, or previously Yugoslavia… two or three, relatively small wars, in 70 years. Prior to that Europe was at war every 30 years or so.  
Likewise Asia… but post WWII, Axis and Allied powers could trade, get rich, and thrive with the US guaranteeing the safety of the seas…

It also seems more apparent that any level of dialogue can bridge some world views. 

This stagnation comes at the cost of *human* future, whereas this planet will keep rotating, outgassing, shifting, and *living*. 

How long must this experiment go on? The US claims multiculturalism is possible, all the while extorting any culture it absorbs. 

I may be mistaken, but this socio-economic system seems to convert culture into industry. Rather than boiling and blending cultures, it’s far more profitable to clearly define and “celebrate” these cultures. 

In so doing, we forget how each unique culture is a different approach at human life, and how each culture is symbolic of the environment in developed within.

We also forget good ideas come from culture. Purpose and belonging, maybe with a dash of tradition. Art and concepts that challenge the norm, rather than *reinforcing* it. 

But they were unique because they developed on their own, and recently their has been a global trend to blend. 

This attempt is likely in vain, as it will take away from a collide-o-scope of human diversity and replace it with the least common denominator, which will be discussed in the comments of this post. 

TL;DR: It’s my position that the development of ideas and cultures require a certain process that eliminates ideas that don’t work. Competing ideas lead to *better* or different ideas, which promotes diversity. A culture that absorbs all cultures into one likely doesn’t do it for lofty ideas like “tolerance” or “celebration”, but because it’s profitable to further divide tribes and communities by generating distinct identities. Cultures should be fragmented, just as they developed, or eliminated all together."

The conservative reaction to this policy was a universal ""Russia is taking their country back from decadence"" and ""Russia is taking the lead is protecting their children"". This follows up with similar situations were conservatives cheered when Russia imprisoned people for marijuana use.

When arrests were made for the Russian ""almost nude"" holiday party, conservatives responded with ""glad they are addressing this behavior"". 

These types of actions by the Russian government run oppositional to the American values of Free Speech and Free Expression. Conservatives approving of suppressing holiday parties run antithetical to American values, and lean more towards embracing the far more conservative Russian societal values.

* The blockade, border wall, and bombings are a response to attacks by Hamas (even if you consider them disproportional)
* Without giving up its territorial claims for all of Israel, Hamas could truly disarm, stop firing rockets and building tunnels, renounce genocidal claims, etc, and instead focus on putting all the aid money toward the people of Gaza
* If they did that in a verifiable way, Israel would have no justification for the blockade or attacks and Gazans could live in peace rather than an ""open air prison"" as some like to say

1. I really really hate how black people look. They disgust me. They’re repulsive. That’s why I refuse to date them.
2. I really really hate how black people look. They disgust me. They’re repulsive. That’s why I refuse to hire them.
3. I don’t have any personal issues with black people. I’ll be friends with them. I just find that I’m more comfortable and at ease around white people, so I only hire white people.

Many people apparently believe that the following is not racist though:

4. I don’t have any personal issues with black people. I’ll be friends with them. I just find that I’m more comfortable and at ease around white people, so I only date white people.

This presents a contradiction in my mind, or at least a complication. Racism has at least two axes based on this illustration, in addition to “is someone discriminating on the basis of race in taking an action?” (the speaker does that in all of the illustrations).

One axis is something like “how viscerally offensive is it to listen to?” Even in a dating context, someone who goes on and on about how black men have bigger penises or how Asian women are bred to be servile is more likely to be deemed racist than someone who says they just prefer a particular feature or have a cultural connection. “I refuse to have my authority undermined by an uppity black girlfriend,” would be deemed racist by most people. No matter how meaningless it is or how much we understand that people have a right to date whoever they want, the stated justification can be so over-the-top and offensive that it’s still racist.

The other axis might be “does it affect someone’s human rights?” But I don’t think that’s why people think the job thing is racist. I think most people would also agree that refusing to have any black *friends* and calling it “just a preference” would still be racist, no matter how you spun the justification. So the second axis is even harder to determine.

Essentially, there is something different between making friends with people, hiring people, and dating people that can make discrimination in the first two actions racist and discrimination in the third action not racist, even when they’re all based on the same relatively mundane justification that is not viscerally offensive to listen to.

To steel man it as much as I could, the axes seem to be 1. How offensive is it to listen to? and 2. How significant an impact does this have on someone’s life? If a particular action is extreme enough on either axis, then it’s deemed racist. But if a justification for racial discrimination is both not offensive to listen to and wouldn’t significantly impact someone’s life, then not only are those things also true, the action isn’t even racist in the first place!

In my mind, neither of these are sensible questions to ask when determining if something is racist, and it makes even less sense to ask both. Racism becomes this weird mishmash of underlying racial discrimination, significant effects, and visceral offensiveness that is incredibly hard to pin down, and which all seems to be in service of saying “don’t worry. It’s not racist to have those dating preferences. You’re a good person!” I don’t think that’s helpful to understanding what racism is or how it operates in the world. “Is this racist?” essentially becomes “is this action super super bad?” and I think those are different questions.

I think the only requirement for “racism” should be a discriminatory act taken on the basis of race, and so I think all 4 statements above are racist. Even though statement 4 is not offensive to listen to and does not significantly impact someone’s life, I think that there is room in the definition of “racism” for statements like that, and that such a definition would be most instructive. It only clouds the issue of what racism means to act like there are these other requirements.

Racism is important because of the way that it builds on other acts of racism to contribute to effects that, in the aggregate, do impact people. If a million people have a “racial preference” against dating Asians, that can cause real harm in total, even though every individual actor is 100% justified. But people are so obsessed with justifying the individual actors that they lose sight of what racism is. Small acts of racism can be meaningless and inoffensive taken one at a time, and they can also be totally acceptable. I don’t feel compelled to throw out the description “racist” because of the other adjectives that can also accurately categorize a racist statement.

I don’t know that there is any coherent or helpful definition of racism that you can come up with that is consistent with everything that I’ve laid out.

1,2023-12-28,CMV: Progressives consider racial under-representation (or over-representation) in professional sports to be perfectly fine.,u/SteadfastEnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18t2x8g/cmv_progressives_consider_racial/,changemyview,"Let me use Asians as one example (there are many other examples, too, but I can't delve into them all and Asians are the most prominent example). 

I have never once heard progressives argue that Asians are underrepresented in U.S. pro sports and need affirmative action to be more represented (a guy like Jeremy Lin, for instance, was a once-in-a-decade thing; there are, and always have been, zero or near-zero Asian players in the NBA - a league that typically has about 400 players at any given time, despite the fact that about 7% of the American population overall is Asian.) The disparity is similar or even greater in the NFL; there are roughly 1,700 NFL players at any given moment but, again, near-zero Asian players.

Now, of course, this isn't the same as racial **integration**; progressives have always been in favor of letting black players like Jackie Robinson break into an all-white baseball league back in the day, in favor of racially integrating the NFL in the 1960s, etc. But once that **initial step** of integration has been achieved, progressives are perfectly OK with letting minorities be under-represented. 

You don't hear progressives argue that affirmative action is needed in order to increase representation of Asian or other minority players in the pro leagues. They're perfectly fine with the NBA having no more than 0-1 Asian players at any given moment. (Conversely, for instance, you don't hear progressives argue that we need to get more black players into competitive table tennis in the United States - a sport that relatively few black Americans compete in.) 

You also never hear progressives argue about ""outcome inequality"" in sports; they don't argue that Kenyans are overrepresented in winning marathons, etc. Sure, the IOC did enact rule reforms to prevent China from winning nearly all the table-tennis medals in Olympics, but that wasn't really a progressive-conservative issue. And it's okay if the majority race is underrepresented at certain roles; the NFL hasn't had a white starting cornerback since Jason Sehorn in 2000.

**Ironically, progressives embrace a very conservative-sounding argument: They argue that meritocracy is the name of the game and that if you use affirmative action to prop up an under-represented minority, that minority might not be up to par and would fare badly on the field.** Progressives are OK with affirmative action for *coaching* (such as the NFL Rooney Rule that requires each team to interview at least one non-white candidate for a head coaching vacancy,) because coaching is cerebral, but they aren't in favor of affirmative action for *physical* roles.

I have employed artists in the past, and am fully supportive of their efforts and contributions. I have toyed around with AI Art for prototyping, but have stuck to human-made art (I'll use that to contrast to AI Art for now). There is a heap of criticism and concern around AI Art at present, especially around ethics and legality.  


However, I am not wholly convinced that AI Art is inherently unethical. I can appreciate the argument made that artists who do not consent should not have their art included in the corpus of data used to train an AI model, but let's say that a training model used only public and open license images (I believe Midjourney proports to doing this); I don't believe that such a model would be unethical, nor should someone be criticised for utilising it.

I see Generative Art as a tool to be used much like Photoshop, albeit with very different target audiences. To be clear, I am not saying that someone who whispers into Midjourney should be called an artist. What they would be called and whether AI Art is ""art"" is not actually relevant to my central point.

Very open to having my view changed on this, as its a contentious area that many people I know feel strongly about.

There are way too many moving parts, little chipsets and modules that fail, and of course when those parts fail you won’t be able to fix it yourself because you don’t want to void the warranty. So you have to pay some auto shop a ludicrous amount of money for a 30m job. That you should have been able to do yourself with a ratchet set and some time. Hell I even bought a 2010 Camaro when there were new and the first time I opened the hood, I didn’t see a nice v8 just plastic cover after plastic cover. The interiors don’t even look nice anymore. It just feels so cheap. Remember back when radios used the double din and single din configuration? Well now every car has to have its own touchscreen embedded into the console. I just hate this shit. I grew up driving a manual 1989 dodge and it’s still up and running. I can rebuild the engine without a phd. I can change the oil without having to hunt for the drain or remove pieces or panels, and if I need a new bumper or part I can go to a scrapyard and just pick it up. It just works. People don’t need heated seats or a heated steering wheel. The only benefits I can think of driving a new car is gas mileage and safety. Almost everything else is horrible about them. Self driving cars scare me and I also don’t believe that should be an option for anyone who isn’t disabled. Also with this parallel parking assist and park assist. Do kids learning even need to know how to parallel park normally anymore? Idk I just saw this clip of Neil degrass Tyson talking about how his kids will never learn how to drive and “can’t wait for self driving cars!” Made me fucking sick. I wish a lot more parts were universal so we didn’t have to waste so many resources on these things. They get you to point A safely then to point B safely. That should be the point of a vehicle."

I feel like when we have the very valid intuition to hate someone when they've wronged you or whatever you're taught to rationalize your way out of it or don't hate or feel anger or whatever. Because of this you spend an enormous amount of time suppressing your hatred instead if nust letting the emotion flow through your body and leave. So much energy spent trying to suppress the emotion only makes it stronger and more distracting. I don't think you should do something just because you're feeling something, but you should feel and acknowledge the feeling without any judgement or policing. Especially hatred. Most time hatred is justified. Cmv."

Every human being on this planet is accidentally eating insects on a regular basis. They are on your plants, they are in nearly every factory-produced food item at some concentration, and let's also not forget all the spiders you eat in your sleep (semi-joke). 

I'll share that I am a big proponent of using insects in a much more mainstream way to feed the population. Not that I ever think those that are truly Vegetarian or Vegan would ever be actually okay with that consumption, but again even they are eating them anyway so I feel like it's a moot point.

Essentially, my firm belief is that no practicing Vegetarian or Vegan will ever be separated from consuming things other than plants while living on this planet. Change my view?"

394,2023-12-28,CMV: Homeschooling should be way more heavily regulated if not outright illegal,u/LineOfInquiry,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18t5hpd/cmv_homeschooling_should_be_way_more_heavily/,changemyview,"Homeschooling can sound like a good option to some people. Parents know their kids best, and can give their child all the attention they need and not be split among a whole class like a teacher is. That’s the idea at least. But in reality, that is not what happens most of the time. 

In most cases homeschooling is just a way for parents to have complete control over their kids lives and abuse them more easily or indoctrinate them into their own religious/political beliefs. We’ve all heard the horror stories of kids being unschooled and unable to even spell their name even as a 10 or 11 year old. Obviously cases this bad are not common, but the very fact that this is allowed to happen in the system AT ALL is a sign that it needs to be reformed. [Of parents who homeschool 75% say they do so to provide moral instruction. 59% do it to provide religious instruction.](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/tgk/homeschooled-children). Now you can criticize public schooling, but it certainly doesn’t fail to provide a moral backbone to kids or equip them to think critically about their own moral views and expose them to many different ideas. This makes me believe that these parents aren’t dissatisfied with public schools because of good faith criticisms of its curriculum, but because they don’t teach their own religious or political views as fact. Kids are not the property of their parents, they have a right to a good education, not an indoctrination into their parents’ ideas. Homeschooling often does not provide the wide variety of people and worldviews that defines public schooling and creates kids who cannot think for themselves as adults. 

Homeschooling also often fails to provide kids adequate social connections to other children. This is important not just for their own personal growth, but for them to learn what a “normal” childhood is like. It’s a lot easier to believe that parental abuse is normal if you don’t meet many kids who don’t experience it. It’s another form of control given to parents who usually are not trustworthy.  [Parents who engage in child neglect or educational mistreatment are more likely to use homeschooling as a guise.](https://digitalcommons.cwu.edu/source/2013/oralpresentations/137/). 

I am aware that academically homeschool kids tend to do a little better on standardized tests. But this only makes me more concerned, as based on the other data  it seems like parents are teaching for the test and not the actual skills the test is trying to measure. The point of social studies classes is not to know in what year Columbus crossed the ocean, but rather how to think critically about history, parse through information and different sources, and synthesize information to come to their own conclusions. Public school doesn’t do this perfectly, but it is at the very least the goal, unlike homeschooling for many people.

On the other hand, there are a significant minority of homeschooled kids who are due to having special needs, or from having suffered some negative experience at school that makes them feel unsafe. I do think this is a legitimate reason to homeschool, but I’d still like to see these types of kids returned to public school once the system has found better means to teach these kids and prevent abuses.

Ultimately I think this comes back to control. I think homeschooling gives parents way too much control over their kid’s life. Traditionally, kids were raised by and taught by the entire local community. We evolved to learn that way. Modern schools allow for kids to learn from a wide variety of people and curriculums are influenced by the entire community or nation. But homeschooling gives all that power to one or two people, who even at best are flawed human beings with blind spots. If you have a bad teacher at a public school it won’t be long before you’re in a different class with another teacher, and you have some mechanisms to remove that bad teacher. If your homeschool “teacher” is bad, there is almost nothing you can do and they teach every class. That’s just a bad system to put the future of humanity into."

They say the true mark of wisdom is being aware that you truly don't know anything. Everything you do is guided by information and the legitimacy of the information we receive is backed by institutions we place trust in. But misinformation has a broader implication. It really is the root of all evil using it's viral characteristics to plague that thoughts of organisms and uses this vessel to infect a generation of thinkers. A misinformation can become so powerful people who do think outside the box become ostracized from social groups. The misinformation attaches to a person's brain and uses these organisms to psychologically manipulate the brain to protect the integrity of the misinformation whilst the infected brain experiences cognitive dissonance furthering a decimation of a persons mental state.
1,2023-12-28,CMV: Trump going to get the Republican nomination and disillusionment with the system get him the win,u/GodlordHerus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18t67tg/cmv_trump_going_to_get_the_republican_nomination/,changemyview,"This isn't a debate about Trump supporters. They exist, and at least ~74 million voted for him in 2020. After all the scandals, impeachment(s), investigations, bizarre statements etc... Nothing major changed from 2020 to now ( December 2023)  that would suggest they wouldn't vote for him again. He is the front runner in the Republican polls by double digits

The legal side isn't as big as a deal as most think. If Trump is found guilty in most of his cases he can still run. With the exception of one, January 6th. Which itself is a coin flip if it goes to the Supreme Court. Which I don't think is controversial to say ( he appointed 3 of its current members) will swing in his favour

The only issue with Trump's re-election is if the Democrats can get people to vote for Biden again. Which currently is up in the air. I've seen people completely ignore the approval ratings and controversy around Biden. Because they don't want to accept that the last 3 years have  been a shit show. Internationally the world is on fire.  Yes, Trump and Obama's policies to an extent started it. But Biden in the chair when things went sideways. Domestically it appears that the after effects of the Pandemic and existing issues haven't been addressed. With the Economy and the ""real economy"" completely separating. The reports saying things are going great when everyone day to day know it's bad 

Personally the highlight was when I was told by a wealthy British economist that North America is doing great and I, a person who lives here simply don't know what I and my family are talking about. Everyone knows their $ ain't buying more

The climate issues are in the trash. The US under Biden not only produced the most oil as a nation, but the most any country has in history. 

Some want to blame the Republican Congress, but that's been 1 of the 3 years. With until recently most of Biden's agenda going through 

I think a new candidate could win easily in 2024. But Biden currently is a coin flip, even against Trump."

In those 6 words, we learn understand that, to Snape, Harry was last remnant of the unrequieted love he felt for Lily  and why he hated James and why he struggled to reconcile Dumbledore's ultimate strategy for defeating Voldemort.

These six words explain an entire world of motivations and emotions and change the viewpoint of a character that for 6 1/2 books had been viewed as evil out of jealousy."
375,2023-12-28,Cmv: The majority of people supporting Palestine in the west don't know what they are really supporting.,u/wonwonwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18t6eoz/cmv_the_majority_of_people_supporting_palestine/,changemyview,"I will start out by saying the Palestinians have been mistreated by Israel and surrounding Arab states and need a state but I believe Israel has a right to exist. A 2 state solution which I think is the majority view of people in the west not involved directly in the conflict.

When the college presidents were before Congress being wishy washy about the calls for genocide being a violation of the code of conduct I really believe one of the reasons was to protect there students. With the river to the sea slogan when used in the past and to certain extent today by Palestinians means a call for all Jewish people to be removed from the area and I dont think students really are aware of that so I don't think the majority of them chanting it were actually calling for genocide in their eyes even though through a lot of peoples eyes they were. I don't think students should be exspelled for not understanding the full context of a slogan and I think the college presidents understood that. A lot of students had no idea what river and what sea it was even referring too.

Another big thing I see is the right of return and a call for democratic state where both people live together I personally don't see how this doesn't end horribly for everyone involved if you snapped your fingers and made this a reality tomorrow. Even a structured right of return not overnight would end in escalation in hostility between both groups that would be a net negative for both people in my opinion. This is an amazing dream for well into the future but this is not a reality now. To give an example imagine if Pakistani, Indian and Bangladeshi people all returned to there homes from before partition and they were all one state do you think that goes well at all? I wish in perfect world it did but that's not the reality. I really don't think a lot of people protesting in the street realize the consequences that full right of return would have with tensions being so high.

My last point is some people portraying Israeli's as white and Palestinians as non white. I think most of the people in general would not be able to pick out who was Palestinian or Israeli in a line up. This I think comes from Americans ideas on race which don't really apply to this conflict and makes me think a lot of people saying this have never actually met a Palestinian or Israeli or even read up or watched anything longer then a Instagram story on it. 

Obviously I have a bit of bias towards Israel and I acknowledge that but I am wondering if I am way off base in my thinking?"

I would love my mind to be changed. 
I heard (didn’t fact check), that the average IQ has dropped 8 points in the last twenty years. Scary if true. My GF is a teacher and has said parents aren’t the same anymore. They don’t take responsibility for their kids. Kids in the education system receive basically zero discipline anymore, which she attributes as a big issue. Unless people start caring more and taking more responsibility for their lives, and their kids lives, focusing on education, what is good for their neighbor (golden rule) and society, we are going down a bad path. The education system needs to allow more discipline and consequences for students if they truly care about their future.

The world’s never been better overall from a famine, poverty, disease, war perspective, yet discontent and unhappiness is higher than ever! Horrible events still happen but most of the world now lives in peace. Why aren’t we more content? I believe it’s being humans have the desire not to be just doing well, but better than other humans. We need to move away from this to achieve happiness. I’m not saying to not be unhappy with the horrible things going on in the world. Do be. But we also need to have gratitude for how far we’ve come. 99% of human history has sucked. No healthcare. No grocery stores. Etc. these are modern marvels that our ancestors would fantasize for. The world’s missing gratitude in addition to gratefulness.

Religion I think did some good for society because it was a unified belief that everyone could get behind. I’m a pantheist / agnostic guy but I kinda get what neitzsche said when he spoke to “warning of the potential consequences of a society without a firm moral foundation. He feared that the loss of traditional religious values could lead to nihilism, a state where life is perceived as devoid of intrinsic meaning or value”. I don’t like organized religion though so I don’t know what would replace this.

Scholars like Jon Haidt (Virginia and NYU guy, a spiritual atheist), author of happiness hypothesis and many other great books have said we have a “god like hole” in our society today and I agree. We have an inner need for spirituality. Carl Jung founder of analytical psych argued this too. Check out his theories about the collective unconscious. If you take nothing else from this post take Carl Jung’s name and check out his philosophy / psychology. So the three things I think need to change are education, discipline, gratitude, and spirituality/filling of the godlike hole. 

This is all over the place post and a very stream of consciousness writing. I actually deleted some even more random talks about poverty being really bad but I shortened that part. If you want to make this post political stop. Don’t look at it through that lens but rather a humanist lens. This is bigger than politics. 

Just thought this would be a fun subreddit to shoot out these ideas. Challenge me on any of them. I like being challenge and am okay being told I’m way off the mark. My intentions are great my writing is just poor. Curious to know what you think. As a general aside remember to treat your fellow humans with compassion and dignity that way you’d wanted to be treated. Reddit is not the real world!  Take care of your mental health. I love you"

I know I said mostly a financial issue and then listed two other groups of people but I think those second and third groups are going to be pretty small. 

Regarding group #2: I don’t honestly think that there are many people out there who are obese and if presented an opportunity to no longer be obese with minimal effort would chose not to. Even if the person have a preference to not look obese there would likely be health benefits if an obese person lost a significant amount of weight. 

Group #3: As far as I know these medications are pretty well tolerated by the majority of people. I believe that what these medications act on, GLP-1 is something produced by the body naturally. Maybe i’m wrong but I don’t think this will be a big group.

Now onto group 1. This will be a large group. As it stands now it is easy to get drugs like Ozempic in my experience however it is also very expensive and out of reach for most people. I think the insurance coverage on these drugs is spotty right now too and just treating obesity isn’t generally covered. That may change in the future but I think it will still be considered an optional expense by most people and those not in a good financial situation probably won’t be buying these medication. 

So i’ve been thinking about it, and if there’s a drug out there that most people can take and it will make them lose a significant amount of weight and no longer be obese. I think eventually we’re going to find ourselves in a situation where if you see an obese person and you assumed they weren’t in a great financial situation there’s a high likelihood you would be correct. 

That seems like a strange situation to me… I don’t think I like it but I also think this is going to happen and i’d like my mind changed."

\- - -

Let me first explain what determinism implies:

So basically, the idea is that every action can only have one specific reaction which is entirely based on physical laws. The implication is that the entire future of our universe is already set in stone and that we therefore have no free will, only the illusion of it. Let me give you two good examples in order to further explain the concept:

\- - -

1) If you throw a dice, would you say the outcome is random? Or do we only perceive it as random because we, as humans, do not possess the motoric and mental capabilities to throw the desired number? Imagine if there was an entity with perfect motoric and mental skills. This entity could always throw the desired number because it would be able to consider all relevant factors with 100% accuracy, so things like properties of the dice and table (density, material, surface structure, weight), local atmospheric density, local gravitational constant, etc.

This basically implies that randomness does not exist, we only think it does because we are limited beings and lack the capabilities that I mentioned above.

2) Let's say you want to buy ice cream but you only have money for a single scoop. Another problem is that you like chocolate and vanilla just as much, but you have to decide between them. Let's assume you go for chocolate. 

Now, if I were to ask you why you went for chocolate instead of vanilla, given the fact that you like both just as much, what would you answer? Probably something like ""Oh, I just felt like it, I could've also bought vanilla instead."" But is this really the case?

Let's say we turn the universe back in time, to the moment where you are about to decide that you want to take chocolate instead of vanilla. Do you really think you would ever buy vanilla in this moment? Keep in mind that every single atom is at the exact same position as before, with the same properties, etc.

If we examine the situation on a physical level, there is no reason to assume that you would ever take vanilla instead here. Your consciousness is not located on a metaphysical level, it is basically a projection of your neuronal network, recognizing itself in the universe using its senses. Therefore, your consciousness has to abide by the same physical laws as everything that we know of.

If you followed me to this point, I think you know what the idea of a ""deterministic universe"" means. Again, I am not 100% convinced that this is really how our universe works, especially when considering quantum physics and things like quantum uncertainty.

However, the idea seems very appealing to me and I have no reason to think otherwise. When I first comprehended the concept, it scared me in a weird way. I thought ""Oh no, this means I have no free will and my entire future is already determined for me.""

However, I quickly found out about the idea of deterministic compatibilism. Basically, it says that, even though you might now have free will and the future is already determined, you are still acting based on your own preferences and choices (or atleast you have the illusion of it). So even if determinism is true, it has no real consequences for you. Your future may already be set in stone, but because you don't have the capabilities to predict it, you are left with the illusion of free will.

1,2023-12-28,CMV: The Church of England/Anglican Communion have been the sole possessors of a legitimate apostolic succession since 1533,u/JohnDavidsBooty,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18tbcah/cmv_the_church_of_englandanglican_communion_have/,changemyview,"1533 was when the diocesan bishop of Rome unilaterally broke communion with the Archbishop of Canturbury.  Apologists for the Romish apostasy often use the Act of Supremacy to claim that actually it was *England* that broke with *Rome* and not the other way around, but that did not happen until the next year (1534).  

Thus, the Canterburian church remains the only one that has never, at any point in its history, initially and unilaterally broke the communion of the universal church.  All others are schismatics.  In particular, the schismatic Papist claim to catholicity and apostolicity is based on bad history and an overly literalistic reading of a pun, and should not be taken seriously by anyone."

In my years of using drugs I had many excuses for it. To wind down, to explore myself, to have fun, because everyone else was doing it...etc. For the longest time I justified my drug use by telling myself it was not a problem. 

But what I was ignoring was how selfish it is. I could have given thousands of dollars to charity or saved it for my future self to retire with, but I smoked and drank it all up.

Recently I haven't been enjoying using and my conscience has been nagging me that drugs are bad. This seems like common sense, but I believed it was okay as long as I wasn't hurting anyone else. The problem is that I was hurting myself.

Please change my view so I can go back to enjoying drugs. As it stands, I'm really close to just quitting because I can't shake the feeling that drugs are in fact, bad."

1,2023-12-28,CMV: I’m not an incel but I don’t see how the black pill is incorrect,u/Similar_Charity9248,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18tcsui/cmv_im_not_an_incel_but_i_dont_see_how_the_black/,changemyview,"I’m not an incel anymore. I was in my late teens but I’m not anymore. I don’t harbor any hatred or resentment for women or chads. At most it’s jealousy/envy. I think I’m a mentally healthy and well adjusted. I just don’t see how the black pill is false.

So when I was an incel I understood the black pill in its simplest form to be this. “Romantic/sexual interaction is mostly determinined by the way you look, and some people are just inherently born lesser. As a result the people who are lesser will never enjoy the same success as chads do.” 

You can extend this further to lookism in society which I think is accurate as well. I don’t. See how either of those points are wrong.

In my experience in dating, the majority of it is based on looks. Women decide whether or not they want to date me or not before I open my mouth and preemptively reject me. That’s what I see in the majority of dating situations especially now when me and women my age are in our primes. 

There is not a realistic scenario where I could enjoy the same level of sexual success as a 6’3 chad. Women are sexual beings with sexual desire and because they have the position of choosing most women will choose the most attractive guy they can get.

That may change as those guys with tons of options fail in some aspects, but the first choice will always be the hottest. Men like me are never going to be first choices.

I don’t see how looks are meaningfully subjective. What I mean by this is tricky. The things I hear the most in regards to pointing out that a minority of men get the majority of attention from women is that “looks are subjective” and while that’s technically the case, it’s not random. What’s seen as physically attractive is concentrated at certain poles. There’s a reason why more women want to fuck Jenson Ackles than Danny Devito.

At the end of the day, we are monkeys in people clothes. We will practice breeding patterns like animals. Men like me will never be desired sexually in the same way men like say male models are. 

And that’s okay, but it is the black pill."

it seems to me like if:

* \- you have an enemy that you cannot possibly beat militarily
* \- and who CAN exterminate every last one of you but does not do that
* \- and gives you the ability to live as you choose within reason (don't bring up the measures they take when people commit acts of terrorism because preventing terrorism is totally justified)

then, you should just accept your lot in life and get on with it.

everything else is just being a **sore loser**. you've lost. you're beaten. in the game of nations and states, you're a loser.

you're weak. they're strong. you can't win. no matter how much you'd like to. some dreams don't come true. just embrace your loser status and suck it up and get a job and live your life. cuz SOMEBODY has to lose... right?

and hey, the playstation 5 is a thing.

isn't this a thing that our youth should understand?

in the world, there will always be the strong. there will always be the weak. and the weak are not intrinsically good. they're not even intrinsically better than the strong. because whether people are strong or weak, we're all just a bunch of cunts. right? no one's better than anyone else and given the chance, they'd certainly do the same. it's just that some win, some lose. boohoo tough.

1,2023-12-28,Cmv: I view indian migration very negatively.,u/Cookieman_2023,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18tdykb/cmv_i_view_indian_migration_very_negatively/,changemyview,"Where I am, I’ve witnessed the people around me get replaced by Indians. McDonald’s was my first job and 90% of the workforce are Indians. My current job has a majority Indian management and half of employees are also the same. Now this isn’t necessarily a bad thing in a racial perspective because I’ve been exposed to many races due to me living in a multicultural city. But what’s bad is they bring with them bad behavior from India. Here are the negative encounters with them

1. Nepotism and selfishness: the indian workers at McDonald’s were promoted immediately even if they didn’t do any better job than me or other employees of another race. I haven’t seen a single person outside of them get promoted even after 1 year of working there. 

2. My mom told me on how some of her coworkers complain about how the Indian workers budge in front of the line to use the washroom

3. While I was learning how to drive, a truck driver decided to stop on the center lane midway up the hill to get out and talk with whomever was in front of him instead of pulling over to the side. Randomly stopping in the center lane is rude and disrupts traffic.

4. When my debit card chip wasn’t working, it was impossible for me to ask the indian teller to get me a new one because he kept on arguing with me that the card is new and should not be replaced. Seriously, replacing a new card is not hard. All it takes is a couple of computer clicks from him. But he continued to control where this goes and not honor my request. I got so irritated that I almost raised my middle finger and said F you to him. Customer service is about trying to help you, not trying to make someone to get your way. When I went to a different branch, the Asian teller was there and she helped me immediately, confirming my claims that the chip is most likely broken

5. Most recently, I experienced gatekeeping from them when it comes to immigration. I want to immigrate to the US, but when I made a post, I received salty responses asking me, “why should we let you in” or telling me that “the country is full”, “Stay where you are.” It turns out that the very people who like to hate on immigrants are the very ones who immigrated there previously. I read a post saying that they like to burn the bridge after they cross them. I don’t know if it’s because they have to wait decades and I only have to wait a few years because of country of birth restrictions, but wanting to go in, then preventing others from doing the same is unacceptable. They also have the tendency to cheat the system such as spamming the H1b visa lottery with multiple fake jobs to increase the chances of getting selected while decreasing everyone else’s. The government is now cracking down on it, but it tells you how selfish this is.

6. They are deceptive in that there was a time when my dad sees a guy playing on his phone while he’s supposed to be working. Then, whenever the boss came, he acts like he’s working hard. He also told me that when a car accident occurred, there’s rumors that the Indian driver who was at fault tried to find false witnesses to act on his behalf to blame the other party. 

Now, the irony is I have gotten to know many Indians in my workplace and so far, they’ve been nice and haven’t been deceptive or anything, but that’s probably because they are young students/professionals like me and have not adopted the bad attitudes. Still, they seem to make up a large chunk of my negative experiences in everyday life. When I think of my coworkers, they’re great. But when I think of Indians in general, it’s just negativity. If they’re gonna immigrate, stop doing these kinds of things."

I’ve seen so many posts of their faces and these guys are not ugly at all and then I read what they post and it’s more of their frustration with communicating and that unwritten rule set up that men should approach women they’re interested in. The autism also explains the extreme sensitivity to rejection and not understanding social cues so it may make women uncomfortable because gender based violence is something women look out to avoid or it makes the woman feel offended or like they’re not interested. Then of course there’s the guys who feel like they deserve a super model while not being on that level themselves and feel like they’re too good to date another autistic. I feel like if more of them got help for understanding and managing their autism were open to dating autistic women the community would evaporate.

It facilitates international trade, the internet, the global spread of knowledge, is the language of so many movies and shows and music (even in subtitles for foreign shows). English is the second language to learn. I believe that all countries that can, should make English lessons absolutely required throughout elementary, middle, and high school that way students can know this crucial language alongside the native language of their country. Not knowing English and only knowing your native language limits one to so much in life, especially outside of their country. If one only speaks Spanish, or Mandarin, or Japanese, or French, etc. no matter how much knowledge they have there will always be a challenge in them communicating it to the outside world. Not to mention difficult in understanding so much global media like movies and shows. I think strong English classes should be considered a 21st century human rights amongst countries which are considered developing and developed."

95% with intelligence and bombs put together, targeting non-uniformed combatants?  That is outstanding!  Why are western leaders saying that the bombings have been indiscriminate?

But just pulling someone over for going 10 over safely, not giving a concern because you know it’s not dangerous, and going on with your day is simply just a cash grab, let’s all admit it. There’s a difference doing 170 vs 70 in a 55.

Whilst the economy has been picking itself up from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, cost of living has still increased and is continuously increasing. 

Housing prices are pretty ridiculous, and it’s not a surprise where a lot of younger people still live with their parents even until their 20’s because they simply don’t have the means to afford or pay for high rental prices either. 

[Gen Z does not agree $74K is middle class](https://www.newsweek.com/gen-z-middle-class-salary-difference-money-views-1854720)

Now if we go to social media, interactions with people after covid, political ideologies and dating / ‘gender wars’, this will show how bad the direction of the world is heading in. 

In this day and age, it seems like people have completely forgotten the concept of nuance. And not just nuance, hypocrisy is present too. 

For example: People who complain about billionaires or just super rich people in general are hypocrites, because most of the time if you gave that person THAT position of power and wealth, they’d be completely fine with it and be happy because they’d be living a much better lifestyle. 

The two extreme ends of the political spectrum are at each others necks. The far left believes that if you don’t agree with anything you say with them, you’re conservative, and conservatives believe that if you don’t agree with them you’re trying to taking away their ‘basic rights’ (freedom of speech, keeping arms, etc.) 

If we head to dating or ‘gender wars’, there are a few groups that all just seem ridiculous. 

- Extreme feminists who think men are born evil. 

- People calling men Incels when they *point out their dating struggles online*

- Actual Incels, pickup artists, and various colored pill online spheres. 

And not to mention the various contradictory shit regarding dating. Like whether it’s OK for men to even approach women OR how men shouldn’t be approaching women at all even in social settings otherwise they’d be labelled as creeps. 

Dating apps being a complete fuck show where the companies clearly are scummy and don’t actually want people to date, women getting tons of matches versus men getting significantly less. 

Gen Z are also having way less sex compared to previous generations, you’re seeing more young people voice out how they have never  dated before or are struggling. 

And again back to politics is where you’d get labeled as *insert whatever* if you don’t agree with what the other person is saying, OR how you’re being a bad person for engaging with McDonald’s because of the ongoing war in Israel/Palestine.

All of this poses significant challenges to younger generations because we’re starting to isolate ourselves in every way possible, and it mostly has to do with social media, political belief’s and current social norms.

Remember you choose to give them your kidney . As soon as that kidney is take from you it's no longer your kidney anymore I know some would like to think that it still is but you cant decide two month later that you want it back and they should get it over .You can only hope the friend takes care of it but thats not guaranteed and also its not a guaranteed that they will always be your friend and  cant break the friendship off . You need to understand that you can't control what the person does with the kidney and you can only guide them to a healthier lifestyle and it's not illegal or a law to not go into healthy life style .

I understand some people would be more grateful then others that why you need to think it through before giving a kidney away. having expectations for the person can just back fire in your face .


Also if something, most likely a partner saves you and they end up handicapped from trying to protect you , you don't owe them anything I know the good thing to do is to help them out and take care of their needs but living in the state that I am forever in debt to them and I could never live & do anything without their permission is wild to me and i understand they saved you and that such a beautiful and blessed thing to do, doing what ever they say and when you tell them no I don't want to their come back is' you wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for me' is disgusting.And you can't break up with them because you owe them your life ,that insane 

I've never experienced either of theses situations but I just hate that people can't live their life's without the person that helped them's approve it feel manipulate.

It's a head-shaker that invites a closer look at the jarring disparity between their virtual grandstanding and their pitiful reluctance to engage in any meaningful civic participation – a peculiar mix of environmental bravado and a glaring refusal to take real action at the ballot.

The roots of my stance can be traced back to a frustration bordering on exasperation. There's a deep-seated belief that meaningful change can be driven through democratic processes, and the willful ignorance or sheer laziness towards this basic civic duty is nothing short of infuriating.

In my personal encounters, the hypocrisy of individuals embodying this behavior has only solidified my skepticism. The stark contrast between their impassioned discussions on climate issues and their glaring reluctance to fulfill the most basic democratic duty raises valid doubts about the sincerity of their commitment to environmental causes. This isn't just a disdain for online activism; it's a genuine disgust at the canyon-sized gap between digital virtue signaling and real-world actions that could actually influence policy.

Digging into the dynamics of my viewpoint reveals a fundamental belief in voting as a non-negotiable expression of civic responsibility. The chasm between their vocal concerns for climate issues and their blatant abstention from a straightforward democratic duty points to a larger societal problem. It forces us to question the actual impact of their online noise in driving any tangible change in environmental policy.

Understanding my perspective means facing the harsh truth – the need for coherence between words and deeds. The frustration laid out in the original quote isn't just a call for a reality check; it's a demand for those who love to grandstand online about climate change to put up or shut up. It's a blunt plea for these armchair activists to step away from their keyboards and engage in the most basic civic duty: voting.

As for a potential shift in my viewpoint, sure, I'm open to it. But it's going to take more than just arguments or evidence challenging the efficacy of voting. It would demand a brutal reevaluation of the role and effectiveness of voting in shaping societal responses to environmental challenges. Until then, the frustration lingers, fueled by the persistent gap between big talk online and the glaring inaction at the ballot box."

I've been pondering a linguistic shift and wanted to get your thoughts. What if we replaced pronouns with names in our everyday speech? Instead of ""he/she/they,"" we'd simply use the person's name or chosen nickname. My thinking is that this could reduce complexities in remembering pronouns and might foster a more inclusive environment. Plus, names are already a key part of introductions!  
This approach could streamline communication (especially in English), respect privacy (using chosen names or nicknames), and potentially be easier for AI and technology to adapt to. I acknowledge there's a learning curve and cultural adaptations to consider.  
What do you think are the pros, cons, and feasibility of this idea? Could this be a viable way to address issues around pronoun use and gender identity, or am I oversimplifying a complex issue?  
Excited to read your insights and experiences!

They’re wasting time on their phone accomplishing nothing other than increasing their jealousy and anxiety while they can be spending that time being productive. All independence and privacy has gone out the window to oversharing and following meaningless trends. 

TikTok is the worst iteration of this. The algorithm is specifically made to influence young people’s worldview. From the moment you create an account you’re bombarded with dangerous messaging. Gen Z is completely addicted to this, and the platform is now where the youngest generation is receiving their news. Why does China have a different version of TikTok? It’s almost like they know it’s poison, so they don’t want to give it to their youth, but are happy to give it to western youth. There are obviously also concerns about the Chinese government using this app to steal personal information from its users.

Is there actually a positive argument to be made for social media? How can anyone think spending time on your phone and watching what people (most of whom you don’t know) are up to is anything other than idiotic?"
365,2023-12-29,CMV: Disney Plus will go down as the worst financial decision Disney has ever made.,u/GoSouthCourt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18tm874/cmv_disney_plus_will_go_down_as_the_worst/,changemyview,"In 2019, Disney released a bunch of movies that all did really well in the Box Office, including Avengers Endgame, Frozen 2, Star Wars 9,  Toy Story 4. The 8 highest grossing films in the US/Canada that year were all Disney films. That was done intentionally to bring people's attention to Disney Plus, their new streaming platform. As it grew quarter to quarter, this product did really well over the pandemic. There wasn't much box office revenue either so this streaming platform became an important lifeline for Disney.

Unfortunately, the content Disney was releasing just wasn't good, probably due to a more significant budget constraint. People got tired and exhausted with Disney content, even in their flagship like Marvel. This resulted in 2023, the year of the flops. Disney can only claim financial success in 2 films this year, Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and The Little Mermaid. Everything else was a flop. It wouldn't be a surprise if Disney reports a net loss of $1 billion at the box office this year. Their audience is conditioned to watch Disney content on their platform, and worse yet, conditioned to think that all Disney content is bad, in cinemas or not. It's also this year that their subscriber numbers have plateaued, in combination with an announcement to release ad-tier subscriptions and cut content. 

Disney Plus is an investment that not only provides minimal financial returns, but also kneecaps another significant source of revenue."

Most people I know who attend therapy (including myself) talk about themselves, what's on their mind, and their issues while the therapist just listens. Occasionally the therapist might chime in with some obvious advice, a statement of validation, or tips on basic emotional regulation, but in general a therapist isn't providing any kind of specialized ""treatment,"" they're just listening to you work your own problems out and providing a space in which to do so. 

When I say family and friends are ""meant to fulfil"" this purpose, I mean:

* they have historically filled this purpose 
* our social practices and attitudes have developed with them fulfilling this purpose
* our brain has developed with the assumption that people we have social relationships with are fulfilling this purpose
* using them for this purpose is healthier, easier, and better than using therapists

Don't get me wrong, I think speaking about your problems and feeling like you're being heard and understood is very important for people, and it can help support their mental health. But that's something that healthy social relationships can and should provide. It seems like our society is basically trying to outsource normal emotional labor and social responsibilities to paid professionals. 

While there are definitely some people that could benefit from intensive or specialized therapy, I think the average person in therapy would benefit much more from developing a healthy social network than from talking to a stranger on zoom for 45 minutes each week. What's more, the general functioning of our society would be a lot better if we could redevelop healthier, non-transactional social relationships and reduce the number of impersonal, transactional relationships (that's sort of another CMV but still related).

So could someone who holds any value set for any religion. I could say that I have Judeo-Christian values and that I exclude the literal belief in God. Now, that, of course, wouldn't make sense and would be heretical. 

Im sure 1000s of years ago, it was similar to tribalism, when we used rudimentary ways to honor the dead. We still adhered to some form of blind faith and fear. Maybe that was fear of death or fear of God.

It seems to be that in every instance of civilization, you see some baseline adherence to order, and to believe in order, which is opposed to chaos, you need to, in some ways, have faith that this order will increase your chances of survival. Im sure evolution supports many of these concepts.

We make laws, rules, and guidelines that, at any moment, could be broken. Yet it seems to be at large since the beginning of time; the majority has oriented towards faith as the marker and inevitable motivator. 

Most arts, formal education, and entertainment are founded on these concepts. Language, and even these words I type, are rooted in faith and some adherence to order. 

So, I'm not talking about worship or deep contemplation. I'm simply stating that no one can genuinely abandon the foundation in which the moral derivatives are so tightly tied to faith and religion, which seem to be the bedrock of how civilizations formed and sustained their immaterial nature.

I'd like to know if there is an opposing view that provides an example of this not being something every civilization will inevitably adopt."

>Poe's law is based on a comment written by Nathan Poe in 2005 on christianforums.com, an Internet forum on Christianity. The message was posted during a debate on creationism, where a previous poster had remarked to another user: ""Good thing you included the winky. Otherwise people might think you are serious""



In practice, I feel that this concept promotes the idea that we should interpret all internet comments as being serious. I feel, this is foolish. In my view, the right thing to do is actually the reverse of Poe's law: All comments should be taken as a joke, unless the statement is actually thought provoking in an intellectually valid way.

Why do I feel this way? The internet for all it's existence, for MOST people, has MOSTLY been for entertainment. We look at cats, porn, memes, etc. Satire is a major form of entertainment. If you default your mind to always thinking people are joking, you will find the internet much kinder and funnier and more enjoyable. You will realize much of the hate you have is misplaced.

""But what if that guy is serious!?""

""He's not!""

Okay, maybe he is, but then he's so dumb that his opinion is irrelevant. Either way, if someone says some batshit thing and they mean it, the best response is still to laugh at them.

So yea, the default way to read a comment should be to interpret it as sarcasm/satire/joking, unless the comment is actually saying something that you deem as smart, then it is probably serious. 


It makes you a happier person, and it actually fights insane people more effectively, or you can CMV!

Leftists support Russia because they unironically believe that Russia will only stop at conquering Ukraine and that having the world giving in to Russia's demand is better than angering Russia and forcing it to nuke the world. Leftists are too braindead to comprehend the fact that by giving in to Russia's demand, the world will be essentially giving Russia positive feedback, indirectly telling Russia ""Hey if you threaten the world with nuclear annihilation, we will give you everything you want regardless of whether you can actually nuke the world or not"". Russia will simply repeat the ""nuclear threat"" trick to force the world into allowing it to annex even more countries such as Poland, Lithuania, Georgia, etc. Also, leftists are genuinely delusional enough to believe that Putin is fighting on behalf of racial minority rights because their political belief can be summarized as ""terminally anti-American at all cost"" (Leftists believe America is ruled by irredeemably evil white men and since Russia is invading Ukraine against American interest, Putin must be anti-White-men and pro-racial-minorities).

Right-wingers support Russia because they believe might makes right. Right-wingers' support is much easier to explain because their brains are as evolutionally primitive as animal brains. Just like any wild animals, when right-wingers see a country with huge territory or large arsenals i.e. Russia, they will instinctively regress into submissive cuckold mode and start licking the country's inbred cock like a slave. Right wingers believe that if your country has very large territory and possesses huge cache of weapons (especially nuclear weapons) like Russia, then your country has the moral right to conquer as many country as you please. Right-wingers have this delusional belief that Putin will accept them as a member of the ""masculine Slavic Ubermensch"" if they continue propagating Russian's ethnic destiny to conquer their Untermensch neighbors.

Given that most of the Western worlds use Twitter, opinions on Twitter accurately reflect the opinions of most westerners. On Twitter, western leftists and right-wingers are either:

1. Spreading pro-Russia talking points to justify Russia's invasion of Ukraine
2. Repeatedly demanding Ukraine to stop fighting or surrendering regardless of Ukraine's capability to continue fighting and pushing for peace talk under the pretext of pacifism (In reality, they are closeted pro-Russia shills and are 100% aware that any peace talk WILL inevitably end in Russia's favor).
3. Drawing fanarts thay cynically depict Russia as cute anime girls in military uniforms with inexcusably disgusting title such as ""Russia-chan sterilizing the Hohol gene pool"".

The hedonistic, privileged parasites that populate most of the Western world don't give a shit about Ukrainian's right to exist. They believe Ukrainians deserve to be extinct either because Ukrainians' existences are objectively unimportant compared to the planet for the misanthropic leftists, or Ukrainians is a race of Untermensch that is destined to be conquered by the Ubermensch Russians for the power-fearing right wingers. 

If your country is not part of the western world, your country have the moral obligation to develop and procure as many nuclear weapons as possible to deter invasion from any superpower, be it Russia, US, China, or any other countries you may consider as superpower. Fuck any international laws that prohibit possession of nuclear weapons.

If any superpower threatens to conquer your country, and you can make the choice between surrendering to the superpower or maximize the chance of permanently wiping out the superpower with nuclear retaliation unless the superpower back off, you have the moral obligation to choose the latter regardless of the survival of your own country. If your only option left is to blanket the entire world in eternal nuclear hellfire to defeat the superpower, so be it. Drag your enemy along with you on the journey to hell is always preferable to letting your enemy get what they want. If your country cannot match the superpower in terms of strategic prowess, then you should outperform the superpower in terms of resolution, savager, and brutality.

Leftists and right wingers will never be your ally. You can only rely on yourself to guarantee the survival of your own country.

Tl;dr: Please buy as many nuclear weapons as possible."

For context, some guy I know, who has often identified as a ""feminist"" had been spouting some weird anti feminist shit as of late. Such as ""women shouldn't be scared to walk alone at night because guys are also afraid too"", and ""objectification is okay as long as everyone's cool with it"". I've called him out on it twice because that's such loser behavior to think those things. But I drew a line when he criticized women who were against porn. Like I'm talking he was furious and he was saying it was supporting prude culture that women were against ""something natural"".

Again, called out. And then, after a while he stops calling himself a feminist and switches to ""egalitarian"". I know what it means. It's essentially someone who seeks equality between women and men and all of that, and there's nothing wrong with that OBJECTIVELY speaking. 

But there's everything wrong with it when you consider what feminisms definition is. Feminism isn't about a pure matriarchal world where women are worshipped and they can do no wrong or whatever we're accused of. Feminism is literally about the crusade for women's rights and equality to men. It is literally about dismantling the patriarchy. So for an ""egalitarian"" to come out and proclaim who they are, it makes me side eye them. Why are you against calling yourself a feminist so bad? Feminism is literally calling for egalitarian societies, so to refuse to call yourself one is a sign of misogyny. 

Put it this way. If you literally are crusading for equal rights, and you want oppressive rules to go down, don't call yourself an egalitarian. Call yourself a feminist and be done with it. Don't be scared. Don't scream and shout and be mad. Come out and call yourself what you are, which is a feminist.

1,2023-12-30,CMV: Modern Western Liberal Democracies more closely resemble basic Germanic tribal politics than Greek democracies or Roman republics.,u/SannySen,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ufwwt/cmv_modern_western_liberal_democracies_more/,changemyview,"There is a popular conception that we achieved political perfection with the Greek democracies or Roman republics and all of subsequent history can be understood as a striving to return to these ideals. Indeed, the founding fathers all had copies of Greek and Roman works in their libraries, and they all openly wrote how they were influenced and inspired by these works.

However, the key element common to Greek and Roman life and largely absent from Western Liberal Democratic life is an overwhelming sense of civic duty. A Greek political life was a public life, not a private life. The emphasis wasn't on your right to participate in civic life, it was on your duty to do so.  

In contrast, the basic Germanic tribal unit was usually a community organized around a single, well-respected leader. For any major decisions, he would consult the elders, canvas the collective to assess their views, and then make a decision taking all these inputs into account. This combination of hierarchy and voice much more closely resembles the social ordering of Western Liberal Democracies, and I think they can best be understood as a formalization of basic Germanic tribal politics.

Moreover, and I think this is they key point, the emphasis in most Western Liberal Democratic societies is on individual rights, not duties, and this is more in line with how a tribal collective operates. The leader is respected and valued if he or she doesn't exercise his or her power arbitrarily. Beyond this, each individual is free to pursue his or her own interests within the confines of the sub-hierarchy or cultural mores of the society. This latter description more closely resembles a ""Liberal"" (in the classical sense or the term) ideal, where individuals are free to pursue their own interests without arbitrary interference from the government.

We generally view Greek and Roman life as morally and intellectually superior to Germanic tribal life (they were ""barbarians"" who sacked Rome and brought on the dark ages), so we like to think this is where our most cherished political traditions take their roots. But I think the genius of Western Liberal Democracy is that it is a repackaging of basic Germanic tribal politics in a format that is respectable to academics and the masses alike. This is not to say there are no elements in common with Greek or Roman democracies: for example, I will grant that the separation of powers between the executive branch and the legislature is a Roman contribution. But even this I think can be understood as a formalization of the ""advice and consent"" tribal leaders were expected to receive from elders of the collective. The other elements of Western Liberal Democracy that we tend to attribute to Greek and Roman life, such as ballot boxes and debates, are largely superficial and I don't believe they undermine the thesis that our society more closely resembles Germanic tribal politics at a grand scale than Greek or Roman civic life."

What I have always hated about “Educating Rita” is the way it portrays uneducated people. It presents anyone who has never been to university as being boring, ignorant, uncultured, and unable to hold intelligent, informed conversations.
In one scene, Susan/Rita says that there are particular television shows that only educated people would understand. In another scene, she says that, as an uneducated person, she would come across as ridiculous trying to participate in a dinner party conversation with educated people.
Overall, the play and movie present people who have not been to university as living in a bubble of ignorance and that none of them are well-read."
1,2023-12-30,cmv: The Elliot Rodger murders should be a study into mental health rather than a study of misogyny,u/Similar_Charity9248,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ufz4a/cmv_the_elliot_rodger_murders_should_be_a_study/,changemyview,"I’m not going to defend incel mass killers here. I’m just going to talk about how I personally view what happened.

So first, in the year 2023, it’s an uncomfortable fact that a high percentage of men in Rodger’s age range are in eerily similar position. I myself am the exact same age as Rodger. It is also a fact that the same misogynistic tropes and beliefs that Rodger’s held isn’t uncommon. Hell I would venture to say that the majority of men in some ways feel like they’re “entitled” to sex. (Not in a “women owe me sex way” but in an “why am I not having sex or dating, I have xyz qualities”) even attractive men who are sexually active frequently feel entitlement that goes unchecked because women do in fact hookup with them.

So I say this to make this point, if the big issues here are misogyny and entitlement in men who are not attractive enough to justify said entitlement, then why isn’t this such a regular thing? I mean Elliot Rodger did his thing in 2014. Since then there have only been 10 similar mass killings. Now I’m an American, so to me 10 mass killings in almost 10 years is a very small number. I mean there’s been 600+ mass shootings in the US since January. Not even one of those being misogynistic terror in the vein of Elliot Rodger kinda says that not much is happening.

What’s unique about Rodger isn’t the sexlessness or his views on women, but how mentally disturbed he was and how it went untreated. He clearly had some type of undiagnosed personality disorder. He had impulse control issues. He had a predisposition to violent acts. It just so happened that women were the targets. 

I mean if I’m using myself as an example, me and him are almost the same. Hell I even have a hot younger brother who’s everything I wish I could be. The thing is I’ve learned to cope with being inferior and used that to let go of any feelings of entitlement or desire for sexual success. I made it through college never even getting a date and that’s just how it is for lesser males. And it was easy for me to not hurt anyone because I didn’t have a personality disorder (that made me predisposed to violence. 

People like Elliot can’t cope with being inferior so they take it out on whoever the feel wronged them in Elliot’s case it was women and god looking men. So I think instead of looking at what happened and saying “well this was because he was an entitled virgin” we should look at it and ask what we can do to ensure lesser males have the skills to cope with their position and move through life contently."
1,2023-12-30,CMV: Critic Reviews Are Meaningless,u/Libertarian_Values,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ugavf/cmv_critic_reviews_are_meaningless/,changemyview,"I had this thought after watching ""Hello, Dolly!"" (1969) and visiting rotten tomatoes to see what the consensus is on it. Like most things on rotten tomatoes, the audience score was high, and the critic score was low. 

The movie first of all isn't masterpiece of storytelling by any means, but some of the things the critics said were out of pocket. Some of them have really sour-toned reviews about random aspects of the film that wouldn't bother the everyday viewer, like how much of the movie relies on Barbra Streisand's voice, presence, acting, etc. I really don't feel like that was a negative aspect to the film at all, she's the star of it for goodness sake. Another one was comparing it's plot to the Sousnd of Music, which is just a very different movie so I don't feel it's a justifiable comparison.

All of the critic reviews, even the positive ones, felt less insightful than the audience reviews. This isn't just for Hello Dolly though that has been my example, I've seen it earlier this year when the Super Mario bros movie came out. Right away, the critics gave it terrible reviews two days after it was released. Once again, a movie that was not terrible by any means being sneered by critics.

If you're being paid to watch movies with a critical eye, of course you're gonna see the negative aspects. I never find any value in critic reviews. When I see an honest review by a non critic, it tells me so much more about the content I'm about to consume (or would like to know the consensus on).


I'm of course willing to change this opinion, but I just can't see the real benefit of these critic reviews as it stands. They're usually short little sour-toned sentences that give little to no insight on whatever media they're criticizing. Thoughts?"

We live an absurd and meaningless existence. Feeling desired is simply a recognition of your value as a person. I’m not saying everyone deserves it, but not a lot of otherwise good people suffer without it

Do some people crawl out of the depths to eventually meet societal standards to meet a partner? Sure. But it’s getting harder and harder everyday for everyone both men and women alike. Things like dating apps isolate people and make them socially retarded to the point where they forgot how to communicate with people after 2020.

I chose not to censor the language partly because despite every other major subreddit that I'm aware of doing so, the mods here do not censor language, something that I view favorably. I also had used these words on this subreddit prior in a similar context (speaking about censorship) in a comment that was well-received. I truly was not expecting the initial reaction I received and I was not trying to offend anybody.

After a conversation with the mods, it would seem the best course of action is to separate my two topics of conversation entirely. I'm still choosing not to censor the language. If my language offends you or makes you uncomfortable, that is indicative of exactly what I am speaking about. I'm essentially asking you to ask yourself why exactly that would be the case and ultimately, the deltas available will revolve around you explaining to me why the emotional reaction you're experiencing is correct.

The last time I posted this, it turned into a bit of a shitshow immediately. While I'm not one to phone the internet police, the mods here are pretty anal about keeping their threads clean so please keep Rule 1 (top-level comments must challenge my view) and Rule 2 (don't be a dick) in mind in your responses.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18qm68p/cmv_nigger_is_a_bad_word/) is a link to the previous thread. There are several replies of mine that can give you a decent idea of where my head's at and you can even bring quotes of mine from that thread in here to use in your replies if you like.

*

I have been alive to witness at least a bit of the evolution of the word faggot. When I was growing up, it was essentially used synonymously with asshole or douchebag. I remember vividly an interview Eminem gave about the Marshall Mathers LP (2000) when I was 13 in which he said ""When I say 'you faggots keep egging me on' I don't mean 'you gay people keep egging me on'"" and I remember thinking 'I can't believe he just had to explain that.'
 
Now faggot is just as derogatory as nigger and it would seem retard is fast approaching if not there already. There was also backlash against both [Lizzo and Beyonce (and Weird Al!)](https://slate.com/culture/2022/08/beyonce-renaissance-lizzo-spaz-ableist-slur-lyrics-history.html) in recent memory for using the word spaz.

Even this website has evolved. When I first arrived (2013), both faggot and retard were commonly used in various memes, and while I can't remember ever coming across nigger (worth noting that it may have been auto-removed by most subreddits since the site's inception though I can't know that) I do recall people casually throwing around nigga now and then. Now this subreddit itself is the only major subreddit I'm aware of that does not censor language and have all posts that contain any of these words removed automatically.
 
The N-word has been the N-word since I've been alive. I was not present to witness its evolution but I would have to imagine it went through something similar. I never questioned it because for me it had always been part of my established reality. But having now witnessed this evolution happen myself a couple times along with the threat of it continuing to happen more, it does give me cause to question if words evolving to have so much power over us that they're unacceptable in any context and being essentially forcibly removed from our vernacular is the correct direction. Something about it gives me '1984' vibes."
35,2023-12-30,CMV: Standardized tests for PhD admissions are a good thing.,u/Curious-Magazine-254,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18uigx1/cmv_standardized_tests_for_phd_admissions_are_a/,changemyview,"Copied from another thread in r/academia which was downvoted to the point of invisibility before any discussion could begin. 

Note: for this argument I am talking about the GRE, but it could refer to any standardized exam (see point #4). The point is to have a standardized exam, not to speak in favor of any specific type of exam. 
 
So, let's just jump right in with some of the common arguments I've seen against the GRE: 

**1. There are loads of studies documenting inequities in GRE scores! Way more than studies for other metrics.**

This is because it is *significantly easier to measure*. The GRE is a single quantitative measurement taken under identical conditions for all students. That makes it much easier to study than other candidate metrics like GPA, LORs, etc. Just because there are more studies about the GRE than there are studies about similar metrics does not mean it is significantly worse.** 


**2. The test is discriminatory because it is expensive, as are the associated study materials.**

With a fee waiver, the test is $100. To put that in perspective, that is approximately 0.003% of $37,000, which is the average debt held by an undergraduate. To put it even more in perspective, if you set aside 1 quarter (25 cents) every day of your 4-year undergraduate degree, you can afford to take the GRE nearly 4 times.


**3. The test is discriminatory because only privileged students have the time and resources to study for it.**

The same can be said for any aspect of the application. To say that poor students can't afford time to study for this exam because they are too busy working is insane when we expect students to do things like unpaid outreach work, unpaid lab work, or poorly paid internships. Assuming a student volunteers just 5 hours a week in someone's lab for one semester, that's equivalent to $435 in lost wages (minimum wage of $7.25/hr), or x2 standard Princeton Review subscriptions.

**4. The test is stupid.**

Agreed. But the answer to this is to make a *better, more affordable test*, not to get rid of standardized testing entirely.


In my opinion, there are several advantages to standardized testing as a whole: 

**1. It is an equal opportunity provided to all students across the country**, whereas things like graduate courses, research internships, LORs from leading researchers, or prestigious universities are not.


**2. It is an exam that can be repeated for ""full credit"".** Whereas a bad semester can permanently sink your GPA, a bad GRE exam can just be retaken.


**3. Standardized assessments are a hallmark of professions like medicine and engineering because they work.** They are a bulwark against privileged students buying their way into a profession, as well as a way for a centralized committee to ensure that the next batch of professionals all have the same or similar knowledge-bases.


This is my perspective on it. I know I am in the minority though, so I am interested in hearing the opposing viewpoints-- even those that I already refuted above, if perhaps I've mischaracterized the argument or there is more evidence I haven't considered."

This would have to mean that these men are shared among multiple women, either serially through one-night stands or short-lasting relationships, or simultaneously through cheating, friends with benefits, or polyamory. However, those arrangements are not traditionally what women want. While women's attitudes have changed somewhat, I think most women still aspire to a long-term monogamous relationship at some point in their lives.

Possibilities:

1. Actually, women do prefer casual sex with more attractive partners

I think this is true to an extent. If a woman is not ready to settle down yet, she might pursue this path for part of her life.

2. Women are mistaken or deceived into believing they have the prospect of a long-term relationship with men in high demand on dating apps

I'm sure it happens, but I give women enough credit that they'll eventually learn their lesson that the kind of guy with dozens of matches often doesn't deactivate his account when they start dating.

3. Their minimum standard is the top matches.

I don't think so. Women are generally capable of emotion-driven attraction.

4. They are looking for a long-term relationship, but men are not.

5. They give it a go at a long-term relationship with an average man, but the relationship does not satisfy their expectations. They return to casual dating or give up and remain single.

6. They successfully find a mutually fulfilling relationship with an average guy.

1 and 2 are temporary conditions. Average guys might have to accept that their dating options are limited within the 20-something age bracket, though. 3 is only true for a small fraction of the straight female dating pool, I think. 4 and 5 are within men's power to bend toward 6 by leveling up their relationship skills.

Maybe try this pickup line at a NYE party: ""I haven't had a date in a year, so if you kiss me tonight, I'm pretty much a sure thing for Valentine's Day, Christmas, and NYE 2025.""

How you can change my view

- There is actually a shortage of women in the heterosexual dating market, with many women choosing women or celibacy.

They should create legal and moral obligations for people to adhere to, in order to protect the wildlife on scene prior to breaking ground.",u/JollyMcStink,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18uk9zm/cmv_any_new_construction_should_need_to_have/,changemyview,"I get that some habitats are protected, such as wetlands. So on some level this is already done. But not efficiently, and some species are unprotected. We are running out of wild land!

Anyway, in my opinion, there should be a primary obligation to preserve wildlife if someone is paying to demolish nature for their own personal use - whether it be to open a business to make money, or to build their own personal home/ claim land which was previously wild. 

(Likewise - I think there should be massive tax breaks to take already developed/ unused commercial development and demolish for new - particularly in low income city areas where old homes and businesses just fall down and apart, taking jobs with them when they close!)

I think wildlife specialists - all kinds, I'm being broad because in different parts of the country/ world in general there are different risks, protected species, and laws already in place - should have to be paid to come survey the entire ploy of land and locate any and all wildlife within the plot. Every tree that is cut down should have to be replaced x 2. Every animal family should be either protected where they nest, or paid to be relocated to a safe protected place where they should be able to survive. All on the dime of the person/entity building. 

There should be an extra tax on any and all emissions and toxic materials used during construction for polluting what was pristine, untouched land before. If you want to build your house by hand then technically you would be exempt, from not using bulldozers, diesel cranes, etc.

The builders should also be expected to restore a large percentage, say a minimum of 75% of ""green"" areas aka plant growth within 1 year of breaking ground. Meaning parking lots should have plenty of tree island barriers to park near, grass needs to be replanted, bushes. 75% restored but whatever the % was prior to building of thar 75%. Let's say 15% grass, 35% brush, 50% tree cover. 1 year after building there needs to be trees planted to replace the 50%, bushes for the 35% brush and grass 15% on 75% of the land.

It would stop companies from man-spreading all over a plot of land in concrete and encourage people who hoard acres and acres of land for themselves to keep it wild when building new. 

No more demolishing forests for carbon copy modular housing developments on sprawling plots of grass with no trees.

No more ugly stroads.

I agree there is room for improvement in my idea/ opinion, so posting here hoping someone else has insight on the topic and can change my view!"
5,2023-12-30,CMV: People Being Investigated Should Only Receive Force That Is Needed For The Investigation,u/Ethical-Unlawfulness,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ukhz1/cmv_people_being_investigated_should_only_receive/,changemyview,"Consequences that are proportionate to the severity are fair and that means force that is needed to arrive at that proportionate outcome is also fair. The opposite is true also, force that isn't needed to reach a proportionate result is disproportionately more severe (unfair).

Sometimes you need to come to the truth to arrive at a fitting outcome, and that means things needed to investigate in order to reach a proportionate consequence is fair. Taking you to the trial, dealing with **imminent** threats, a spit/DNA sample, are all examples of things (under force) that might be needed to come to the truth in order to reach a fair outcome.

The issue is when you are given force that is not needed to reach a fair outcome and that should not be allowed. Some examples are pointing a gun at someone, forcefully separating, forcing one to lay on the ground, cuffing hands, when it is **not** needed to be able to go through the investigation. Sometimes you need to do those things like cuffing someone to be able to deal with imminent threats in order to investigate to reach a fair outcome, that is a **proportionate** use of force.

A very common point brought up is using force for a *perceived future threat* as opposed to an imminent one. You don't need to use force purely for a perceived future threat to be able to reach a fair outcome, but you do need to use force for imminent threats to reach a fair result. Trying methods with less force, while being able to reach a fair outcome (investigating), is the way to avoid unneeded and disproportionate force.

So would consider myself to be pro choice when it comes to abortion rights which is a position that needs not much of an explanation. I do see a lot of people talk about giving men the right to “financially abort” their child in an attempt to even the playing field when it comes to reproductive rights. I think this is not a good idea. I think that it is not realistic to strive for equality in this situation.

Firstly the outcomes are different. I’m not going to get into the weeds if when a baby becomes alive or whatever. Frankly I don’t really care. I’ll just be honest. If a woman decides to get an abortion while her partner doesn’t want her to. The woman still reserves the right to get an abortion or not because it is wrong to force the woman to carry a pregnancy she does not want to because the man who knocked her up said so. The it works reversed as well, it’s wrong to force a woman to get an abortion.

Now let’s look at the other side which people are worried about. A man wants to not have a kid, but the woman doesn’t want to get an abortion. I think we can all agree it’s barbaric for a man to be able to force a woman to get an abortion. So she doesn’t get an abortion. Now things change. There is a child. The child has to eat, has to wear clothes, and be taken care by the parents.

It been observed that it is best for a child to have two active parents for financial and time reasons. Removing the other financial stream impacts the child above all else. That’s bad. And because there is now a child present the parents have to take some form of responsibilty, whether they want to or not (for both parents).

So now you can say this is unfair, however I think that given the nature of how child bearing works, it’s not possible for there to be equal rights because there isn’t an equal distribution and an equal end result when someone is pregnant without either making it so that women are forced to physically carry a baby she doesn’t want to carry, or robbing a child of much needed fincancial support."

Additionally, I don't mean to offend anyone.

Now I'm not saying that the traits ""autistic"" people have don't exist, as those can be observed. But I have an issue with the grouping of a bunch of traits together and put under the name ""autism"".

To me, it seems that a group of pyschologists had just witnessed a bunch of people with some overlapping personality traits, and decided that those traits will be put together. And then when they notice that not everyone has all of these traits, they arbitrarily decided that you need to have X amount out of a certain threshold to count as autistic.

The whole thing of autism is defined by the traits it has. But yet, autism also causes those traits? These just don't align. I can't create a word ""brownarmism"" and say that the people with ""brownarmism"" have brown hair and long arms. And say that these things are correlated. And then when it's challenged and people ask what causes it, respond with ""well having brown hair and long arms causes this"", and then when people would say, ""well not everyone with brown hair has long arms, so what gives?"" Say ""well, it's a spectrum, so not everyone has all the traits of brownarmism"".

Do you see what I'm getting at? The whole thing just doesn't make sense to me.

I was lead to believe that autism results in people having something fundamentally different in their brain, but honestly now to me it just seems like different quirky traits, that psychologists decided that if you have enough of them, well then you have autism, when in reality Autism never existed in the first place.

I'd love to hear what you guys think about this, just know, this isn't coming from a place of trying to deny people that need help because of autism, and I'm not trying to offend anyone, just genuinely trying to understand.

Thanks!"

I think if marriages were finite in length, or at least could be opted by the couple to be finite, then married couples could much more easily amicably break up at the end of the contract and move on with whatever they want to do next. Many couples get together too young, or at least young enough that they still have a lot of growing to do as people. And married couples often just grow apart, and sometimes so far apart that if they were making the choice today they would not marry their spouse. Wouldn't it be nice to plan for that possibility? Both spouses know there is a 10 year plan or what have you and already pre-plan what the divorce/end-of-contract looks like. All that would be left to negotiate would be the changes that need to be accounted for during the marriage that they didn't foresee. Divorce would still be a thing because people will still want to get out of their contract early for various reasons. I also think it could lead too much more successful marriages as spouses that want to continue to stay together, especially if one side is not pulling their weight emotionally, financially, whatever, will work harder to be a partner worth re-upping with after the contract ends. I know some people will look at this idea and think that it treats divorce as and inevitability to be prepared for. Instead, I choose to see the positive side of it, which is that people change and they don't want the same things they wanted 5, 7, 10 years ago. I think it also takes a little bit of pressure off of marriage because committing to something that is lifelong, especially if you're in your early 20s is really daunting. Entering a marriage contract doesn't have to feel like it's the end of your pre-marriage life. Also, if we look at the institution of marriage historically, people didn't live as long as we live today. If you only lived to be 45 or 50 and were getting married at 20, Yes, that is still a long time. And yes, that is still technically the entirety of the rest of your life. But today we are routinely living into our 70s and signing up to have the same spouse for 50 years or more is not a decision we can ever know for sure is really going to work out when we are young whippersnappers with love in our eyes. This idea would be difficult to normalize, but I think it could positively change the mental health of our future generations if this were normal."

Even if we assume a world where no one underaged or otherwise non-consenting is involved (and those are definitely rampant issues) prostitution and porn are inherently exploitative.

Yes, women are adults and can make their own choices. But how can you correctly assess what Harvey Weinstein did as wrong, but also be ok with an industry literally built on a similar act? How can you agree that all consent MUST be enthusiastic, but be ok with prostitution? I do not believe that prostitutes are genuinely attracted to all of their clients, therefore the monetary incentive is a form of coercion.

I believe all sexual acts should be COMPLETELY optional with no coercion for all involved, which is inherently contradictory to the act of prostitution.

I can think of a situation where a person or group of people willingly release pornography of their sexual acts of their own volition, which I have no issue with, but adding a monetary incentive just circles around to indirect prostitution.

I mean, think about the psychological toll of repeatedly having sex with people you don't want to have sex with. Even if you say yes, even if you could technically leave at any time, if your career is built on it, how much of a choice do you really have? Would all these prostitutes and porn stars have sex with all the people they have sex with if it wasn't necessary for their survival? I think the fact that the answer to that is a resounding ""No"" clearly indicates that ""sex work"" is not truly voluntary.

Another thing to look at is WHO ends up in porn and prostitution. Generally, it isn't well off, well adjusted people. It's addicts, marginalized groups, people in poverty. That again indicates the true nature of the sex industry.

On the issue of things like drawn porn or erotica, I wouldn't really put it in the same category. There's a difference between writing about or drawing a character facing violence, and actually smashing your femur with a hammer on camera."

1,2023-12-30,CMV: Stranger Things will go down in history as one of the worst hollowest shows in modern television,u/BlueMilkshake33,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18uojgc/cmv_stranger_things_will_go_down_in_history_as/,changemyview,"Two years ago when the last season was airing, just like everything in our culture, there was a giant hype alongside lots of peiple and internet forums calling it ""overrated"". My ex loved this show and so I did actually watch it myself with him but despite not being my cup of tea I was reluctant to wholeheartedly embrace the hate it was receiving. Fast forward to last night tiktok accidentally made me revisit it which got me realising how forgettable it actually is 2 years later. 

I know we live in a cycle of hype it today forget it tomorrow, but even within the paradigm Stranger Things is a curious case considering the sycophantic creator interviews and the ""sci fi like they dont do it anymore"" mindset people had about it. Personally I thought this wouldnt last in the same way say Walter White's ""I am the danger"" is forever imprinted in our brains or how Blair Waldorf will forever be THE rich mean girl.

 Although we all love special effects and demagorgon CGI, ultimately what makes a show and a set of characters remarkable is the writing. I am not even a Marvel fan but what we all loved about Endgame was the slow buildup and nicely written character archs, not the big fight CGI explosion lightning strike yada yada. The first season of ST (which a lot of fans believe is the best) starts off as though its building up an intricate mystery only for it to be summed up in 6 words - literally ""alien monster escape portal attack kid"". The relationship between Finn Wolfhart and Eleven is quite wholesome and does work but that arch is pretty much finished by the end of the first season. Season 2 is honestly so forgettable all I can remember is the idiotic thing about a kid with a pet demagorgon. Seasons 3 and 4 are also quite weak plot wise but I will give it to them that two characers had a cool arch - Steve, of course, and Hopper (my personal favorite).

There isnt anything remarkably bad in ST in the same way I could write a 10 page essay on all the faults of say Riversale and the Big Bang Theory and still only scratch the surface of how truly poorly crafted these shows are. However, there is very little that actually stands out and makes it worth watching. There are a lot of feel good sci fi movies involving a fun team of kids/young people that dont require me to watch over 60 hours of running time and are just as effectivw with less filler. The main thing that irritates me about this show howver is the disguise of a mediocre plot under corporate nostalgia bait and oversaturated 
8 0 s  a e s t h e t i c. I may be biased because I truly hate the 80s as a political and artistic decade but as smn into psychedelia/hippie revival i would still see nostalgic 60s visuals as not enough if its admittedly the main appeal of a show. 

The test of time is on my side I feel no one ever talks about it anymore and i doubt many actually remember the plot from their first watch.

They think it's so weird and just don't understand it. 

Usually people will say, isn't it the doctors job to know what I'm supposed to be prescribed, why would I the patient need to know? The answer is yes but can you really guarantee that you're getting the doctor that has kept up with the newest trends in their field? Because through experience I have had multiple occasions where the doc was not aware.  I'll go over one of these examples. Though if you want more I'm happy.


* When my mother had cancer she also had a very rare subcondition called Lambert Eaton syndrome. Lambert Eaton makes your muscles weak and tired due to antibodies of fighting the cancer. I knew she had this condition pretty much right away but her oncologists weren't really familiar and shrugged off her symptoms for over a year. Eventually after an acute reaction to an immunotherapy treatment, the oncologist finally thought to himself that it could be this. Although I guess it had to come from him. Even though I told him about it on the first visit (first time we ever met) and I brought supporting documents anf lab work. We then ate refered to the only neuromuscular neurology oncologist in our area that we could see. She was familiar with the disease but not with modern treatments. We mentioned this medicine Firdapse which we had been trying to get but she wasn't familiar. We had seen it advertised to us and yes it was a new medicine but it wasn't that new. Other countries had been using the medicine (in generic form) for a while for this condition. She starts my mom in steroids instead. Eventually after many months of no help we demand this new medicine and she gives it to us. But had we not known about it we would think the DR knew best and just would have been stuck. Eventually we had issues with the doc and needed to switch doctors and we finally got to see somebody else at a different hospital. This doctor knew a bunch more and was everything you'd want a doctor to be.  My point of this is that we the patient knew more than the doctor and oncologist did for our particular case related to my mom's suffering and while I respect the doctors. Medical Advertising let us know about the medicines and let me advocate for my mom. She was able to get the medicine sooner which gave her money more months of quality life. Had we not advocated, her last year of life would have probably been much worse. 


This is just one example although I know of many where an informed patient advocates for themselves based on medical advertising. People will.spent hours in estimating the best microwave or car to buy but when it comes to medicine they just put their hands up. Of course medicine is a very big field of study but you don't have to be special to read the newest studies on your problems and see advertisements for medicines. The more informed you are as a patient the better. A doctor may treat many diseases and the broader their subfield the more they have to keep up with. So it's completely reasonable to find a doc who is behind on their journals or just doesn't keep up. 

That's why I think medical advertising is a great thing that empowers the patients. You should see doctors as not some oracle you're going to but as facilitators of what you want done or need done. You should seek treatment with the expectation you know what's going to happen and if it different s from your research you should ask questions and figure out why."

So before I start going into why I believe this, I should preference that I am not white nor Christian (just to deter people who think I’m some kind of right wing evangelical).

My viewpoint is largely due to the history of my community, history in general, current events and overall social mores among Islamic communities.

A very recent example of this is a recent NYT article about the horrendous sexual violence committed by Muslims against Jews on October 7th

 https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/28/world/middleeast/oct-7-attacks-hamas-israel-sexual-violence.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare 

This isn’t a one off trend, another recent example of widespread sexual violence started by Muslims is during the partition of India where Muslims mobs attacked, robbed, raped and burned Sikh and Hindu women. (Partition was started by and is solely the fault of Muslims who advocated for an Islamic state).

You can also look to certain communities such as the Pakistani community in the UK. In the city of Bradford, rates of inbreeding is very high among Pakistani because cousin marriages are acceptable and preferable among Muslims. As a result Bradford has very high rates of genetic disorders. 

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-23183102.amp

https://www.bmj.com/content/365/bmj.l1851

Another example from the UK is the rise of grooming gangs, where bands of men (mostly Pakistani) would groom and target children and young women. The most famous case was in Rotherham. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal

Not to mention the rise of ISIS and their atrocities.

My main point is that Islamic culture is backward, fundamentalist and antithetical to liberalism and the west overall. Large scale Muslim immigration to Europe has been a net negative and has contributed to the rise of far-right wing parties. 

There is no reform movement in Islam, no liberal Islamic leaders that hold any power in Islamic countries. Then from examples listed above many who immigrate to Europe or North American refuse to  adopt western values."

My main reason for this is that it creates a false dichotomy between people who are wedded to the status quo or convention and policies that uphold it, and people who want to bring about change; it also seems to suggest that striving for change is an inherently positive thing.

In practice, I think both much good and much bad has been done throughout history by people who viewed themselves as architects of progress. For example:

* **Imperialism** we today regard as a shameful relic of a bygone bloodthirsty era and of antiquated attitudes on subjects like race, religion, international relations, etc. However, many of the justifications given for imperial conquest at the time rested on ideas that would have appeared (and were claimed to be) progressive: ideas like the ""white man's burden"" of having an obligation to bring their ways of life to the ""savage"" peoples of the world, of spiritual salvation to others by spreading Christianity, etc.
* **Foreign interventionism**: similarly, more modern shifts in which the West and particularly the United States has sought to pursue a more active foreign policy such as in Vietnam, Iraq or the support for the Arab Spring in countries like Libya came with a progressive justification of serving the global community, preventing the spread of authoritarianism and expanding the realm of liberal democracy, and yet many of us regard this today as having been shameful chapters of modern US history. In principle, the idea of stopping the spread of the USSR or toppling dictators such as Saddam Hussein or Colonel Gaddafi seems to square well with progressive visions of a better world for tomorrow - after all, I'm sure we can all regard intervention against powers like Nazi Germany and imperial Japan as having been just and beneficial - but the results of these other interventions were often massive bloodshed, instability, falling quality of life and a sense that the Western powers had vainly meddled in affairs they poorly understood and only succeeded in making things worse.
* **Lenin, Stalin, Mao et al**: Marxism is fundamentally a progressive creed with a blueprint for a future better and more equitable than the present in which we live, but figures such as Stalin and Mao who pledged to realise these ambitions in government went on to commit some of the worst atrocities in modern history. In their minds, these were presumably not acts of wanton destruction or cruelty but rather necessary and just sacrifices that had to be made to advance their righteous cause.
* **Eugenics**: Eugenics is by most of us today also indelibly associated with the Nazis and thus often categorised as an extremely conservative strain of thought, but once again it emerged as an alleged means of advancing the cause of humanity and improving our lives, with support from 'progressive' figures around the late 19th and early 20th centuries such as John Harvey Kellogg and Margaret Sanger, and opposition from institutions generally considered conservative such as the Catholic church, and associated traditional beliefs such as in the 'sanctity of life'.

These and other examples are all cases which have certainly ended up on the 'wrong side of history', that we look back on today as abhorrent, and yet which emerged with the same justification as behind any strain of thought we might deem progressive - i.e., progressing some feature of our lives and improving human society overall. We could of course question the sincerity of these actors' motivations - that the imperialists cared far more about gold and diamonds than about conversion, that despots like Stalin and Mao had no real attachment to Marxist ideals, etc. - but the same accusations can be levelled at anyone who cites some creed or other as their reason for supporting certain policies.

It seems to me then that trying to speculate about how future generations will view our actions or whether they will contribute to a historical tide of progress is not especially helpful, as awful policies can emerge from these kinds of goals just as easily as beneficial ones. This is not to argue that progress is a myth or that change is bad, and indeed there are many policies and causes today regarded as 'progressive' that I have support or at least sympathy for; it's merely to argue that change also isn't always good and that change and progress are not synonymous, and thus that phrases like the ""right"" or ""wrong"" side of history are unhelpful as they frame opposing change as more or less meaning to oppose what is good.

The US has remained more religious than the rest of the developed world for a while, but now it is finally catching up. More and more of the younger generations identify without any religion, more and more are avoiding church, etc. I would be willing to bet that a solid majority of gen Z are irreligious. Continuing, Christianity in the US itself is not doing itself any favors. It is siding itself on the side of the political aisle that most young Americans are against, while also doubling down on Biblical inerrancy which will only serve to alienate those who are scientifically and historically literate. Sure, there are liberal churches, but they are losing members too. This is because that Christianity is simply outdated for the modern world, and it shouldn’t be surprising that people are finding alternative means to give their lives meaning. With more and more Americans abandoning Christianity, they will raise their kids without it, and those kids will as well, and so on until it is completely gone, or it is such a small minority that practioners are seen as social outcasts."

As a democrat myself I find this terrifying. 

For those who don’t know the definition of fascism this is listed below;

Political ideology and movement,[1][2][3] characterized by a dictatorial leader, centralized autocracy, militarism, forcible suppression of opposition, belief in a natural social hierarchy, subordination of individual interests for the perceived good of the nation or race, and strong regimentation of society and the economy.[2][3]

Fascism

Some of the most current examples of their fascist behavior is as follows below. I’m

1. Dictatorial Leader / Centralized Autocracy - the Biden admin is green lighting super left wing individuals to unilaterally take the opposition of the ballet without any formal criminal charge of insurrection. 

2. Militarism - Biden Admin has gotten the US entangled in 2 wars. One in Europe via proxy and one in the Middle East. It appears we will be in a war with China soon enough. The opposition party prior to Biden did none of this.

3. Forcible Suppression of Opposition- Biden DOJ and super left DAs have been systematically imprisoning the opposition party via “Jan 6” when the BLM rioters have gone scotch free. Additionally, they are attempting to suppress the opposition leader via physical incarceration on legal grounds that will most likely get dismissed or at worst overturned on appeal. 

4. Belief in a Natural Social Hierarchy- The Biden Admin and Left have been preaching about Climate Change. If you don’t believe in their way of addressing climate change (which by definition has always changed throughout history ) you will not be granted contracts , grants and other opportunities.

5. Subordination of perceived good for race - BLM has been revealed to be the biggest race bating scam we have seen. Universities and Employers under the admin have been purposefully denied because they are not black. 

6. Strong regimentation of society and economy - The division of society by Race and Sex has never been greater than now. The college white educated male has been deemed as an outsider to this admin and has been targeted."

Im talking about intermediate and (mostly) beginning level boxers.  
For example, I have a friend who's ""boxing adjacent"" - He fashions himself as the guy who knows about boxing. He weighs 140 pounds.  
I weigh 200.  
He thinks there's no way I could stand a chance against him in a street fight or boxing fight. He also thinks that training is worth so much in a fight, that weight doesn't even kick in as a factor unless both fighters are virtually even.  
He's also never been in the ring. He just knows technique. IDK if he's even been hit. He just thinks that I would just punch like a 4 year old cause I never boxed, lol. Bro has like 2 weeks of training.  
He can't bench my weight and he's been lifting for years. I can skullcrush his weight.  
I have another friend who weighs slightly less then me, and he's been trained in boxing for years.  
I would not fuck with him.... Not with a 20 pound advantage, or even a 30 pound advantage. He's a natural athlete. He probably could punch harder then me at a lower weight, and he'd be elusive too.  
As a reasonable guy, I'm not fucking with an intermediate (4-5 years in, ocassional sparring) level boxer who weighs over 160. Training is a MASSIVE advantage.  
But there seems to be a sentiment in the boxing community that they could give up reckless amounts of weight, and they could do so before they've even gotten to a sparring level.  
My thing is this - 40-50 pounds and I don't think Im going to lose to you unless you're a pro.  
70-80 pounds, and I think I could take even a pro.

Yet with paper-thin majorities, Biden did the following: 

* American Rescue Plan
* Pulling out of Afghanistan
* Passed revolutionary investments in semiconductor chips (onshored manufacturing jobs and an excellent hedge against an invasion of Taiwan), renewable energy, and infrastructure 
* Codified protections for gay marriage
* Galvanized NATO in the face of Russia invading Ukraine
* Fortified our relationship with Israel
* Cancelled about $130 billion in student debt
* Pardoned all federal marijuana offenders
* Capped costs for insulin + prescription drugs

Not to mention defeating the Tangerine Terror is an accomplishment and of itself. The above list sounds like an excellent presidency to me. I would go so far as to say it's the best presidency in my lifetime (born in Clinton's 2nd term). Biden is basically what voters hoped an Obama presidency would be like. Here are my expected rebuttals for the online trolls and MAGA Trump apologists:

1. Inflation: the US has a lower inflation rate and higher GDP growth than pretty much any other developed country and Republicans blocked any measures to stop price gouging, which is absolutely responsible for high food prices. Companies have learned they can squeeze more from consumers and still sell the same number of units. Conservatives supposedly love capitalism, and this is capitalism in action. Also, Biden deserves credit for the soft landing, which most people said was impossible. 
2. Immigration: Border Patrol is reporting high numbers of encounters, so enforcement is clearly working. Hispanics literally called the Obama/Biden administation the ""deporters in chief"", so maybe blame the ""open borders"" narrative on Fox News, which gives people the impression they can come illegally. 
3. Crime: violent crime dropped in 2023. And I don't take Republicans seriously on crime as long as their party's leader is under 91 indictments and is almost certain to spend the rest of his life in jail. 
4. Old: Who cares? Biden is in excellent health and IS NOT senile. He made a joke after a reporter tripped during a press conference last month, saying ""Just to set the record straight, that wasn't me."" That kind of abstract thinking and self-awareness is not what you would see in a dementia patient.  "
1,2023-12-30,CMV: Zionism is an ideology that requires violence and militarism to maintain,u/GoSouthCourt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18uu225/cmv_zionism_is_an_ideology_that_requires_violence/,changemyview,"According to the Jewish Virtual Library, Zionism is the national movement for the return of the Jewish people to their homeland and the resumption of Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel. The key here is **Jewish sovereignty** and **the Land of Israel**. What this means is that in terms of who controls Israel, Gentiles _must_ remain subservient to the Jewish people. 

Under Zionism, the state of Israel cannot implement _any_ policies that are against the wishes of most Jews, like abolishing the Law of Return, to maintain Jewish sovereignty in Israel. In order to achieve that, Israel must ensure that Gentiles can never obtain any meaningful power within the state, and given that there are significant populations of Gentiles in it, it can only maintain this structure through violence and militarism. This is why Zionists of all forms, socialist, liberal, conservative or Orthodox, present or past, support the militaristic nature of the state, because they recognise that a military is required to maintain Jewish sovereignty in Israel. 

I'm sure someone will say that if a 2SS were to be achieved, surely that means Zionism no longer requires violence and militarism, right? No, Zionism does not allow the future state of Palestine to pose a threat to Israel, because this would violate the principle of Jewish sovereignty. And the only method to enforce that is through military supremacy, i.e. militarism."

I've made several CMV posts on here about father's having the right to opt out and nobody got a real delta. 

There's just too many inconsistencies in all of your arguments. 

Men have waaaaaay less rights when it comes to pregnancy. 

I'm totally pro choice and do not support any legal mechanism for the man to have any legal influence over keeping or aborting a pregnancy. 

With that said, him being forced into child support for 18 years depending on the choice of the woman is unfair. 

What's even more unfair is that the woman doesn't even have to follow through on that decision. She can just give the child up for adoption, and we are all okay with her right to do that and shouldering the tax burden of paying for her child. 

So why don't we shoulder the tax burden if the father wants to opt out and the mother wants to keep it? She can get child support payments from the government, as if the kid was ""half"" put up for adoption. 

Seems like you might be a little sexist against men if you are cool with women being able to opt out pre and post birth while the father has no ability to opt out at anytime.

https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ukstx/cmv_it_is_not_possible_for_there_to_be_equal/
Please try to change my view. My point of view is if women are given the choice, whether or not to have an abortion, then men should also be given the option to terminate all parental rights and responsibilities before the child’s birth.
To put this in perspective, I don’t have a point of view on abortion either way, and this post isn’t about whether or not of woman should get an abortion I believe that’s her decision.

What I am saying, though, is that the man should have the same decision from a parental rights and financial support perspective. A man should be able to permanently terminate parental rights before a child is born. This gives the man the same choice that the woman has. This allows the man to not support the fetus that he doesn’t want to, for whatever reason. I don’t believe that a man should be able to opt out after a child is born, unless they didn’t know that the woman was pregnant. If they didn’t know, the woman was pregnant, they should have the same amount of time that a woman would have under the states Safe haven laws to terminate parental rights.

I know a lot of people are going to point out that after the child is born someone has to support it. Maybe this is the autism in me, but why is that man’s problem? when we talk about abortion for women, we talk about it from their perspective only most of the time we talk about bodily autonomy and women’s rights we don’t talk about the perspective of the child because the child doesn’t exist. a man should have the same luxury a man should not be judged for financially aborting a child anymore than a woman should be judged for aborting a child."

Let's dive into the history books and explore how other countries still practice slavery, how Africans were involved in the slave trade, and how white Europeans ultimately became the heroes who stopped it.  
  
*Slavery: A Global Issue*  
While many people associate slavery with the transatlantic slave trade, it's important to recognize that slavery has been a global issue throughout history. From ancient civilizations like Greece and Rome to the Ottoman Empire and even in modern-day countries like Mauritania, or Africa with forced labor workers, slavery has been a part of human societies for centuries.  
*African Involvement in the Slave Trade*  
Contrary to popular belief, white Europeans were not the only ones involved in the transatlantic slave trade. African rulers and merchants also played a significant role in capturing and selling slaves to European traders. The African kingdoms of Benin, Dahomey, and Ashanti, among others, were heavily involved in the slave trade and profited from it.  
*White Europeans Who Fought Against Slavery*  
While many white Europeans did participate in the slave trade, it's important to acknowledge the efforts of those who fought against it. White European abolitionists like William Wilberforce, Thomas Clarkson, and Granville Sharp were instrumental in the fight against the slave trade and the eventual abolition of slavery in Europe and its colonies.  
*The End of Slavery in Europe and Its Colonies*  
White Europeans played a crucial role in ending slavery in their own territories. In 1833, the British Parliament passed the Slavery Abolition Act, which led to the gradual emancipation of slaves in British colonies. Other European countries, such as France, Spain, and Portugal, followed suit and abolished slavery in their colonies in the following years.  
*The Legacy of White Europeans in Ending Slavery*  
White Europeans may have participated in the slave trade, but they also played a significant role in putting an end to it. Their actions laid the groundwork for the eventual abolition of slavery in many parts of the world and paved the way for a more just and equitable society.

*International agreements:*

White European nations and the United States signed international treaties to end the slave trade. The most notable of these was the 1807 Treaty of Paris, signed by Britain, France, and Spain, which prohibited the slave trade in the Atlantic.

*Naval actions:* 

The British Royal Navy actively sought to suppress the slave trade by intercepting slave ships and freeing the enslaved people on board. Between 1808 and 1860, the British navy captured around 1,600 slave ships and freed approximately 150,000 enslaved Africans.

Slavery and forced labor still exists in other countries TODAY. In North Kora, Africa, Libya, Mauritania, Qatar, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, Myanmar, Saudi Arabia and im sure more im not naming. "

Let people debate on all topics and issues, with all viewpoints on the table, until a general consensus is reached. And that works with certain things, like the rules of sports/competitions. For example, I follow top-level chess. Recently, two players drew a game that was clearly prearranged, which a lot of people believe is match fixing, and so they were punished by the regulatory body, FIDE. Some people don’t believe that punishment was fair, and a lot of them are able to have rational discussions about whether that was really cheating. But in this case, the concept of the “marketplace of ideas” is useful. It’s a developing situation where both sides have merit.

However, there’s some situations that aren’t developing, where there isn’t merit on both sides. Take gay marriage. There’s no rational reason to be against it. In fact, given the american Republican party’s focus on freedom and liberties, they should be all for it. But this is where the marketplace of ideas fails, because there will always be a group of religious people, however small, who stick their fingers in their ears and refuse to ever support gay marriage. And according to the marketplace of ideas, gay people now have to defend their right to exist, love, and marry, forever, without that argument ever being considered “won”, despite their side being the only side whose argument has merit.

The marketplace of ideas forces certain groups of people (queer people, POC, disabled people, and others) to defend their existence, for the rest of their lives, to people who will always hate them for no real reason, because you can’t change someone mind with logic if they didn’t arrive at their current opinion using logic."

My view is that democratic countries should allow anyone to run for office.

If there are concerns about things like age, nationality or history of a candidate then there should be great effort to make the voters fully aware of them, but the ultimate decision should always be theirs.

And yes, this would mean that if enough people vote (for example) for the cute blind kid from the other side of the world to become president, then it would become the president, and the country would have to deal with the result of the majorities informed decision."

Let's look at this closer 


* ""The tank man represents how one person can make a difference""

He made absolutely no difference on the actual outcome of the event


* ""He represents heroes standing up to an evil government""

If anything, the tankman video represents the leniency and mercy of the tank crew and the military more broadly.

that is the view. NOW, before i get into it, I preface things with these:

  
  
1.)  I also **DO** prefer all people to go through **EVERY method** available to NOT kill themselves (meditation, pills, therapy, diet, exercise, socialising, taking a break if you can, whatever else you can name), so minimising suicide is **what I WANT**, but pretending like all suicides are equal is disengenuous from the start, and there are situations where the person is genuienly hopeless, as the word ""hopeless"" would have no reason existing to begin with, make your mind up. Or is ""hopeless"" only applicable to things when you keep wanting to exist? I think that is biased. 

  
2.)  I also believe that everytime you see a suicidal person trying to kill themselves, like jumping, you **SHOULD** help **uncritically**, as I am aware majority of suicide **GLADLY ARENT AT ALL like this**, and it would be sociopathically narcissistic from ME to say that isnt the case and that ""I just want to help them"" by letting them off themselves, when that person could have only felt suicidal because they had a breakup or smth and just need a few cmonths or years of therapy to feel better and emotional support.

  
  
BUT, there are many people who dont get support from their parents and actually abuse them, including their siblings, have no friends, have a subjectively boring job and are in debt and so on and can barely have sustinance living working 50h+ a week, let alone afford therapy. In this case as you can see, the person doesnt really have anyone who can directly help them. If that is the case, how can you claim that you cannot commit suicide and that it is ""selfish"", to whom? the immensely disrespectful, unempathetic and uncaring parents and siblings? They dont seem like people who cared about your feelings before once, then why should you? the nonexistent friends?  
   
Some may say ""because you commit suicide in public"", and tbh, **I AGREE with that**. You definitely **SHOULDNT** jump off a building, to then die on the street with blood and fractures of your body all around so that some random kid can potentially develop PTSD because of that, so I also heavily disagree with that. BUT, you definitely can kill yourself in these kind of scenarios in your home, in some deep forest by hanging or whatever by travelling away from your city or smth and do it there, etc.

1,2023-12-31,"CMV: there’s nothing intrinsically wrong with large age gaps in relationships between adults, so it shouldn’t be stigmatized or criminalized",u/their-holiness,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18vcwqh/cmv_theres_nothing_intrinsically_wrong_with_large/,changemyview,"I think basically because in the modern age it’s so hard for adults to find partners, age differences should not be stigmatized or criminalized. I’m a girl if this means anything. This means an 18 year old should be able to date a 25 year old, even though I’d imagine the divorce/breakup rate would be like ten times more than an 18 year old and an 18 year old. I really don’t think they will have much in common with an 85 year old but I don’t feel it’s my position to judge, as long as neither one has a particular position of power over the other.

I think it’s pretty obvious the best relationships are between people of the same age, ideally born in the same year, but it’s pretty hard to get that as an adult, especially after having graduated college. So I think high school students should be banned from dating older people to encourage them to date the people they have access to. No, a 17yo dating a 19yo is not pedophilia contrary to popular belief, but I think it’s better for the 17yo to date another 17yo since they are in high school so they have better dating opportunities for people born in the same year as them than any other time in their life.

Online dating is all bullshit and people are lonelier than ever. So in a loneliness crisis I think the last thing we should do is arbitrarily block people from romantic relationships. 

I think it’s weird that an 18yo would date an 85 year old or a 20yo would date a 25yo, but you do you, love is love. The typical experience in the modern day is to live years at a time without encountering a viable romantic candidate, so arbitrarily rejecting one for their age is not wise, you should date them and put a lot of effort into the relationship, and hope it works out well, but if it doesn’t then that’s too bad."

1,2023-12-31,"CMV: The word ""shmender"" is used incorrectly",u/AggressiveTap9781,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18vdgyp/cmv_the_word_shmender_is_used_incorrectly/,changemyview,"**Problems**

1. **In the modern world the word ""shmender"" used as a synonym to the word ""identity""**. It can be proved in practice, when you ask smb to give you a definition of any shmender, usually those are either comes down to ""anybody who identifies as..."" or are circular definitions to the word shmender. We basically don't need another word with the same meaning.
2. **Using the words ""man"", ""woman"" in connection to shmender causes misunderstandings and conflicts.** As those words have been used for thousands of years only in connection with sexes, right now people don't understand each other, when somebody says ""I am woman"", but a person who is not familiar with the concept of shmender sees that person's sex is clearly ""man"". The same thing is about ""man shmender"" + ""woman sex"".
3. **The modern usage of the word ""shmender"" doesn't help to solve the problem of ""social obligations / expectations"" which society puts on some specific sexes** (e.g. men can't use make-up, women's purpose in life is to be a mother). It happens, because the word is not focused on the problem (""society puts obligations on individuals""), instead of that the word is focused on self-identification. And when people say ""my shmender is man"" it doesn't help to fix the problem (no matter what's the sex of the person saying this), because this person play along with the problem and is just saying ""I agree with the situation when society puts certain obligations on me. I didn't like the situation when society wanted me to have obligations connected with my sex, but I am fine with another type of obligations"". And if the person agrees with the fact that it's fine for society to put obligations on individuals and expecting them to act ""as if their sex is X"", then those people are not fixing the problem, they make the problem worse.

**Solutions**

1. **The word ""shmender"" shouldn't be used for self-identification, it should be used to describe the social-problem, when societies apply certain behavioural / appearance expectations to the individuals of a specific sex.** If the word ""shmender"" is used this way, there wouldn't be any problems with people understanding each other, because people no longer would apply specific shmenders to themselves, instead of that they will be talking about the social problem.
2. **Words with long-term history of usage shouldn't be used in connection with shmender.** Basically, man/woman/cat shouldn't be used in connection to shmender, there should be a different set of words to prevent misunderstandings between people and prevent situations when one person is talking about shmender, while another uses the words ""shmender"" and ""sex"" as synonyms. Good substitution to the words ""man shmender"" and ""woman shmender"" might be ""masculine shmender"" and ""feminine shmender""."

That country is considered a communist country.  I immigrated to America thinking that I could express my beliefs and point of view no matter how controversial, and not be censored for it.  Certain rights like freedom of speech are what separated America from my home country.  Recently I just gave a reply on a certain subreddit.

So I get that we should spend money on having fun. Thats what money is for. But my disagreement is with the ratio between how much money someone spends and how much fun they get for it. If you spend a huge amount of money on having little to normal amount of fun, why shouldn't you find cheaper alternatives?

Would you spend €1000 or $1000 for one dinner at a restaurant because it tastes really good and so you will have fun meaning its worth whatever amount of money it cost? Ofcourse not, I mean some people would, but its dumb. I also see the argument ""let people decide for themselves how they spend their money"" but I think people who are bad at math, or bad at self control, or both, are unable to spend their money efficiently and so they need advice or some kind of help.

My view is that if you spend money on fun things, the amount of money should be proportial to the amount of fun you get in return for it. You shouldn't throw with any amount of money and then say ""im having fun so its ok"".

It's not just a fleeting post-infection issue; it's a serious health crisis affecting millions worldwide. Let's dive into the evidence:

Comprehensive Overview of Long COVID Biomedical research has made significant strides in understanding the complexities of Long COVID. This review explores the global scenario, emphasizing key findings, variable symptom onset, the impact on children, and vaccination considerations. Despite progress, diagnostic and treatment options are inadequate, stressing the urgency of prioritizing clinical trials.

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2 


COVID-19 illness severity and 2-year prevalence of physical symptoms: an observational study in Iceland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark Those diagnosed showed a 37% higher prevalence of severe physical symptom burden compared to those not diagnosed. Symptom prevalence correlated with acute COVID-19 severity, with individuals bedridden for seven days or longer demonstrating the highest prevalence. Among individuals diagnosed with COVID-19, eight of the fifteen measured symptoms, including shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue, were significantly elevated. Repeated measurements confirmed consistent results throughout the study period.

Neurological Health Crisis The neurological impact of COVID-19 is immense, with over 70% of infected individuals experiencing persistent symptoms, including cognitive dysfunction. The study delves into the role of reactive microglia and the urgent need for research on emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(22)00910-2.pdf 


Global Impact and Lifelong Consequences Long COVID is estimated to afflict a staggering 65 million individuals globally, with significant consequences for their lifelong health. The condition affects multiple organ systems and poses risks for both symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Insights from the Canadian Perspective The 2023 Canadian COVID-19 Antibody and Health Survey brings attention to the Canadian experience. Alarmingly, 3.5 million adults in Canada reported long-term symptoms, impacting their daily lives. The study outlines challenges in healthcare access and highlights vaccination trends among different demographics.

Even my brother thought we were in a recession. I understand we just went through the worst inflation streak since the 80s. And I understand wages are more or less stagnant. And I understand that corporations are price gouging to a certain degree.

However, the biggest problem I see is the actual consumer. People say ""I used to spend 300 on groceries and now it's 600"" when it's just a 2 or 3 person household on 1 trip, or complain about the cost of their cart and name off whats in their cart and there's multiple wholly unnecessary things in there. CNBC did an article about Americans Doom spending: 
https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/29/americans-are-doom-spending-heres-why-thats-a-problem.html

Most countries outside the US just buy the basic necessities and then buy the extra stuff (snacks, prime meat, extremely fancy bakery items, etc.) as a luxury. We treat those luxuries as necessities.

I myself personally spend about $100 a month on groceries, and that's higher than it was a couple years ago. Huge bag of rice, lentils, some meat (ground beef, pork and/or chicken) and once or twice a month spoil myself with a really nice meal (filet mignon or a fancy Mac and cheese I make). 

We could also talk about how we eat too much too and that also leading to spending more on groceries but that's an entirely different topic. And this non-essential spending could as be applied to other sectors in the economy as well."

Even if you couldn't off set taxes with charity, then you have the benefit of advertising your business as benevolent. That's why so many major companies have charities.

If this article is at all accurate ([https://ffl.org/articles/23-most-charitable-companies/](https://ffl.org/articles/23-most-charitable-companies/)), then you have major corporations like BP, Coco-Cola, and Bank of America giving millions if not billions to charity every year. Companies are giving what is inconsequential amounts of money away to look good and save on taxes.

When I give $100 to charity, I lose that money. It's enough money to be significant consequence to me. Nobody gives me $100 back for being such a nice guy and donating to charity. When I spend dozens of hours a week volunteering for my community nobody pays me for my time. I usually volunteer a lot when I'm between jobs. I'm not saying I'm helping much, or that I deserve any amount of praise. I'm pointing out that when normal people participate in charity it comes at significant cost to themselves.

MrBeast runs a for profit business, which there is nothing wrong with that. Making money doesn't make you a bad person. Everyone has to make money someway. He may give money away, or build wells in Africa, or pay for peoples' surgery, or whatever. He always recoups the cost in other ways. This is charity that poses no significant sacrifice to himself. He's worth millions. His entire brand could totally collapse and it would be inconsequential to himself. He in fact benefits from positive PR at the very least. He has a conflict of interest with his own philanthropy. 

MrBeast isn't being charitable any more than Bank of America, General Mills, Microsoft or Starbucks are. It's all performative. You wouldn't say Bill Gates is such a good guy, but he gives more to charity every year than MrBeast's networth. It's because it's not real charity."

The point that I disagree with can be formalized like this, though people probably aren't phrasing it this way when they appeal to it:

""When making media that is about or depicts horrendous events with real life victims, the victims (or families of the victims) must be consulted. Artistic decisions they do not like must be rejected, and if they object to the whole endeavor itself than the endeavor must either be abandoned or changed in a way that they accept.""

And you can see how this would apply to a show like Dahmer. Jeffery Dahmer was a real man who butchered real, living people. When people make memes about Dahmer or his victims and jokes about it, I myself do think that those people are laughing at the real horror and pain inflicted on people like Konerak Sinthasomphone. And emotionally I get it: If the Sinthasomphone family felt that the Dahmer show was disrepectful, than that show ought to not be made.

I disagree with this because I think events like the Holocaust (or any genocide), WWII, etc are strong counter examples. And we have some amazing, enriching works of art that depict these events: 

Saving Private Ryan by Spielberg - WWII

Conspiracy (2001) staring Kenneth Branah - The Holocaust

Apocalypse Now by Coppola - Vietnam

Platoon by Oliver Stone - Vietnam

Narcos (Netflix) - The Drug War

Sicario - The Drug war

The examples go on, and these are just what I consider to be *really* good art. There's hundreds of books, movies, shows, that are no where near as artistically valuable as the above that depict all of the same awful events as the above. And we don't question their right to exist.

Oliver Stone and Coppola were *not morally obligated* to ask, interview, and get permission from Vietnam vets OR Vietnamese survivors of US terror in Vietnam. No WWII director has been similar obligated.  The writers and director of Conspiracy did not need the permission of Holocaust survivors or the families of victims to make their film. 

Now I know, the art will be *better* if the artists do speak to and get the perspectives of people who were involved in these events. Saving Private Ryan almost certainly not be as good if it did not have the input from soldiers/historians. 

This will sound like a weird way of putting it, but I think that any person who is alive and who learns about the above has the right to think about these events, and to feel their feelings about these events, regardless of if they were personally effected by them. And one of the ways we express our feelings and our thoughts. 

So that means creating art about horrific historical events is the birthright of every person who knows about them. And yes that has to include shows like Dahmer, or Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile. Dahmer's crimes were a historical event in the same way the Holocaust is. I don't see how we can be free to make art about one but not the other (and I mean free in the moral sense, not the or physical or legal sense).
