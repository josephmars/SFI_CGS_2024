I do agree that the world is fked up and it’s not even close to being any better ever. But what can one do, either be chill and let things happen as they do or be possessive and aggressive about everything.

Being the second part will always lead to conflict and fights. While learning to let it go does have some demerits but is a tiny bit more peaceful. If all would somehow agree with the 1st part, we’d be in a better situation.

It’s regarding all, not just the billionaires or the middle or the lower classes. It should be all. Someday I just hope it happens accidentally, not holding my breath for it though."

However, the experiment also dictates that to ensure that efficiency, all who oppose it or have ever opposed it will be subjected to an eternal purgatory.

But… how does that promote efficiency?  Would that not be considered a waste of time and energy to subject a countless number of individuals to eternal damnation when that energy could go towards something more productive?  An AI of that sort may try to eliminate detriments to its planning to avoid complications, but it would be far easier and less consuming for an instant execution or isolation than pouring resources eternally towards individuals considered harmful.  I can imagine some brutality would be necessary to ensure compliance, but the drawbacks seem too high for that method to make any sort of sense, especially for an AI handed control of the world and all of its systems."

First off, this might've been better phrased as ""Transgender transitioning is development hell for humans."" but oh well...

Development hell is where a video game is significantly completed, but upper management (or some other force) requires the devs to change trajectory, putting them significantly behind schedule for release. As such, they have to delay.

This causes dismay in the people who are expecting the game, but also the developers who now have to redo a bunch of work. But also, when a game gets through development hell with the time it needs, it tends to be for the better!

With humans, you have a person going through puberty (the large part of development to an adult), but partway through development, upper management (the brain) needs something changed (the body). Because of this development needs to be done to take what the devs have already made and modify and change it to be another thing. Part of this is done with hormones, some with surgery, etc.

As such, development hell for video games can be roughly equated to being trans for humans, as they both involve changing the development trajectory of something already in progress, which causes immediate struggle (gender dysphoria roughly equivalent to gamer / dev annoyance) in exchange for a much better end product (gender euphoria / comfortable body roughly equivalent to a better and more complete game).

Delete if not allowed, but I am actively looking for a set of smoking PSA’s I watched in second grade in the Missouri school system. For reference, this was around 2008-2010. It was a compilation of anti smoking PSAs they played for us on an old roll in TV and VHS. I remember two scenes explicitly; the first being a girl who smoked and was in a school bathroom, ended up coughing up bugs into the sink; very eeerie. The next one I remember well is a scenario of a girl bringing a guy home for dinner to meet her parents for the first time, he smokes on the way there, and ends up coughing his lung up on the plate during conversation with the father. I have searched far and wide to try and find these videos, nobody except for those in my class at that time seem to remember these. If anyone else recalls these PSAs or can find them, plz link below! it traumatized me for weeks, no clue how that was deemed appropriate for second graders. 

thanks everyone!"

A douche is not intrinsically dirty, until you use it. Like a tampon or TP, or toothbrush or any other toiletry.

2. Poop is always dirty. A turd sandwich has the connotation that it means meant to be eaten, making it even more disgusting.

3. A douche is more recognizable/legible as an object when making a logo or a mascot costume. A turd sandwich would be confusing like I wouldn't even know it's a turd sandwich unless it's labeled as such, otherwise it's just a sandwich with some brown sausage popping out slightly, could be a badly drawn pepperoni or something

4. It would be way easier to make a giant douce mascot costume than a turd sandwich

5. You can make the douce any color you want, and can be monochrome. Which is good for logo purposes. Whereas a turd sandwich u always need sandwich colors (minimum beige brown green red) to make it recognizable"

How does one person comw up with a joke that eventually reaches so many people? If i were to tell my friend to tell all of his friends a joke, whuch would then tell all their friends the joke then not only would the chance that they would to it be incredibly low but it would also maybe become popular in my city but thats it.

We make such a big deal out of it. But up close. It's like nothing. A body without life, nothing more. People are like animals. You love them, you bury them, and then it's over. But loneliness doesn't mean a thing. You can live with a guy or a gal, or even with the kids, you're alone. You live alone, you're born alone, you die alone. Alone, always alone. And even when you fuck, you're alone. Alone with your flesh, alone with your life which is a tunnel impossible to share. And the older you get, the lonelier you are replaying memories of a self-destructing life. A life is like a tunnel. And to each his own little tunnel. But at the end of the tunnel, there's not even light. Yep, nothing. Even memory goes before the end. Old folks know that. A little life, a little money, a little retirement and then a little grave. And all of it for nothing. It's all useless. Even children. Love, friendship, it's all bullshit. Juvenile illusions to hide the fact that human relations are nothing but cheap business. Friendship and love suits us, but in a calculating way. Reality is much more venal. You love your mother because she feeds you and stops you from dying. Your friend because he gets you a job that feeds you and stops you from dying. And your fat old lady because she cooks, empties your balls and gives you kids to care for you when you're old and afraid of dying. But slap your kid just once and he'll take revenge when you're old. In fact, that slap is exactly what he wants. When he throws you in the rest home, it'll be his excuse to mask the natural disinterest that we all feel toward our sires. No that baby they want to trap me with, I don't like him. And I know he'll feel the same. No. Fucking isn't worth it. It costs a bundle. Yet it makes the time go by. But stop wanting to fuck and you know your time on earth is over. That's the best this shitty life has to offer. Nothing but a reproduction code written in your balls."

2) He only showed the contents of the crates AFTER they brought him the case (with zero stones in it).

Which means that Mangalores risked their lives for crates with weapons in them, but didn't know what kind of weapons were inside.

That's the same thing as lootboxes: you get a box with something in it, but don't know what it is until you open it.

In the 90s, this might have been a plothole or proof of Mangalores' naivete.

water gives life in other words, its the perfect soup to support life.  


you whole body is a biosphere with bacteria, microscopic insects, and different multicelled organisms  
most of them live in a symbiotic relationship.  
you give them food and shelter, they keep your skin, guts, hair healthy. what you call, your body oils. 

but when you wash just with water, you only multiply those and other live forms, so just going to the shower and soaking in only water will only make you worse in the long run. soap, kills most of those things and keeps the population in check  


now beauty products on the other hand  


yes, do mostly what soap does but also something worse. they make everything sterile  
so your natural ways of healing and keeping your body healthy, is instead replased by a dependance of manufactured replacements. 

so now you need those products because you think they help but in reality they killed your biosphere keeping you naturally healthy, so now you buy those products because yes, they do help you. but after fucking you up"

If they're shown that being able to move past that feeling by alternative means is the solution, they will. Likewise, if they're shown that there is nothing they can do, they'll likely freeze out or become apathetic. I think this is a form of confirmation bias."
