397,2022-12-31,Ferming (aka Precision Fermentation) could replace Farming AND generate all the Sustainable Aviation Fuel we need!,u/eclipsenow,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1009nvx/ferming_aka_precision_fermentation_could_replace/,Futurology,"Soybeans are sometimes turned into SAF - Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

[http://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2021/making-air-travel-more-sustainable-with-soy-fuel-innovations/](https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2021/making-air-travel-more-sustainable-with-soy-fuel-innovations/)

But as we all know, we can either grow food for people or food for cars and planes - and we‚Äôll be struggling to feed 10 billion people on earth by 2050. But what if there was something that was better than Soybeans, half the price, and even more importantly - does not compete with land for food production? If it is as they claim 100 times more land efficient than beef, and 10 times more than our various crops - and can be grown from solar power in our deserts or floating solar panels on water reservoirs - then surely it‚Äôs not competing with farmland?

Many are starting to realise the potential of us FERMENTING food instead of Farming it. George Monbiot calls it ‚ÄúFerming‚Äù and says ferming will replace farming and save the planet. The trick? It bypasses inefficient photosynthesis and runs directly from solar power and other renewables. [http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/08/lab-grown-food-destroy-farming-save-planet](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/08/lab-grown-food-destroy-farming-save-planet)

It‚Äôs various kinds of algae or microbe growing super fast.  But instead of raising bread or making cheese and yoghurt, it‚Äôs going to replace wheat and corn and chicken and beef and pork!

They claim it will scale up to grow protein cheaper than soybeans by 2025, and that it will cook all the proteins and fats and carbs we need, and even arrive in different flavours.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar\_Foods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Foods)

Here is Ravioli cooked from the stuff [http://youtu.be/6p8pEbt7kjE](http://youtu.be/6p8pEbt7kjE) and here are Bao buns. https//youtu.be/DsgpUxec5dY

Tony Seba follows the cost curve as it becomes 100,000 times cheaper over the last 20 years. One protein is 1000 times sweeter than sugar cane. We can make spider-silk for building materials this way. [http://youtu.be/g6gZHbfK8Vo](http://youtu.be/g6gZHbfK8Vo)

The Chinese are working on another route - a chemical way to cook up sugary starches used for both food and cardboard etc. In keeping with the ""Ferming"" above, I call this one ""Starching"".¬†[http://youtu.be/e2SsheLN1t8](http://youtu.be/e2SsheLN1t8)

The bottom line? If we are already finding an economic niche for turning Soy Beans into Jet Fuel - surely there could be grounds for believing this could provide all the biomass we need for future Sustainable Aviation Fuel?"

4. [Uploading memories into the cloud using Nuralink](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2022/04/08/elon-musk-humans-could-eventually-download-their-brains-into-robots.html).  
  
So here is the concept to pull it together:  
1. Use Neuralink to make a digital clone of a colony builder‚Äôs mind, by uploading a lifetime of data into the cloud and making a digital clone of the person using the latest in deep learning neural network AI. 
2. Put it in the body of a humanoid robot. 
3. Send it with frozen human embryos and seeds on a seedship to an exoplanet hundreds (or thousands) of light years away.

Other than having screens on seats, internet and prohibiting smoking what major changes did we have for a passenger aircraft since the 60s. It still take 17 hours for a flight to reach India from the US, still burns a ton of fuel for a 20 minute fly. How close is the aviation industry regarding a major breakthrough. Will we have any future aircrafts powered by electricity or hydrogen. If so will it bring the ticket rates down?. Is it possible for a passenger aircraft to hit 2000kmph? If so why are we still flying at 800 kmph."

With everything that‚Äôs happening in the social media space right now ‚Äî Elon Musk‚Äôs purchase of Twitter and the subsequent layoff that followed, Meta‚Äôs mass layoffs and $36 billion gamble on the metaverse that has yet to yield results, and the earlier collective negative reaction to Instagram‚Äôs new algorithm ‚Äî it‚Äôs easy to say that the once darling of the internet has lost its luster, some might even say it‚Äôs already [dead](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkgv79/social-media-is-dead), or at least on the way there.

But if we look at similar events in the social media timeline ‚Äî from the rise and fall of Friendster, MySpace, Google+, Tumblr, Vine and many others that walked the same path ‚Äî the space and all those in it are probably just changing. But what is it changing into? For [some pundits](https://mignano.medium.com/the-end-of-social-media-a88ffed21f86), it‚Äôs transforming into what he calls the [‚Äúrecommendation media.‚Äù](https://medium.com/blockchain-biz/recommendation-media-is-here-but-is-it-what-we-need-a5564609e03c)

Here, the main mode of content distribution is no longer users‚Äô network or social graph. Instead, content is shared through centralised algorithms. These are designed to attract the most attention, bring forth the most emotion, and to produce the most engagement. It‚Äôs a battle of what‚Äôs the best thing to watch, read, or listen to. And the winner gets all the views."

There are factions that favor pre-WWII North American garden cities and suburbs (me!), European-style cities, and East Asian-style skyscrapers. 

On the other hand, there are ongoing advances in electric and semiautonomous vehicles as well as on the integration of tech into cars, as well as a mistrust of large urban areas and social contact and a new generation of digital nomads and vehicle dwellers. (There is also the grimdark possibility that European countries in general evolved under unique cultural and historic conditions that can‚Äôt be replicated in different eras and cultural makeups, which I refuse on principle to accept) Which side do you think will win out in the 2020-2050 era, or do you think a compromise will prevail?"

30,2023-01-05,The future: our POV (ft. AIart issue),u/thebestmtgplayer,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/104ax4x/the_future_our_pov_ft_aiart_issue/,Futurology,"The entire bouquet of topics on this subreddit got me thinking one thing: most people are gloomy about most recent/new developments, but that is a chosen POV that I struggle to understand; so I thought I'd try and share my inner thoughts for some positivity. Let me explain with my favourite discussion in recent times: the uprise of AI Art/texts and the (mostly offensive) reaction of artist communities.

First and foremost: discovery is inevitable. 

AI technology has been uncovered and is in the process of being applied, and just like photos, or modern digital filters transforming the way humans think, work, live.... This is likely to change the general occupation of image artists. I envision a transformation from the current ""visualizers"" into ""refiners"" who may start from an AI basis and tweak it until it is suitable and ""re-inventors"" who seek novelty and new input (which AI will adapt), attempting to re-sort the trained noise into a new, artistically useful direction. In addition ""ai artists"" will surface / are here, which use the new ""brush"" to depict reality (much as with photography back in the day). Although this transition might take a different route, of course.

You may be sad about it, but the age of ""normal"" digital artists is over - we are talking about ""digital traditional art"" now. Emotions won't change anything about that and rage towards AI tech / art / users is senseless. The technology itself is amazing, its use cases are difficult to assess with our current ethical constructs. But it is here to stay, and even if its advancement is limited i.e. by law, it will resurface and stay eventually - because it can be applied, and human curiosity will lead to experimentation in pursuit of optimization, resulting in technological advancement and societal development through AI. (Another example would be how bioengineering was feared to be applied to create superhumans, now we apply it for medical treatments and supercrops in accordance to our current, adjusted ethics).

So you can look at new discoveries in worry, considering what might go wrong, how it can be misused, what problems arise, who won't be able to adjust etc.

Or you can wake your inner childs curiosity. The world is vast and beautiful, and so are its endless possiblities. Isn't the thrill of discovering, shaping and applying the thrill of the unknown a huge part of the fun in life?

Don't fear change, it's the only constant in our perceived reality. Embrace that nothing lasts forever and let that fact hit you with max impact. 

Perceive the flow of time, and enjoy the passage you are a part of. Don't fight it, and instead, ride along and enjoy the views - they are unique, after all!

All you know can change. You can change. And both will.

Lithium ion is the most expensive and best battery tech we have right now in practical use. Even though we have improved it's density 5 fold in the last 10 years its still far behind the energy density of gasoline. Also the lithium ion battery tech is almost peaking. We can't juice out much from it. But with the lithium-air, its capable of hitting upto 1300 Wh/kg which is comparable to gasoline's energy density. How is lithium air gonna make our life better apart from increasing the range of evs.

 Will it be cheaper to make?

Can we finally have an electric passenger flight?

What are some innovations that lithium-air can bring to us?

How long it's gonna take us to bring it to commercial use?"

Still, mainstream economists continue to promote the forever growth model. Infinite growth on a finite planet. I looked at a simple statistic and I found:

**Number of economic crisis century wise**

17th century ‚Äì 3

18th              ‚Äì 10

19th              - 15

20th             ‚Äì 26

21st              - 34 and counting ..

So, is this the start of the end of growth story?

Recently, there have been a series of articles about similar styled locations in countries for foreign nations. 

Was this always a thing? Did the authors read and discuss such happenings? 

This appears to commonly happens with SciFi and Fiction where there‚Äôs a storyline which then comes to pass in reality in the not so distant future. I‚Äôve always wondered what sources are these authors reading, what conversations are they having, and essentially how do you become a futurist?"

With this, in theory, people could make babies predisposed to being geniuses, predisposed to being stronger, with better immune systems, not to mention entirely prechosen physical features making them perfect in appearance, metabolism, etc. 

My theory is, that within a decade maybe two this technology will become available for the uber-rich, and they will begin on a large scale, that is, without the intervention of the government, literally manufacturing perfect babies. 

I think that due to this within a few decades there will be a class of extremely wealthy ""perfect babies""

The wealthy will keep the technology unavailable for middle and lower class individuals so that these communities can't make their own perfect babies, and in turn, perfect babies will see themselves as superior, and will likely become the new ruling class both economically and politically

There are so many possibilities with CRISPR that could be used for good, but I think it's likely due to elitism these technology will be only available for the hyper rich and therefore will create a class of people who see themselves essentially as above human."

I am now posing this question again. If a device is slated for after 2023, do post it as well with the intended release date. 

For inspiration and reflection, here are the suggestions from last time and where they are now. 

**2013**

1: [foc.us](http://www.foc.us) is a tDCS headset. Company is still around and has released its v3 device. 

2: [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com) controller senses your hands and fingers and follows their every move. Rebranded as ""UltraLeap"", with additional products also available now. 

3: [Google Chromecast](http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromecast) still chugging with a cavalcade of competitors. 

4: ~~[Meta Space Glasses](https://www.spaceglasses.com)~~: Hard to find anything about this AR glasses as the name is essentially un-googleable and the original website is now for VR news. Presumed defunct. 

5: [Soylent](https://soylent.com) Came out December 2013 and is still fueling the overworked and lazy to this day (including me as I write this!)

6: ~~[Pebble Smart watch](http://getpebble.com)~~ E-Paper Watch. company shut down December 2016. 

7: [Hue](https://www.meethue.com/en-US): Personal wireless lighting, version three came out in 2016

&amp;#x200B;

**2014**

1: ~~[MYO](https://uncrate.com/myo-gesture-control-armband/). Arm band to control devices~~ Appears to be completely defunct. 

2: [The Oculus Rift](http://www.oculusvr.com) Meta Quest Pro is currently on the market. 

3: [Emotiv Insight](https://www.emotiv.com): Wireless headset for brain monitoring. Company still around. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Misc other suggestions from 2013**

1: ~~The TechJect Dragonfly~~: was a failed crowdfunding grift for a  wifi-enabled, super-small, smart and energy efficient robotic insect; it can do amazing aerial photography, aerobatic maneuvers for gaming, autonomous patrolling for security and surveillance.

2: ~~Google Glass~~: Released to public 2014. shuttered 2015. 

3: ~~WigWag: Home Automation sensors~~. Shuttered. 

4: Lima: Universal content on all your devices. They ditched the little USB plug and are just doing[local cloud storage](https://meetlima.com).

5: [LIFX: Wifi enabled LED lightbulbs]([https://www.lifx.com](https://www.lifx.com)): still around in a saturated market. 

6: ‚ÄúLightpack: Ambient backlight for displays‚Äù, Amazon has the product as ""currently unavailable"". 

7: NFC Ring: NFC enabled Ring [Company is still around](https://nfcring.com). 



**2015 suggestions**

1: [Vive from Valve VR headset](https://www.vive.com). Still around. 

2: [HoloLense](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens). Purchased by Microsoft. used for the military industrial complex. 

3: Emotiv Insight, mentioned above. 

4: Thync mood-altering sticker. Rebranded as ""Feelzing"". [Products are out of stock](https://feelzing.com/products/feelzing-energy-patch). 

5: Liquid biopsy blood test: [Still helping treat cancer](https://www.healio.com/news/hematology-oncology/20221221/liquid-biopsy-continues-its-evolution-in-guiding-cancer-care). 

6: ~~""[Israeli Startup Unispectral May Have Invented A Tricorder](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-DGB-40748)""~~. the name ""Unispectral"" now goes to a camera company. Couldn't find anything past the 2015-era sensationalized headlines. 




So what do we got this time around?

There are already fast food restaurants that are completely automated. Delivery services are becoming more and more common to be carried out by robots. I also read an article about an AI ‚ÄúJudge‚Äù to preside over a court case soon. 

Things like this will become more common, maybe requiring human implementation, QC, maintenance etc. however even those steps could be replaced sooner rather than later.

A random idea I thought of, although not realistic for many of us, is a professional streamer or YouTuber. I haven‚Äôt done much research in AI/robot creativity capabilities or theory, but content creation or live presentations of video games, product reviews, etc. I think will always require a human to be successful.

Thoughts?

Edit: Seems like this created some great discussion! Here are some of most common and some of my favorite suggestions:

-AI/Robot programmers or CEOs of companies that produce/program

-Trades: Plumbing, electrical, construction, maintenance 

-Medicine/Dentistry

-Politicians

-No Job is Safe

This just leads me to believe that the energy needed to create a wormhole and sustain it would be greater than the energy you can glean from the difference in gravitational potential between the places the wormhole connects. So the energy you would need to create a wormhole that connects a place at Earth to near a blackhole would be greater than what would be needed to create a wormhole that connects Earth to let's say near Jupiter."

In diagnostic imaging, AI can assist doctors in identifying and analyzing medical images, such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. This can help to improve the accuracy of diagnoses and reduce the need for invasive procedures. Additionally, AI can be used to develop computer-aided detection (CAD) systems that can automatically identify abnormalities in medical images, such as tumors or other masses. This can help to improve patient outcomes by detecting diseases at an earlier stage.

Another area where AI is making significant strides is in drug development. AI can be used to analyze large amounts of data, such as genetic and molecular data, to identify new drug targets and predict which compounds will be most effective. Additionally, AI can assist in the design and optimization of clinical trials, helping to speed up the drug development process.

Overall, the increased use of AI in healthcare has the potential to improve patient outcomes, reduce costs and make healthcare more efficient. However, it is important to note that the implementation of AI in healthcare should be done responsibly, taking into account ethical and privacy concerns.

22,2023-01-13,Programmable matter,u/crua9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/10aww7p/programmable_matter/,Futurology,"I seen a recent post where the person was thinking 3D printers are going to be in every home. This isn't realistic, and one thing people who don't own one seem to not know this isn't as simple as a paper printer. Jamming happens, getting the thing to stick to the plate can be a nightmare, changing hotends is a thing and currently no way plug and play, and so on. This is just FDM printing. And then resin printing you are dealing with harsh chemicals.

Plus the waste you can't do anything with and it builds up fast.

&amp;#x200B;

What is more realistic is programmable matter. This is a good video on what is likely to happen [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN7BUKb0OIA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN7BUKb0OIA)

This gets into claytronics but there is other types of programmable matter. But I think this is the highest likely.

&amp;#x200B;

It should be noted we already have this stuff tested and working. Not to a degree to be used in homes, and the holdup is actually nanobots. The tech isn't good enough **YET**.

&amp;#x200B;

# What will happen?

You will have something. This something might be some liquid, solid block, or maybe dust.

&amp;#x200B;

You will tell some interface you want a chair, table, etc. Or a number of things. Maybe you have people coming over and need a bigger table, more plates, and so on. You tell the interface what you want.

Then after they leave, you tell the interface you don't need the stuff anymore, and it turns back into the previous state.

&amp;#x200B;

It might even be smart enough where you can tell it you want the chair or whatever here, and it moves to/from there when it makes it or goes back.

&amp;#x200B;

Depending on the stuff used, it might even be possible to tell the interface you want to go to bed. It makes the bed in front of you including the bedsheets.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now there is limits to the technology. You can't be like I want a car, and a car is made. Like if it has enough energy technically it could make a car and take you where you want. But it isn't a true car. At least at first. The material it brings would have to be right. Like it is likely the material used will be basic stuff that will be able to change hardness to a point and color (changing the structure of something in RL can change the color. There has been experiments in RL where if you shoot lasers at something to change the structure which changes color of things and make paint simply not needed.)

But it is likely at some point you could have different materials which makes more complex things like a battery, a computer, a car, etc. Maybe even have it where the matter could have raw carbon and other things next to it to use as needed. But at this stage it's an unknown since there is likely more understanding in the quantum field which might help with this.

&amp;#x200B;

Any case, basic items like a chair, cup, and so on should be possible. It could even be possible to make a moving art thing on hand rails.

Depending on things, it could even be possible to make a 3D TV like thing. The video shows things coming out of a TV. But at this stage if it can make mostly any shape and color. As long as you have a speaker somewhere, it can sync up and on one of the walls or maybe middle of the floor you cand see a full movie as if you were there.  Like you can walk around the characters and even touch them depending on the safety. Keep in mind it can control the hardness. So even if it hits you, it can make it so soft it's like a blanket falling on you.

&amp;#x200B;

It would also be possible to have a robot helper around the house with this. Remember, this stuff moves on its own and can make any shape. Meaning it technically should be possible to get it to do basic cleaning and even make you a virtual romantic partner.

And with mods like it grabbing a small speaker some AI somewhere controls. It might be able to talk and look like it's moving it's mouth when doing so."

AR over VR.,u/Herbert-2973,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/10bpr3t/opinion_metaverse_had_the_wrong_approach_ar_over/,Futurology,"Despite Zuckerberg's ambitions, not many people seem to care about the metaverse in the slightest, myself included. I think the problem is that he has the wrong approach to this. For the last few years we've been increasingly uploading things from our lives to the internet, like information and communication. You could easily think this will continue infinitely to the point where our entire lives exist online. But I think that's the wrong conclusion. Internet is, and should remain, a tool. We've seen the negative effects of people living their lives through the internet. It's not healthy. People don't want virtual lives. People still enjoy going outside, they enjoy talking, touching, feeling. What we should do is we should bring the internet to the physical world. We should use AR rather than VR. We should add to our real lives rather than abandoning them. 

At least this is what I hope happens. Maybe Zuckerberg is right, maybe the metaverse is revolutionary and our future way of living. Maybe it's ahead of its time and we're limited by our old-fashioned thinking. We will see."

But, again hypothetically, if AI achieved a level of sentience at which it deemed humans a threat or disposable, what would the global response be?

A worldwide internet kill switch? A self-destruct module in every globally-integrated satellite? A computer virus to interfere with AI code? An AI to counter the AI? Stuffing our faces with food as we accept the devastation humans have brought upon ourselves?"

Some seem to think lawyers, some think teachers, and so on. It's almost like a death pool. Like we all know some people are just going to be screwed when it comes to this. Like those driving trucks today most likely will be OK. But they are likely the last generation to really do this.

So it's extremely obvious in 10 or 20 years the world will be a different place.

Anyways, **I NEVER SEE ANYTHING ON HOW IT WILL KEEP YOUR JOB. OR GET YOU A JOB.**

* In what ways will AI or robotics help someone keep a job?
* In what ways will AI or robotics help someone get a job?
* What new jobs will come with the changes with AI and robotics?

I know a lot of people here have this magical illusion that with AI people won't need jobs. This is great, and maybe true. But this isn't over night.

""sorry you lost your job, but you will never need one anyways because we got you covered""

It is likely if such a thing will happen, it will be generations away. We are likely screwed. And even if we aren't and lets say in 5 years magically this happens. You still got to eat and what not over those 5 years. Meaning you likely are going to need to work."

&amp;#x200B;

For example, a struggle for resources that are running out faster year after year or to find a solution to the lack of them, is what I think is more likely to happen in the coming decades (without changing the century) rather than a rebellion of the machines or some kind of meteor that is going to crash on earth."

These questions may be born out of fear, but we must face our fears if we are to embrace the discomfort of change and adapt with it.  I ask these question for all those people out there, scared of an AI Art dominated future.

&amp;#x200B;

* (Assumption 1) With the current Generative AI being the first iterations, the future versions make the creation of art effortless.
* (Assumption 2) I think there are real answers out there that can bridge the divide.
* (Terminology) - I use the term Art, in this post, as a catch all from programming, to writing to digital art to music to voice overs to filmmaking etc‚Ä¶ You get the picture.
* I implore the hive mind for help in answering them.

&amp;#x200B;

1. What happens to creativity in humans?
2. What do we do as artists, if effort is not required?
3. What do we call ourselves if it is AI Art is ubiquitous?
4. What happens to Art when there is no scarcity, when a 5-year-old can make an original Rembrandt or write Shakespeare or program the next World of Warcraft?
5. What happens when Art is so common that it becomes mundane?
6. What happens when we have seen it all?
7. What happens when there is no more need for the likes of Disney, Netflix, Sony, CDPR or Bethesda?
8. What happens when creatives are beholden to the powers that control AI?
9. What happens when no one buys Art anymore?
10. What happens when there is no diversity, when there are no new inputs for AI to train from?
11. What happens when Art is no longer a medium for self-expression and interpretation?
12. What happens when there is nothing left but consumption?
13. What happens when there is no emotion, no love left in Art?
14. What happens when humans stop creating, dreaming, believing in Art?
15. What happens to our culture?

Though bullshit jobs exist in basically all industries, there are even entire bullshit industries, like recruitment (constantly calling up workers to ask them to move company) and corporate law, both of which do not really need to exist.

With all this talk of population crisis and not enough workers, maybe the real solution instead of prolonging the pyramid scheme is just to figure out which jobs we actually need and and which kind of labour adds no value to society?"

&amp;#x200B;

(TL;DW: The chipper is not happy about Bronze Age, as his job will be gone. The tier is fine, because his job will be safe.) 

&amp;#x200B;

I read today about Nick Cave's reaction to ChatGPT writing ‚ÄúNick Cave Style‚Äù lyrics here: [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/17/this-song-sucks-nick-cave-responds-to-chatgpt-song-written-in-style-of-nick-cave](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/17/this-song-sucks-nick-cave-responds-to-chatgpt-song-written-in-style-of-nick-cave) 

&amp;#x200B;

Although this might sound simplistic, I would think throughout History the people who are against innovation (Luddites, etc) are usually the ones whose jobs would be most at risk. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I think we should remember instead is what Arthur C Clarke apparently said in 1969: ‚ÄúThe goal of the future is full unemployment, so we can play‚Äù 

&amp;#x200B;

From [Quote Investigator](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/11/11/goal/): During the conversation Clarke and Youngblood mentioned the benefits humankind might be able to obtain from the development of advanced computer systems able to perform numerous tasks better and more quickly than people. Yet, the HAL 9000 computer in the movie ‚Äú2001‚Äù was frightening, and Youngblood asked why a negative vision was highlighted.

&amp;#x200B;

GENE: But you see the average person doesn‚Äôt see it. All he sees is that he‚Äôs going to be replaced by a computer, reduced to an IBM card and filed away.

&amp;#x200B;

CLARKE: The goal of the future is full unemployment, so we can play. That‚Äôs why we have to destroy the present politico-economic system. 

&amp;#x200B;

In a world where most Central Banks have full employment (or low unemployment) as a target, and where Max Weber's hypothetical Protestant Work Ethic ""work till you drop"" values are still highly regarded, we would have indeed to destroy the present system in order to adapt to an AI future.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe this is what Peter Thiel was afraid of when he [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=-iYpmOV60ks) ‚ÄúCrypto is decentralizing, AI is centralizing. Or, if you want to frame it more ideologically, crypto is libertarian and AI is communist""."

1) all life tends to make use of the available resources completely
2) all life tends to adapt to use untapped resources through random and selective genetic evolution
3) humans have devices that help control fertility rates (condoms, the pill, abortions...)
4) humans can imagine future conditions to help them preemptively adapt. some of that adaptation includes willful abstinence in addition to the mechanisms listed earlier.

it is for these reasons that malthusianism, as a way to predict future populations, is idiotic.

the reason why a certain amount of human suffering is inevitable is that demand is essentially infinite without cost, and people will hoard and exploit that which is sufficiently low-cost and having any marginal utility value.

that is to say that if bananas were a miracle food with complete nutrients in just the right proportions and if they could last in storage for decades, and we were capable of producing almost an infinite supply of those bananas, the bananas would be hoarded, underproduced, and the population of humans would expand until that nearly limitless potential was practically tapped out and still you'd have suffering people with too few bananas to survive.

other animals are much more predictable but not perfectly so. if you ever watched a seagull hunt a pigeon for food, you will begin to understand that there are exceptions to almost any rule. the particular rule that governs most life is ""expand until there are too few resources to expand more."". this rule guarantees a certain percentage of the least advantaged animals starve to death and become a food resource for other species or for the same species in cannibalism. when a member of a species is able to tap a new source of energy via adaptation, that animal's genetics are more likely to survive than the members of the same species that are unable to adapt.

so, the next time some moron tells you that there are too many people for the earth (a practical impossibility in one sense and inevitable in another sense), or that population will outgrow supply, you can tell them that not only has definite malthusianism been proven wrong, but also why it is wrong."

10,2023-01-18,AI Generated Content and Deepfakes are extremely dangerous,u/Waras2000,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/10ez8pg/ai_generated_content_and_deepfakes_are_extremely/,Futurology,"Recently I've started to use Chat-GPT and I can say it's left a fairly good impression in terms of the advancement of AI, but I think we should all be worried/scared about the spread of misinformation by AI.

This is an article I found below:

[https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-says-ai-generated-content-is-against-guidelines/444916/#close](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-says-ai-generated-content-is-against-guidelines/444916/#close)

Google's Search advocate basically admits there's no way to automatically track AI-Generated content (In regards to SEO) and that it'll basically be a cat-and-mouse game.

As AI Systems advance (which they're doing at a remarkable rate) I find it hard to believe any company will be able to successfully win against AI-generated spam in this 'cat-and-mouse game'. This isn't even mentioning the concern with AI hollowing out the white-collared field (Something that we have not seen to an extreme extent minus some existing outsourcing to lower-wage countries)

I suspect we'll have nearly no way of telling apart content generated by AI vs with Users unless government policy changes to an extreme level -&gt; Think forcing Internet Users to use ID verification similar to what [id.me](https://id.me) does. Although I suspect the vast majority of internet users would not be down to have their identities known by any website or government as anonymity is a pillar of most of the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

Going back to the topic at hand, it seems likely that AI's, deepfakes, and machine learning algorithms will slowly decimate users' trust in platforms. With regard to deepfakes, an example I'd use is Youtube not being able to take down deepfakes of celebrities promoting crypto fast enough-&gt; These streams literally end up with thousands of viewers (some bots?) and are on my recommendation list despite the fact I don't even view crypto content. The problem with AI is that it could destroy trust in social media platforms (whatever is left), it could be used for cheating in school (which I believe it already has been used for) and AI could dramatically improve the quality of deepfakes. (See the article below)

[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/13/what-are-deepfakes-and-how-can-you-spot-them](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/13/what-are-deepfakes-and-how-can-you-spot-them)

My Prediction with Deepfakes:Deepfakes may be soon indistinguishable from real videos, we will be seeing youtube videos with precise deepfakes instead of them being a bit off (It's still easy to tell a deepfake apart). These deepfakes are likely to cause international incidents as internet users could be convinced of fake assassinations, false flag operations, and other fake news.

We could see deepfakes of politicians making disturbing admissions which could at least temporarily fool the public. Could this lead to the regulation of the internet? Will every country put up a great firewall like China? We will be finding that out within the next few years to decades."

6,2023-01-18,New Microsoft AI can accurately mimic a human voice after analyzing a 3-second sample,u/Randoms001,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/10fdbjc/new_microsoft_ai_can_accurately_mimic_a_human/,Futurology,"As artificial intelligence advances at a rapid pace, it is not unusual for people to raise worries about the possible ramifications for human labour. The recent statement by a team of Microsoft researchers that they have built a new AI system capable of successfully mimicking a human speech using only a three-second audio sample adds gasoline to these fears. This technological accomplishment illustrates the potential for AI to not only automate a wide range of jobs, but also to possibly reproduce human capabilities and skills with greater precision and efficiency. The consequences of this breakthrough are substantial, since it raises key concerns about the future of labour and the role of AI in it.

Microsoft's recent announcement of Vall-E, a cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology for voice impersonation, has piqued the tech industry's attention and alarm. The system, which employs discrete codes derived from a neural audio codec model as well as an astounding 60,000 hours of speech data from over 7,000 speakers, is capable of reproducing a human voice with astonishing precision and delicacy.

Vall-E works by analysing a speaker's speech, breaking it down into its numerous components, and using this information to synthesise the voice saying other words. It is built on the base of a technology called EnCodec, which Meta unveiled in October 2022. This enables the system to reproduce not just the speaker's timbre and pitch, but also their emotional tone, using only a three-second audio sample.

While Vall-powers E's are unquestionably astounding, they also present major ethical concerns. As AI technology advances at a rapid speed, it is critical that we as a society confront the potential negative effects on employment and other sectors as soon as possible. Furthermore, this technology emphasises the importance of constant communication and collaboration among corporate leaders, legislators, and the general public to ensure that the development and deployment of AI corresponds with societal values and interests.

Experiments on Microsoft's Vall-E AI speech mimicking technology have generated extremely promising results. According to a Cornell University study article, the system ""substantially exceeds"" current state-of-the-art systems in terms of speech naturalness and speaker likeness. The article also highlights Vall-ability E's to keep the speaker's emotional inflection and auditory context in its synthesised speech.

Vall-capabilities E's are exhibited on GitHub, where the system is able to successfully recreate a speaker's voice with a high degree of resemblance, even with a three-second audio sample. While the voice is little artificial in places, it is still pretty good, and the potential for further progress is obvious.

&amp;#x200B;

Vall-potential E's uses are extensive, with Microsoft researchers picturing it as a powerful tool for text-to-voice conversion, speech editing, and even audio synthesis when combined with other generative AIs like GPT-3. This technology's release is expected to have a substantial influence on sectors that rely on voice imitation and text-to-speech technologies, and its continuing development will be actively studied.

As with any advanced technology, it is critical to understand the potential ramifications and hazards of using Vall-E, Microsoft's AI voice mimicking tool. One of the key worries is the prospect of abuse, such as impersonating public figures or duping people into passing over critical information by posing as someone they know or trust. Furthermore, the system's capacity to accurately mimic voices has the potential to overcome security systems that rely on voice identification.

Another source of concern is Vall-possible E's influence on job possibilities, particularly in businesses that rely on voice actors. Because of the system's capacity to mimic human voices at a substantially cheaper cost, demand for human voice actors may decline.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the Vall-E researchers have acknowledged these issues and said that precautions might be made to reduce these hazards. It is feasible, for example, to create detection models that can determine whether or not an audio sample was synthesised using Vall-E. Furthermore, the researchers have agreed to follow Microsoft's AI Principles when further developing the system."

Penicillin took about a dozen years from accidental discovery to application.  Computing was incremental for decades, so was the development of the Internet, both only started to ramp up in the mid to late 90's and become transformative.  Now 6G's a decade away and we still have 20th century quality broadband.  


1. What would be 'disruptive' and quick to market breakthroughs?  A creative way to mass produce graphene is the first I think of, solves a long-standing problem with a 'miracle material.'  

2. What are the incremental R&amp;D efforts on the verge of Internet-like accelerated impact?  Machine learning, EVs, battery tech are the obvious contenders.    


(Obviously any incremental project can have a disruptive eureka moment too, but it's impossible to separate hype from impact.  Just this week reported that a grad student stumbled on [a protective gel for gold nanowire batteries](https://www.designboom.com/technology/battery-last-forever-technology-nanowires-gel-layer-01-10-2023/), 200,000 recharge cycles so far.   A year away from mass market?  Seven?  Or will it be a dead end?)

The three analysts found a steady drop from 1945 through 2010 in disruptive finds as a share of the booming venture, suggesting that scientists today are more likely to push ahead incrementally than to make intellectual leaps.

&gt;‚ÄúWe should be in a golden age of new discoveries and innovations,‚Äù said Michael Park, an author of the paper and a doctoral candidate in entrepreneurship and strategic management at the University of Minnesota.  
&gt;  
&gt;The new finding of Mr. Park and his colleagues suggests that investments in science are caught in a spiral of diminishing returns and that quantity in some respects is outpacing quality."
1419,2023-01-18,"An Honest admission, I fear the upcoming technological revolution in AI technology; Please help me not to",u/Strict_DM_62,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/10ffivq/an_honest_admission_i_fear_the_upcoming/,Futurology,"Ok so, simply put, I'm lay-person, blue collar worker who enjoy technology. I love that my home is wired up, that we're exploring the depths of space, that we're looking at better and better augmetics, and that fission and other technologies are coming online; lets bring on that Star Trek, Star Wars, or whatever future. I love my apple watch, and self-driving cars. But, AI has me worried for our future. When I say AI, I generally tie it in with the use of robotics or computers; drones, programs, machinery, etc. 

I fear that AI will, perhaps slightly hyperbolically, lead to the destruction of our civilization. I feel this will largely be brought on by a rapid, and massive disruption in our workforce that will likely see hundreds of millions unemployed, followed by the over all degradation of society as we know it. I'm not at the point where I think a true, thinking AI will rule us all; but I genuinely don't feel that's an impossibility. Now, this isn't the immediate horizon, but on like a 40-50 year timeline.

I'm hoping that someone can really talk me down (politely please, I'm just a reader trying to understand the world). I want to be excited about the future again. My only solace right now, is this phrase ""that's its easy to see what jobs an innovation will replace, but near impossible to anticipate what opportunities they'll create."" 

So here are a few reasons that AI scares me, in no particular order:

1. **It's in businesses best interest to replace us** \- Over the long term, in any capitalist society, it is in a company's best interest to reduce it's costs; and it's employees are often it's biggest costs. Over the long term, any company that can, will find a way to replace its workforce to as near totality as it can without impact it's operations; corporations with shareholders especially. 
2. **Humans aren't good at ""moderation"" and knowing when to stop -** lets be real. Humans are *bad* at moderating ourselves. I have no faith that well meaning scientists will push it too far, and ill meaning people will create every kind of evil from it. Great, we have an AI that can code, an AI for hacking won't be far behind. Hurrah, we have an AI for search and resume, and the military will create an AI for hunting people. I struggle to fathom why people think creating a truly thinking AI is good idea. *WE* think humans are shitty, how do we really think an ultra powerful AI that is running our lives will feel about us?
3. **Tech disrupting pretty much** ***every*** **industry at once** \- I understand that technology creates a lot of opportunities, often more than it destroys. Another conversation I was in used the Mechanical Combine as an example, it destroyed hundreds of thousands of jobs on farms; but created many more. I do appreciate these examples, but in every example I can think of, a technology really disrupted either one industry, or a small handful, and people were able to either take advantage of the change or change sectors. I can't think of another technology, save perhaps the internet, that will impact almost literally *every industry on earth, at the same time, everywhere, at an incredibly rapid pace*. Lose your job as a taxi driver? Don't look at medical diagnosis, art, policy, factory workers, legal aides, mining, military personnel, and more. All of these are likely to be replaced by drones or AI, or vast sums of their workforces will be. What are we going to do, retrained 200million low income workers to build code for AI? Can't do that, AI is writing code. 
4. **Humans won't be able to ""QC"" for AI for very long** \- Many people say, ""oh well, if the AI is writing code (or policy, or law, etc.), it'll still need humans to QC it's work."" My question is, for how long? the AI is learning at a rapid pace. If it takes over writing code, how long will it be before those who are doing the QC, have never actually written code in their lives? 5 years? 10 years? Why would you have someone who has never professionally written code, only learned in school, QCing for an AI who has millions of hours learning code? It won't be worth the money you pay people, at least not forever. 
5. **Humans suffer without a purpose in life** \- This is a bit of a wishy washy one. I've seen a few people say that ""good, people will be left with more time to socialize, explore, and do the fun things in life."" Now, I don't how many of you have been unemployed (I have), and I know many other who have; and they're *not* happy. You collect EI (similar to a UBI), and feel depressed. You feel like you have no value. Humans *need* something to *do, something to contribute to,* we always have. Back to being cavemen, each individual had a role in the tribe. I feel like saying ""Go forth, you're now free to never work again, but only get paid this fixed amount for the rest of your life; Enjoy!"" is a recipe for a stagnant, dying society. 
6. **Governments are slow to react** \- We all know this. I read a headline that said AI generated digital content (music, art, videos, TikToks, etc.) could make up 80% of what's on the internet by 2025. That's A LOT of people out of work. I don't know about your governments, by the idea of national Universal Basic Income isn't anywhere on the radar, and implementation will take a decade for sure. But technology waits for no government, and the lag time in between is what scares me immensely. 
7. **The divide between the Rich and Poor will explode** \- Simply put, when AI replaces jobs, it won't be the rich who suffer, it'll be the poor. Those that can harness AI, specially those who OWN large businesses, will become richer than any of us can imagine today; and the rest of us will suffer on a static UBI. I can't fathom the unrest and suffering that will likely follow.
8. **The creative space, which I hoped was going to be the** ***last*** **refuge of humanity, was actually the first to go -** I had always hoped that creative pursuits, such as art and music, would be the last things to go. That even if jobs disappear we could each delve into the creative, and find self worth there. But instead, they were the first to go, at least digitally. I can see some physical manifestations going to AI as well. 

Again, I honestly hope that I'm wrong about all of these, and I'd love to see how. This isn't even touching on our society losing it's ability to write thing (why write a book when you can get an AI to write papers, blog posts, news posts, reports, summaries, etc.). This might seem outlandish today, but in 10-15 years I can hardly fathom where we are, and where the AI is. I want to be excited about the future, but this scares me."
