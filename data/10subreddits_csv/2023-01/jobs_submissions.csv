1,2022-12-31,From Bachelor of Science(BSc) in Geography to MBA a good path?,u/JAndrew45,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1007l87/from_bachelor_of_sciencebsc_in_geography_to_mba_a/,jobs," Do you think this would be a good path to go down? I was looking at doing an [MBA with Specialization in Natural Resources, Energy and the Environment](https://calendar.ualberta.ca/preview_program.php?catoid=36&amp;poid=42371) or [EMBA](https://www.ualberta.ca/business/programs/energy-mba/index.html). Does this path make any sense? Do you think I would be able to find a decent job, and what type of jobs would I be able to do?

I heard that many people with Geography undergrads end up doing best as Project Managers; so thats why I was wondering about the MBA.

I  am currently in the third year of my BSc; I am just looking forward and  planning. I'm not sure how exactly I want to proceed, so I'm looking  around. ***Any sort of help is appreciated!***"
7,2022-12-31,How to not let anxiety affect your job performance?,u/Moso19,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10089tc/how_to_not_let_anxiety_affect_your_job_performance/,jobs,"Hi everyone. I need some advice here. I have struggled with generalized anxiety all of my life, with it getting worse in college. Afterwards it wasn't as bad until I got my first job. For the past 2 years I worked in customer facing retail banking and it was the worst. My mind was always fixated on messing up; whether from not giving someone the right amount of money, being yelled at by an angry customer, messing up someones accounts, etc. I am also always really nervous about getting fired. I think the anxiety is from a mix of dealing with customers and self doubt. And the atmosphere in those banks just feels so intense and stressful to me. Overall I just think it wasn't a good job fit for me. At the end of the day I know I did the best I could in that job, but I just feel like my anxiety hindered me so much. And that entire job just made me hate my life and I felt stuck,

Well finally a couple months ago I was able to get a new job in a completely new field and not in front line customer service. I will be working on a computer and doing software tickets mainly from emails or an occasional phone call. I can already tell that this is going to be a much more relaxed environment from the company culture. I have been training remotely and will go into the office after the first of the new year, I guess I am asking for advice on how to not let my anxiety affect my job performance? I really want to start this job on a good foot. I know I need to work on self confidence and stop the self doubt. I just don't want to look dumb to people anymore because of my anxiety and I feel like it can make me look dumb even though I am really smart. Any advice on how to deal and turn the negative self talk off would be great."

•Is it regularly a fast paced job or is it pretty chill?

•is there a position that doesn’t involve standing all day? 

•is it a hard job or is it somewhat enjoyable? 

•is it worth it? or is it better to work somewhere else? 

•What are all the positions and what exactly do they do? (I know they have this info on their website but I wanna hear from people who have worked at a movie theater) 


I’m looking for a chill job that isn’t so demanding, I’m not really good under pressure and I get overwhelmed easily, so please lmk of your guy’s experiences. I need a pros and con list!!

While I've been in charge of hiring myself at multiple levels, I feel like it's worth asking. Do you prefer seeing where someone's succeeded, or what they know how to do?

For example: ""Lowered cost per acquisition by 30% YoY,"" or ""Managed Paid Search, Paid Social, and Paid Display campaigns?"" (Sorry for the marketing based terms, it's just my profession.)

I tend to really dislike the achievements/percentage increases when they come across my desk, because I really doubt the applicant was solely responsible for them, and I have no way to verify. Like, was that part of your team's success? Did the company implement a new, more effective website? Were there external market factors that led to it, like the end of Covid lockdowns? Of course, if you've personally won an award or designed a software/process that had a major effect, I'd love to know.

A skills-based resume lets me know more or less what you know how to do, and if you can do the things I need you to do. I don't want to assume you're competent in things based off of your title, and then we can talk about your accomplishments during interviews.

I’ve recently taken a new sales job after previously leaving the industry as I truly hated it especially towards the end.
Long story short after nearly 2 years away I am a few months into a new sales role simply due to the fact I can’t find anything else, I’ve done well in sales but I am introverted and over time gotten worse and I really have to put on a front a lot of times and it’s really getting me down.
I’m mid 30s with a family with no qualifications as such so really don’t know where to start, has anyone been in a similar situation?

I’ve recently accepted an offer to start a new job in a profession  I’ve been waiting since I graduated in 2019 to get into, however I’m feeling slightly anxious about leaving my other job and how it looks on my CV. 

I’ve been at my current job for the last year and a half (I’m leaving this for a new opportunity and also because my manager has put a dent in my well-being) and the job I had prior to this was also a year and a half- the reason I left that job was because I relocated and the job didn’t offer a work from home position.

Now although I don’t plan on leaving this new job for sometime as it has great promotional routes, I’m worried that my CV is full of jobs only lasting a year and a half. The future world of work seems to be that people no longer have jobs for life anymore and instead having a whole host of jobs. Now while I have this opinion, not every recruiter may. 

Do you think I should be worried about this and how it looks on my CV? I’m only 24 so it’s partially understandable that some jobs have been short as I’ve been getting experience since I graduated- but I have this impending worry that I’ll  struggle to get a job again(if I leave this new one) because recruiters will see the jobs I’ve held for a short period of time without understanding as to the reasons I’ve left. 

Now i know i’m looking very much ahead into this but i’m just curious as if other people have experienced this or I f this is something that I really don’t need to worry about. 

Thanks y’all :)"

In our one on one, he said that the earliest would be early summer but that they’d essentially give me even more responsibilities so that the transition to the new higher role would be seamless. I would essentially be promoted, but without the pay and title for the next six months. How normal is this?

I will be approaching the 1 year anniversary for my job in February, but my job does its annual reviews in January.

Some back story:
I am a 26 year old male living and working in the US. I graduated college with a Bachelor’s in Cybersecurity in Dec 2020, then a Master's in the same field in June 2022. I am certified in Sec+, CySA+, and PenTest+. I started working for below mentioned company in July of 2021, 7 months after earning my Bachelor’s. I also served as enlisted in the US military from Dec 2015 to Dec 2020 as an analyst and achieving the grade of E5. My time in the military introduced me to the government agency that I now work for through private contracts.

The actual story:
I am a government contractor who works for a company that specializes in cybersecurity consulting among a myriad of other things. I have been been extremely blessed to even have the job I have as it was only possible through a referral from an old boss with much higher standing than my own. That being said, I joined the company I work for within 6 months of their current contract ending. The customer I worked for had very ill feelings for the company I work for due to them sending a then 24 year old to do a job they advertised as requiring 20 years of experience. Although I made every attempt to accomplish their projects, needless to say those 6 months were uneventful and the customer expressed that they didn't want to continue working with me/my company. I then interviewed internally and externally and was offered a job with the same company and on the same contract that was operating on an extension. The extension lasted a year (Jan 2021-Jan 2022) and the company I work for began bidding for the follow on contract in June of 2022 and they won as the sole bidder sometime in the fall of 2022. However, the Gov stated they wanted to implement a standard where all contractors would be required to have a minimum of 14 years of experience in order to work on the new contract...at the time I had less than 7 years...Luckily for me, a few people on both ends (Gov and private company I worked for) attempted to get me added to the new contract but they were told adding someone simply because you like them is strictly forbidden. That then led to my company management inviting me to a private meeting where they explained that I would be given termination papers effective 1 Jan. It was already the first week in Dec at this point...not much time to find a job especially with the holidays coming up.

I honestly got emotional on the drive home that day out of sadness and fear of what I was going to say to my family. I compartmentalized as best I could and hopped on LinkedIn to start looking for recruiters working for competing companies to hopefully get an interview and eventual job offer. My very first message out was to a recruiter who had sent me a message saying they were looking for people with my similar skill set. I scheduled a time to talk to him the next day and he then referred me to his manager to get interviews with a few small companies who acted as sub contractors to many of the larger companies (my current employer included). I interviewed with 3 or 4 companies and really hit it off with one interviewer who turned out to be the CIO of the company. 

A week or so goes by and I start to hear rumors that the Gov was going to remove the 14 year requirement due to the company I work for claiming they'd lose too many people and have to rehire that talent. A few days go by (mid December by this point) and the the rumor is confirmed...the 14 year requirement has been removed and I get to keep my job. Huge relief and huge weight lifted off my shoulders but I am still thinking of the company I had the excellent interview with. Apparently they were also thinking of me because they sent me an offer that truly blew me away. To summarize, the pay was 20% more ($140k-$170k), PTO went from 7.33 to 8.66 hours every 2 weeks, 4% to 6% 401k matching, and a technology stipend that would have easily paid my phone and home internet bill indefinitely. 

I then reached out to the company I already worked for and asked if there would be an increase in salary when the new contract hit. They then offered me a raise in salary from $140k to $151k and no additional increase in other benefits. My opinion began to shift towards working for the new company yet the catch there (and something I'll never tell my company) was that that position was located about 1.5 hours away where I now knly commute 45 mins with traffic. Now I do have a family and I knew I couldn't put that commute on them and be gone 11 hours out of every day just to make an extra buck. Yet...with everything to lose I sent the offer I received (it didn't show job location) to my original employer and...they matched it!

I was extremely nervous to do so and I asked for help from several people on how to correctly present my situation and the competing offer I received. But wow. I have been over the moon since finding out and it still boggles my mind that I was potentially facing unemployment only 2 weeks ago to where I am now.

I share this to hopefully give someone else the confidence to believe in themselves and recognize their worth. Apply to your companies competition! Get offers! Ask for help!!! And make sure your current compensation matches what competitors would be willing to give for your talents."

During the handful of interviews I got in the entirety of 2022, at least four of them sprung up group interviews without warning. All with the same scripted questions that make me feel like I'm being picked apart by three pairs of eyes. All my group interview experiences in the past were shit. However, I'm willing to go through the one coming this Thursday cause it's a job I actually want -- a university writing consultant who helps students with composing their papers. The lady who called me actually apologized for having to do a group interview after I told her my experience, as the tutoring service I'm interviewing for is told to hand out scripted questions by the higher ups. She added that she didn't want me to feel intimidated.

The scripted question that I hate the most is the one about if you've had conflict with a colleague and how you handled it. I swear on my future grave that never one have I experienced a disagreement with a coworker. At my last job I always made sure to divide heavy loads between me and my colleagues. And if they had a lot of work I always offered to take some of the load off. Yet in the group interviews I've had, they insist on me thinking about conflict when they ask ""Can you *try* to remember having workplace conflict?"" The woman on the phone told me her advice was to think of a hypothetical conflict. How do I even do that? How have you responded to this question if you've gotten it before?"

Management suggested I apply for a full time role in the same department. I applied and have been in the new role for 3 months. I have a new boss and am expected to be in office 3 days a week per our company’s hybrid work policy. 

I went to my doctor for a physical and turns out I have critically low iron levels, which causes extreme fatigue and weakness, brain fog. I lay in bed all day besides bathroom and kitchen runs. I sleep for what seems to be 12-15 hours a day. My sleep schedule is so off. I’m wide awake from 9pm-4am, then sleep from 4am-2pm, then go back to sleep in the early evening.

The doctor also found something in my pelvic area so I need to have a minor procedure. I feel so groggy and can barely get out of bed everyday, so I know I cannot manage going into the office for a while. 

How do I explain this to my boss?
Would it look bad since I’m new to the job?
Should I submit doctors notes in writing to prove my condition?
If you were my boss, would this make me seem untrustworthy as an employee? 

Of course I’m human and things like this happen which is beyond my control, but my company is enforcing archaic in-office work policy which management is pushing on employees, despite resistance(WFH anyway or quitting).

I love investigating. I'm fantastic at skip tracing and have even previously earned a contract with the IRS that I worked for a year. I hated working for the IRS, but I loved being a creepy little online sleuth. I especially loved taking on the individuals that had disappeared for years and was MUCH more successful than almost all of my counterparts at doing so. Yes if you stalk my post/ comment history I did have a long career in sex work that I have now left, however thats always just made me even better at skip tracing. I think a career in private investigation would be really well suited for my interests and expertise. The caviat is I don't want to work crimes. I don't want to investigate murders or assaults or anything really heavy like that, I want to do more looking into people, finding people that don't really want to be found, hacking cheating spouses, gaining evidence for domestic related court cases. Is that still a PI? Is there some other career path that would be better suited for me? I internalize things too badly I couldn't emotionally handle violent crime, but im good at identifying anonymous black mailers, tracking peoples whereabouts etc etc. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Basically, long story short, I graduated culinary school roughly 7 years ago and worked in restaurants until just before the pandemic. I stopped working due to health issues (not COVID related) and my back became a main problem. I can walk, but not far and I usually walk with a cane. I can lift things but not too heavy. As time goes on, I may recover to a point where I can be ALMOST as mobile as I was three years ago, but it's unlikely to be soon.

I'm trying to even find any job in a restaurant management position I can apply to. Working as a cook, I could just go to places and say ""here's my resume, you hiring?"" and probably get an interview that week. The jobs I'm looking at are obviously more difficult to find and get. I can apply to all the ""chain"" restaurants around me, if they're hiring any kind of management but beyond that, how can I get in with, like, anyone? I have no network here in my city (I worked in RI before, now live in PA).

Also, if I get an interview, how should I approach the disability topic. I imagine this is going to be a hard no from most, if not all, potential employers due to the (usual) physical requirements in restaurants. If I were going in for an interview, would it be wise for me to leave my cane at home? Like I said, I can get around without it, but I am much more comfortable walking with it (it takes a lot of the stress off my back), but would bringing it deter a potential interviewer even more?

I don't know how much more help I can get here than over on the culinary reddit I mentioned earlier, but I'm trying to get a lot of different opinions on things from people."

I practiced so much for it, read about the company where it functioned, about its competitors and was looking forward to it. I got a nice set of formals and wanted to do my best as I really needed this job. In the morning I took a bath, got fresh and felt quite good 
But the moment I entered the interview room the entire mood changed. The HR person was quite rude from the start. Didnt even care to look at my full resume just asked why do I want to join. Didnt even let me finish my answers. Even before I could complete my answers she cut me off, and asked something else. Didnt give any details of the work and I understood by then that I had absolutely no chance and I get it. But if you were never interested in my profile why even ask for an interview. And if you haven't gone through my profile, why not let me answer your damn questions about them.

I’m trying to find her a better option because I can’t keep watching her fall apart mentally and physically while not making enough money to live off of. The issue is she can’t do any bending or lifting and even simple office jobs list that in their job descriptions. The job also can’t be high stress because that flares up her UC. The only thing I can think of is call center type jobs but I know those can be high stress too.

Any other ideas that could work in this situation? She’s considered grant and copywriting before. Does anyone have insight into what that job actually looks like day-to-day?

I'm 32 M and electronics and communication engineering graduate.  I'm unemployee since 2 years due to some mental reasons. And I only have 2 years of working experience so far till this age. I was something like business analyst in a software company and did my best actually however had problems with thinking fast and that led to feeling incompetent and quitting the job even though I was okay with the surrounding people at office.

So I have been a problematic person about working unfortunately, I get stressed whenever somebody give me responsibility.  It is in the whole area of my life actually but that is another topic.

I am expecting to get a goverment job after I acquired a mental disability report. And the it is probable to be selected and to begin to this government job in 4-8 months. That may never happen though (I'm living in a chaotic country that means anything can happen.)

Should I lie to the employers when somebody like me is accepted to make an interview? I have some doubts!

4,2023-01-02,Career change away from healthcare,u/user5746,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/101e706/career_change_away_from_healthcare/,jobs,"

Hi all, I’m looking for a career change but not too sure where to go. I’ve spent the last 7 years in healthcare and it’s just not for me anymore. The pay is awful, there is no progression or training opportunities, and despite how much “admin are an integral part of the team” you get treated like crap. I don’t want this to be my life for the next 40 odd years.

I’m a senior administrator and honestly I never wanted to be in admin. It was always meant to be a “filler” that ended up sticking because the real job I wanted I haven’t been able to get in to - despite how many tries I’ve given, some things are just not meant to be. 

I love to solve problems and use critical thinking, to come up with new ideas and really use my brain. The thought of trying to solve a complex problem excites me, to be stuck in a problem and really trying to figure it out. 

I would love a job I can sink my teeth into and work my way up or have one where I’m happy with the team. I just want anything else other than healthcare and admin. I’m just done with it. The things I’ve found most exciting is fixing the printer - just like that episode where Pam fixed the copier machine and it made her day. That’s me. 

Is there any other online training or learning I can do to make me more appealing to new employers? I do have a degree in science but most employers have completely overlooked it or say it’s not relevant for patient facing roles, which is weird as a massive chunk of my degree was understanding disease, diagnosing, treatment etc. further pushing me back into admin. Is there anything that’s essential to learn? I find that there are so many tech jobs but I do struggle with it as I find it a little boring? Maybe I haven’t found the right role but I have looked into UX and UI and they’re just not for me. 

Sorry this was long, I ended up ranting a bit. Careers and jobs are a touchy subject I suppose. I know no job is going to be perfect but if I’m miserable now I can’t think of how miserable I will be in 5 years time and the rest of it.

After the switch, I took 10 days off through the month up to my eventually departure from the company in December. I was not paid out any vacation time.

Did the switch to unlimited vacation wipe out the hours of vacation I had banked? I am in California and left with two weeks' notice."

Problem is I still haven't learned anything at all and cannot pick up. I'm still super slow and struggle to get the basics. 

I look at other workers who have been here for 5 years or so and they're so fast and work like it's quite easy. That has demoralized me and damaged my self esteem. 

It makes me feel I'm going to be fired eventually. So far there is no indication that I'm in trouble and everyone is nice. 

And there are still not much expectations as they think I need to be given more time.

But I'm not getting the hang of it. In 6 weeks I cannot do the job like other workers. I feel I will never be like them.

And so I'm considering resigning. Should I?

This is a designing job that involves high tech devices and software. It is in $60k's.

I really feel I'll be fired.

Update: Thank you very much for so many responses. This is my first professional job ever and I'm entry level.

I recently graduated from college but nothing that was learned in college is ever used at the workplace and that made me anxious"

I have ASD (tho not bad as other cases) and the hardest part of getting a job for me is the interview process.

I genuinely struggle talking to people (tho gotten better over the years tho I still stutter sometimes) and if it's not fumbling over my own words it's either I'm forgetting the point I was saying or I end the conversation too early. (if that makes any sense) Additionally, I have been told I'm easily distracted by stuff and I never seemed focused or ""there"" in a conversation. I don't think I am but I'm gonna assume that also a huge problem too..

Every job interview I had up to this point usually goes in this order:

1. Apply to the job
2. Then I practice interview questions with family and my mangers at my current job.
3. And when I get to the actually interview (despite days of practice in advance) I struggle and blow my chance...

I'm not even applying to positions where too much social interaction is required (it's mostly warehouse or stocker jobs). It's really frustrating cause I know I'm a hard worker willing to anything I'm asked to do but nobody will give me the chance to prove it. And the only way I was able to get my 1st job was because my father was friends with the manager at the time (so I basically skipped the interview part...).

Also I tried applying to other positions at the current job I work at too, but I'm not given a chance to work those either...

The only thing left I could think of on getting a job in my current state is maybe be finding a job coach, but I don't really know what they do or how they help you. Nor do I know how to find one...

The only problem with this is that I’m going to moving about an hour away in August and while I appreciate this job, it’s not worth driving two hours each day for. 

My rough plan is to start looking for an entry-level job, so I have something more secure to live off of and gain that experience I need to eventually work my way up in the field, since I’ll be lacking a bachelor’s degree. 

I just don’t know when to start applying for said job. I wanted to find a job closer to where I’m moving to, so I don’t really want to start looking now and then be stuck commuting super far.

I travel anywhere from 20-25k+ miles a year, and traveled more than 21k in 2022 alone.  I understand many companies will follow the IRS compensation rate per mile of $0.58.  But I also understand that this isn't a ""by law"" straight across the board practice, as there are stipulations and exemptions regarding compensation for travel with a personal vehicle.

My company for instance doesn't offer any ""per mile"" rate of coverage, and instead only offers a monthly stipend, and pays for all of my fill ups Monday-Friday.

For 2022 the total compensation based on the IRS rate of $0.585 per mile came to $12,717.90.  My company however paid me $7,340.67 (including their stipend and all fill ups).  This stipend is supposed to go towards oil changes and other general maintenance.  

I negotiated a higher rate last year and was only given a bump of $50 a month.  I have a feeling this year they'll either keep me at the same rate or offer me at most $25 more.

How should I move forward with negotiating, because everyone I've spoken to says the way my company handles this is in no way normal."

I'm  30, unemployed, have a whole bachelor's degree, and I have no idea what  to do with my life. I am ashamed about it every single day, and every  day I wonder if it's really all for the best. Funny thing is, I had  taken a short sabbatical of sorts when I quit my job over a year ago,  but now I'm here. I worked in the arts in a super entry level position,  so now that's all I seem to qualify for. It was a good resume builder,  though. I've applied to all sorts of jobs and have landed interviews,  but have received no job offers. Now I have a year plus gap in my work  history.

This is an overwhelming  stage of my career, because it's like I have to start back at square one  despite all the work I've done. So I just feel like a big failure all  the time.

I do strongly feel that I  need to start a remote career, ideally, so I've been applying to a lot  more remote jobs. I'm even looking into leveling up some remote skills  and side hustles. I'm an introvert, and I see myself doing my best work  in a career that would allow me to telecommute. I understand I can't  limit myself to that right now, though.

Since high school, I’ve always wanted to be a clinical psychologist. Everything I’ve done in my academic and professional career thus far has been in line with that career track (getting a B.S in psych, working as an RBT, doing research in undergrad and getting published, etc.)


To get more research experience before applying to PhD programs, I’ve been working as a CRC in a prestigious psychiatry lab. I’ve been here about 6 months and I’m miserable. The workload is nothing like I’ve ever experienced before. I feel like I’m Responsible for so much and it’s not humanly possible to do it all in 40 hours. I try not to take work home but there’s so many tight deadlines I feel like I’m losing my mind to keep up. It’s gotten so bad that there are certain tasks I silently don’t keep up with anymore because it’s too overwhelming. On top of this, my mentor keeps recommending I do posters and help on other studies…which is a good thing for grad school….except I don’t have time to fit it in my 40 hours so it’s become homework.

I do find clinical psychology fascinating and the individual tasks I complete aren’t difficult, but there’s SO many of them I feel like I can’t keep up. In fact, a few months ago I’ve gradually started ignoring certain tasks. 

I mentioned my time management/stress concerns to my mentor a few months ago. She’s very kind and Her tips have helped some but not much. I’m trying therapy and “to-do” list apps, but with every passing day it feels like I’m just not meant for this job. Even with the support and kindness I’ve been offered, I cry often and have panic attacks multiple times a week. I’m afraid to take time off because I don’t want to be found out, and I can’t really quit because I’m the only person in my position for this study (it’s a mental health study and I’d feel guilty leaving them high and dry).


I used to want to teach and be a therapist, but I think a PhD program will crush me if it’s any worse than being a CRC.

Ultimately, I just want to make 80k + annually and have a MUCH better work life balance. I’m not sure how to achieve this without getting a clinical psych PhD (contemplating HR or I/O psych?) . Does anyone have any advice on good industries to switch to?????? Feeling very lost….."

I have gotten two professional jobs but I stopped. Currently I'm 1.5 years in childcare and I feel so bad I don't make good money. My friends an accountant and my other friend is an RN.

If theres something I enjoy... it's learning about foreign affairs. This has been an interests since I was 17. I would write about the Russian Ukraine issue during high school and have kept up for a decade now. Including other situations. Foreign complications similar to Russia/Ukraine is what interest's me. I hate quantitate, qualitative, etc. research just for reference. I learned this during my Masters. I wouldn't mind traveling. Are there any jobs that revolve around this interest of mine?

I (23M) am employed full-time for the water department in a small surburan town. I am relatively new as I'm nearing the end of my 6 month probationary phase.  It is a good government job, union, pension, health/dental, decent pay ($20/hr). While not my dream job I don't mind the work we do, maintaining the town's water/sewer system. However there is one key part of the job I am in a love hate relationship with: due to the nature of the work there is a need for a rotating on-call service to answer emergency calls after hours. It is a 4 man rotation with each shift lasting a week. During this time you must carry a phone, you take your truck home with you and you are paid an extra 10 hours straight + 2 hours OT plus OT for any time you actually work. So they make it worth your while. However you're typically expected to respond within a half hour so this limits what you can do during your offtime. The money is great but I hate being somewhat restricted and basically losing one weekend out of the month. During that week I am basically unable to see my friends or the girl I've been talking to as they live too far. I also feel like during the time I'm not on-call I'm counting down the days until my next shift begins. Does anybody have any similar experiences? What advice do you have to adjust? Should I look for a job that doesn't require on-call? Would I be foolish to walk away from this?"

My main duty is serving as a liaison between designers and buyers to fulfill in-store signage needs. I'm constantly under pressure from extremely tight deadlines and it's also my job to hold all parties to their own timelines. There are just so many moving parts and dependencies on other people, it's also an extremely micromanaged and corporate atmosphere and I just don't believe this kind of environment is for me. I'm good at meeting deadlines when its completely reliant on my own work, but I just feel completely in over my head in this role because I feel like I'm trying to herd wild sheep and the workload is overwhelming too. 

My biggest struggle is the constant intense anxiety/stress that I feel, and the fact that I can't just ""forget about work"" when I go home for the day, because all I think about on my days off are how much I dread going back in because no more progress can be made over the weekends.

I'm feeling completely directionless right now, and I have no idea what kind of career would be for me. I love the office flexibility and being able to work remote occasionally, but I feel like any office job with potential for growth is going to have these same stress factors that I can't stand about my current position.

then in november, i got hired at a craft store. this is the job i have currently and i really like it, but i might not be able to keep it. a few days ago i got really bad vertigo in the middle of working and couldnt walk right and felt cold and sweaty. i felt like i was going to faint and get hurt so i had to lay flat on the floor NEXT TO the break room (i didn't even have the strength to go inside. no customers saw though). it was extremely weird, because it wasnt even super hot or stressful or anything, and its not like i had been moving a lot. my manager was very worried about me and told me to see a doctor but my parents refused to take me because they claimed it was because i had too much caffeine and was dehydrated (one cup and a chocolate chip muffin which isnt even a lot). this kind of thing has happened to me a few times in my life and 2 times it was after i chugged down an entire bottle of water so idk if thats true. but all of the times it happened it felt like i was dying and sometimes the vertigo would get so bad that my vision was pitch black. but anyways there were some other issues. apparently i accidentally threw money at a customer while i was going really quickly, which i dont even remember, but it looked intentional enough for the customer to call the store. my manager knew it was an accident but told me to go slower when im doing transactions. there was also one time where i wasnt quite sure how to close so i did it too slow, but this issue has been fixed and now im pretty good with closing.  ive talked to my coworkers before and they said they had similar issues at the beginning so im not sure if this is a problem. during the meeting where this was being discussed my manager asked me if i had an iep, which i do, for aspergers syndrome (which i clarified was ""mild autism"" and that sometimes i have trouble communicating with people but shes seen me with customers and shes aware im decent at it). she seemed understanding about it, and she doesnt treat me like im different or whatever, but you never know.

 the cutoff date for seasonal workers is january 8th and i dont have any hours due to too many full time employees working and my manager said she is unsure if she is able to keep me but will let me know. im praying that she keeps me but it seems unlikely especially because of the dizziness spell that happened and my manager worrying it will happen again. i dont want to keep hopping from job to job, i just want to stay in one place. and i really like this job because its just cashiering. you dont have to run around folding things or cooking or whatever. but i hate that i ruined it by almost fainting."

My vacation ends tomorrow and I’m trying to game plan how and when to approach letting my employer know I’m leaving. 

I’ve held this position over 15 years and work a specialized tech role of which there is no redundancy in the organization for. My pending departure is going to cause a panic. 

The rub is, the new job doesn’t start for a month. I’m not interested in give more than 2 weeks notice.

The other variable in play is, I think my current employer will need some sort of retainer contract with me because there’s simply no way I can transition all my responsibilities, processes and legacy knowledge in 3 months, much less 2 weeks. 

Given all this, is the best plan of action to give my notice tomorrow? Or keep the secret for 2 more weeks and further delay the inevitable?

Idk, im assuming it was if I was moving on to the next round but whatever).

Well I didn't get a response for over a week. Ok that's fine, my town was having extreme weather so a bunch of people couldn't get in to work.

So I finally heard back and got an interview scheduled. Well, they sent me a Google invite, and apparently a thing can happen. The invite read a certain time when I opened the email on my computer, but a different time when opened on my phone. So of course, my luck being what it is, I didn't find out until I was about to head out for my interview... 6 hours too late.

I called, and emailed screenshots of the different times, and they said they understood. Apparently it wasn't the first time it had happened. Cool right? They said we can reschedule and we hung up.

Well instead of rescheduling I just got an email saying they were moving forward with someone else. I get if they found someone better, but they didn't even try to reschedule! They just lied!

I'm allowed to use the company vehicle for personal use but I own a personal vehicle. I'm required (monthly) to report the mileage used for personal, vs business.

However, I don't understand this concept. I have the option to input that I drove 0 personal miles at the end of every cycle and input all my miles used as business mileage. (Even if I use personal). I have the option to pay $0 on any mileage I use personally. Why wouldn't I take it? &amp; if so, why would this be problematic?

My employer indirectly advised that I report no more than 15% of my total use as personal mileage regardless of total use. I assume so the IRS doesn't get suspicious.

Are there any Pros for me to report personal mileage besides the fact that it'll look odd to the IRS if you're not reporting/using any personal mileage on the car.

Why would it be mind blowing to the IRS that all the mileage on my business vehicle is business rather than personal, especially when I own my own personal vehicle.

I am posting this with the intent that your responses may help me determine how to proceed with a possible job offer that I may have in the next couple of weeks.

Here is the background.  I have been with my current employer (a well respected academic laboratory in a top notch University) for about 10 years.  I have done well in my role, and have received significant pay increases and some, but not a lot of advancement.  I feel very grateful to my current employer given that they hired me straight out of training into a mid-senior role.

About 5 years into the job I was asked to interview with a high-caliber start up being headed by a well-known entrepreneur.  It would have doubled my salary, and it would have allowed me to be part of a teams that had a great future. But I also knew that it would be a very risky move given that there were a lot of unknowns of how the team would be organized and how it would operate.

I nevertheless accepted the offer, and soon after gave a one month notice to my current employer. I gave a one month notice because I wanted to make sure that the transition was good for my current employer and for me.  Within this time frame I had several discussions with my boss in which he took the time to explain to me, and in some ways remind me, of the high positive impact that our work could have in the world.  I also did a lot of self introspection and although I felt very excited about my new job, I never really felt peace, joy and easiness, which the work of Eckhart Tolle points to as feelings that you may have after making a good decision.  After further introspection I decided to change my mind and I told the new job that I was not going to join them, and that I would remain in my current job.  I did not ask for a raise, but my current employer did end up giving me an extra $10k, which I appreciated. The move turned out to be the right move, as the group that I considered joining have gone through a lot of challenging times recently. However, this event changed the relationship that I had with my boss and ever since I have not felt as welcomed and included in leadership meetings, which in some ways is totally understandable and I accepted, but it did hurt a bit.

Fast forward another three years (now 8 years into my current role), and a great senior position opened within the greater University we work for.  I was approached by several people from within the University to apply for this position because they thought, and I also thought, that I could excel in the position and it would be a great professional opportunity for me.  I thought about applying and not telling my boss, as I knew that this would upset him.  However, I decided that the right thing to do was to let know him.  I wanted him to find out from me, not as a surprise from someone else. I scheduled a meeting with him and I let him know that I would be applying to this new opportunity and that I wanted his support. At that point he had given me many exemplary annual reviews and had nominated me for awards as recognition of the good job that I do.

During our meeting, my boss flat out told me that he would not support me and that he thought that I would be bored in that new job anyway.  It was out of the question for me to get a good letter of reference from him, he said, even though I knew that I had earned one.  He subsequently contacted other high-senior level folks within the University as he was upset that someone was trying to poach me.  Needless to say, I did not get the job.  The hiring manager told me that I had come in as a close #2. I can't help to think that if my boss would have supported me I could have had a better change getting that job.  Which in many ways was my dream job.

Even since then I have been further sidelined at key meetings and decision making. Which I know makes sense, given I can imagine that my boss does not see me as part of his trusted inner circle any more. This has not changed the 110% that I bring to my duties at work.  But I can't help but feel sad and a bit trapped in my current job.  I don't see myself growing further very much professionally in my current role, as now it has become very clear to me that my boss has closed off my ability to grow and advance in my current role.

And thus about six months ago I kicked started another job search.

About three months ago I became aware of an senior-level opportunity for a job that I know I could do very well within a leading industry organization. I interview with them, and I know that they liked me.  In many ways I would be a good fit for them, and I know I could help them with my skills and experience.  I have received positive feedback from my hiring manager, and I get a strong feeling that I am either the #1 or #2 candidate. It would be a good opportunity to gain additional experience both in a new field and to be in industry, and the position would very likely come with a healthy raise.  However, I can't but feel somewhat nervous about taking this position.  There is a large part of me that wants to move on from working with my boss who I now feel does not support me, but I know that I would miss my current team, which I helped develop and nurture into an extremely capable team. I am also scared to jump into a new team. I don't understand my fear. Is it a fear or is it intuition trying keep me safe?

I know that I have not received a job offer yet, and in some ways it may be premature to be worrying so much about this. But this is one of the hardest decisions to think about for me. I am not 100% sure of what's the right thing to do. The closest that I have felt about this was when I knew that I was in a romantic relationship that was not right for me. It took a long time, years, to get clarity. I won't have years to determine the right decision to make when/if the job offer comes. 

Has anyone else been a similar situation with their boss? Or with similar choices? I would love to hear from you.  What criteria did you use to choose/decide? how did it go?

Thank you for reading this, and I look forward to hearing from you."

It’s subject to employment laws so I am considered an employee with this firm. This job is super easy. I hardly do anything all day. I’m not lying when I say I do something maybe 1-2 times a week totalling 1-2 hours per week. To be fair, they think I’m an incompetent new grad so like I’m basically to stupid to take on any real responsibility.

Got another job with a huge pay increase - 1.5 times the bottom salary I’m making (pure luck this came in). This time it’s a consulting gig and I get paid a flat monthly rate subject to no income tax (I pay that myself) and it’s run through a Corp I setup. They even put up an extra 20% bonus and stock options.  

I’ve decided to keep both jobs going to earn a big lump sum to help pay off student debt and afford a living in the city. Everything is within the rules on the 2 firms. My prospects are looking really good and I see myself being happy with the decision I’ve made. 

Question is this: why do employers hate seeing young people flush with earnings? I feel like I’ve created enemies doing this. Ive used the employment system in a different way than most people.

Now that I’ve cleaned myself up, it feels like the people who acted nice to me just want to watch me struggle again - like this is the right narrative they want to see."

I very quickly was asked to be a shift manager as I have the experience and they needed one.
We just got our yearly review raises and I ended with one of the highest raises and now make as much as I do with my side hustle. My boss has also shown interest in me moving up in the company. Talking about salary, bonuses, benefits, etc. 
I'm conflicted because I LOVE my side hustle. But it also has a lot of downsides. It's not super steady income, it's seasonal, no benefits, because of the industry it's slim I'll make better money unless as an owner my business does really well, and to be totally honest I don't think I'm ready to run my own business yet. I still want to go back to school to take some business classes along with the degree I want to get.
Now obviously I didn't intend to stay in fast food long term but I'm only 25 and this job could hold a lot of long term benefits and pretty good pay if I stay and move up. I just need some advice from people who can look at it from a less personal and more professional stand point."

I don’t want to work in an industry like that and I am not passionate enough to try to push through like some of my classmates are. Just don’t think I fit there.

I don’t care to be rich, just comfortable. I’ll be working minimum wage jobs to get by for now but I don’t know what to do in the future. I know I like the idea of working from home and I know that my dream is to be able to love to Toronto.

I am not in a huge rush, and am looking for a place that I can see myself staying for a long time.

Because I am not in a rush, I definitely don't want my current boss or team to think I have one foot out the door or know that I am looking just yet. I don't want to mess up my current working relationships or cause tension when I am just starting to dip my toes into the job pool and may still be in my department for a while.

Here is where my question comes into play. In my meetings and work across departments, I met someone who is on a team that does work that I think I would like to move into. I emailed her and asked if I could get her department and job title, as I have been thinking about where I want my career to go, and her team seemed intriguing, so I wanted to keep an eye out for any openings there. She gave me the title, and also gave me the name of her boss, and said that he would be happy to discuss things further with me. I reached out to him, and he said to put a meeting on our calendars.

Now, as far as I know, this department isn't currently hiring, but this could certainly be a foot in the door, so I want to handle this opportunity well. The problem is, that I would need to sent the meeting invite to him using Teams, where my boss and team also have access to my calendar and can see anything I put in it. If I want to use annual leave for the meeting, it needs to be labeled as such in my calendar for payroll, but then it would also appear that way to the person I would be meeting. I'm not sure what title would be generic enough to not raise eyebrows on my team, or how to handle taking the call during work. I do work from home, so I won't have to worry about anyone overhearing the call itself."

They’re doing this with other employees one-on-one, too.
I’ve been in this role under a year. 

But honestly:

- the start with this job was frankly really bumpy - like, they expected that I’d know as much as possible about the job 2 weeks in, they took the person that was onboarding me off a week in, and I was one of many new hires (though I was a transfer from another part of the company). So - even though I know it’s a common experience across multiple jobs, it hadn’t been the culture in the other part of the company I was in so I was surprised this happened, especially when I was promised a longer period of having onboarding. 

- the work is frankly a lot more than it was in a different part of the company I was in - and from talking to others that came from other parts of the company in similar roles to the ones we’re in this area asks a *lot* more than typical positions. I spend 60+ hours and still can’t catch up on my workload. I’ve had conversations tactfully with my direct supervisor about how to prioritize the work to attempt mitigating this, and they haven’t had the best clue because their plate is too full. They’ve also had contradicting statements about getting overtime so I have felt deeply uncomfortable asking.

- one of my parents passed away unexpectedly during my probationary period so I was out for a stretch of time, and I’ve still been trying to recover since then from it both work-wise and personally (additionally I think it’s worth noting that I had taken bereavement leave with support from my direct supervisor so I could handle affairs, then one of my other supervisors made comments about how I’d been out and they have more sway on who stays and who they fire, so I’ve been deeply uncomfortable about taking time off as a result). 

- because of the discomforts I have been looking for a new job since about a month in. I started my search back up a month and a half after my parent’s passing, took a break from it for my mental health - which has been poorly from the aforementioned items - and during the holidays, and am getting back to it this week. I haven’t gotten bites on interviews yet.


So realistically my goals are really just to focus on my health, and personal things, and just do what I need to do to catch up and continue training so I can be successful enough to at least meet expectations, including just setting boundaries so that I get better at at least protecting my health. 
I just don’t know if I even feel comfortable telling that to that boss if/when we meet. 

If I find a new job then that’ll be fine, I just don’t think this position is possible to be held onto long-term without harming my health further. (I will continue being there til I find the new job because my parents’ passing set me back on my savings, in helping pay for expenses and the gas between the places related). 
 
I don’t know how to approach this meetup - and I don’t even know if I want to do this meetup. Looking for suggestions. 

tl;dr: Boss (not supervisors) is meeting with me and other employees one-on-one to talk through goals and see how how things are going. I am searching for other jobs because red flags have popped up while I’ve been at this job (less than a year), and because my health has declined dramatically since being at this job. 
Do I be honest about just focusing on boundaries and health while meeting expectations, or do I say something different?

Edit: I realize it’s possible that even though they’ve asked for feedback before they were not in the mind space position for feedback - even though they asked - but because they also have asked before then disregarded the concerns I brought up cordially I do get a sense I won’t be heard this time either."

an interesting opportunity for a job in another workplace has come up which is $25k AUD MORE per year than my current job. However they are not flexible on part time arrangements even for one semester. the thing is, this job is exactly in a strange niche i have carved for myself also. I didnt even know this job existed until recently and I am very interested. I am yet to actually apply, though I have contacted them with some more questions. They have indicated there are potentially other rounds or expression of interest pathways i can consider in future, but won't promise that (obviously).

what would you do?
Apply?
attempt an interview at least?
take the job if offered, and work and study full time to graduate in June?
delay graduation by 6 months by dropping a subject (i really reallyyyy dont want to do this)
dont apply?
apply as an expression of interest?
wait to see if there is another opportunity in 6 months? (who knows)

i am quite lost

edit: i know i might not even get the job anyway, but it might take me two days to work on the application. is that worth it right now?

thank you!!"

I've moved up in the company over the years and have always been genuinely happy... until I needed to move. When I moved, my boss proposed the idea to start a location in the large city I moved to. Fast forward 8 months, and I'm struggling. 

In short, my boss lacks communication and mentorship.  I'm constantly having to remind my biss about set meetings we have, or contact the boss multiple times before I get any response. My annual review was supposed to be 2 weeks ago (I had to initiate this...) but my boss never contacted me with a meeting time. Then, the business was closed for 2 weeks for the holidays. I was expecting to hear from her today but still did not. 

Do I contact her again about my annual review or wait a few more days and then call my boss on her BS?"

I literally could not be any more miserable with my current job (remote 9-5).

I'm 21y/o and have recently developed a great passion for fundraising, charity events, or any job that requires event planning like maybe an assistant to a wedding planner or smth (idk if that's even a thing lol, but I'd love to be able to attend events and go to venues, do the catering for my job)

I wanna expand my social network, but I'm so lost, I don't know where to start, I've always had extreme social anxiety but I'm getting better at coping with it and now I'm at a point where I actually want to meet/talk to people as opposed to staying home all day.

where do I start? Most people in my circle work in totally different fields, like construction, childcare, etc, so I have no connection, nor do I have any experience, closest field I worked in was a sales associate job, which I stayed at for 6-7 months.

Any advice will be appreciated. the thought of planning events, visiting venues, etc gets me so excited and I wanna give it a try. thanks!!"

3,2023-01-02,Job application + interview help/what's a red flag?,u/VanguardIsTerrible,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/101ydsd/job_application_interview_helpwhats_a_red_flag/,jobs,"Hey everyone,

I've been having a lot of trouble getting a job beyond part-time/short term contract work, and it's really discouraging for me to see all my friends have stable, full-time jobs while I feel like I'm wasting my time, so I'm coming here for advice.

I'm located in NYC, I went to a good university, and I have a degree in Media Studies + Communications, so I've been trying to break into the entertainment industry, which I know was already an uphill battle. To make matters worse, I graduated in 2020 so COVID made much of the job hunt feel impossible to me. However, many of my friends with the same degree and trying to work in the same field have gotten full-time jobs so I'm not sure what my problem is.

I think my resume is pretty strong - I have a decent amount of experience from the past few years, plus a solid amount of skills listed. My school's career center is available to alumni, so I met with the center in August to fix my resume, so I'm not as worried about it as much right now.

For applying to jobs, I've been using handshake, indeed, glassdoor, [entertainmentcareers.net](https://entertainmentcareers.net), and more recently linkedin, and I've been emailing production studios my resume directly. For interviews I think I come off as professional, engaged, and enthusiastic, but I'm not sure what else I can do beyond that, so I have a few questions (but any additional advice beyond them would be beyond appreciated).

1. Are there any other resources you recommend I use for finding open positions? Especially for entertainment-oriented careers
2. Is there anything you recommend I do once I submit an application? Indeed recommended reaching out to an employer once I submit, do you think it's genuinely helpful even if it's something simple as ""Hey I just sent in my resume, I just wanted to make sure you got it because I'd love the position, looking forward to hearing from you"" etc?
3. When submitting an application: is it a red flag to mark off identity-related questions as ""prefer not to disclose""? I have epilepsy, and I worry that despite the Equal Opportunity Employer tag, unconscious bias would move me to the bottom of the pile, so I've left all identities (Usually race/gender/veteran status/ability-disability) blank. Is it better to be upfront about it on an application because answering all of them as ""prefer not to disclose"" is a red flag, or is leaving them blank just to be safe fine?
4. For interviews:
   1. Beyond the usual ""Dress/act professional, be enthusiastic/affable etc."" are there any tips you have? Even small things like ""never spend more than a 30 seconds answering a question"" or something.
   2. Are there any questions you recommend I avoid asking/other behaviors that are an instant red flag to employers?
   3. Are there any questions you think I *should* ask during my time that would make an employer remember me?
5. How necessary are:
   1. Cover letters? I've submitted cover letters for jobs I'd genuinely be excited for, but I don't do them every time. Do employers really read them/do they really make that much of a difference?
   2. Using linkedin? I use it for finding out what positions are available/what companies are hiring, and my profile is up to date, but I never make posts, connect with or contact companies/others unless I already know them. Does linkedin help that much?

Thank you in advance!

I’m trying to be as brief as possible. I (22F) have been working in customer support for more than a year now. I quit my previous job in November, took a few days off then started my current one. It is still customer service but more on the IT side, which I honestly prefer, however only 1,5 months in and I already feel overwhelmed. 

I work in the afternoon shift from M-F (2.30pm-11pm) and I cannot get used to it at all. Two months seem like a very short amount of time to adjust to a new workplace and its pace in general, but I am truly trying. The benefits are way better than in my previous job, but I feel like 9-5 was rather for me. 
During January we must stay overtime every day for a few weeks, which means I have to work until midnight. I might seem like a crybaby (perhaps I really am, dunno), but I personally do not feel this would benefit my mental/physical health in the near future. I am constantly tired, since I’m an early bird no matter how sleepy or tired I am, I always wake up around 6.30-7.30
Also, anxiety really took over me, I catch myself crying during almost every shift, because we get so many incoming contacts that I can barely go and take a break. 

I have already talked to my supervisor about changing shifts, but long story short, there is no way to move to the morning shift anytime soon.

How would you handle such situation? Would you quit asap if you’d feel that things won’t work out?"

I was told that the recruiter would organise the time next week and we would have our meeting. 

Next week comes, the day I am supposed to speak to him, she (the recruiter) says that she will reorganise as the date is inconvenient for me. The date we had this interview I was able to make it, but I was very busy at the same time so it would have been better to reorganise but I could have managed to make it if I had to and I had communicated this to her. She says she will reorganise and let me know, doesn’t get back to me holidays come. I can’t contact the interviewer, nor can I contact the recruiter because she is on holidays. I get back to her today as holidays are over, and she just plainly says the jobs been taken and to contact someone else to maybe have a look for other jobs. 

If you are from the UK beware of this company please, assessment day ran way over and the recruiters really don’t care.

Long story short - One of my relatives lost his job as a caretaker of a huge farm (alongwith family) and is desperately looking for jobs. It will be much helpful if you could suggest any jobs in unskilled sector or anything else which could help in guiding their job search. 🙏

Background - 
One of my relatives (along with family) have lost their job during the pandemic. They were working as  caretakers of a huge farm (Husband and wife) for many years, but due to the takeover of property by the owner's sons and their internal property dispute, for some reasons they had to leave the job. They were living with their family (husband, wife and 2 children) in the farm, taking care of the owner, fields, cattle and everything else required and had a good bond with the old owner.
 Now, that the job is gone, they've moved back to their own village and the husband is trying desperately to find a job for 2-3 months but couldn't land up with one reliable one. 
His family are very close to us and they are extremely good, hardworking, sensible people hailing from a small village in uttrakhand (India). It is very difficult to see such nice people in trouble. The husband is good built man.
So, I wish to ask you guys if you could suggest some good options for jobs in the unskilled sector which will guide our job-search for them in that direction. Any help will be much appreciated. 
Thank you for your time.🙏"

A lot of people with the company are surprised I was hired into such circumstances, could’ve been corporate wasn’t aware of the situation when assigning me to my first team, who knows. At this point I’m not confident my manager won’t just write me off and dump me and try again with a fresh start on someone else. 

I’ve put out some resumes and feelers around the industry and city and the response has been positive. I have enough saved to get me through a couple months with unemployment (in my state an employee can only be denied unemployment if the company can prove they committed willful misconduct. Being a bad fit or poorly trained doesn’t count I would’ve had to been leaking company secrets or be harassing people) 

The thing I’m really dreading is having to go through the process of being “the new guy” all over again. Going through company training and email set up all after the experience of wasting months at a job that never really transitioned me out of being a “new hire”. I’m especially nervous since given my circumstances it’s likely to seem that I have much more experience than I do, and I’m worried going too much into detail about what happened will either make me out to be a slow learner or overly negative"

I started a new job in September. When I started, the agreement was I am allowed to WFH two days out of the week. This is a company wide policy in place since COVID. My WFH days we agreed upon are Tuesday and Thursday. 

When I got to my first holiday, Thanksgiving, we were off Thursday and Friday in the week. My boss told me since I was off two days in that week that I wasn’t able to WFH and instead had to come into the office on my WFH day, Tuesday.

Every holiday since she’s done this. To me, it’s just an act of control as no one else in the office is subject to this rule. On the days she makes me come into the office, there’s no meeting I have to attend, training or in person collaboration I’m doing. My job is in data and all the work I do is easily done from a computer. There is no value to coming into the office on my WFH day.

Does this sound ridiculous to any one else? How can I professionally counter this? 

Thank you for any help offered."

I don't really know what I want out of this post, maybe just sharing some thoughts.   
I am new in my industry and after an internship I am in my first real paying job for the past 6 months. It has been very challenging for me, I am struggling with expectations and not really knowing my way around things. 

Saying that, I have learned a lot, so many new things for me which is great! But I am currently unmotivated and I barely work. This leads to me feeling guilty about underperforming, but I don't really have anyone to share that other than my manager. 

I am apparently burnt out, but I am not sure how I want to continue. Do I just try to get over it and continue? Do I look for a new job? My plan was to stay at this company for 1-1.5 year, that way I will have enough experience to get a good new job and also not feel like I have taken advantage of my current employer. The current job is good paying and everyone working there is nice, but I never felt I fit in and I am working mainly alone which is getting lonely and hard to overcome obstacles.

Not really a question, would just love to hear any thoughts."

1,2023-01-03,Which job offer should I accept?,u/hewehh223,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1029csr/which_job_offer_should_i_accept/,jobs,"I received two job offers and I can’t decide which one to accept. I just finished a 3 year contract as a project manager in social research. It has been a good job, good conditions, however I lost my focus on economics and really did management only. My previous background is in policy and economics, I want a job where I learn new skills and retain a focus on economics and policy. It’s not necessarily my passion, but I am interested in this field and I think it provides me good career prospects. 

Job #1: Policy consultant at a think tank: will be doing project coordination in the beginning and contributing to papers later on as I get onboarded in the content. Generally the think tank works on interesting topics, but I suspect I will be working on a bit more boring ones based off of the interviews. The salary is a step down from my current salary, the job would require relocation, but the work mode is mainly remote, so I would be flexible to spend time in different places. However, there are absolutely no perks, no moving allowance no travel allowance nothing. Also it is a 1 year contract… they say they would want to extend after that, if it is possible, but there is no guarantee, so there is a risk. 

Job#2: Expert at a central bank: will be working on current policy issues, forecasting, reports. They offer trainings In Econometrics which has been my weak area so far. I think I will learn a lot overall and get away from the management trap, where I would coordinate but not be part of content and analysis. However, salary is lower (both compared to my last job and to the policy consultant job) and will require relocation (to my home country which I left 15 years ago) with very limited remote work option. Contract is permanent. Perhaps this one offers quite good career prospects later, as it is a type of experience which is more difficult to get usually. 

There is a third option, which is to continue looking - I could afford that for a while. 

Additional considerations: I’m in a process of separation from long term partner, my personal life is a mess. I wish to build a more stable situation for myself. My life is spread over 3-4 countries with family, jobs, friends, (ex?) partner all in different places. 

Idk what to do! Any advice?"

I've been in my current role since August, and since we're a brand new department, large projects have been few and far between up until the past month or so. The way we've been assigned projects is in pairs of associates and leads. I'm the associate in the pair, and my lead is essentially incompetent. She asks me for advice for how to do common job tasks for the industry we're in, I'm constantly having to remind her to reply to emails that we're both cc'ed on (the lead is supposed to be the one in direct contact with clients), and she just genuinely seems to have absolutely no idea what is going on. I feel like I'm being forced into the position of having to take the lead on this project, with regards to project management, planning, client communication, subject matter expertise, and just overall grunt work. And for some reason my manager has assigned her as my lead for every single project I'm on (I think she might have asked to work with me...), so I don't even get to work with any of the competent leads who are actually mentoring and training their associate partners. So I'm trying to figure out how to handle this initial large project. Should I defer to my lead's ""leadership,"" do my assigned job duties, and let her take the fall if the project is inevitably a hot mess? Or do I go above and beyond and leverage this project to show that I'm performing at the level of one of the leads and ask for a promotion? My lead is a genuinely nice person, and I think she would vouch for me if I were to go that route. However, I work for a city government so there's no guarantee getting a promotion to a new role would be open to me even if my manager were to think I was deserving of one. Raises, also, are automatic and baked into our union contract. I don't want to throw her under the bus (especially because it seems like she's struggling with pretty severe anxiety and ADHD, and she's basically admitted to me that it affects her work), but I also don't want to do work that is significantly above my pay grade (there's a $20k difference between our salaries) without the pay to match."

Recently myself and five other supervisors were demoted at our company due to restructuring. Ie: there are not enough people in the building to justify keeping so many leads. The company kept those with the most seniority, even though one of them has less experience in the supervisor role. We have been forced not one, but two ranks down, back to the very bottom. Most of us had decent mid-grade positions before we were promoted to supervisors, and we cannot even get those original jobs back because there are no open positions. We are all taking a 5/hr pay cut but with the promise of getting our supervisor positions back when our production increases. However, they hired too many supervisors to begin with, and if they go by seniority again, myself and a fellow lead that started at the same time pretty much have no chance. 

They have told us to hold out and that things will improve. My mom and boyfriend are all telling me to stay even though I despise my current downgraded position and it has reminded me why I worked so hard to get out of it in the first place. I am currently going to school for business administration (the current program is with emphasis on operations management) so I am torn between riding it out to finish school which will still be a few years, or jumping ship now. 

I have worked at this company for over five years, and have been a supervisor for two years. One of the other leads that got demoted was even a fill-in manager...and this is what the company does. I guess I should be happy to keep my benefits, but this whole process has been humiliating. Any advice is appreciated. So what should I do? Stay or jump ship? I should add that I asked for an apprenticeship for a planner position. Management said that it should be fine but they have to sort out the details. Although I haven't heard anything back about it yet. 

Thanks in advance! 

TL;DR: Got bumped back to the bottom."

Would a scam send me to lapcorp to do a drug test/etc etc? More fears below. Thanks 

So I applied with a large dream company multiple times since the summer, and each time was pretty much auto-rejected. I applied for a third professional level position in mid September as a just throw a dart attempt. Knowing no one at the company and doing zero networking. 

Background, I am in my late 30s and been in this field for close to 15 years, but the field is being battered right now due to outside circumstances. So lots of people in my field are and have been out of a job in this field for months, maybe even a year now. 

This company interviewed me in September and it went well. The interviewer said he has no problem moving me on to the next round. Then I don’t hear anything for twoish+ weeks. I reach out and ask whats going on, they apologize and schedule me for a second interview. It goes well again, they say they love me experience and want me to move onto a final round and a writing assessment. And also, that they are recommending me for not a professional level, but same position at a senior level. 

I dont hear from them for almost a month, and I reach out again. They apologized again and scheduled me for my final interview and send the writing assessment instructions same day. Complete the interview and assessment and am unsure how this round went. But the next week i got a call saying they want to offer me the opportunity. 

Here is where my anxiety comes from. I was one of the thousands of people who was laid off this year in my field and took a similar but lesser paying job in a different field, and now this offer is in my field but a safer position. The offer is for more money than ive ever made in my life, significantly. This is almost a $70K raise in base alone, and about 25K more than my most successful position. The benefits are life changing. Ive always been poor, I didnt finish college. I was raised poor but happy. This will be life changing. 

But so they perform a background and criminal check, pass both and i see the reports. They asked me questions about my one prior employer because the dates didnt fully align, but passed once cleared up. Scheduled me for a drug test with quest/labcorp. Did it, the technician even confirmed the test is for the company I am talking about. Passed that too.

Now last week I get workday links to complete all tasks prior to my start date next week and that I will receive a UPS Priority tracking number with my new laptop and etc etc. My schedule for my first two days has been provided and then im told ill be handed off to my manager. 

My “anxieties”? Im being scammed. The offer alone being so high scares me. Im told by my loved ones that Ive worked hard for a long time and shown success at all levels, and that someone is finally recognizing that. Other fears? Some spelling mistakes in emails, the fact that I had to contact them at each stage. The health care package is EXACTLY what ive been looking for for years. It all just feels too good to be true. 

Would a scam job send you to a drug test? I said I wont officially celebrate until my laptop is in hand. Would a scam send you laptop and other equipment? This opportunity is literally life changing, I hope and pray its real."

Difficulties of getting into this field aside - I'm VERY aware of how tough it is to break into academia - I just graduated this week with a BA, and I am applying to MA and PhD programs, as well as intensive summer preparatory programs (mostly in language studies). To make ends meet, I've also been applying to jobs, and I received two offers of employment.

One offer is a teaching gig at a unionized high school, paying a pretty handsome rate. I live in a city, so the pay and the type of work could both be pretty appealing for me. At the same time, I know that there are insane teacher shortages and it feels scummy to do a job until June and then leave for a summer program + grad school for an indefinite length of time. 

The other offer is a consulting role at a small firm. It seems like they could use my help, since I have data analysis skills that no one else on the team has, but the pay rate is half that of the teaching gig. It's also not directly in my field, which makes me wonder whether it is a good career move to make, especially considering that, like the teaching role, I'll have to leave after 5-ish months to pursue graduate study. The one really bright side to this job is that I'd have the space to audit classes at my university and serve as a TA for an introductory class, which would provide me probably the change for another month's rent.

I can't not work. Before now, I've lived below the poverty line, and I've struggled to make rent for months. I really don't know what to do here. Any advice would be appreciated, either in terms of professional development or in terms of financial health."

I would like some advice, or experiences dealing with my situation. I'm nearing my mid-thirties, and I've had a rough time the last couple of years finding a steady job that I like. At its core: finding a job at my intellectual level. I've not really felt challenged the last 5-6 years after I chose to change my career.. I'm a little stuck with myself and the situation I'm experiencing now.

I've recently been put on exit from my previous job, which was a good thing in hind sight. I've worked as a professional game-journalist for 4 years and my education focusses on media, communication and marketing. Most of my experience (RL) was as a content producer specialized in video. My boss felt I had a lot of potential, but I got severely demotivated after my boss (the founder) was fired, and my new boss and I weren't a good match. This job back then was my life and passion, but I sadly turned my hobby into a job which I didn't enjoy as much anymore. This was 10 years ago. Five years ago I've had a hard time finding a entree level job within my field. My freelance journalism experience was a risk for a few too many employers, and my bravado/enthusiasm at times felt like arrogance to them. In hindsight, I was too confident with the lack of RL experience I had in their eyes (which was correct, mostly). My previous field (game-journalist for a paid website), rarely to never matched the classic marketing/video fields and the interviews never landed. Something that I was quite good at, when I was still at school.

I finished my school, and worked in various fields (all temp jobs), the last couple of years this was the wood/steel/construction industry, mostly office positions. I've learned, that most of these jobs aren't what I want and become stale/boring too quickly. I'm a problem fixer, and rarely to never got to do that, or did it so well I made myself irrelevant for the company (which was the case at my last job).

My main problem is experience with the marketing industry, or better said: a lack there off. 

For the last 10 years I've not worked as a marketeer, I've only been sparring or giving advice, and only sparingly. I've finished school, but I couldn't get an entree job during Corona. Fast forward a few years and I'm quite literally behind on the marketing field. I still did some jobs as a content creator, but only the trivial/smaller jobs. Now the B2B business generally is behind when it comes to marketing. So the fact that my knowledge isn't up to date, isn't THAT big of a deal. It is much easier to cherry pick the best strategies and models, in an industry that is roughly 10 years behind on modern companies.

Here comes a second part, I kinda despise how marketing is used in most fields, as I can't stand selling a product I don't support. Which is 90% of the marketing industry. The irony being... I'm good at it, but don't like manipulating people. I understand marketing theories and generally am good at pitching idea's. But I've not yet organized large-scale campaigns other than community events.

So here comes an opportunity that feels like an opportunity of a lifetime. I've recently come into contact with a marketeer and business owner my age who's background is business management. After his struggle to find what he is passionate about, he's working as a marketeer for different companies and he's looking to expand.

Right now he is actively looking for his **first** hire. I have experience with his category of clients/companies. Lots of production, wood, metal, construction the ""masculine"" fields basically. Fields that I support, because they are building the world we live in, and don't try to sell you an idea or concept. Everything you do, directly and indirectly helps companies create the world of tomorrow. He will help me and coach me 1 day a week. I will work for his clients 3 days a week. 32 hours a week, on average. No car, I will get a laptop and phone and some kilometer allowance to cover some of the traveling costs. Some of his clients however, live in the middle of nowhere. Which means I have to use public transport which is twice as expensive as the travel allowance I'll receive. And will take me twice as long. 

But here comes my issue.

The last few years I've come to learn that I don't function at my best working under someone. I've always naturally took a leadership role towards myself and love coaching people. I'm a top-down thinker with a lot of people skills and my biggest drive in life is to tackle one societal issue during my lifetime. Which I want to achieve in 10-20 years. But I don't have any experience starting a company. I barely know how to build capital to get to that point. 

I do know that working under someone, with no promise for a 50-50 partnership the first years. Is a risk. My ambitions aren't going to be satisfied if I can't lead a team, if I can't coach/mentor people or have responsibility. Yet... I have zero experience outside of small-time projects for a company to hire me as a manager yet. I simply lack real life experience. School, hobbies and project leading all taught me I have it in me. But even I wouldn't hire myself, with a lack of real life experience leading/managing people for actual companies. To put it plain, it's potential in waiting. I need more RL experience. Working under someone, I have to prove and show I actually have it in me.

My mind is telling me that working with/for this business owner, fire up my marketing skills once more and learn beside him, how to get customers, how to create real life campaigns, how to basically run a company. My mind is telling me to just take this job and take the risk. I will certainly learn a lot of new things and familiarize myself with this industry in a very short time. This might be the best chance to get back into my old field, which I've given up years ago.

But my main issue is this. I feel like I want the job my potential future boss has. I feel like I want to contribute to the world differently. I feel like my passion in life, won't be satisfied by this job. It might just be a lesson to get there. And my values tell me... it's a bit of a dick move to accept a job knowing I might step aside and start to do my own thing a couple of years later. It now feels like I will use this (honestly) entree job to start my own company one day. I've spend a LOT of time understanding how I need to have my own capital, if I ever want to start to contribute to the world. Something I can't do working under someone. Which has become a pattern. I've always been at my best when I was leading my own projects and had a big say in things. I've started two video teams with succes, yet I've never really been leading anything with real consequences. In that regard, video is very safe. You make something, get paid and move on. 

I have this doubt I can't really put into words. A brain that is telling me to ""take a risk"" and just say yes. It isn't my company. I won't become partner any time soon. I feel my ambitions are holding me back, indirectly. I feel like I need to shush my ambitions for now, and just accept that I need to prove myself once again. My potential employer is giving me a chance to build **his** company with him and see what we can offer companies/clients. He wants to contribute to the world in his own way, and he hopes that this company will allow him to do that.

I can still reach my own goals, helping him along. Maybe I'll be surprised and become passionate about it again. But he's just starting out with his own clients and two years of experience. He's still searching for his core purpose in life. He's my age, with a young family. He will coach me, but I have to learn all the new tricks of the trade within my old field again. And I'm not sure if I'm passionate enough to do so. I love the concept phase and creating plans, I have almost no experience realizing actual campaigns. And I already know I have to figure out 75% myself, because he can only coach me 1 day a week, learning me how he works and what I have to do. There is a real chance I am ""just"" his employee, even in 5 years. This industry generally only makes people their partner if you bring tons of clients as well. I have zero. If I have the ambition to become partner, I have to work REALLY hard to get there. To build on something that I don't own, didn't start, that has potential... but with a real chance of disappointment in the end.

My logical and rational side (""if I was a dad to myself"") are telling me ""just do it"". My feelings however... are telling me that I have a doubt I need to take serious.

And as a side-note. My mother noticed I lost my enthusiasm for this potential job after new years eve. And if I'm 100% honest, if my potential employer would change his mind and decide not work together? I won't even be that disappointed. For a lack of better words, it might feel freeing. Which stands opposite to what my rational side is telling me.

I feel that taking this job, might be a little egocentric ""with a chance at potential"", but if I don't take it. I'm at the same exact point I was at: I still lack experience. 

I still don't know exactly what I want. I will still play with the idea to start my own company, and only have a few shallow idea's on how to realize them. None of those ideas contribute to the world, but it might allow me to build early capital, so I can start moving towards my ultimate goal. An ultimate goal I feel I won't achieve, working under someone within the Marketing industry.

I don't know if I should take this job, and just take the risk. Not taking it, won't get me any step forwards towards my goals either.

I might just have gotten this job offer a little too soon? Sometimes when there is doubt, it is clear not to do it. But tactically speaking... this is the best job offer I've gotten the last 4 years, and not finding out what it might bring... I might regret more, than trusting a vague feeling which feels as doubt. I absolutely have a good feeling about my potential employer, in a different context we could be friends (first two impressions).

I would really appreciate some experiences from people having gone through a similar process, and what choices you have made. This is the first time in years my 'doubt' feels different, than cases where I knew deep down it was a bad choice. I don't think this is a bad choice, I don't feel like this is a dead end. I don't feel like I will get bored. I just realized I would rather do what my future employer is doing right now, and not start from the bottom and learn a craft I don't want to become an expert at, knowing at some point I'll switch towards my real ambitions.

(But I have to start somewhere right?)"

Has anyone been in a position where a job offer was rescinded after trying to negotiate salary? Here is background on the situation:

My spouse was extended a job offer. They worked with an independent recruiter during the hiring process, and attempted to negotiate the salary. The number was not a number pulled out of the air, research was done to ensure it was a fair number based on their skills, and market value, etc. The company came back and said they weren't budging. My spouse verbally accepted the offer the same day the company replied, and received word that the company was eager to have them come on board.

Well. After the weekend, the recruiter reached out to my spouse over text and essentially said ""XXX is retracting their offer. Your request rubbed them the wrong way."" I know that employment in most states is at will, and the written offer did not come through, so they can do whatever they want. But isn't negotiating salary a common thing to go? Although I know it happens, I was under the impression a company rarely rescinds job offers based on the applicant attempting to negotiate their salary. Perhaps I am wrong. A background check,  drug check, reference check was not performed so it seems this is purely because of the negotiation.

I'm not looking to sue or anything, just looking to see if maybe companies rescinding job offers solely based on this is more common than we were led to believe. My spouse is knee deep in the job hunt so input would be appreciated!"

I was offered a job with the Federal government and gave my notice last Friday.

Since then, I've yelled back at card holders and told a manager what a douche he is to everyone. 

I've had problems with my voice for the last month and had to call in this morning to take PTO so I could go get some tests done for my doctor who wants to rule out cancer in my larynx. Neither of us believe that's what it is, but it needs to be ruled out.

When I called in, I called the Manager on Duty line, which is perfectly acceptable, instead of calling the attendance line. I was groggy, it was really early, I'd just gotten up, etc.

Anyway, just as we're about to hang up from the call, this manager (who is known for being a toxic a-hole to pretty much everyone BUT people above him in the hierarchy) says, in a gruff voice, ""You've been here long enough to know *THIS* isn't the place to call for this, but I'll take care of it *THIS* time.""

Normally, I'd let something like that roll off me knowing this guy is a well-known douche. BUT.. with the warm knowledge I'd already turned in my notice, I said, ""AXEL (not his real name) I'm going to the hospital to get some tests done to make sure I don't have cancer of the larynx, but yeah, you're right, now's EXACTLY the right time to flex so you can feel superior to me.""

He asked me when I was coming back to work so he could get the write up for insubordination started. It felt SO good to tell him I'd already turned in my notice to go to work for the base commander and IDGAF what he does.

I signed the waiver for HireRight to complete my background check in mid October and have been waiting seven weeks for a background clearance to-date. I keep getting the same tired excuse that California is taking longer than expected to return employee background checks because of litigation that resulted in a change in the clearance process in 2021. The funny thing is that I have a friend who received a clearance in two days, and he lives in the same county as me!
I have called HireRight about 100 times; they have “expedited” my background clearance process with their third party agency that actually conducts the clearance process 10 times now in seven weeks. That’s right- HireRight uses a third party to conduct background checks. This is the most frustrating experience in my entire job-seeking career. I’m stuck waiting for my clearance, and I have no criminal history!"
0,2023-01-03,What’s the skinny on directly applying to a position a staffing agency told you about?,u/cozy_sweatsuit,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/102hbt5/whats_the_skinny_on_directly_applying_to_a/,jobs,"The main point of staffing agencies seems to me, as an employee, to get in the way and demand things of me while keeping me from learning anything important about the position (like salary). I much prefer to speak to companies directly. 

Sometimes a staffing agency will cold call or cold email me with a position that sounds interesting, or I’ll come across what looks like a great opportunity on LinkedIn or ZipRecruiter or whatever thinking it’s a company, and turns out it’s a staffing agency posting. 

Recently this happened and I was really interested in hearing back. The staffing agency wasn’t giving me anything back and was borderline ignoring me after I gave them my info and application, so I found an actual job posting from the company itself and applied directly. 

Now I get a call from the agency pissed off that I went around them, saying that it makes him redundant. Well, yeah buddy, that’s the point. You’re in the way!

Another time this happened the guy was super annoying, constantly calling and emailing with minimal info and asking to set up calls at the most inconvenient times. I got suspicious that it might not even be a real job so I called the company they named, which turned out to be a SECOND staffing agency which then told me the name of the actual company. I finally got a real interview with the company itself, which was itself a subprime contractor, ended up not taking it for a variety of reasons, but it was legit. Then the first staffing agency starts calling wanting to know why I didn’t take it and STILL said that the job was with the second recruiting company. Which it definitely wasn’t. I gave up arguing that point. 

However, despite the annoyance, I have gotten legit interviews through these agencies eventually and some pretty good opportunities. My understanding was that they are parasites that ruin job sites with their bullshit listings and spam your info trying to jam you into a poor fit before ultimately selling all your info to advertising companies. But now I’m realizing that companies, even reputable ones, seem to enjoy working through them and use them intentionally. 

So did I have it all wrong? Is it wrong to try to go around recruiting agencies like this?"

I went ahead and messaged the hiring manager responding to his email and said I was available anyways. I just got an email back setting up the phone interview.

But since I was rejected from the system I'm not quite sure how to proceed. Could this be a system error? Or could I already be rejected and he doesn't know (which doesn't seem very plausible).

Should I even bring this up in the interview? I'm not wanting to screw this up as this could be a dream job for me.

Unfortunately, I'm unable to answer any of them which is really frustrating me. It's a customer service WFH job, so I'm trying not to to be so negative, but it's hard not to be when it feels like I've just been thrown to the wolves. I can only transfer calls because of ""my level of training,"" which is what my supervisor always says whenever I ask her a question. It's maddening because customers wait on hold for a long time, and if they're connected to me, I can only transfer them. 

It's really making me want to quit this job. I already quit one after nine months because it was not only toxic, but they gave me the worst training known to man, and then expected me to know the answer for everything. I feel like working period has screwed up my mental health. I've been in customer service since I was 16.

At this new job, we were given two days of training, which basically consisted of showing us how to search for the customers account and transfer, which isn't rocket science. But we aren't allowed to go over anything in the account. I've had several customers get upset because I couldn't help them, which us understandable. Then they have to be on hold for another hour. I don't see how it helps to hire people just to take calls and transfer them if they're unable to assist the caller. 

I suspect a few people quit, but in at a rock in a hard place because I live with family and had plans to move out soon. If I decided to quit for my mental health, they'd threaten to put me out...so I have to suffer through this job. It has only now started to feel this way after working almost a month with them. I'm trying to hold out in the hopes that it gets better, but every day now feels like torture. 

I'm grateful to work from home, but I have no idea how people in the past were able to survive working several years for people without going mad. I'm literally at my desk crying because I'm painted in a corner with no way out. I also feel the need to point out I went almost two years at one point not working because I got sick to the point where I couldn't walk properly. My doctors suspect I have FND. I never got an official diagnosis, but I believe I got better physically by doing yoga and changing my diet. However, mentally I'm still suffering."

Need a bit of help here.

Going through a hiring phase at my company, and this time around my boss handed the lead on this effort to me.

So I got about 15 people to go through. He also mentioned that as the lead guy - I need to be less grilling in my interviewing and more of the ""overall feels"" guy. Up until this point I've always been the ""roast the candidate technically"" guy, but never the overall mediator guy. So I need a bit of advice on how to take on that role effectively.

What kind of questions should I be asking? 

What kind of insight or answer should I be gleaming?

I'm just used to a binary scale of ""this guy knows nothing, and this guy knows his shit"" so any advice would be appreciated.

Aside from all the general life problems it's caused me - missed opportunities that I lament over a lot - I'm now in the position where I might actually be let go from my job.

I work in marketing, not exactly my passion but I don't really have the skills for much else. And while my manager constantly assures me the work I produce is great, he's very concerned about my soft skills and all the other aspects of my job alongside the actual physical work I produce.

Basically, I'm expected to build a network and maintain relationships both in and outside of the company, have calls and regular catch ups, contribute vocally in meetings etc. 

Despite working here over a year, I've never quite gotten to the point where I feel comfortable reaching out to a LinkedIn connection and inviting them to hop on a call with me. Note - when I applied for the job, I did not know this was going to be a requirement of me, I thought I'd just be writing articles and reports (since my job title is copywriter).

So back in November I was put on a Performance Improvement Plan. I've got until the end of January to basically prove that I can build these relationships and connections without having to have my hand held by my manager. I just...don't think I can do it. I'm completely debilitated by shyness and unless someone is basically setting up meetings for me and telling me how to have conversations I literally cannot do it myself. 

So I guess my question is...what exactly can I do to stop being shy? Is there anything I can do? Or should I just get a job better suited to my personality?"

I have a second interview tomorrow with a full time position with a company I’ve been trying to work with for the past 6 months (I’ve applied for a few internships with them, all of which I was too far distance wise or too close to graduating so I wasn’t picked). While I was applying my last semester, since my job field near where I live is a bit spastic (every now and then a job pops up) I wasn’t getting any good jobs or anyone willing to wait a month or two for me to graduate. I applied to the masters program at my university since my current position would let me be a TA and pay for 60% of my tuition as long as I take 9 credits. 

I’m going to see how this interview goes but logically I should take the job since 1) it’s a job I want to do, 2) I’d rather get paid full time than minimum wage and part time and 3) I’m kinda done with school since I graduated a few weeks ago. I do feel a little bad since I’ve been with my current job for the last 2 years and they have been extremely accommodating and I’ve been pretty excited to be a TA for awhile. My old job knows I’ve been interviewing with companies but I have held the Masters program as a higher priority until recently since now classes start in a week and I’ve thought about jobs more than classes. I also considered doing part time masters and 10 hours or less with being a TA since it’s something I wanted to do but I wasn’t sure if I should tell the hiring manager I’m talking to about all of that (I know the company I’m interviewing with is open to their employees pursuing their masters but it depends on each team)."

So I am not sure what to do. Take a significant pay rise and have more free-time but in a job which isn't we close to my heart. Or stay, take a pay hit by refusing, less free time (longer commute) but a job I enjoy. What would you do?"

Then the recruiter had to change plans last minute bc the person I was supposed to shadow would be out that day and could do later next week. They asked if there was any way I could come in even though I told them I would be back at work by then and work during regular business hours. They’re unable to do a shadow after work hours or on a weekend. 

I’ve already used all my PTO/sick hours (on account of actually being sick all of last few months as I work with sick people a lot). I would have to risk coming in for the shadow and miss a day’s worth of wages in hopes
I actually get the job.

I got another interview this week but it’s over the phone, so maybe that will pan out better. But for now, I’m debating if I can afford to extend my vacation another day. Feels like I should re-evaluate my interest in the first one as I recall the hiring manager himself say there being organized chaos at that company.

Why is the pay so low in Ontario or am I doing something wrong. I graduated last year and started my first job at 50k at a defense company as an external hire (contract) which is what I made as an intern in my 3rd year. 6 months later I accepted a job in automotive, again as a external hire but i got a pay bump (approx. \~ 20%). I accepted the job cause I was getting higher pay compared to my first job and the work was more interesting but I've found out that my coworkers who are direct hires and in same positions as me are getting paid much more. The company has no plans to hire contractors directly and given how other OEMs are laying off its only a matter of time before it hits us. I've been applying to direct hire positions now more and I recently got a job offer but the base pay was around 60k, which is significantly lower than my current job and when I tried to negotiate they said that I dont have enough experience and my market value is not what I asked for. I've been working for 1.5yrs now and have 1.5yrs of internship experience as well. I declined the offer and have been applying to other places but so far all jobs I've applied to are on average paying less than how much I'm making rn.  


how should I negotiate for a higher paying job or should I accept what they give and just work my way up in the company? for some of the more experienced people here, approximately how much do you make now and after how many yrs of working did you get there?  


for background, reason i want to leave my current company is because there's no opportunities for to move up as a contractor and no room for growth professionally or in terms of compensation. Basically once my projects go into production I will potentially be laid off."

There are way too many cooks in the kitchen, who also are not good at what they do, and it is affecting my performance.

I’m looking for some advice on the best way to make a connection with the intention of gaining experience and ideally paid part time employment. 

The place I am interested in is a clinic that assesses and provides therapy for children and teens with mental health difficulties and developmental disorders (ASD, ADHD). 
Their staff are made up of psychologists, occupational therapists, and therapy assistants. 

I am a psychology student, have just completed my undergraduate and been accepted into my fourth honours year. I am also autistic myself and having had only two health care professionals with explicit lived experience I feel that, this is something that is invaluable and missing in a lot of health settings. 

I would be very interested to see if I could gain any kind of experience within this company as it would be massively beneficial for my postgraduate applications moving forward and would allow me to see if I am suited to this type of work. I also would hope that a facility that sees many neurodiverse people would be a more friendly workplace for someone like. 

I have some previous experience in support work but no experience with children. From my research I have the name and basic contact information for the owner of the clinic who works there as their head clinician. 

What is my best approach here? I have never made contact outside of applying for jobs that are advertised so I am not sure what the rules are for this type of situation.

Initially the agent and I had agreed that I would work service role and not do sales, as I was burnt out from my prior years and had no interest in calling and prospecting, and I made that Very clear from the start. She stated that that was fine because she was planning on just maintaining her current book of business. This did not end up being the case at all.
I was not aware of it when I signed on, but the one other employee was also under the impression that she was to be only service as well. When we met, I was expecting her to be doing the sales. Nope. We ended up divvying our tasks based on what we were good at. I hate answering phones so the other associate answers the phones, and I do all of the behind the scenes service work, which adds up to quite a bit and am cross selling a lot naturally as it’s been programmed in me to have initiative and be a high achiever. 

I gained approximately 80% of agency sales for the year just by cross-selling during service interactions via email (I am a natural and I hate it). I also earned 20 separate five star reviews within my first year. Six months, and I was promoted to manager, and now had a few more hats, including head of marketing and commercial business, in addition to all of the other tasks. 

We just met for our 2023 goals. The agent is super hyped around increasing the business and ramping up sales. Making calls to prospect and gain more clients, as well as adding to the current book of business. She would like for me and other team member to come up with our sales goals for the year and numbers I plan to achieve as well as contacting her entire book of business by phone to cross sell to other products. Her (agent) numbers/personal goals would not be included as she does not plan to sell anything other than life insurance (which she is only one licensed for). The poor other associate promptly messaged me that she knew she would not bring much to the table at all, as she is afraid to ask for a sale.

I’m feeling extremely overwhelmed, underpaid, and I appreciated as I have communicated all along with the agent that sales are draining for me, and I don’t want to do it anymore. It was presented as a service only job, and now it seems focused on sales and me as the primary breadwinner. The agent is rarely in the office, and when she is, she delegates plenty of service and sales tasks that were sent to her via email by the clients. I actually dread the days when she is in. 

I have reached a point where I have absolutely zero interest in the industry and in sales. My initiative at the start was first service, and I have completely been drained of all of my capabilities as I tend to go above and beyond. 

I would like to communicate this to her that I would like to change careers, and that this is no longer working for me because it wasn’t in our initial agreement to have me doing sales, and now I am the only person capable of doing it. 

She knows I have been of great value and an exceptional team member and manager, and I would love to have her as a reference for a future job.

I don’t want to give notice without having another job and income…that is the crux because I want her reference for the new job. For me it seems reasonable that she should hire a person specifically for sales, and that will relieve all of the stresses within the agency. I feel like if I word it well, it could be beneficial for her and myself, however I am concerned about not having a job, so I don’t want to quit or give notice yet. Should I have a conversation with her and hope that she provides a good reference?"

Me and my friend both work for the same organization, but different departments. There will be an opening on the same shift and department that he works at soon.I’m very interested in that position and am probably overqualified for it if I’m being honest and it would be a pay cut, but I am wanting to take a step back from my senior level position, it’s really taking a toll stress wise on my mental health. My friend has offered to introduce me to his boss, so I can get a leg up on the application and put a name with a face, but I’m worried I may not get hired because they may see this as me just trying to get on the same shift with my buddy.

So my question is - Because he already works here, on the same shift I’m pursuing, could that create some issues for the person hiring me out of concern for nepotism? He’s not like my roommate or anything like that, but I am worried he may not want to put the both of us on the same shift? Thoughts or advise? Thanks."

2,2023-01-03,Issue with background check after accepting offer (not anything I did) SORRY ITS LONG,u/Normal-Ad9562,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/102qvv7/issue_with_background_check_after_accepting_offer/,jobs,"So, I got an offer a couple weeks back for a job I am well qualified for (and really wanted) at a reasonably reputable hospital in my area. I was sent my hiring package prior to winter break, which with this company (and the job I just left, having put my two weeks in after accepting offer) was from the 23 of December until the 3rd of January.

 I submitted all my information through the hireright portal link that was sent to me, this being about the 3-5 time this company has done a background check on me the past 10 years or so. Nothing has ever been an issue previously with anything on my background checks, and I worked for the federal government for 5 years and had to undergo a much more thorough check. I stayed in contact with the person I had been communicating with during my interview and hiring process keeping him posted on what I had finished. Since the hospital area I was in was also closed for break, communication was sparse and somewhat laissez faire.

When I did not receive an onboarding package, I told said contact person and he told me more than likely it was because background checks were still behind, my area was closed, and basically don’t sweat it. I called hire right a couple times and was told my check was complete.

Today I came in to start and got an email that they had not received anything pertaining to my high school diploma or heard anything from the school district. The school district was also on break during this time frame, and it looks like they began the background check on the 23rd, and basically null and voided the school part after not hearing back from the school district (again, which was closed). 

I came in and met with the man I had been communicating with and he told me he would show me around but I needed to finish on boarding before I started. During the time between entering the building and when I read the email, I requested copies of my diploma or transcripts virtually to be sent to me, but this can take weeks. 

I left and continued to call the background check company (who again, never had an issue with and have never had anything come up on any background report) and they told me they couldn’t do anything. I emailed HR at the job I am supposed to be starting and got a similar run around, that they couldn’t do anything, contact the hire right company. Then they asked me to send them my diploma to send to hire right. 

I have my transcripts from my tech school/secondary training, but not my diploma. I graduated more than 15 years ago. The process to get this paper work will take weeks, and I am going to go to the school district tomorrow and pretty much beg for whatever they can give me but I am at a loss. I feel like I am about to lose a job I really want because of a stupid glitch that I suspected would happen initially because I was extra vigilant checking everything.

I will mention on top of this, when I got my offer and was asked to send references, they typically send out emails to references to give information thru a third party website similar to hire right, but I never got those emails: the guy I had been in contact with told me to simply have my references email him personally which was weird but I figured it was a glitch as well.

Has anyone had any experience with anything like this, or have any idea what to do? I’m beside myself, I left my previous job already and gave them notice and now I feel like I am totally screwed. I have rent and a kid and pets and I’m really stressed out.
Sorry this is so long, was just trying to be thorough. Thanks."

My problem is this person is wholly unreliable.

The few recruiters I've spoken to have given the feedback that this person isn't available when they call their office and doesn't reply to emails for correspondence. Because these potential employers are looking to hire NOW, I've been told that once they encounter issues with references they move onto another candidate.

So how do I approach this? I'm currently working on replacing this reference and letter of recommendation in my portfolio; but any interim fixes? 
For full disclosure, I am still currently employed and managed by this individual; and this is likely their way of preventing me from leaving."
22,2023-01-03,Bait and switch on hybrid remote flexibility,u/submarinedreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/102rssc/bait_and_switch_on_hybrid_remote_flexibility/,jobs,"Hi all, I just started a new job today that was advertised in both the job description and in the initial interview with HR as a hybrid remote job that required me to be in the office on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, and was WFH on Mondays and Fridays.


However today when I started and asked my hiring manager if I would be hybrid right away this week or if I would need to be fully trained up in person first, he said that it's not really a hybrid position except for instances of inclement weather, if I'm sick, or maybe at some point in the future working something out like working every other Friday from home.


I'm frustrated because I was lied to. I not only quit my job to take this new position, but I also turned down another job offer, because this role I accepted and started had the best benefits and pay (by a couple grand a year). However the other jobs that I quit/rejected were also hybrid and I feel that the time saved in commuting, getting ready, being able to move a load of laundry to the dryer on my lunch break, etc. are a  huge benefit that adds value to my daily life.


That said, the office is closer to home, hybrid working isn't really a necessity (just a convenience), it's in a field I want to be in, and it seems to have a good workplace culture (it's been rated a top place to work, has good benefits, overtime is rare), and has good room for professional development and promotions in future.


Should I cut my losses and quit because I was misled? Maybe ask for my old job back or see if the other job offer I rejected 3 weeks ago is still available. Or should I try and stick it out because being hybrid shouldn't outweigh the other good benefits?


Edit to add: I like my hiring manager so far. I don't feel like he bait-and-switched me. I feel like there must have been a breakdown in communication between him and HR or HR just made a mistake by telling me this/posting it in the job description. I have had bad jobs and bad managers before, I have a healthy level of cynicism. But I truly believe this miscommunication was an honest mistake, but I feel upset nonetheless."

The field I am trying to get into is data analysis/data science. Since graduating in May of 2022, I took about a month and a half off to travel with family and then I began applying. While I was applying I also completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate which gave me a good foundation for data analytical thinking along with some good technical skills like SQL, R, Tableau, and spreadsheets. 

I also have a quantitative background with economics since I have taken an economic forecasting class, game theory, and economic statistics. All heavily focused on regression analysis and probability.

I am also currently enrolling in MIT's Applied Data Science bootcamp that starts later this month which focuses on data analysis &amp; visualization and machine learning.

In terms of work experience, I’ve worked my way from cashier to store manager at different jobs. Comes with the usual experience, submitting orders, inventory counts, interpersonal conflict resolution. The basics of retail. I think manager experience may help me, but I’m not sure how to word it so that it would appeal to a hiring manager in an office. 

I have education but it’s kind of weird. I took a legal clerk program, but couldn’t secure a placement despite blasting resumes/cover letters everywhere.

My typing speed is a solid 68-70 wpm, I’m expert level in almost all facets of Microsoft Office (Average at Excel). 

I’m considering going back to school for office administration, but that’ll take some time because the cost is very high. 

Is there anyway to spin the experience and knowledge I have into some lucrative wording I can put on my resume? I just desperately want an entry level receptionist position, Monday to Friday office hours. I just can’t do retail anymore, it’s killing me.

Within a 25 mile radius of the city i am working in, there are a total of 4 postings on marketplace and craigslist combined for all RENTALS.  everything else has waitlists.  Despite all this i have found a reasonable place that starts in February .  I have asked to delay my start date until Feb 2nd.

They we're upset and told me to get a hotel until that date and start on the 16th.  Hotels are 150 a night here and I am only making 23hr.  I told them that wasn't an option, and I would be glad to start on the 2nd but the housing is making it impossible to start on the agreed date.  They have not responded.

How do i proceed?"

I have been applying to software engineering jobs for the past 6 months. I wasn't serious back then and was looking for jobs sort of casually. I was almost done with the interviews with one startup which I was in final stages and the interviewer asked if I was available for 1 last interview with them to which I said that I'm very busy for the next 2 days and I will be able to attend it later because (I didn't tell them this) I was waiting for a technical interview with another startup which I was more interested in. The 1st startup ghosted me and the 2nd one rejected me. Both offers had the same salary. I felt very sad back then on not getting any offers but I was just getting started. I got other interviews as well and I got rejected from technical rounds that's when I decided that I needed to LeetCode and since then my technical interviews, mostly algo related are going good ( still doing bad sometimes during fullstack questions like api designing and frontend css) but I still think that I can clear the tech interviews now. 

What I'm worried about is the final interview which asks the behavioral questions which I'm not at all prepared for and don't know how to clear at all. I'm so bad at communicating in English because it's not my native language and I start stammering which gives a bad first impression. I want to nail the final interview. I have had many chances. If someone else is facing the same issue, please feel free to contact me so that we can get through this together. I hope that everyone gets their dream job!!!!"

9,2023-01-04,My boss wants to write me a subpar reference letter,u/ThatKidOnTheBloc,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/102zlbm/my_boss_wants_to_write_me_a_subpar_reference/,jobs,"So basically, I worked a job during the summer as an assistant manager at a golf club. My boss was a bit of a twat, but I managed to maintain a decent relationship with him. I did so much for him that wasn't even required including building a new website, writing news letters, fixing a ton of different tech issues he was having, doing golfing lessons for dog shit pay. Ultimately, I wanted to put some solid experience under my belt. I worked there for about 5 months FYI until it closed. My second week in, I had an accident with the golf cart, which cost about $250 to fix. I was extremely apologetic and even ordered all the new parts for a far cheaper price than he was ever going to get it. Once my contract was over, we parted on good terms and I've continued making changes and additions to the website.

During my time there, there was also this wonderful lady who had invested in the place. We've kept contact even after my contract ended and she's been very supportive in finding me a new job and opening me up to her network. Eventually, I needed a letter of reference, so she wrote it because my boss is incompetent when it comes to that stuff. She sent it to him for a review and he claimed it to be  too nice and too long on the basis that I had caused him damages in the past. 

Before my contract ended, the investor lady wanted me to work with them on building an ecommerce store to which I agreed, and even started with planning certain things, but now I'm having second thoughts, because if this guy isn't going to vouch for me, why would I ever want to work with him again or be involved with him at all.

I told her this and she understood. Is this a reasonable reaction on my part? I think so. However, she wants to make sure that the boss understands why it's important to have a good reference. I don't even know if it matters at this point, but the dude is so incapable of understanding certain things that she thinks he might just not get it. 

What do you people think would be the right course of action here?"

They apparently pay mileage to drive beyond your usual location and she “may be able to come up with more hours,” but that costs overtime to the nonprofit and “she cannot guarantee it.” I can’t afford groceries, even if they reimburse (later) the gas for weekend work at other sites. The manager is trying to find a way for me to work more than 26 to 30 hours, but at $18 per hour in California, I can’t afford groceries on that, and also have to feed my pets. I am really disappointed because I wanted to do nonprofit work, but can’t do it on 30 hours a week. Is it unreasonable to quit after 2 days if I ran the numbers and can’t make it at 26 to 30 hours a week and the manager unable to guarantee 40 hours a week?

Long story short, a manager was hired December 2021, and was fired November 2022. I started at the store before she was hired. While she was manager I’ve picked up a lot of her slack, and especially after she got fired. (Here you have a 3 month resignation period, and she has called in sick ever since, which is allowed here…)
I’ve (gladly) taken on a lot of the responsibilities of a store manager - training staff, visual merchandising and so on.

For the past month I've been interviewing and in negotiation with a large company for what I considered to be my dream job. Went through three awkward interviews on zoom (my camera was always on, their cameras were always off - I never did see anyone during these interviews). They extended a generous offer and seemed as excited as I was about the opportunity to work together. Now suddenly a bunch of questions have come up out of nowhere about the businesses I currently operate. I've assured them that I am willing to do whatever they want in order to show my commitment to them. Because of the tone of our conversations yesterday I am now certain they intend to rescind their offer today. I was supposed to start on Monday.

So in the meantime, I turned down another job offer, and cancelled all my interviews the past two weeks, turned off my searchability in search engines, etc. Plus I haven't worked for the past week due to holidays so now I'm behind on cash, all because I was counting on this job.

I just spent the entire night in a prolonged panic attack. No sleep, heart racing, complete panic. I am going to have to go to the doctor today to get something to help calm me down over all of this.

I honestly have no idea what I'm going to do now. I'm in an at-will termination state, so I believe they have the right to rescind with no explanation required but I still might try talking to an attorney anyway because I have suffered real damages at this point. This was the most frustrating and disappointing job experience of my entire life and I have no idea how I'm going to pick up the pieces."

I hope you are having a great start to the year! I just really wanted some advice as I have been in two minds about this.

I am based in the UK and I am a 24 year old law graduate. I graduated in the middle of the pandemic and got desperate so I fell into tech sales at 22 years old. After two years, the job is honestly pretty good: WFH, friendly culture, amazing manager and a £60k salary. The only problem is, I don't really like the job and my motivation is completely gone.

I really want to pursue a career in law again as it was something I worked so hard towards. This would mean I would start at the bottom of the ladder again. I would have to become a paralegal and take a big paycut. I have started looking but have not yet been successful in getting an offer.

I am fortunate that I have some savings and still live with my parents. However, I am just scared with how unpredictable the job market is especially with how the economy is looking to be headed towards in 2023. I am worried that I may be making a huge mistake throwing this job away to take a gamble on another career but it just feels like the correct decision for the long term.

Has anyone been in a similar situation as me?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!"

I know that it generally looks bad to have a lot of short-term jobs on my resume, but if I were to omit every job that I worked at for less than half a year, I'd have practically no employment history to speak of (and with it, no marketable skills).

How do I express this in a resume in such a way that it is neither obviously deceptive nor unflattering?"

Signed the paperwork for it and then was told HR sits with you the first day of orientation.

2,2023-01-04,A couple of thoughts after getting my first job in IT,u/TheRosie,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/103791v/a_couple_of_thoughts_after_getting_my_first_job/,jobs,"I decided I'd share my brief history of a career pivot.

I've recently decided to give up on a career in the automotive industry in order to pursue a career in IT.

The main reasons I gave up on the automotive industry were:

- There are absolutely no new job openings whatsoever. Most of the people work for the same companies for over 15 years (case in point - my previous job was covering for a person on sick leave that worked for over 18 years at the company).
- You will work for companies and people with little to no management experience or knowledge.
- Everything and everybody is micromanaged. WFH exists for NSC (National Sales Center) employees only, but for a certain amount of time. Doesn't matter if there is a reason for you to be at the office.
- The pay, here in Eastern Europe you won't be making 6 figures while working for a car maker. 

Credit where it's due - the transition process was made so much easier by both my friends and my partner. I've been given a clear road map of competencies to become a junior/trainee in the IT industry by both of my two closest friends. I could rely on my partner during that time and not worry about having to put food on my plate for two months during which I focused on just learning how to program. I understand that not everybody will be able to just quit their job and relentlessly learn coding for 8-10 hours a day.

I've chosen to become a node.js backend developer as my end-game goal, I also did not really have money to spare on a boot camp or any paid courses as I was going to be potentially out of work for an extended period of time, because of that everything I used to up my technical skills had to be free. The resources that I actually took advantage of were:

- [freeCodeCamp Back End Development and API Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/) - this along with the JavaScript course was the backbone of my learning journey
- [Exercism JavaScript Course](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript) - while their web-based stuff is great, the CLI will get you used to working from within your IDE more than the freeCodeCamp tutorials do.
- Official documentation - I fell asleep numerous times while reading the TypeScript handbook, but this is still a place I visit very often. 
- https://roadmap.sh/backend - if not for one of my friends who actually sketched this out for me I would have 100% used this.

The reasons I had been hired, according to the people that were in charge of the hiring process:

- I had soft skills which were required for this specific role. Due to my previous customer-service-based position in the automotive industry.
- I had technical skills which were fitting this specific role. 
- I backed up my soft skills during the initial and consequent interviews and my technical skill with a link to my GitHub (which notably had just a CRUD project I created in order to put all I've learned in one place).

#**Here is what it all boils down to in my mind:**


#1. Plan


What exactly do you want to do? [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) comes extremely clutch here. Browse through all available road maps, and see if there is anything exciting, or perhaps something you can apply your past experiences to. Then work your way through the backlog of things.


#2. Learn


Learn as much as you can, however, most importantly don't get stuck in tutorial hell. Try figuring out how to do something you are passionate about. I've learned the basics of hosting, Linux, Docker, and networking by managing a self-hosted NAS for my partner's photography business. It's all the small things that will help you later on.


#3. Show it to your recruiter


If you don't have commercial experience in IT, but did a fun little IoT project that fed your neighbor's cats at exactly 2:00 AM every day make it your resume's centerpiece. Consider what's the most important quality the company you're applying to is looking for and make it stand out in your resume. Actual, tangible projects which showcase your skills are worth many times more than all the tutorials you might find, tutorials, however, are a good place to start.


While I haven't exactly met my end-game goal of becoming a backend developer yet, I've been given a chance to work my way up. I am currently filling a position that's more community management centered. But I still get to code! 

I still have so much ahead of me to learn, and a lot of times I feel completely lost. Fingers crossed this won't stay this way for long."

About 2 months ago, I was recommended to a job by a friend. It's honestly a really cool job. I'd basically be my own boss in a way, and it's a small company (which I've learned I prefer). They've been around for like 2-3 years, so they're new. 50ish employees. This detail may be important in your assessment.

The interview process has been long, with slow communication. I've interviewed from my manager, all the way up to the CEO 2 weeks ago. And since then, they haven't sent any emails or follow up.

This part, by the way, isn't unusual. It normally takes HR a week to send next steps, and given it was the holidays it doesn't surprise me that I haven't heard back yet.

I feel confident that I'll get the job eventually, but that isn't the question: the question is if I should accept the job.

I truly like everything about the role and the company and the people I interviewed with. But, then there's this nagging feeling of, ""It's been 2 months... and counting. Is this a red sign that I'm not paying enough attention to, or is this normal, especially for smaller/newer/not as organized yet company?""

This role has been open for a very long time, and when asked their answer was that they have yet to find someone who matches what they're looking for. Now I'm thinking it's because their process ices everyone out and they get another offer elsewhere haha (which, for me, I haven't actually been looking for a new job, it was just something a friend recommended that I quite connected with).

Can someone share their gut feeling on this?"

I don't know what to do.,u/Jennafibber,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1038drx/new_job_lowkey_called_me_a_liar_i_havent_even/,jobs,"I've been unemployed for nearly a year despite my best efforts to find work. (Hundreds of resumes, nearly 100 interviews, networking like crazy.) I finally got a new job, and I was so excited to start. It was a raise from where I had been albeit low for the industry. Benefits don't start for 90 days, but hey, they exist! They called me yesterday to confirm some personal details and I asked if 830 on Monday morning would work as a start time since they'd told me they had flex hours, and  no one was really paying that much attention to clocks. But of course, people need to schedule the first few days to set up computers, accounts, etc, etc.

""We start at 6am, so we expect you between 530am and 545am.""

I had multiple conversations with the department manager about my schedule during the interview process. Their flex hours were a big part of why I was willing to take a smaller paycheck. I mention that 6am is not in line with what we'd discussed, and quote from them ""we don't watch clocks"" ""as long as your work is completed, you could work 2am to 10am for all we care."" 

They told me that they'd never said any of that. Suddenly, there never were flex hours. They always had everyone working at the same time, and that time started at 6am. They offered to start me at 7am instead. But it was a huge inconvenience. 

I can make 7am work, though it's quite miserable with the rest of my schedule. But telling me that several conversations never happened is incredibly concerning to me. I don't tend to make up lengthy, detailed conversations in my head. And since I was only talking to these guys in the last month (job searching is painfully slow around the holidays) I can't imagine that I misremembered this conversation as being with this company instead of another company -- there was no one else to be talking to. Furthermore, whenever they asked to schedule an interview, I was always available between 9am and 5pm. 

I feel like walking in I'm on thin ice and will probably crash and burn quickly. Thoughts?"

It is commission based only and very hard to make it in the business. I chose this career path because I was told it would give me the opportunity to not only push myself and make more money but spend more time with my children which is most important to me. It involves creating your own leads and working closely with management with extensive training which I liked. I was able to do well at first, however, 2022 was not so kind to me as I faced more hardships and pain than I've ever had to endure. I've dealt with death, a breakup, child custody, debt, moving abruptly, losing friends, and many many more issues. I had to juggle life as we all do with working. 

A lot of what I do is networking and this requires me to find people who are willing to meet with me. Most of the people I encounter are only able to meet on their days off which mostly are weekends or after work which is typically 4-6 pm and then the meeting can consist anywhere from 45 min to 2 hours. I would sometimes not come home until 8 or 9 PM when you include driving from wherever I met my client. Obviously, this takes a lot of time from my children and my sister who watches them has expressed to me how sad and lonely they feel with me gone all the time. 

My mental state began to dwindle and I felt the pressure. My production went down and I also started to realize that my manager would sometimes ghost me or other co-workers on appointments we set which was very embarrassing. There definitely was favoritism which a lot of people on our team saw. I found out quickly he was not very reliable. I talked with my manager about this and he apologized, but he would continue to do it to other co-workers which made me make the decision to not work with him as much anymore. One of my close friends with who I work closely, dealt with this daily and tried to talk with the boss of the firm but every time he set up a meeting and asked if it could only be the two of them, our manager would invite himself so my co-worker gave up.

I made the decision a couple of weeks ago, that I was going to cut ties and move on to another career that would give me the ability to work from home. I wanted to talk with our boss at the beginning of the year because 1.) His father just passed away and the holidays were coming up. 2.) If I quit before the first of the year, my manager would have to pay back all the money he made off me. I didn't want to inconvenience anyone before Christmas or maybe that's me being too nice. I got an email from our boss right before NYE that said he wanted a couple of agents including me to meet after the holidays on a zoom call. 

When the time came, I thought this was my opportunity to tell him but he went off on us. He said that my production was terrible, that I try to fit things into my own agenda, that he can't trust anything I say, and that I wasn't being honest with myself. I forgot to mention I picked up a part-time job that paid great money during the fall just to make up for what I couldn't with my current job. With my current job, we aren't supposed to, or else we lose perks and could get terminated. My manager knew this and encouraged me to use it as a networking opportunity, but not to tell anyone. It seems like he did anyways. Moving on he asked me if I was the boss and I wasn't making production, would I fire myself. I answered, ""Yes, I would fire myself."" He then went on to say that we could either go away and have it on our records he terminated us or we can work 3 more months while we were on ""probation"" and holding our hands to do training and we aren't allowed to work with certain people anymore. If we still weren't able to meet production, then he would terminate us, but not put it on our record...

I was a bit surprised by this as it sounded like it was a letter sent in black if you get my drift. He went on to tell us how much money we can make.. it sounded like he was trying to sell us on staying. I'm not sure if I should at this point because I don't enjoy it but maybe it is just because of what I went through and maybe I can like it again. I'm not sure how much it will affect me if I chose termination and it went on my record. Would it make it harder for me to get another job? Should I just suck it up and do the 3 months?"

I'd like some input from headhunters or hiring managers out there. Let's say an individual has been a teacher for 10+ years and holds 1st class BA and MA from top UK universities, plus a teaching qualification and is en route to finishing a PhD.

Their field is languages and social sciences.

Temperamentally, they are much more suited to quiet work without excessive face-to-face interaction. They know they're good at research and produce top-quality reports. How likely are they to be able to switch careers in mid-life? What tips might you be able to share?"

Long time lurker, just reaching out  because I'm not sure if this is something I can do or not. I really need some clarification here.

24F. WI. Working here since September 2022. Fulltime (40hr). Hourly pay.

I work as an afterschool care supervisor for two elementary schools. Basically I come in in the morning and open before school, then send them off. From there I work an hour or two in my office then have a 3 to 4 hour break until the after school program starts. I work that, including various programming I have available for the kiddos for the evening, and then close it up when it's time to go. I've been told multiple times to not go over my hourly time by my supervisor (even if it's just 15 minutes to a half hour I'm still reprimanded for it). This is my first hourly job that is very stringent that I stick to 40. I've tried to keep to it as close as possible to avoid further issues. 

The problem arises with my financial situation. I have a lot of student loan debt, and on top of all the other things I need to pay (credit cards, furniture repays, etc.) I'm finding that it's becoming more and more difficult to be financially stable. I am considering asking for more hours at work for the time being so I can boost my finances a bit more, but I don't know:

A.) If that's even legal in my state;  
B.) How do I go about asking for them;  
C.) How much I should request.

Some advice would be nice as I go forward! I have a meeting with my main supervisor on Friday, so I hope to bring this to him then. Fingers crossed!

(Also I am sorry if I'm using the wrong flair, I can change it once told what I should put it as. thanks again!)"

I work as a full-time contractor for a large tech company through an agency. I'm not sure if I'm technically an independent contractor as I have a W-2 with the agency that set up the contract. The company I'm working for announced this morning that it will be laying off a large percent of it's workforce.

From my understanding, it's more difficult to fire contractors (assuming they're holding their end of the contract/expected work). Because I work through an agency, and my contract isn't directly with the tech company, what are my rights if I were to be let go? What should I expect from both parties?"

Overall weird interaction, and honestly just unorganized and unprofessional. I got my acceptance letter for an IT job yesterday and that's when my suspicions arose. Anyways long story short I looked into them and everything seems sketch (like A LOT), but I called my direct supervisor for the position I'm applying to and he lives in my state and I was able to confirm his Identity. He told me that Tekwissen was a sub contractor of the actual staffing agency they use and that's probably why everything has been so weird. I honestly still don't know how legit Tekwissen is as a staffing Agency is, but i'm mostly confident the Job itself is real. My only worry now is the fact that my paychecks will go through them, I really don't want to work 2 weeks and then have my check bounce. At this point I just really need a job and the pay is good enough for me to start fixing things in my life, so either it works out or I fuck myself more."

I recently (last year) got promoted to a full time, assistant supervisor role. From being a seasonal for 4 years. The company has me working there 5 years.

So, if I just write on my resume 2005-2010 - Assistant Supervisor

Leave it as that as my job at the company, never mention the temp/seasonal part. Honestly, I was doing the exact same job I am now......my company is just cheap.

Not that it matters, but maybe split it 2 years seasonal 3 years  supervisor? or just all supervisor? I'm thinking I have to show how I went from nothing to that, if I just put that I started there as a assistant sup, looks sus.

IDK, I 100% plan to lie my ass off on these, as no one reads these things until I get to the interview anyways. I know this, because I applied for like 80k+ jobs that aren't in my field ( I barely make 32k now), my resume- a wizard D nD sheet. And I keep getting emails how awesome my resume is and some company wants me to come in XD.

It seems to matter when you get there, then they read it, and you have to explain it......but awhile since I had a job interview,......well not really, every off season, but that's the feeling I got after so, so, so many interviews. I'm like ""so....you want someone with experience....why did you call me in? My resume says I have none, but I have knowable."" 

IDK, job hunting seems to change, the way you go about it, every 2 years now.

Also any general tips for resume building is appreciated.

I had had about 6 jobs on top of the one i have no during that time (during the off season). There's one one or two I'd put on there. One was a sales job I literally got off the street at a gas station, talking to a random guy who happened to be the owner of the company. He noticed me 2 days prior hustling at the gas station trying to sell whatever BS MLM crap we were doing at the time, and I immediately went from losing money based on commission/non-reimburse gas, to 40k a year.....probation period.

Being that i never sold anything over 200-1000 dollar range, I'm suddenly trying to sell 1000-1000000 machines to companies......like going from t-ball to pros. Point is, I lasted 90 days, BUT the owner said he really admired my ethic, and when they do this with others, they usually don't do this. But he said I can use him as a reference anytime, and even come back if I want to after experience (never want to do sales again lol).

I gotta get out of this pathetic paying job for a supervisor role into something better, but i never had supervisor experience, so I am thinking this is going to open more doors for me in terms of jobs.....

in b4 this post gets deleted because i missed some rule or something. Always seems to happen when I post to a new sub i never go to, I end up violating some rule and get banned or severely warned, even after reading the rules......so....plz don't hurt me daddy. :)"

Firstly, thank you Reddit for giving me the courage to speak up. The comment that really hit me was that I should follow my intuition on this.

Secondly, I appreciate Redditors pointing out laws that my company would be breaking but I am UK based, not USA.

It was a very tense meeting with my manager and I still don’t think they fully understand my reasoning for why I didn’t want to commute 4/5 hours even though it is only once a week.

Their counter argument was that ‘travelling comes with the territory of the job’. I explained i would travel as per needs of the business but this new request was unreasonable.

Nail in the coffin was when I would go into the office as they requested but on company time and not mine.

In the end it was agreed that I would travel to the office once a week for January only but they would put me in a hotel. 

From February onwards I only need to go once a month which again I have no qualms with.

I will not be budging on the above and I will die on this hill if I must. The request was bonkers."

I initially went to college for nursing, but decided to switch majors halfway through after several nurses I knew personally urged me to seek a different path. While I enjoyed healthcare, my school didn’t offer any other healthcare specific degrees. Instead of transferring, I decided to switch my major to business management. I was never strong in finance or economics, but I did well in accounting and my core management courses. I ended up scoring a Human Resources internship as a junior and stayed with that company for five years and switched to accounting/credit. 

I’ve been with two other companies since as an office manager and now an HR analyst, and I honestly ask myself daily why I thought working an office job would be a good fit for me. I don’t enjoy sitting still all day. I have a hard time following the typical HR mantra of “our job is to protect the company” when it screws over employees. I’m terrible with computers, and even though I took Excel courses in college and have used it daily for work for years, I still suck at it. I hate typing emails full of meaningless information. I’m realizing that a lot of office jobs require an advanced level of tech skills, which I do not have and have no desire to gain. It’s just not my thing. 

I got great grades in high school and decent grades in college, but I actually did better in nursing school (which was much more difficult) than I did in business school. I’m coming to the realization way too late that maybe this field just isn’t a good fit for me, nor am I a good fit for it. My strengths are helping/leading my coworkers efficiently and fairly and customer service. The only satisfaction I experience at my current job is when I get to directly help an employee with something like health insurance or a personal issue, and that is probably the smallest part of my job currently. 

It seems like office jobs are so glamorized right now, especially Human Resources. I see TikToks where women gleefully file papers and highlight random words on a piece of colored construction paper. That has so *not* been my experience, and while I wouldn’t necessarily want it to be, I feel like I’m broken for hating the field and finding it difficult. I want to do something more hands on. I’m mentally exhausted from thinking critically all day and I can’t believe I used to be an amazing student. My body is suffering from sitting at a desk all day. I’m given the responsibility to hold corporate power over other employees but I can’t actually do anything to help them. It is so draining. 

I feel like I’ve missed my window to switch careers. I’ve started to apply to positions at other companies that have more of a direct hand in operations, but they’re still desk jobs. I dream about going back to school or making a huge change all the time, but I have bills to pay and it seems like everyone else is miserable with their professions, regardless of the field. Are we all just destined for burnout? Am I insane for despising my office job?

Should I?,u/anonymousventacc,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/103by27/im_just_about_to_work_the_second_day_of_my_job_im/,jobs,"I recently started a new job yesterday. For the sake of privacy and chain reputation (because I'm a nice person) I'll only call it a fast food joint.

I was supposed to work 11 AM - 5 PM initially. Ended up going an hour early instead just because they wanted me to. It was supposed to be my training day, as I had never worked in fast food before. My trainer only showed me what to do a few times before leaving early, which left me as the only employee there with the position in question I was hired for. The position with the most physical labor. The position of having to hold massive, heavy trays, while shoving open very heavy doors and hurting myself in the process, while also reaching into tight apron pockets for cash and change, because the system for credit/debit cards has been down since Sunday apparently. The mobile app doesn't even work either.

The owner knows about these issues. They don't care.

Anyways, for basically 3/4 of my shift, I was left alone. I was ordered to do things I was also never trained to do, and berated when I made the slightest mistake. I was also blamed for things I had no partake in and were out of control, and to add to that some of the customers were just absolute female dogs and I had little to no assistance with those situations. I ended up getting sent home a little bit early because the crowd eventually died down, but that didn't change how my heart had physical issues the rest of the day due to the amount of stressful activity I endured.

I was prepared for the worst, but certainly didn't expect it to happen.

My manager was there and just said ""They'll be fine."" right before the person training me left. I can't help but keep thinking about that either.

I should let my physical state, alongside a few other things be known right quick before some jump to assumptions: I'm underweight and not very strong. The only reason I took this job is because I had been searching for three months for one and only this place decided to bother interviewing me at the very least. They did not make the job look like as presented, though I'm assuming this is a quite common case because that's just how things are.

So, there's my situation. I really just want to quit immediately through text, honestly before I even have to deal with the second day (in like 2 hours) but I've been told by someone I'm just overreacting and need to get used to it. However, I don't think I could juggle this and college at the same time, and honestly would prefer being stressed over full time college than this. Quitting for full time college would be genuinely reasonable, but I'm just not sure what to do."

How, if at all should I go about navigating this situation both with my current boss who is unaware I'm interviewing elsewhere, as well as with the hiring manager at the position I'm interviewing for? 

The new hiring manager told me to let them know if I have any other offers/time sensitive decisions arise, so they can take them into consideration in the hiring process. I also don't want to accept the new promotion only to be made a better offer from the new company. Overall its a nice problem to have, but I want to make sure I handle it professionally, discreetly and take advantage of any leverage it may afford me."

I have a rather unique job in a large industry (retail) that consists of inspecting product listings all day. Our original KPIs were in the 200-250 ""items"" per day range. Today, they have gone up to 400-500 with no explanation (yet) 

For some context, our department tripled in size since I started working here. At least 2-3 people have left without being replaced, and of course the work has been shuffled off to other employees. There are many times throughout the year we simply didn't have enough work to meet the bare minimum on the original KPIs; now, these new ones would be impossible to hit every day. 

My question would be, has this happened elsewhere, and why? Trying to shrink our department further?"

The company, however, consistently under pays employees compared to market value or other positions in the industry. 

In the past, I put forward valid points to get a raise and while management agreed, it exceeds the salary range for that title determine by HR. Therefore, I was given a promotion and subsequent pay increase.  The problem being that I al now underpaid for what that higher title would be paid.

To clarify, I am not given promotions solely to give me the pay requested, but because I also earned it and perform above expectations.

My company also has a policy that if you were promoted in the fiscal year, you do not earn a merit raise during year end review.

I was promoted in July but didn’t get as high a salary as I hoped for and want to argue that I should get a merit raise but I doubt that is likely. I’ve pushed so much for the pay we deserve but I feel like I’m at the point of becoming the squeeky wheel that will never be satisfied.

Is it common for companies to only give raises in non promotion years?"

They’re always arguing with each other, it’s hard to focus on work with these two. On top of that, one manager is very rude and due to his awful personality, they have lost business. Oh and a few weeks ago, they caught him doing coke in his office!


I’ve worked for so many toxic jobs, but this one takes the cake!

Aside from these clowns I’m working with, I find the industry to be rather boring and the day just takes forever!

I’m going to start working on my resume, but I’m just worried now because people will start thinking that I’m being a job hopper, when in reality I just had some bad luck once I left the one company. 

Any advice on what I should say on interviews? I was thinking of saying I got this job due to being unemployed for so long and now I want to get back into my industry."

I've been looking at jobs lately and I found a job that I have nearly 100% of the requirements for. However, it requires a Secret Clearance! Now, I've seen that before and typically scrolled past because the job is typically WAY out of my league in terms of requirements and experience. I took the time to look up what it would take to acquire a Secret Clearance and it looks like you can't get one if you want? From what I'm seeing, you need to apply for the job that requires one to be considered for getting one, and it's revoked when the contract is over (for which contract jobs apply to) or you simply get another job with or without a Secret Clearance (but you'd be able to get it again). 

Am I reading this information correctly and I should be able to apply? Or am I grossly misunderstanding what it was that I read and I'm wrong?"

My boss was hard on me because they were “training me to be manager” for a different  smaller store , so I had to do literally everything expected for special orders . That means answering the phone, helping customers, building bq and arrangements for customers on the spot , filling buckets with water, unboxing, checking my boss email and online orders, cleaning/ organizing displays . Sometimes my boss didn’t let me take a break and force to work overtime even corporate said no overtime whatsoever. It got a lot for me and a lot stress because it got so busy and doing flowers stuff on the spot . It got to much when my boss let my coworker go on her phone take over 10 minutes bathroom breaks and letting her show up 3 to 4 hours late but if I’m out of my bosses sight for 2 minutes I hear my boss screaming my name . I had this really bad pain in my side since I was teen and stress made it hurt worst and my boss didn’t believe me even with doctors note and I was diagnosed with IBS (later found out I’m really allergic to yeast too which I ate alot of before I knew I was allergic). It got kinda annoying because they barely paid me minimum wage and most of my money went to helping my single mom with 3 younger brothers so I didn’t have a car . Sometimes I would come 10 to 15 mins late and my boss understood my situation .The thing that got me was my bosses boyfriend who owns his own business always has some snarky comments about our work effort even though I tried my best to go above and beyond . Right before Christmas I was on the phone with the customers and put the customer on hold to go over their order my bosses boyfriend came to me and said “if I was your boss I would have fired you after the 3rd time of you being late.” I looked at him like are you kidding. I was so angry I started to cry in the bathroom and the next day I put in my written two notice because I got fed up . Fed up of doing my coworkers job to but all she did was text, drink coffee,and only wanted to do flowers design even though I was work their longer and had more experience. My boss found fault in everything I did also saying comments about me to the customers “I couldn’t do what she did “ “that I wasnt equal” and laugh about even though I was still learning and everyone else love my flower designs . When my boss found out I put in my notice that when she started being kinder to me and gave me time off because my side was in a lot pain and I was nauseous a lot . I didn’t want to go back but I let everyone convince me to go back . A couple months later mother day a big holiday for florist I was at my limit working 12-16 hours in pain and nauseous. My boss didn’t believe my pain still. My boss and  coworker didn’t like how I didn’t stay as long as they did which was over 16 hours. I decided to put 1 day notice (my coworker was saying stuff to get me in trouble) in the email and also texted her my notice no response from my boss. Now I’m just finding out my boss is saying I never gave notice and I abandon/no call no show. Sorry for the long rant I just not sure what my next steps should be it already hard enough finding a job."

My dad had a meeting earlier today and in the meeting they said that they have filled all positions in his location meaning people already received the call that they got in. I haven’t received the rejection email yet so the only hope I have is that the other locations will call me back as there was about 12 different locations and in the interview I said I would be willing to relocate and when I signed up I had to disclose that a relative worked at the company so maybe they didn’t want to have me work at the same location as family even though it’s two different positions.

I am currently working for one of the big 5 banks in Canada (started in May 2022) but I received a new offer and while it is a higher salary, I am unsure which one would be the most interesting in the long run.

Current Employer (Big 5 Bank) - Customer Service Representative for Credit Card Department. 

Role is remote (Computer provided) with a possibility of going back to the office at some point although unlikely since they are closing down offices 

Salary : 40550 / year (starting Jan 1st 2023)

Pension : Employer gives 6% automatically after 2 years, no matching required.

Shares : 6% (+3% employer matching) since day 1.

Benefits : Pretty good to be honest, it covers what I need (Medication, Chiros, Mental Health 5k 100% coverage) + more that I probably do not think about

Potential for growth : Quite high, there are a lot of departments I could look to move in even with different products than the Credit Cards like I am in currently, just cannot start the process before 9 months but after march my manager said we could look into it. Moving department would also almost definitely include a salary increase (I am in one of the lowest salary bracket due to my specific department being basically entry level and not doing anything) 

Job Offer (Big Credit Card Company) - Customer Service Representative 

Role is remote (Computer provided) with a possibility of having to go to the office in Toronto which is impossible for me as I am in Montreal - company is already aware of it and said it was fine and I would not need to go to the office.

Salary : 47 000 / year (starting Feb 20th 2023)

Pension &amp; Shares : Matching to RRSP &amp; ESOP of a maximum of 4% (would be 6% RRSP &amp; 2% ESOP to receive the max of 4%) after 6 months

Additional Employer Contributions : 3% added to a Deferred Profit Sharing Plan after 6 months, regardless of any contribution I make in this)

Benefits : Same company (Sun Life) that does the Benefits as my current employer) and they give Flex Credits to pay them (same as current employer I think) aswell as a Mental Health 100% coverage with a yearly maximum. Company also gives 300$ Fitness Reimbursement per year on gym membership

Potential for growth : Seems smaller here since this company only does Credit Cards - they are not a bank with various departments for various products - however the company seems to be able to keep their employees so there are probably other departments that I just do not think about currently. 

I feel like the Big 5 Bank I am with currently has more possibilities for growth but with that much of a difference salary wise, I am not sure if I am doing the right move to stay with them. Opinions?"

I’m a college student and applied to work front desk for a gym on indeed. Luckily, right now it says only 1-5 people have applied! The bad news is that I was rushing, and just looked at my resume and realized it’s edited for the jobs I applied for during winter break…which lists my location as 3 hours away from the gym.

If they read the resume fully, I’m sure they’ll put together that I’m in the school’s area, as it is listed that my graduation date is in June and our semester is starting soon. I’m wondering if I just shot myself in the foot though since most just glance at it, and I don’t want them to think I’m too far to commute. There’s no way to change it since it’s through indeed and they don’t have an email on their website :/

Need some advice.",u/BlueWombat76,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/103lje9/just_started_a_new_job_today_after_working_my/,jobs,"To add some context, I have worked at a small butcher shop for the past 8 years (1st Job I’ve ever had). My boss decided he was going to close the place and only gave us a 2 weeks notice. I had very little time with the holidays being in those 2 weeks so I went with the first job that got back to me. 

I decided to go to a local grocery store chain to work in their meat department. In the interview they asked me my preferences on where and when I would like to work. Instead of placing me in one of the 5 stores located in a 5 - 10 minute drive from my home (which I stated in my preferences), they instead sent me to one 45 minutes away. 

I looked past this and just accepted the fact that I had a job. I had my first shift today and already know that this isn’t for me. Not only do they not cut their own steaks like they told me they do. They also don’t plan on training me, it says no training required on my info sheet so I’m thrown into the deep end. The employees I worked with were all some of the most disrespectful people I have ever met, the work place is disgusting, management doesn’t interact at all (had to search for my own time card, uniform, etc), my schedule is completely different from what I was told (6am start time and no scheduled days off for the posted two weeks), I didn’t even get my lunch break today, and this just isn’t the job I signed up for. 

I’ve never felt so useless and miserable in my job before. I will work hard with no complaints but this just took it too far already. I’ve already been told that it’s like this most days, by a couple of the employees, and my schedule is set to get worse from here. All of my co workers said they have 1 day off a week maximum since late October.

I’ve been job searching and sending applications around all night. Is it professionally okay for me to tell this place that it’s not going to work out after 1 day of work? Or should I stick it out and give them two weeks notice? I just don’t think I can handle doing this for the next 14 days straight.

1,2023-01-04,Interview at a new place by a former employee at the place I used to work at. Help!,u/iconicuser,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/103llwz/interview_at_a_new_place_by_a_former_employee_at/,jobs,"I am shocked to find out that I will be interviewed by a former employee at my last workplace. This person was not there when I started the internship, but left shortly before I got there. I came across a lot of her work while there and she was kind of a big deal there. Apparently she now works at the place I applied to and will be interviewing me. It is the same industry (not business) as our former workplace, but a different location (government job). I applied for one internship position and one permanent one (which I’m kinda regretting -maybe I should’ve just stuck to the permanent one?)

She is going to interview me and know that I interned at the place she used to work at. This is making me uneasy because one of the reasons I left is because I felt I was going to be stuck as an intern there forever, which you might find confusing since I am applying for a new internship, but the difference is that this internship is greatly related to what I want to do. It is basically the Intern level position of the permanent position i also applied for (analyst). At the old workplace, I was an administrative intern which I hated. I also left to pursue a temporary job which I enjoyed greatly and gave me valuable experience. That job has since passed. Another reason I left is because my supervisor (who she knew very well and worked with very closely!) was rather mean to me. I wasn’t the only one who noticed either, other employees made it known that she was kinda rude to me. Also, some of these former colleagues of mine let me know that if I ever needed anything I can reach out to them. I did, and they never got back to me. So I feel I might be blacklisted for some unknown reason.

So, when she interviews me, how should I handle our shared work history? How do I make myself not look bad for leaving? I suppose her and I have some common ground since we both left the same place in search of something better!

Edit: I also wanted to add that i was an intern at the former workplace for nine months, if that means anything."

When I arrived only the HR representative was available and apologized for the fact the hiring managers who were supposed to be the panel didn't arrive. She said instead it would be better for me to meet with the manager of the location I specifically applied to, showed me the hours for the AM and PM shifts, and said that I would hear back about a meeting time. 

I didn't hear anything and yesterday sent an email to the HR representative asking if she had heard anything about a time. She responded saying the location's manager was supposed to reach out to me and that she would remind them the next day. 

If I still don't hear anything within the next few days would I reach out to the HR representative again, or should I call the location and speak to the manager directly? I haven't been in this kind of position before and I'm not sure how to go about it."

This past September I was told to send me resume directly to the hiring manager at a major contractor after several of their employees wrote me glowing recommendations (his words). The hiring manager mentioned I have all the qualifications they are looking for and the recommendations were a major boon; but after our email exchanges, we both knew it was obviously too early to line anything up and he asked me to re-engage with him in January to get me in for an interview.

Now I am nervous about doing contacting him again as I simply do not know HOW to re-engage with him. Do I flat out ask for the interview or is there a more obvious way I should approach this? Does it sound like he is excited to have me as a potential? I have spent my career in aircraft maintenance where we speak direct and to the point, I kind of no experience in this situation.

I appreciate any input, thanks!"

Today I received news on what my raise/merit increase for the new year would be, and it was unfortunately less than I was hoping for. 

I am compensated pretty well, all things considered. However, I was making around $15,000-$21,000 below the market for my role. I presented evidence to my leaders that suggested such about 14 weeks ago, and I’ve waited patiently until today. 

The day finally came where we find out our increases and my amount was 8%. It was higher than 96% of my coworkers, and I’m thankful for that. But, it still fell $9,000-$15,000 below the market. The reasoning was because of the performance of the company, that is the most they could offer me at this time.

I don’t necessarily want to leave, but being that far below my market value prevents me from being able to provide for my family how I should be able to. So far, the only options I’ve been able to determine are: find a new job, or suck it up and hope it gets better. 

Am I missing an option here?"

Anyone have any idea what types of jobs there are for people who like to look at ""What could go wrong?"".

I tend to have this ""negative"" view on ideas/things...However, I do strongly feel that when used in the right moment it could actually be ""positive"".  I feel it is by far my strongest ""trait"". 

An example of how a ""negative"" thought can be ""positive"".  

Let's say someone is thinking about ordering new fancy desks that go up and down.  A ""positive"" thinking person tends to not think about ""What can go wrong?"". This positive person could then ask this ""Negative"" person to figure out ""flaws"", ""reasons"", ""Points of failure"", ect..about said fancy new desk. 

This ""Negative"" person, immediately realizes that this thing will eventually fail to go up and down.  How long will it take to get to this state? Is the part that make it go up and down easily replaceable? Is the desk cheap enough it doesn't matter and a new one can be purchased and replaced? How long is said desk going to be available to purchase if needing to be replaced? Will someone care that one desk is not like the rest? Ect....

If anyone knows jobs for this ""Negative"" person. Please reach out. :) 

Thanks,

A ""Negative"" Person."

My last role was engineer but have some related experience that I could leverage as well, so I think without MBA completion, it might still help. This is probably why I still got some interviews. 

For folks got laid off, how long would you land the next one. I’m lucky to have a spouse who is working and fully supportive of my transition. at the same time, I feel bad/pessimistic not being to land anything despite multiple interviews. I’ll appreciate any sharing their similar experience too."

Unfortunately my anxiety went into overdrive, causing me to fall behind in assignments and to start skipping out on work at Job A. I still attend work at my hospitality job as they give me regular shifts (around 3-5 shifts a week), however whenever I am given a shift at Job A I don't attend.

Part of the reason is because when I do come into Job A, I feel isolated or inferior to everyone else there as they have higher degrees than I and they're all very extroverted people who I feel I can't get along with. I know I can't get along well with everyone and every workplace has it's pros and cons, but I just feel like a loner and that I'm looked down on whenever I did go to Job A though that could be because of my anxiety.

Job A also asked if I have an ongoing medical condition that's preventing me from coming into work and if so, I should provide proof. They made it clear I have to communicate with them and I'm afraid if I don't fix this up soon I'll be fired.

I can't talk to my friends or family for help because I feel so ashamed and when I do try to talk little bits and pieces, their advice is so extreme (e.g. my friends will say to quit and my sibling will say to get over my anxiety, grow up and continue going to work for experience).

What can I do to get out of this mess? I want to catch up and finish my assignments and clear the issue with work but I just feel so overwhelmed. I have got a doctor's referral to go to a psychologist but other than that I haven't properly gone to seek help and I just feel like my life is falling apart."

I thought I had found a new job, therefore that was my decision. This ""new"" job is a day care center (since I want experience, it would help me out). The interview went well, and she began to tell me what I needed (CPR training and fingerprints). She supposedly sent me an email with information, but I never got it. I provided her with another email, and still nothing. (I believe in signs, and this was already a sign for me).
I went to get my fingerprints but it was just a waste of time, I wasn't able to because I needed a code. I let her know, and she said to just move on with the process, ""one step at a time"".
Today, I went for a teacher training. Everything went well until I was able to talk to her about my information. She would talk to me for a second, then leave to do something else, leaving me hanging. This happened about three times, I got annoyed and left.

So I graduated college last December and have been working in my corporate gig for about 4 months now. The job is what I went to school for and the pay is pretty good for my circumstance, but I think I’ve realized that the corporate office life just isn’t for me - like at all. The stress is really taken a toll on my mental health and work-life balance and to be frank, I just want out. 

Now there’s a different department (same organization but not desk job) that I’m trying to get into and have made some leeway by introducing myself to the hiring manager and expressed my interest in the position which will come up soon. It will be about 30% pay cut, and is definitely a downgrade in seniority level, but is still well within my budget and I’m certain I would be so much happier at that position. I know a few people in this department and they are vouching for my name. 

Now here’s the part I’m not sure about. Say I get this other job and start the transfer process. What do I tell my current boss? I feel very grateful that he hired me for the role and am a little disappointed that I don’t think it’s going to workout, but am not sure how to approach him and what to say to him. Do I just tell him I’m just not happy at this role and am pursuing something else? It just feels a little weird saying that knowing that he hired me literally because my degree is in the field and gave me a shot. I beat out a few other people who have been in this organization a little longer than me for my position, and it kind of makes me feel guilty leaving to be honest, but I know that I do not want to continue working at this job. I’m really not sure how to move forward with this transfer process when it comes up."

I’ve been at my current part-time retail job since September, and with the holidays behind us, I’ve seen a drop in hours, to the point where I’m currently only scheduled to work one day next week. I tried asking for more hours, but my request was declined. 

I get paid every two weeks. I’m willing to deal with this for one pay period, but if this becomes the new normal, it’s not sustainable. I need more money. It’s making me consider looking for a new job. I was originally gonna try to stay here a year, possibly even two years to show I’m not a job hopper, but this is making me reconsider my decision. 

WIBTA if I started looking for a new job, and possibly left my current workplace if I got offered better pay and/or hours? 

Would it badly affect my work credibility if I decided to explore other options now? When I got hired in September, I didn’t think it’d be in a position where I’d be considering a change so soon. I actually wanted to try to secure a full time position before this happened.

3,2023-01-05,Is this illegal?,u/YachtSkrrrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/103sq4w/is_this_illegal/,jobs,"I started this new job last month. Within my offer, I was given vacation for Christmas. Due to flight complications (thanks Southwest), I returned to work multiple days after anticipated. Upon returning to work I realized my manager had notified payroll to not pay me for any of my time off. I responded via email explaining that the majority of my time off was covered and I should be paid. I also asked to discuss expectations regarding working from home if I’m sick or trapped in another state.

During the time my flights were delayed, I offered to work in all aspects from my job aside from making phone calls (phone calls truly weren’t an option during that time). I was told by my manager I cannot work solely because I can’t make phone calls and to take unpaid days off. It’s safe to say, phone calls are only a very small percentage of my work for this role.

Anyways, my manager scheduled a meeting to discuss these expectations. Today, I met with my manager and was brought into an incredibly small room with the executives/CEO. I was then questioned about my happiness, whether I like my job, and given an ultimatum to quit. My manager proceeded to berate me regarding my performance despite me being very successful in my role the past month (there are metrics to prove it). Nonetheless, the executives/CEO supported my manager who was yelling at me, meanwhile they are sitting in front of the only exit to the room, and I was essentially trapped in a corner and ridiculed for an hour with several ultimatums about my job as well as implications regarding how my manager didnt approve hiring me.

Without exaggeration, this was the least professional experience I’ve ever had in my career and I cannot express the level of absurdity that occurred.

Within this meeting my manager explained that she took my email very personally and I am ridiculous (for pointing out that I legally should be paid for the time off).

Given the fact that my manager blatantly lied about my performance and used the executives/CEO as support for incorrect information, but also berated me in the process, is this legal?

It took everything in me to not quit on the spot because I didn’t want to make an irrational decision, but quite honestly, I seemed to be the only person in management to act rationally in the situation. I truly have no idea what to do - any advice is greatly appreciated."

I want to find remote work as I feel it will be the most flexible for my current goals and living situation, but the problem is that most of my experience has been in customer service. Bank teller, cash register at a café, front desk, etc. etc. 

I feel like it just funnels all my searches into stuff that’s customer-service oriented and I’m sick of it. There’s a reason I’ve only stuck at most of these jobs for a few months. The interactions are draining and the management is jaded and simply incompetent most of the time. 

I’ve been told that data entry work is “entry level” but I haven’t had much luck even finding many jobs in that category that don’t require at least a couple years of experience in some specific program or certification. IT is the same story. Anything that truly is “no experience” just ends up being a call center or “something something Representative.”

What are some jobs that won’t make me hate my life that are actually entry level, remote, and do not have to do with customer service at all? Even something that requires a relatively easy to get certification I will consider."

The specific injury was a pretty nasty concussion that prevented me from working for 2 weeks and these were ""unexcused absences"" so I was fired for attendance.  The problem is now I am monumentally screwed and I have no idea how to find another job.  I got my previous job kind of by accident and I lasted for 2 years.  I picked up some customer service skills but not much else.  I have mental disabilities as well as a physical disability that prevents me from lifting heavy objects.  The mental disabilities make it extremely challenging for me to work in general, but especially in new environments and they affect my memory.  My memory and focus is even worse after the recent head injury.  How can I find a job paying at least $16/hr with all of this.  I have no special skills, certificates or a degree, and I live in the middle of nowhere maryland.

Tldr; got fired, have both physical and mental disabilities that make working really hard.  I live in the middle of nowhere maryland and I need to make at least $16/hr.  Help."
5,2023-01-05,How am I supposed to get industry experience?,u/UntalentedPuffin,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/103tb4l/how_am_i_supposed_to_get_industry_experience/,jobs,"I have a Master's degree in environmental science and have been working in customer service since I was 16 years old until late last year. I'm now in my mid 20s and I can't seem to land a job in my field or even a basic office job that isn't low level admin work. I've done a bunch of research assistant work throughout my degree (paid and unpaid) as well as have worked in an admin job for a couple of years after my undergraduate degree. Every job I have applied for (both within my field of study AND regular office work) keeps telling me the same thing after I manage to land an interview, that they want someone more industry experience and someone they think would be able to handle ""high pressure roles"". 

Here's the thing that really fucks me off when I keep hearing the same bullshit from recruiters and hiring managers, I spent the last 6-10 months during 2 years of my postgraduate degree working in remote areas with lots of hazards and some projects were very time sensitive while also dealing with dangerous chemicals. I don't understand how explaining all these things during my interviews on top of saying that I have almost 10 years on and off of hospitality and customer service experience makes me unqualified for the most basic jobs that isn't going to pay me minimum wage.

I ended up applying for a hospitality role because I literally used up all my savings and had no money left so I needed a job ASAP. I got it within a week of applying. Talking to my manager, apparently a lot of people applied for the role and for some reason they thought I was most qualified for it (despite it being the most basic minimum wage job) and I interviewed really well despite literally doing the same thing in most of my other interviews. The job itself is fine but there's no potential for a career so I can't see myself in the role for any longer than a few months (if I'm lucky) or half a year. I'm just really bitter about spending most of my life in higher education and then feeling like I'm never going to go anywhere outside of working minimum wage in these customer service roles. I haven't been depressed for the past 3 years but some days after a long shift I end up wanting to just drive straight into a lake."

I get paid £24k the day is 8-5 and is a 40-45 min commute both ways. In my head I should stay because it's more relevant to my long term career goals but it's having a negative effect on my family life. I come home at 6 so have less time with my 10 month old son and wife.

I have been offered a job which is offering more (£29k) and only a 18-20 min commute. The day also finishes at 16:30 so home earlier. So it should be a no brainer. The downside is it's in a completely different industry (food production) I would be working in the operations support side so mostly desk based.

I'm just scared of making the jump, fear of not enjoying my new job as I have just settled in this one (1 year in) fear of not being good at my job. I'm not sure if I should stick it out look for something else or take this job which has its good perks as discussed. It's driving my crazy."

This is all weird but who knows some might like doing it this way, here's how i think its fraudulent, they want me to complete a basic dbs however, this is usually done on .gov website and the pricing is £18

What they have done is sent me this link [Basic Disclosure (uk-disclosures.org)](https://uk-disclosures.org/Basic-Disclosure/) , when i viewed the html it looked pretty basic, like one that was just put together also when i try to search the company burgwallets as indicated by their email, i cannot see anything online at all"

I worked as an HR Analyst for my old company for over a year and left in October 2022 for a better role, same pay but with much more potential.  I get to the new job and company switches gears and I'm out the door within a month - layoff.  I omitted this role from my resume and didn't put it on my application (I don't need any security clearances so I figure that is a safe move?)

So in the mean time I worked with my family construction company to make a few extra dollars to not damage our emergency fund.  

I have an interview on Monday for a Senior HR Analyst, I feel confident that I can do well on this interview as I was basically this person in the original role.  But not sure how to answer the 2-3 month gap from October to January? 

TL;DR - need help answering the 2-3 month gap from last job to the one I am interviewing for (Left on good terms/voluntary quit)  

I'm friends with my old manager - who left prior to me around September 2022 if that can help answer questions.

If more info is needed, I'm happy to answer

I chose this company among other companies I had successful interviews with because I believed that it would be massive in a couple of years and I wanted to be a part of it no matter the role I got. I was to work about 5 hours from Monday to Friday which was fine with me as long as it didn't interfere with my university education

So after my classes from 8am to 1pm, I would go to work. It was an on-site job so I was expected to drive about 1 hour to the place. Everything was fine and I did what was expected of me, spoke to people about how things operate with their app, tried to gain as much info as possible and I constatnly asked for advice whenever I made mistakes. The people were nice and the boss would chat with me at times to make sure I knew what was going on with the startup and what direction it will take.

Fastforward to 2 weeks after starting the internship, it was Saturday (my day off) and the boss held a mandatory Zoom stand-up meeting for us to discuss what we've done and what we would do that day (I still attended the meeting to see how they talk). The boss tells me that he wants me to come collect the tablet from the office (for testing purposes) and that he's expecting me to come at around noon. I replied that I didn't work Saturdays and I'll be collecting it on Monday and to leave it in the drawer. Silence. And then he tells me that he'll call me after the meeting.

After the stand-up meeting, the boss calls me and tells me that he didn't like the attitude I use in the work environment. I apologized to him for it if I offended him and said that I still wouldn't be able to come on my day off because it was the weekend and I wanted to chill out after a week of classes and 5 hour shift. He then tells me that this kind of attitude won't get me far and he ends my internship.

Can someone explain to me why this happened? What did I say/do wrong?

Sorry for the long story but I need to know this so I can prevent this from happening again."

Even with that, I am never doing enough and they always ask why I haven't done more (I asked and an existing employee confirmed I am doing it right and as fast as they could).

Everyone works every weekend, holiday, and doesn't take vacation.

This is already destroying me and it was supposed to be remote with occasional hybrid but they have be coming in more days then I'm not. It's am hour away.

This morning, I got a text being chewed out for not being there at 8 when I was told it was 9. I'm looking for other jobs and won't be putting this on my resume.  I know these are first world issues and I should be glad I have a job, but they make me feel so awful about myself. Remind me I have to stick it out during these interviews.

Could I work a job w/o my meds?,u/Th3MysticArcher,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1041sv8/i15f_really_need_a_job_my_biggest_problem_is_my/,jobs,"As the title says, I really need a job. I’m in 10th grade and take adderall everyday for my ADHD. I also have an afternoon dose that can wear off anywhere from 6:00-8:30PM. I know for a job I would have to work past that dose often, if not always. 

There’s quite a few fast food places and grocery stores within 5~ mins of my house. I have my driving permit, but could walk/ride a bike if I needed to.

I like to think I would be good at an average retail job. Given, I’m not exactly sure what I would be good at, but I do work very hard.

Sorry if I put too much, I tend to info dump and figured gauging my full situation might be helpful.



TLDR - Would I be able to work a job after my ADHD meds wore off?"

Despite pretty good feedback from projects I have worked on, I still have a feeling that I’m soon going to be seen as a mistake hire because I’m not picking up on process efficiency as quickly as others. My role is brand new and I’m the only one with my title, and I’m one of the only ones in the office without a CPA license or studying to get one. 

I think a lot of it stems from traumatic experiences from my last job and was eventually let go from(boss never gave feedback, blamed me for things going wrong, 4 days of training, never feeling appreciated, etc) and has created this mindset that I have to be perfect or close to perfect or else I’m on the hot seat. Does anyone have pointers on how to look at this or deal with it in a more healthy way?"

As free-thinking and free-living individuals we must allow ourselves time of leisure. This time of relaxation is what allows for real productive thought and abstract inspiration. This time may not directly benefit your organization but it does directly benefit the individual. 

Leisure is the time that you come up with the shape of your consciousness. Who are you? Who do you want to be? How do you make your dreams a reality? To clearly see the steps required you must break down the large goals into smaller, attainable goals that lead up to the dream over time. This process requires extended durations of a relaxed mind. Without that time, you are likely to get stuck in the hamster wheel of labor like the majority of working people in America. 

Use your paid time off.. and use it well."

Now the thing that confuses me slightly is that originally because this was what Hannaford originally had up on indeed was for the deli department but then on December 18th they put up they were looking for full-time bakery associate

Now since I previously with my last job worked in a bakery inside of grocery store doing the same thing that they were doing there it seem to go fit. Now the posting was after my first interview

So when I had had my follow-up interview the Wednesday before Christmas they talked about cross training between the deli and the bakery and they told me I would hear something that Thursday like mid afternoon specifically just not an exact time. Just mid afternoon was a general area and I had heard nothing and so I waited after Christmas and I called them and they said they didn't internal move in the bakery and they call me if things changed not mentioning the deli

So I sent them an email mentioning the cross training in the deli and I received an email saying that if I would want to do the deli department to call them and everything on Tuesday later that day while I was cleaning my room. Not expecting a phone call at all. I get a phone call and they were talking about working in the bakery department and everything

So when I did all my orientation stuff for them and everything I did all the paperwork signed everything it was sent home with. It had an apron and I was told that the team was like five people. I don't know if it includes myself or if that's how many other people there are. I was given the amount of hours by them so they could have easily given me full time hours and everything

Because today when I was looking at reviews of the specific answer that I am going to be working at, I scroll down and bottom the page and saw that they were looking for a part-time bakery associate which is a little weird that they just posted that today

So I did a search on indeed. Found it and it didn't say anything about the hours or when they were needed to work. It just said that they needed someone. I don't know if this is a bad thing for me or something? I don't understand why they be posting them and they could have just as easily give me full-time hours"

I work in a VERY niche field that I went the grad school for. I absolutely love what I do and would never want to exit this field. I've currently been at my job for around 2.5 years, and have been looking for a new job since July. I've had some success with interviews, but most of those came from me cold-emailing companies and asking if they would be interested in talking. People are nice but they just aren't hiring right now.

I am in a Linkedin group of people in my field - there are maybe 5,000 of us total and a lot of people freelance. They post jobs in this group and one popped up yesterday for a company, but the job isn't exactly what I want but I at least know they are hiring. Now, since the field is small, there are two people that I know of who graduated from the same school I did and who work jobs there doing EXACTLY what I want to do. Would it be unprofessional for me to reach out to one of them on Linkedin and say something along the lines of ""Hi I wanted to reach out - I saw you graduated from X and are now working at Y company. I noticed you guys were hiring, but I'm interested in more of a Z position. Do you know if Y company is interested in hiring more of Z people?""

My current position is cushy and I am surviving but not thriving. It's been almost two months since I've seen a position pop up AT ALL. Should I message on Linkedin? What do y'all think?"

I wasn't really taught how to look for jobs or find them by my parents, so I feel a little clueless and embarrassed! I have 3 years of experience with customers, obviously.

the previous daycare i worked at was my first job, and it had a good routine. this new place has a schedule but it’s Extremely loosely followed. there’s no real relationships had with the parents, nor the kids honestly. it just kind of feels like i’m just Literally staring at these kids all day. the one teacher told me that people keep leaving after getting hired recently, and it felt really suspicious. something is just off and i can’t pinpoint exactly what it is."

I have my bachelors and masters in counseling. I'm fully licensed and have been working in mental health through a 4 year volunteer at a suicide hotline, 4 years of addiction rehab work, and 2 years of private practice. I like working with some of my clients but I hate how little money I make and how much burn out I stave off every damn day. I want a job where I don't have to take care of folks anymore and can make some actual money.

I love working with computers but don't have coding experience, plus I'm worried the field is saturated and I know a few people who are struggling to find a job without the hustle/networking crap. One of my dream jobs would be an editor of sorts (academic papers, books, articles, blogs, whatever), but I don't have transferable skills. Like everyone else in the world, working from home is a priority but I know it's likely a pipe dream.

I would be open to going back to school but I'm just so frustrated by pouring my life and soul into this job and then getting nothing out of it.

During the application process, I spoke to the HR person about the situation with the director-level role and if I was being considered. They said the position was ""on hold."" 

A few days after I joined, I learned through my boss that the director-level position was in fact open (and still is, far as I know). Now I'm not going to suggest they deceived me or anything. At the same time, I feel like I should get a fair shot at that role because I applied for it before. How should I handle this information? Should I reach out and ask to be considered? It's worth mentioning the director-level position pays about 40% more than what I'm making now."

It usually occurred while I was walking or holding/carrying something (even things that were only like 3 pounds or less), but sometimes it would happen when just standing somewhere.

A friend vouched for me, but I also provided a ton of work (for over a year as a contractor) that was major contributing factor to some big shifts in company structure. He was promoted from director level to VP to a brand new department, much due to my work. Shortly after, I was offered a full-time job, which I accepted. I stayed senior level. He still depends on me a lot and, frankly, I am not enjoying my time here.

Well, being the competitive industry it is, another company gave me an offer for a lot more money. It’s about a 30% raise and a lot more equity.

The company I’m at won’t match.

Am I wrong to accept it? When do my responsibilities as a friend end? I know I’m putting him in a difficult spot and, trust me, it’s the one thing that makes this a hard choice for me.

I’ve been guilt tripped by his boss and a bit by him, but I don’t think friendship should have any bearing over the career choice of another.

I’ve been an agricultural worker / seasonal harvester my whole life. I do seasonal restaurant BOH work during off seasons. I’ve found that it’s a lot a easier for me as a blind person to get hired at places that allow you to “test” before you get the job. Trial shifts pay in cash at end of shift and you know if you get the job or not. 

I’ve been trying to get out of manual labor as I need to learn Braille for college (agriculture leadership &amp; mass communications) and I can’t learn Braille if my hands don’t have the option of being sensitive. My current restaurant jobs have me handling 100-120F dishes as soon as they pop out of the sanitation machine along with having thick calluses from farm work. 

What would be a good place for me to break into? 

I’ve been applying to mainly retail and receptionist positions but I tend to be taken off the schedule within 2-4 weeks once they realize I need hands on training and not computer only (re: very few retail or receptionist places have screen reader accessible software for training). This has only happened with these types of jobs despite me making sure to show up early, cover shifts etc.

I am done working within 1 - 2 hours (Yes. Seriously) After that, I have ABSOLUTELY N.O.T.H.I.N.G to do. There's so little to do, I am only making 7 hrs.

Usually in my spare time, I create ideas, spreadsheets, processes, find new was of doing things (Our company does everything on paper we do not have a system) all of that feels like a waste of time because the majority of the ppl here dont want to change. 

Even though we NEED a system, the owner hasn't mentioned any plan of changing in the future.

What am I even doing here? (Obviously need to work)

I'm bored out of my f\*\*\*\*\* 

I take 20 minute breaks every hour to kill time.

My boss has even said that there will be days where I'll ask my self ""Why did I even come in today?""

Mostly importantly,

It's getting to a point where I dont even care about my job anymore. I do things whenever I feel like it regarding work, if i get to it i get to it, if not i honestly do not care. This is bad and I am wondering why I am starting to care less and less.

Honestly the 48 min drive and then only having an hour or two to do work, seems like it's absolutely pointless to even continue working here.  But I'm in a niche role, there are not very many electrical contractors hiring for purchasing agents.

my boss has continued to promise me full time since I started and has yet to do it still.  this doesn’t necessarily contribute to my anxiety but it’s so frustrating because he thinks I can pay bills working 10 hours a week. but he doesn’t want me working “too much” on projects that require extreme attention to detail and I feel rushed. this has caused me to miss things, both big and small, on recent projects. 

he also asks me to do certain things, like email a client something, but the client will get upset about it. or he will forget to do something important with a document and blame it on me (this is all in front of clients btw). it makes me look bad when in reality I’m doing everything he’s asked me to do. 

this was a big leap for my career and my “dream job” but I’ve felt nothing but stress since starting. since I’m only working (as a freelancer really) would it be bad to quit? would a 2 weeks notice even be necessary?

Ideally I'd like to start working at the new job ASAP to start making money again and have those benefits. Because work has been so slow, I know my boss would understand if I wanted to start another job immediately without a two week's notice.

However, I didn't disclose to my future company that my current job is essentially part-time or how few hours I've been working lately (and I don't want to share that information).

On Jan 4, they basically sent me the same email as before, only from the second supervisor who led my last interview. Now today, I received an email from the head of the department, who I met but didn’t interview with, saying he wanted me to be aware that they are still reviewing candidates and no decision has been made.

I’ve never been in this position before where  so much effort has been taken to keep me updated, though it’s better than being ghosted, but I’m not sure if there is anything else this could be a sign of?

I've worked with individuals with ASD for about 4 years, going on 5 this summer. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in social work, and am currently in a graduate program for special education/applied behavior analysis (ABA). I've been in my current field (ABA) for about 1.5 years and have continuously job hopped throughout my time in the field. I am with company #3, and have not managed to stay at one place for more than 6 months. this is due to difficult caseloads, lack of support, toxic work environment, unethical practices, etc.

I'm seriously considering leaving the field (partially) despite getting a degree in ABA due to burn out and poor mental health. I absolutely love working with individuals with ASD, but my mental health has taken its toll, especially within the last few months. it's come to my conclusion that this type of work might not be for me as I am not happy and am constantly stressed.

I was casually browsing jobs and came across one that very much interests me, but I am thinking I am underqualified for the position. basically, it is a job where I would be sharing resources to parents who have a child with ASD in a hospital setting. while I have knowledge about ASD, I am limited on resources/parent interactions since I've mainly directly worked with clients. however, the job description just says that the only requirements are a bachelor's degree and preferred experience with the autism population. this is different from anything I've ever done, but I cannot stop thinking about the position. additionally, with my frequent job hopping and the fact I just started my newest one 3 months ago, I am not sure how that would work for future employers.

thoughts on applying to this job/job hopping? sorry for rambling, but any advice or input would be helpful!"

So I just got back from an interview with an insurance company. This was the second interview after having a group zoom webinar/interview two days ago. This interview was more about the next steps and how the pay works. I’ll do the best I can to give as much details in the easiest way possible without exposing anyone (especially since I privately recorded it in audio 😎).

For compensation, it seems like it is straight-commission with an expected total of $2246.40 per customer with $270 stock bonus and $135 APO bonus for year one (comment me for more explanation cuz I ain’t good with this stuff). 

The job itself sounds like its basically helping small businesses by selling insurance. Now the issue is, I am not as much of a sales person (or at least have as much experience with pitching sales). I’m an INFJ, which means that sales is not a usual industry for my personality, so I am afraid that I might not get enough pay (or get paid at all). I have another interview coming up for another company and I am still awaiting for another company’s decision. For this insurance company, I am expected next Thursday to talk with the boss again.

To sum up: I graduated 3 years ago from a fairly well known liberal arts institution. My degree is skillwise essentially useless. I had no idea what I wanted to do while in school, I hated being there at all, and I had a horrible horrible mental health struggle during it. I interned nowhere during or after, and immediately after graduation I eschewed ""desk work"" in favor of working at a ranch and saving up money during the pandemic. Then I joined a conservation corps, where I worked as a forestry crew member, then a crew lead. All my friends currently are heavily invested in conservation careers, going into wildland fire, wildlife biology, etc. At 26, after years of manual labor, I am sick of the great outdoors and want a career that is both easier on my body and more fulfilling intellectually. I have always loved writing, I have a strong interest in political affairs and policy making, but absolutely NO professional experience in any of this, nor does it pertain to my useless degree. I have been looking at internships related to political analytics, very low level journalism type gigs (almost more PR than anything), anything that seems like it might be up my alley.

I feel like I messed up my life by frittering away my college days. I have a slightly clearer idea of what I want to do now but I feel old, inexperienced. How on earth can I break into something so unrelated to these grueling manual labor jobs I have been slogging through? I am persistent, intelligent, I have leadership experience and a host of soft skills from leading a crew in the back country, but no technical skills outside of forestry grunt work. I would love to do something with writing, something in the political realm, something involving both, maybe still involving conservation to some degree. Does anyone have any advice at all? What ground level entry gigs or internships might I be elligible, and more importantly, where the heck do I find them? Money is not super important at the moment, I've been poor my whole life.

Thanks in advance.

TLDR: majored in 'useless' liberal arts related nonsense, been doing manual labor in the conservation world since then, want to switch to something involving writing, or politcs, or both but don't know how."

I helped her with her resume, and I gave her resume to one of the bosses with great references. She previously worked unloading trucks at a grocery store for 5 years, so her new position as a receptionist, to me, seemed like a great opportunity for her to start a career in a much better environment.  The only fact that I found to be strange, was that she was not applying to different jobs, but she was mostly obsessed with the open positions available at the company I work for. As I know her for 15 years and I consider her my very good friend, I helped her without expecting anything in return.

Now, fast forward 6 months since she was hired, and I am having the following issues:

\- She uses me as her therapist during work time. She has problems with her ex and comes to my desk to talk about her problems for quite a while. The company has a laid-back culture, and no one would get into trouble because of it but I am tired of hearing about someone else’s problems on demand. There is a difference between listening to her once a week and every day at any time of the day.

\- She keeps complaining about her job already, even though she is a less physically demanding job at a higher pay rate than in her previous position. Now, she wants to know how much money people in my department are compensated, and she told me she wanted to apply to work there too.

\-  I feel better at work when she is not there. When she is there, I feel like I need to be in friendship mode with her all the time. If I do not show up to work for some reason, she calls me to see if everything is OK. It feels like she knows too close about different aspects of my life. Work and my personal life got mixed up and I am not knowing how to handle it.

It seems like her life has always been drama and now everything related to her at work is drama too. I am so tired of her. I already found a new job and I knew I would not stay in this company for too long, so this situation is transitory. I am writing this just to warn anyone out there who wants to help a friend in need, DO NOT refer a friend to the same company you work for. Your friendship will probably change, not to mention all the risks you face if your friend turns out to be a subpar employee.

  POST EDIT:

Thank you for all that replied to my post.

For those who said that I am the problem because I have low boundaries, that is true. I am a people pleaser, and my first impulse is to help and understand the other side. I need to learn how to work on that.

What bothers me the most about her is that she has had issues with a lot of people at work. She is always saying something about someone or talking about what this or that person did to her.  This is a situation that I do not understand because, before she started in this company, what she mentioned about employees had never bothered me. She talks about the lady who works from home and has more privileges than the others, she got her heart pumping fast and was all infuriated when a coworker made a joke she did not like, she went to HR and told them that they made a mistake AND it was their fault. There is more to the history, but I will stop here. The bottom line is, I liked working for this company way more when she was not there because I was not involved in any drama.

I do not regret referring her to the hiring manager, but I feel that it is time for me to follow my path and wish her the best. "

I'm an undergraduate and was looking to find a PI whose lab I could join as an assistant. I'm interested in science research of all kinds, but physical/natural science would be golden.

What I'm specifically asking for is a database or list of PI's. If it's organized by location and how often they produce research, that would be optimal. I guess the main hurdles for me are location, so I can help out more and be able to go regularly, and secondly just finding the right person. Another issue has been experience. Alot of the research programs available ask for prior research experience, several letters of recommendation, etc. I'm new to actual research, so I have no prior research. Although I have worked with patients in a volunteer setting, and have taken a couple classes with lab work.

If you are a PI, or know someone who would be interested in taking on assistant, let me know. But otherwise a list/database would be very helpful. Thanks!"

I currently make 55k (top of the range for this role according to Glassdoor) and have worked here for about 7 months. I don't mean to toot my own horn, but I feel like I've been a pretty good employee. I'm always eager to help out, and more importantly, trimmed down the workflow for a certain task so that it takes seconds instead of hours. Not only did I take on tasks that required more a little more tech expertise, but made new requirements for the role by slowly making people learn/use shell scripting too. I focused primarily on the tech side of my job because it's obviously more lucrative for me down the line. I've also recently noticed that my boss wants me to start training workers outside of my team.

I know that other coworkers who have worked for 2.5 and 3.5 years are getting paid 55k and 57k respectively. For additional context, another one of my coworkers who is straight of college (like me) and has no industry experience makes 52k (I often do all the work when we get assigned together). I also expressed in my appraisal that I'm willing to take on more work from the tech side of things because I can only tell my boss so many times.

What kind of raise is realistic? It seems like there's a cap at or around 60k for this role and the idea of making 57k for all the work I put in frankly makes me want to scream. I saw online that bonuses can be a good way to to circumvent a salary cap. Am I hoping for too much? I have another new coworker that also works hard and suspect he's worrying about the same thing.

This is my first corporate job so any advice is much appreciated!"

2,2023-01-05,I cannot find a job: What am I doing wrong?,u/hhkhkhkhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/104gy9f/i_cannot_find_a_job_what_am_i_doing_wrong/,jobs,"Hello all, I was hoping to gain some insight from this post. 

For context, I graduated in 2020 and was denied an internship with my undergrad (B.S. Psychology) due to the pandemic. To make ends meet, I began working in retail and then subbing as soon as schools went back in session. 

Here's the jobs I've worked for. 

* Special Education Teacher (learned lots of technical and analytical skills from this one) 
* Rehabilitation Educator (again, learned a lot of technical and analytical skills from this one) 

I worked as a special educator for one year becauase the education system is crumbling and the demand was not equal to the pay that I was getting (less than 30k a year, but easily working 60+ hours a week). My rehab job is contract work. When I was employed I was promised that I would be clocking in at 35 hours a week, but recently, I've only been contractd to about 15. Additionally, I was initially told that I would have the opportunity to move up in the company, but that ended up being an exaggeration becuase full time employment is not offered until, ""You've been with the company for 1.5 years."" 

So, I'm stuck. I DO NOT want to do anything else in education. I'm sorry, but no. The stress and energy is far to great for how little you get paid in these job sectors. I hated it then, I would hate it now. I enjoy my job with children with disabilities but many similar, full time positions require 1)An advanced degree or 2) An insane ammount of exprience (Like 5-10 years). 

I'm wanting to make a career switch. I'm good with data and documentation and I'm learning SQL to market myself even further. What jobs can I apply for that I can get help with? I'm afraid that my resume is sending a mixed message and the ATS system is just spitting it out at this point. 

My main goal is to be independent since I'm living with a relative atm. I want a good paying job that offers benefits. Tech is the obvious option and I'm leaning that way (due to my data and technical skills...that I will build more of). 

Are there any job title's im overlooking? Thank you in advance. I'm beginning to lose my purpose and becoming depressed. I cannot even get a receptionist job at this point because of all the 'entry level' BS out there."

Before i joined this company, there were gonna be 3 owners and I, the 1st employee. Well the other shareholders left and now theres only 1 owner left. And im still the only employee. 

He would call me every morning (i work from home) and yell at me to get things done. My man im the only employee im doing everything A to Z. Even though I was doing everything that he wanted. 

Well i got sick of it and i told the 2nd owner (while there were still 2) that im not understanding the yelling part every morning. I dont understand why hes mad when i didnt pick up his phone call on Thanksgiving day. And when i did call him back thanksgiving day, he just talked about work, and asked why i didnt pick up his call. It was nothing urgent. 


Then he told me to come in for a meeting face to face. That commute is 2 hours one way. That meeting was 4 hours long. Just me and him. And he just kept trying to get a reaction out of me. Even to the point where he said “you dont show emotion and i wanna know what gets you “excited” (he meant angry)” just kept trying from different angles. “You millennials are lazy” “this aint a 9 to 5 i want you on the phone 24/7””help me build this business because everyone else left” i just gray rocked hard. No emotions, nothing. Should i have told him off? I don’t know. 

Im thinking this is my first job out of college. I cannot take that responsibility for entry level pay. The only reason ill help “build your business” is if im a shareholder, not an employee. 

Well now i’ve found another job which is not a startup. Theres like 20 people at that company that do what i will be doing. And that team is growing.

As for my current job, im about to send in a 2 week notice. They dont have anyone else lined up. There is someone they’re trying to bring on but she cant join till October of 2023. I know the boss is gonna go ballistic. But if your leadership style is you shitting on your employees constantly so they feel like they’re worthless and cant go anywhere else, lol try that with someone else. I know what i bring to the table.

EDIT: a lot of people have suggested not giving a 2 week notice and quitting outright. When I was hired and we were talking expectations, he told me “everyone promised me a 2 week notice, and no one ever gives one.” Hmmm gee I really wonder why everyone wants to get away from you fast."

With this comes client, leads, and all of our branches reaching out to me 24/7 to my personal phone number (a work phone wouldn’t work bc the business model essentially isn’t set up for 9-5 hours and whoever is in charge needs to see if any issues arise). Long story short I have hit such a burn out after working for this company I can’t look at my phone. Every vacation I’ve taken I have my work computer and laptop with my boss still on my ass even if she knows I’m on vacation. The only time I’ve had a week to myself was when my appendix burst and I was in the hospital for 2 weeks (they still asked if I could answer emails). 

So I tell my boss I need a break - she’s still on my ass. After really thinking everything over I didn’t think I could enthusiastically respond to clients in an appropriate time like was needed and I quit. I’m not really sure why I’m posting this but I don’t have another job lined up - wish me luck 🍀 take vacations from work my friends"

I had work at a corrections facility for over 3 and a half years and finally from all the stress due to 12hr shifts, and constant overtime, I just had to leave even if it meant taking a huge pay cut which I end up doing. The place I've been working the past year and half has been OK ,if a little unfulfilling, with little stress and even have received some nice pay raises thanks to positive feedback from customers. Out of the blue around Christmas time, the corrections facility I worked for called me and asked would I consider going back with an 8hr schedule Monday through Friday without the overtime and I said yes. Now I'm having doubts about this. This is the same place who told me and others lies and if I go through this and accepted this position they can always change their mind and put me back to where I was. On the other hand if it does work out this would be the best career choice I've made since I actually loved what I did. Though if it doesn't work there's a chance that I threw away an OK job for nothing and now have to work myself up again from the bottom doing job searching. I guess the dilemma I'm facing is should I go forward with this new job knowing the high reward, but very high risk or should I stay where I'm at knowing I'm comfortable.

1,2023-01-05,(23) Probably going to lose first post-college job and trying not to panic,u/BraveCheesecake6090,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/104jj7o/23_probably_going_to_lose_first_postcollege_job/,jobs,"Came into the job at a bad time for a team that was organized in a terrible way with me, the junior communications person, working out of a completely different office than the rest of the team whom were all in the same office. Because of some stuff involving other teams and things from before I joined the company the client was pulling back on a lot of stuff and asking for higher seniority than normal leaving me with very little material to build post-corporate-onboarding. Bring this up repeatedly with managers and other staff and either be assured everything is normal or I’m doing fine. Months later they’re gunning for me because I’m way behind where someone of my hire-time should be. 

Really haven’t learned much of anything that wasn’t company/client specific or just reiteration of stuff I did in college. Especially worried because this wasn’t a HARD job just learned the hard way that the constant starting and stopping and pace and subject changing of being a mostly remote junior communications associate is really bad for my concentration as I made frequent mistakes and frequently got lost in conservations with managers and coworkers as project names and production steps would quickly blend together in my mind. 

Got a google ad certification out of it at least 

Obviously next steps are to apply like mad for the next few weeks before I’m likely officially unemployed (performance notes this week were extremely contradictory and given to me by someone who isn’t my manager so I see the writing on the wall) 

Non-compete is a extremely vague about job functions/industry parameters but defines the “area” as a 50 mile radius of any city the company has an office in. This is most major US cities and many major non-US cities like London and Toronto. 

Luckily I’m likely to get unemployment benefits as by state law as only ex-employees accused of misconduct can be denied, which I am not. I’m just a bad fit who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  

I put feelers out a few weeks ago and got a lot of responses and did a few interviews, but for a little while before the holidays it looked like I was going to save my job. 

I’m scared because when I was looking at jobs after graduation I was frequently bombarded and invited to scams because it’s easy to promote scam marketing and communications jobs. 

(Also all very stressful because ice felt bad and anxious at work for months while having all my friends and family and co workers tell me I had nothing to worry about)"

At the company I work for in the past 3 years or so, have given gifts for anniversary dates, and professional days (depends on your job title). The gifts would be small things, they give everyone a list of stuff to vote on around the beginning of the year. Then the highest voted ones can be chosen as a gift for those special dates during the rest of the year.

But at the end of this year, they decided to end this practice in favor of using Awardco. Which is basically a company where your employer gives you points, and you can spend those points on personal gift items, or gift cards (like Amazon). The gift then gets delivered to your personal address, so you don't need to go pick it up anywhere.

Being as this is new to our company, we all got 75 points to spend. (Yippie me, last year I got a $750 bonus after taxes, the only one I've ever gotten after working there for 5 years, this year I basically get $75. For those of you that didn't catch it, the Yippie me, was sarcasm. Also, yes 2 out of the 5 years we got nothing. No gift, No bonus. Also no raise for about 3 of those years too.)

Anyways, I was reading all the polices that Awardco has, and it says something about being taxed on getting a gift card. Now it is our choice to get either personal items, which are not taxed. But if we choose a gift card we are taxed on it? So it wouldn't actually be a gift card for $75? What would it be then? Also this feels really wrong to me as I am being taxed on unearned income that is less than $400. Either way kind of feels like a slap in the face by the company but what am I going to. Go on the internet and complain..."

a few more people asked after that. on my last day, HR asked during my exit interview. each time, i gave the same answer.

definitely left on good terms, or at least i thought so. this morning, i got an email from my old company's head of HR asking the same question again.

I am confined to part time remote work at the moment. I have a Masters degree in Urban Planning and my Bachelors was in Psychology. I am very good at writing, research, analysis/problem solving, teaching (I have tutored before online) and can handle customer service but would prefer it not be a job where I am on the phone all day.

Writing and Research are probably my best attributes for work from home jobs that are part time, as my field of urban planning rarely offers PT work to my knowledge.

All I see when I look for this type of work online are a bunch of scammy looking websites, jobs that barely pay (below minimum wage), or options that might not be great for me (constant phone calls all day).

I am a bit pickier than I should be, but that is mostly because I am looking out for my health and am supposed to reduce stress per doctor's instructions.

I have the education, some work experience in urban planning, mental health, and education (tutoring). But I am having trouble finding something that can fit me. Usually the biggest barriers are the Part Time aspect (everything is either full time or unreliable) and of the jobs available that I can probably do, I don't always have all the qualifications (e.g. I am well versed in psychology, but I am not qualified to conduct remote therapy, a popular job listing, in the United States).

I was so tired of the BS promise as this was the third time I was passed over.
 So fortunately as I said I was offered another opportunity. Gave my 2 weeks notice and the s h i t hit the fan. Now my boss is offering in writing to give me a 10% raise on top of the 5% I got two weeks ago.

These cause me a handful of issues in daily life, but I'm really struggling to find a job that won't give me a panic attack or fire me for fidgeting and being, as described to me, rammy. I'm lucky enough that my main parent, my dad, isn't pushing me to get a job because he understands my issues, but I feel like I'm still letting him down.

The biggest issue is my noise sensitivity. I've tried headphones, earplugs, white noise machines, etc, but it's never enough. Sometimes I can moderately deal with it, but other days, I'm crying and shaking from the noise stimulation. I only do half days at school (grade 11) for this very reason, because I start going into a panic attack from all the noise. Kids walking, talking, lockers, pencils, the speaker, etc, it all builds up.

Second reason is my fidgeting. I cannot get this under control no matter what I do, and it stresses me out when I focus on not doing it. Not sure if this is normal, but when I heavily focus on something precise, my chest hurts and my head pounds. This happens when I try to stop the fidgeting. I can't stand still for the life of me, always needing to shift my weight between my legs, change how I'm standing/sitting, and fiddle with something. Even at school, on an average one hour class, I'll have changed my seating position maybe 20 times or more.

There's a couple more things, but those are the two major ones. Is there anywhere I could possibly work that I can actually go to constantly and not turn into a shaking ball of anxiety from noise?"

They're a closed friend group that I thought I would get along in the beginning, but turned out to be even worst than I though. We're all around the same age and I discovered they all knew each other before entering.

The things is, in the beginning they were very nice and invited me for their gatherings. Now, they simply ignore me. During lunch breaks I'm quiet because I know they won't listen to me. So I just stare at their convos. Usually they're always taking about their personal lives and their plans all together (in front of me, never asking me to join them). Sometimes they don't even bother to say good morning or see you tomorrow. More often than now they give me tasks they don't won't to do so they can leave the office. There have been 2-3 times where some of them talked to me in a more agressive/rude way. They often talk to me with contempt, they won't even make eye contact and are almost bored if I say literally anything, which nowadays is just talking about work.

I often feel insecure and incompetent.

Is this consider bullying?

I work at a small startup and we're expanding, and I am one of two in marketing who have been promoted after a year and a half of working there. We are hiring interns and entry level positions so fresh grads or uni students. I know what it's like to come into a startup where everything happens quickly and you've got to be on it, but it's a really rewarding place to work where I see my efforts have a tangible impact on the company. The CEO is my direct superior, and is very reasonable and is always open to suggestions and I feel listened to if I need to tell him anything.

He basically told me to look for a new 'me' to train up, and we've put job ads out on LinkedIn and had quite a few applicants. I'm not a recruiter so all I am looking for are things that I put on my application when I first applied and looking for similar personalities or complementing ones. Interviews are one thing, but once hired I'm pretty nervous to become someone's boss. I appreciate the trust the CEO is putting in me and my other colleague, and I'm not worried about teaching the new hires the skills and tools that I had to learn.

I guess I just want some advice on how to be a good boss. I hear all these horror stories of bosses asking employees to work weekends, late hours, micromanaging and I definitely don't want to be that. I want to strike a balance between trusting them to do their job, but being someone they can ask for advice. Is there anything you wish your boss does or actually does that you really appreciate, or anything else I should consider? Thanks"

I’m a 23 year old college dropout. And to make it even more pathetic it was communications. I was in my senior year and when covid hit I lost all motivation and that was that.

I’ve had enough of this. I know I need to change. Im just extremely unsure what direction to take. Im not sure if this is really the best place to ask for advice but I am very desperate to know what my real options are. For now I think I’m wasting away. Time is blowing by and I haven’t accomplished anything. 

I’m also not sure what I’m really capable of. After failing out of school I wonder where someone like me can actually succeed. I don’t know if it’s possible for me to find some kind of work now that allows me to grow and develop skills without starting over and going back to school for something else.

The number of jobs that invited remote workers to apply peaked at 20% of job listings in March 2022, but quickly fell to 14% through November 2022.

For reference, only 10% of jobs were inviting remote workers to apply around April 2021.

It was an internal shifting, meaning this person used to work at the company but a different branch/department. 

This person is supposed to handle certain tasks like making reports and support the team while also manage it when boss isn't around.
In reality, I'm the one who's been doing my job and his. My boss took a vacation for 2 weeks and since my boss has learned of his incompetence after hiring him, they assigned most of their tasks to me and my other colleague and very few to this supervisor.

Since my boss left for vacation, this guy has been coming late to work, spends all his time on breaks (he takes 3-4 breaks) and he takes all day to finish one simple task that should take no more than 3 hours even if youre the slowest person on earth. He constantly asks me to explain things to him, which he should know. He constantly underminds others' responsibilities and work.

Not to mention that he took 2 days off without informing the team. And on top of all that he respects on boundaries, he's extremely unprofessional and childish. He'd rather blame luck and misfortune and ""evil-eye"" for any mistake he makes.
In our company each team depends on the other teams to finish their job so they can proceed with theirs, yet He'd think that people are out to get him when they start complaining about delays and missed deadlines.

I'm honestly waiting for my boss to come back so I can tell them all about the unnecessary escalations that happened because of this guy, he has been given too many chances and I believe it's time for him to go.

I really don't wish anything bad for others but when someone is causing me issues that can be avoided if only they did their job well, then yes screw them."

I am not heartless, I sympathize and try to give him space but it’s been a year and his work ethic isn’t getting better (it wasn’t that great before this). He’s gay-the only reason I put this detail in here is maybe that’s why he hasn’t been fired (scared he’ll claim discrimination) 

He’s been offered part time or less hours but turns it down. So he lost his phone months ago and we have no way to contact him outside work. He gets away with a lot: he shows up hours late no prior notice , calls off a lot, vapes at work (inside the lab), will show up and ask to leave an hour in, watches movies when there’s work to do…

I take my break late, can’t get out on time, or have to let morning tasks carryover to second shift cause of him

And I’ve been putting up with it for months with little complaints cause I feel guilty cause he’s grieving. He’s turned down part time or extra time off. But This week coworkers are out sick or on vacation: basically down to 2 people in the morning and 2 at night

Yesterday he shows up 5hrs late no notice…said his alarm didn’t go off (not the first or even third time this happened) I was by myself struggling to finish everything. 

The boss said she’d write him up but I feel he should be fired by now. 

And I confided to my boss I’m uncomfortable working with him on one particular shift next week cause he’s so flaky. There are other people on but she told me I can’t pick and choose who to work with and seem to make me out to be the bad guy

I bet you if I told HR about a fraction of what he does he’d be gone, but I don’t want to be the reason for someone’s firing. Am just so frustrated he get a million second chances 

TLDR; Coworker lost his dad last year, makes mistakes left and right, screws over the team by not showing up never gives notice, anyone else would’ve been fired for half the stuff he does. When I confided to my boss about 1 particular shift I’d rather not work with him she acts like I’m the problem"

What happened was I worked in diversity part-time. I was tasked with assisting a co-worker of color after they had poor work performance. They improved and everyone was happy with my contributions, it was wonderful. However, when we discussed workplace culture, I brought up how this space was overly judgmental and didn’t equip employees with a chance to succeed. I mentioned the employee struggling and highlighted ways that our organization set him up for failure. I asked if the employee would still be here if I didn’t help, and they said yes. They told me someone else would’ve gotten the employee on track and I was being dramatic. I also had a conversation with my supervisor and told her that I didn’t feel as excited now that I’m at the job because of how toxic the culture was. Eventually, things went south with my boss. She and I had friction because I did a presentation and mentioned her, saying I wasn’t sure if everyone knew who she was. She then pulled me aside to tell me about work performance issues that she had with me, saying that she didn’t know what I could do to show her I could handle the responsibilities. These were things like not turning the light off when I left, pettiness. I wrote a resignation letter that I planned to give my supervisor when she came back from cancer treatment. However, she snooped in my desk and turned it in for em. I got a call and was told she turned it in to HR, they accepted my resignation, and that I needed to turn my equipment in. I wanted to sue her for turning in my resignation letter and snooping through my stuff. I told this to my friend and former co-worker(who I helped with work performance). He said that I can’t sue because it’s not illegal for a supervisor to go into their employee’s desk, especially because it’s the school’s property.

My current company is very “safe”, but that means that I remain part-time, working odd hours/weekends, and making a minimum. 

My major concern is job searching in this current market and making sure that I’m making the right decision by leaving. It’s a risk leaving my current job in retail, but I think if I’m able to make it to a solid 9-5 kind of job the benefits could far outweigh the risks.

Are there any good ways of knowing whether or not a company is volatile or could potentially be laying people off? Are there any red flags to look out for or perhaps any questions I could ask in an interview to ensure that the company is I guess for lack of a better word, doing well? 

Any thoughts or experiences would be appreciated. Thank you!"

Not on my part - on the employers part. Has anyone had anything like this during an interview??

It started off with her saying I wasn't a good fit for the job, right off the bat. I thought to myself ""okay maybe I don't have the experience she's looking for"" since its a mid-entry job so I brushed it off. She then asked me one question, why I applied, and I answered. She also answered her phone and spoke with somebody on the phone. She spent the remaining 20 minutes speaking to me (no more questions towards me) about how I may not be a good fit, about how I may not like the job, etc. As she was describing the job, she would throw things in like ""so this may not be a good fit"" or ""you may not enjoy that part of the work."" She kept reiterating that the job was mundane and can get boring. She was basically convincing me and begging me not to work there.

The part that got me was this. I put in my application that I wanted to step away from hands on work and focus on administration or management roles. She told me in the interview I wouldn't like the job because it wasn't hands on, involved math, and had a major writing component that can be boring for those who don't enjoy writing and said I should consider other departments for this purpose.

I was a writing minor in college.

She ended the interview pretty abruptly. She told me at the end that she doesn't want to ""settle"" for someone who isn't ""perfect for the job"" and then told me to email her tomorrow (aka today) if I wanted to continue the process. (Edit to add: the job has been open since October, 3 months).

I don't know if I just had a really weird experience, or if this is some kind of tactic people use?? I emailed this morning thanking her for her time but that I would not be pursuing the application further. Is this normal?

Edit to add: I forgot to mention, this is at a non-profit, so the pay is a pay cut for me and I genuinely liked the job. This job does not pay a lot, and we live in an underpopulated area/state, so I don't have any ""competition"" and I know there wasn't anyone else that applied."

And who are these people who are getting remote jobs at the drop of a hat? It has stressed me out because my current work environment is becoming extremely abusive but I’m essentially a wage slave until I can find a way to get out of here. I am also seeing the same jobs posted over and over and over again….even with the new year.

Edit: thanks for the comments, support, and advice everyone. I’m trying to take my frustration and put it towards sending more applications next week. I guess the fact I’m even getting interviews has to be kind of promising. It’s tempting to look for anything with how awful my boss is but at this point I’ll widen my net a little with remote but will not take anything in office that I know would make me really unhappy.

My current skillset: I've been a SaaS product marketer for the most part (except in my recent role, where I handled influencer relations). In SaaS, product marketing essentially means content marketing, so I have a solid content background. I sometimes do competitor analyses and email marketing, but content is my forte.

What I want to do: While I believe I can easily get another job in content, I don't see myself staying in content in the long run. It isn't easy to measure the impact of content or attribute revenue to content (it's possible, but it just takes a really long time to see any tangible results). Moving forward, I want to work in a role where I can contribute directly to the company's bottom line or at least show measurable impact in a relatively short time. One of the apparent reasons for my layoff was given to be a lack of quantifiable impact from influencer marketing (when has any branding activity's impact ever been clearly attributable in as short a time as 4 months??), and I don't want to be in this position again.

What would you recommend I learn to show immediate results and make myself indispensable at my next job? Something along the lines of SEO or analytics? Any suggestions are welcome!"

I have been doing entry-level positions for awhile now. Although I do like my current job, I want to find something better than just being the “lowest level” of the company. I think I’m a great worker and am highly motivated to continue learning at any job I do. We had two layoffs this year, and despite being the newest employee on our team, I made the cut and am still here. With job security being an issue, I am thinking about looking elsewhere but if I were to start over, I’d really like it to be in a higher-paying position. Most people would say it takes time to climb your way up, which is true, however I’d hate to spend years hoping for a promotion/great raise and never receiving one. I made the mistake of busting my butt for a year at my last job with near-perfect attendance in the hopes of a great raise, only to get a 45 cent/hr raise at my yearly review. This has really skewed my view on patience in the workplace (maybe somewhat entitled, but I worked so hard)! I put in my two weeks a couple days after that. And I look at my current company, and there are people at my job who have been here for 5+ years and are still in the same role. 

I don’t have official leadership role experience, and I don’t have a college degree, but I do have about 6-7 years of both hands-on and behind-the-scenes medical experience and customer service experience.

What advice can you guys give to someone like me? I’m ready to work for bigger and better things. I can’t helping feeling stuck since I don’t have a degree, but there are many success stories of people that don’t have a degree."

I had my performance review scheduled earlier today and was basically told they were letting me go effective immediately. My work ethics were great, but they wanted someone with a larger working skillset in an area that I am not at the greatest at. They wanted someone more web dev when I'm more in the web design. They ended the call saying they might be open to contract work for other projects that are closer to my skillset and that I didn't need to work for the rest of the day. They were very friendly about it, but I was still let go.

Shortly after, I started to notice my company accounts (emails, slack, etc.) were getting logged out. So I could only say bye in email to anyone's work email I remembered. I think I should of seen it coming, since my supervisors started asking me to upload my files to the company more frequently. 

On a good note, I get severance pay, and my work's health insurance will last for a bit.

This is the first time I was ever let go from a company. I'm currently in NYC and if anyone has advice on what I should do while I actively job hunt, please let me know. I've already updated my resume and started applying/looking for a new job.

TLDR; Wished everyone a happy new year before I took a week off for vacation and come back to a performance review being let go."

I never thought they’d want to interview me. 

What was it like working this job? I’ve never had a scope done, so I’m a little underprepared, but they said no experience was needed. The job is far from me, so I’m hoping the pay would make up for it. Do endoscopy technicians pay more than PCTs? 

Thanks!"

1,2023-01-06,I need advice for my resume.,u/algotrader_,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1053ffc/i_need_advice_for_my_resume/,jobs,"Hi,

After graduating from a top college of my country, I worked for a software engineering company for 4-5 months and then left it because of some personal circumstances. For a year, I worked on an awesome project which I'm quite proud of. After a year from when I left my last company, I joined another company. I loved working for them but they laid me off to reduce burn after 6-7 months. I have been unemployed for 3-4 months now and I'm looking for a new job. 

So, I was wondering what the best way to create a resume would be, should I add my independent project as a Stealth startup? Should I still say that my last jobs tenure is from startDate - present? Should I remove my first job all together? I'm really worried about it and I can't sleep at night because of this. Will I be able to find a software engineering job if I only mentioned company 1 and 2 with their perfectly correct tenures. 

I come from an extremely humble background and have worked very hard to get where I am, I don't want to be ruined because of some mistake that I made in my career's beginning. I'm very passionate about technology and software engineering. Please help me."

Took 2 gap years after high school and worked as a hostel receptionist. Was super fun but also tiring. Cant do this forever. I dont save money for the future, just for now so i had lots of fun tho traveling and going out.

Now studying. Living on loans and part time job (hostel receptionist too). Im studying a french 3yr program called ""Data science"" or ""Statistics and business intelligence"". The courses are interesting but I cant get myself to study : i cant focus and studying is not for me. I like working and earning money. I still am passing the classes but only cuz i learn the formulas by heart last minute without necessarily understanding. Also im good at cheating. The math/stats are super hard!! 

When im not at school, im working or out drinking/partying or exercising or playing guitar/drawing. I hate sitting still. I cant do it. I hate studying. But i want a good job in the future and good money. Smthg in the programming/Statistics field.

I'm coming to Reddit for direction because right now I have none. I've been drafting this post in my head for years but never mustered the courage because I know some jerk out there is gonna reply telling me to pull myself up by my bootstraps and suck it up. But I don't care because there's got to be more to life than this 9-5 bullshit.

I'm in school and live off campus to support myself. I've been battling intense mental health issues for a decade now and they are ruining my life. Before you ask, yes, I've been in therapy for nearly the same amount of time. But I have this really bad habit of only lasting at a new job for a few months before it makes me depressed and suicidal and I end up quitting. Usually, I have something lined up, but this time I don't. Then, I found another job that's all shiny and new for about a month, and then the cycle repeats.

I have this intense urge to be my own boss. For years now, I've realized I hate the anxiety and song-and-dance of working for others. I've tried waitressing, customer service, work-study at my university, remote works, internships, etc. The common denominator that I hated across all these jobs is being subservient to another person and the ridiculous status quo and unfairness that comes with it. 

So I quit my serving job today with nothing lined up, and I'm feeling scared but hopefully this will push me to get my shit together and live my truth. I want to be my own boss and get some money coming in but that's a huge leap and I'm worried. But I feel like this is the only way I can truly be happy. I know freelancing and self employment come with their own slew of issues but at least it's up to me and I won't have a control freak or micromanager to answer to who controls when I eat, piss, or get to go home/take time off.

Realistically, I only need to make $1.2k a month to be able to cover my expenses and be comfortable since I have a roommate who thankfully doesn't have to rely on my thready income. Some of my interests include: makeup (beauty, skincare, nails, etc.), film and photography, writing, acting, baking and cooking. These are just a few of the things I really enjoy that make my heart skip a beat and make life seem worth living. I'm a very passionate person and unfortunately, I can't simply keep my head down and work. It makes me suicidal and a shell of myself to do work that I feel is meaningless. 

I don't even want to be rich or even have crazy extra income. I just want to be able to cover rent, food, and take care of my pets. Please, please help me think of something. I feel like the walls are closing in and I'm out of options.

&amp;#x200B;

No TL;DR: Because there's no way to put this concisely. Just please help me."

I took recently a personal developing degree in graphic design, but quite frankly, everybody asks for experience, experience and experience or to even work full-time.

I can't currently work full-time because I just simply have so many commitments. I have therapy and I am learning Dutch two times per week. 

And as much as I want I currently signed a contract with the language school that I'm learning Dutch and I have to fulfill my contractual obligations until July, since it's six months and I am starting next week. 

I do not have experience, I mean how can I even have experience if I had never worked in my entire life.

I even asked for lower position jobs such as translating, teaching, reception, graphic design, project manager (due to thinking that the job didn't require experience), call-center.

And yet, everybody is refusing me for the stupid reasons ""Or I am too young"", ""Or I do not have experience"", ""Or oh we like your skills but we don't think you're a fit to our company at the moment, so can we stay with your contact in case we have a future vacancy?"" or ""Oh sorry, you must be mistaken but we don't currently have vacancies"" or ""Oh we want some to work full-time, based on the client's needs"". 

And I cannot understand, I am a very clever, smart and intelligent guy, I speak many languages (including English and my native Portuguese), am very good in what I do but I just can't simply understand why do they not accept me.

I mean come on, quite frankly how can I just find a job given this stupid excuses.

Given my tight schedule, how can I find a part-time job or even online if nobody is willing to hire someone that is not wllling to work 24/7, without any break in the week or even weekends.

I am just so desperate that I simply just don't know how to even procede.

Just what can I do?

How can I even find a job that allows me a flexible schedule?

Also how can I just work remotely online or even as a freelancer? What are the best platforms, how do they work and what are the tips you have for someone in my case that it's starting.

I have a very vast experience in blogging (which I started since July 2016), graphic design (which I started since my 11 years old) and I am an amateur photographer and I am an amateur cooker, and I am very good in anything related to history (including politics). 

I have so many ideas but quite frankly I just don't where to start, specially given that I do not have any market experience or even in the workforce.

Given this what are the best jobs that I could do to start, given my case?

Any tips or pieces of advice are highly appreciated.

Thank you for your time."

I’m on the Presidents list with a 3.9/4.0. I am set to graduate this spring(a full year early). I d worked my ass off at school. I did this while being a D1 track/xc runner, I have multiple records at my school so I’m not just there messing around. 

For the past 4 years I’ve worked at a farm and garden store doing basically any job you can imagine. I hated working there at first, there was a lot of hard labor that I wasn’t accustomed to. But over time I began to like it. Long story short the owner of the business is looking to sell and I want to purchase the business. I can take out a business loan and I know the owner would be flexible with me because he knows I have a passion for that place. 

My estimate is that the business is worth 3-4 million dollars which obviously I don’t have on hand. But I think I can come up with a way to pay the owner over a period of time. (Giving him a portion of the company for life or continuing to pay him, there are lots of solutions).

I'm aware of potential job scams which is why I've always research the company when applying on Indeed or my college career center job listing. However, I recently got contacted by two shady recruiters by text and email. One of them even tried contacting me by phone!

I knew they were scams because I didn't even recognize the companies. They would say ""We've recently review your resume..."" and try to schedule a interview the following week. Also, the second scam had a similar formating to the first which is another red flag. Checked their social medias as well which had barely any activity such as instagram, LinkedIn (especially checking on employees), and other traces of digital footprint.

What I'm really concerned was that I humbly replied to the first declining the offer. Was that a mistake? Did that reply automatically put me on a list of being message/email by more job scams? Please share some advice on how to avoid potential risks in the future.

Questions.

1. Should I change my email that I am using for job hunting? I am currently using a email that I've used for years mainly for ""professional/important"" reasons.
2. Should I block the numbers of these scams? Delete the email? Don't reply to the email?
3. Where did these scams come from? Indeed is my main site for applying for jobs. Should I remove my resume from my profile?"

21years old student (male if that makes a difference) in the UK.

Had odd jobs here and there mostly with family(self employed) with one officially employed job, but that was for the council when it was election season and was only for the day. I've done a fair bit of volunteering over the years and I'd like to think I have enough on my CV to show I'm not a complety boring useless person.

I've been applying to part time jobs while at uni. I started looking and applying in late September stopped in late October and started looking gain in late November. I must have applied to what feels like 100 jobs, all that I've seen on indeed and some of them I applied from the website instead. 1 job i handed in my application in person.(one of the more recent ones in mid December). 

The majority of the roles I have applied for are in bars, with some waiting jobs, a few retail jobs but I either get no response which seems to be the case with most of these places or an email saying no. Some companies I appreciate when they say if you don't hear back in this time we are sorry because at least I know. But I've seen so many jobs say no and then relist their jobs later that day or next day. I have applied to roles that say no experience needed and some jobs where I feel a monkey could do it. Some of these roles have silly test that I assume are just used to whittle down the people that A. can't be bother and B. Don't fit criteria. 

I'm eager to learn, I'm not stupid I just want to earn a bit of money while studying. I started adding a cover letter and I used the university help to create what is supposedly a good CV but yet here I am 4 months after starting to look and nothing. Yet some people I know for a job in a second, some of whom I don't think have much to offer. I keep telling myself the more that say no the closer I am to that yes but the application is more work than the job itself.

I'm sorry for the rant.

TLDR: Basically applied to a lot of places and I just don't seem to be going anywhere. I've change My CV and writing a cover letter for everything I've applied to in the last 2/3 months."

Companies are now also required to provide you with the salary range for your role in California if you ask them.


I was the user that posted [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/102w1u2/and_so_it_begins/) two days ago because there are still job postings for the state of California made *since* January first with no listed salary range. The same day I received a response:

&gt; Unfortunately, the Labor &amp; Workforce Development Agency does not handle these type of requests. However, I can recommend 2 options depending on what reasons you feel best to claim regarding your situation, or you can even try both.

&gt;Please review the websites and their options below:

&gt;- California’s Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) – Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (AKA Labor Commissioner’s Office): https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/

&gt;- California’s Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency (BCSH) – California Civil Rights Department: https://calcivilrights.ca.gov

I reached out to both organizations the same day with no response so far. I also have reached out to multiple people in HR at my company in regards to the salary range for my role and my emails and calls have been ignored. There is no open positions for my role so I can't just look up the job listings.

Tl;dr: Has anyone here at all had success in actually getting their salary range at their company?"

I am not from the US but currently live in Texas as a permanent resident. We are returning back to my home country this summer. I have been a stay at home mom until summer of last year when my child started pre k.

I then had a remote job for a month which turned out to be a scam and I had to file a claim for non payment of wages, which was ruled in my favor.

A few months ago I started working for a cleaning company in our town that cleans new construction homes. I thought it was perfect because I work very flexible hours and I am able to be there for my son when he is out of school.
The thing is, I never signed a work contract. I asked multiple times in the beginning and I was always told that she (my ""boss""?) will have something for me to sign soon. But I haven't gotten anything yet. I work alone a lot on my side of town because it saves me long drives. I have been accumulating anywhere from 12 to 15ish hours a week at an hourly rate of $15. We send a Screenshot of our hours every friday to her and then usually get paid via paypal by Sundays.  It has been late every now and then and when I ask about it in text it always takes her a few days to get back with me. When the pay is late, she always says it's because a home builder is late with the check. It's inconvenient but I have been understanding of that.
What worries me is that I recently asked about taxes and if I am getting anything from her and she said that I will get a 1099 and she will email me a contract too. I didn't know what a 1099 is until I started reading about it. It has been over a week and I haven't gotten anything. 

I am just trying to boost our budget a little before the move home. Am I on the hook for paying back a lot of taxes back? I'm just really confused and honestly a little disappointed about the lack of explanation from my boss/client. I also haven't gotten paid for last week yet. Today she showed up at one of my houses I was cleaning and started nitpicking my work. 
I guess I am just really not understanding what kind of job this is and if it would be better for me to let it go.

Thank you for reading this long text. I feel really dumb. I just don't know how things work here."

I've known I've been underpaid for quite some time, 30% underpaid mind you, but I took the job because I live in a rural area and the commute was less than 10 minutes. 

I hadn't really had an issue with this until this past week, I saw how much the client company pays my contractor. 

Literally double my wage. 

Now, I'm no genius here, but why would the client company pay the contracting company DOUBLE my salary? Knowingly? After taxes and other overhead employers have beyond salary, the contracting company NETS as much as I do in my best estimate, and in my worst estimate, they net 25% more than I take home!

Is this common practice? Beyond not giving it to me, why doesn't the client company just hire me directly for a fraction of what they pay the contracting company and save the difference?

The only answer I can come up with why they'd do this, is someone in the contracting company's upper management is performing extracurricular activities under someone from the client company's desk."
2,2023-01-06,"Should I chase money in something I may not like or be good at, or chase a risky feel-good career that I may not like or be good at?",u/ThrowThinkAway,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/105coij/should_i_chase_money_in_something_i_may_not_like/,jobs,"The higher paying fields I could possibly jump into now that I'm out of college but unable to land a full time job (albeit requiring likely further education, self-teaching or even going back to college...) would be an area in tech, programming, computer science, or IT. But the problem is it's not really my passion. I don't wake up everyday wanting to code or learn new technology and such. I use a lot of technology... as a consumer, but not as a creator or someone naturally interested in learning it.

Now, can I tolerate it? Questionable... I get frustrated easily by programming even though I was decent at programming during my Business MIS degree, I'm not good at math, and I'm also concerned if I would be able to stand IT and the inherent need to deal with potentially disgruntled customers/clients. 

Meanwhile I like random and mundane things like anime shit, fluffy dogs, reading books, being an advocate (before I suffered burnout anyway...) and... being kind. At least, that's what I ***think*** I like right now (admittedly I'm not in a great mental space). 

... but none of those are really employable where I am, or at least not sustainably. I live in a HCOL in the Bay Area that essentially guarantees poverty or borderline poverty level if I were to try going for your altruistic, feel-good career (e.g. teacher, artist, animal technician, voice actor, musician, self-employed, writer, etc). There's a great deal of risk with any of those fuzzy warm ""passion"" jobs, and it's especially concerning that I could one day burn out (like I did with nonprofit volunteer involvement and leadership) and have it all wasted. 

I'm also not *already* skilled or talented enough as an artist or musician who started at the age of 13 that I could feasibly stake out a career with it. It would take years if not over a decade of practice to become ""good"" enough, and there's plenty who are way more talented and younger than me who still don't ""make it"" with the creatives, so I certainly wouldn't be able to put any bread on the table without enough skill and luck. 

If I chase money in tech, I can surely live sustainably here and also pay for hobbies, have a real impact through charity and such for things I care about. But am I really willing to go 80-90,000 hours for the rest of my life going down a soul-draining path I may regret? If you've heard of ikigai, well that's a problem... there's not much that I love, not much that I'm good at, and no overlap with what the world needs, or what you can get paid well enough for. People say don't pick a career for the money or you will hate it, or go for your passion, but I've heard plenty rebuttals like making your hobby your work is a good way to kill a passion, and money can buy you relief from worry. 

So what is it? What do I do? What if I really don't have a passion or know what I can be damn great at? What if I have no real way of identifying the right intersection of natural interest, developed talent, tolerance of the cons in any career, leveraging my natural strengths, and financial prospects that can result in a good fit career?"

I was on a team of 3 people but someone quit and now it's a team of 2 with already too much work to get through in a week and no sign from MGMT that they're looking at hiring anyone else, and all the noise from higher-up suggests that work is going to increase exponentially this year.

Hello there.

I live in Toronto, Canada, but advice from anywhere will be appreciated. 

I need help and advice. I have been looking for jobs in Toronto since the beginning of 2021. I don’t have any past job experiences, so I only applied to minimum wage jobs at retail stores and fast-food restaurants, etc. I don’t know what I am doing wrong, but literally NO ONE is giving me a job. They won’t even call me for an interview. The only thing I get in my email is that the employer has received my application. After that I don’t hear from them. By the way, I just finished high school and I have not done a job yet. I wasn’t allowed to get a job while I was in high school because my parents wanted me to focus on my studies. I don’t know what I am doing wrong. I want to know how everyone gets their first jobs in Toronto. There is someone I know who is new to Canada (she came like 2 years ago and has no education at all) and she doesn’t even know English properly and she has a job. I asked her how and she told me to just apply. There are 16-year-olds I know who have jobs and I am 19. Please give me some advice because I’m desperately in need of a job right now. I want to help my parents who have very low income and I need to save up for college. I have done youth employment programs that help you build a resume and get you interviews. I got only 2 interviews out of the 100 places I’ve applied to. Those interviews were months ago, and I never heard back from them. I applied to a Loblaws once, and I actually got the job as soon as I applied, but I had to quit before even starting because I was still in high school and my parents didn’t want me to go. That’s the first and the last time I got a job. I need to get a job not only to help my parents, but to feel a little better about myself.

The company just announced for my department that we'll be going to a hybrid model instead of remote, 2 days in the office. That would be 75- 90 minute drive depending on traffic one way. Also, we work in a shift schedule since our SOC is 24/7, but we work 4/10 schedule. I have an opportunity to transfer to different role in different department, same level, but working with PKI's and it completely remote on a 9/80 schedule. Do you guys feel either position would progress my career? or should I pick based on work life balance? I'm having difficult time deciding if the commute is worth it."

* I'm in Ontario, Canada and cannot relocate.
* My background is in IT. I've done everything from Tech Support grunt to Network Administrator to IT Dept. Manager.
* I'm currently self employed, but barely. I started out 10 years ago and did well but the pandemic really destroyed my business; most of my clients have folded and the two that I still have call less frequently. I don't think that I have it in me to basically rebuild nearly from scratch.
* I've done other types of work and am willing to look at a wide variety of options.
* I'm looking for something I can do part time to help make ends meet.
* I \*need\* to negotiate my own schedule so that I can drive my 85-year-old father to and from his dialysis treatments every Tue-Thu-Sat.

I don't know \*IF\* such jobs exist. But if they do, I don't know where to look for them. Can anyone make some suggestions and/or point me in the right direction?"

The AP job has the pay range posted, within typical range for the market in my area.  The AR job did not have the pay listed but I figured it was be a bit lower due to it being ""entry level"".  My experience is above entry level.

I get an interview for the entry level AR job.  That's fine.  Interview was last Friday.  I learn by accident when responding to recruiters email, the interviewer hit ""reply all"" and I learn they have another candidate that applied for both positions.  Interview goes well, he keeps stating that everything I did in my previous job is exactly the same as the duties of this position.  The only catch is, slight pay cut (by like 68 cents) but I'm okay with it as the commute is shorter, insurance is cheaper.

He says I'll know by the end of this week, he had 2 more interviews.

I got the rejection email yesterday ""while your qualifications are impressive, we have chosen another candidate"".  Eh, shrug.  I do need the job but I have some other prospects, and while the pay cut was minimal and acceptable, I really wanted more money.  

So imagine my surprise today as I'm scrolling Indeed, the job is relisted.  And it's not just a renewal of the previous listing, because the pay rate is now included.

I'm so tempted to send the listing to the recruiter and say ""it seems your other candidate has not worked out"".  I'd never actually do that but still tempting."

Language Line Solutions doesn't seem to have the best reputation when it comes to how they treat their workers but, honestly, there are a lot of companies that do that already, so there's no point in fuzzing over it. What I'd like to dwell on is how most of these reviews just say that there's no leave for when you're sick, no vacation, you can't go to the bathroom while on the job, or it gets deducted from your salary, I've also read about people muting the call for a second and getting fired over it. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are two things that I currently want for advice, firstly, since I don't want to back off yet, training being on the 30th, what can I ask my employer about what benefits I have and don't have, I learned that I don't have days off by googling, and it didn't occur to me ask them something so simple during the first interview, so a small list of things that a human would enjoy from a job would be nice to learn. 

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, should I back off from the job before training starts and does it affect me in any way?  Like a smudge on a record?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, take into consideration I'm currently enrolled in an online University, which takes a decent chunk of my time as it is.

I’ve been looking for a remote position so I can take care of my grandmother with lung cancer while both my parents work full time.

Since October, I’ve applied to 30 positions, 5 of which have rejected me, 3 closed the position, 1 extended an interview and hasn’t followed up, and the other 21 haven’t given any response to my application. I’ve applied through LinkedIn, FlexJobs, the companies directly, and a ton of other job boards and can’t seem to land one.

I have 5 years of manufacturing experience as an operator and a technician at a company I’ve been lucky to work with throughout college and late-high school, but they had to let people go for the start of the New Year. I’ve put a lot of time into tailoring my resume and practicing interviews for a new position, but I know remote jobs are probably the most sought after right now.

With the deadline for securing a co-op coming up, I’m starting to worry I won’t find one. At this point I’d be happy doing data entry for minimum wage in a time zone 6 hours different than mine so I can get the school credit.

If anyone’s able to help, please reach out. I’d be more than happy to provide my resume for anyone interested.

There’s computer jobs like video editors and programmers and salesmen and stuff but that looks too stressful. Too much possibility of error, too much risk of messing it up. Requires difficult skills to master.

My original job idea was emt or firefighter or a cop or something like that then I realized there’s just too many factors that I can fuck up on.

So, any jobs that fit the bill? Something boring and repetitive that’s hard to fuck up and relatively stress free but is also, well, an actual job? Or at least something close to that?

All my job ideas just have too much possibility of me messing them up. I’ve done freelance video editing but even that was ludicrously stressful. I did game design as my senior project but there’s just so much you need to know and learn and understand and so many opportunities to mess up something small that destroys the whole project until you fix it.

I just can’t handle the stress. Just give me something soul crushingly existential nightmare inducingly dull and simple that a monkey could be trained to do it, they just need the monkey.

Living wage is relative to Rhode Island, just want a small shitty apartment, as long as there’s a bed. I’d like not spending 99% of my life working as well and to have some free time but that’s not always an option so."

anyways, it was reduced to lowest misdemeanor.  will the arrest and felony show up on background check?

its a government job.  the application when i applied said “convicted of felonies” i said “no” and convicted of misdemeanor in last 5 years and i said “no”.

i didnt lie.  can they not hire me for a dropped felony charge when i just turned 18?  im sure they can see the original charges… one time when i was 21, a lady i wanted to volunteer for rejected me because she said she saw the original charge was a felony.  :(

I however listed my part time job supervisor just as a supervisor and not a reference and said my new employer could contact them. I said this because well I only work part time for them and there are no plans to expand my responsbilities and I think we are both fine with that.

But I forgot to tell my part time job supervisor, should I send him a quick email and let him know?

And I would like to stress I did not list him as a reference, I only listed him as my supervisor."

I am an English literature and history major, and I have a lot of volunteer experience working in libraries. I've done just about everything in a library. Shelving/reshelving books, working the register at their bookstore, supervising children's and family's events, etc. I've also worked as a nanny and as a caregiver in the past, so I have a lot of experience with children and the elderly. The job itself is basically to help educate the public on the Holocaust, to work with survivors, and to lead tours around the museum. 

I am planning to focus on Jewish studies and Slavonic studies when I get my master's in the future. For my bachelor's, I've taken a large number of classes on WWII and Europe, and a lot of that overlaps with Jewish studies. Even though I'm not Jewish, I am extremely passionate about this topic because my family is from Germany. The reason I'm a tiny bit nervous now is because one of my close friends is also applying, and she's done way more than me. Like she's the president of our school's Hillel, which I do help her with occasionally but not really enough to put it in a cover letter. And she does a lot more than that.

How do I write a cover letter that showcases why they should give me an interview at all even though I feel like my experience is definitely inadequate in comparison? A template would be helpful, but any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated as well."

About two months ago I applied for and made it to the final round interview for a curriculum developer position for an Ed tech company, but unfortunately did not get the job. However, they have recently posted for the same position again, which I’ve already applied for.

My question is this: should I email any of the people who interviewed me to let them know that I’ve applied for the position or is that too presumptuous?

Edit: Just to note, that final interview went very well, confident in my answers and my ability to do the job, easy talking to and chatting with all the different people who interviewed me. The rejection email that I got following that interview was a fairly generic ""we selected a candidate who more closely aligned with our needs at this time."""

I asked my manager if I could bring a more comfortable one from home. He said yes, I could but it has to be the exact same kind. So it defeats the purpose. I asked why and he said that the employees need to be uniformed. Including the earpiece I asked, and he said of course. He asked what was wrong with the one I had and I said it was uncomfortable and he said I just needed to get use to it and he has never had someone complain about them before.

For the record I knew the company was particular about how all employees dress, males have to have black pants, white dress shirt, tie, matching aprons, but I had no idea that extended all the way to the earpiece."

I will be graduating next year with a degree in computer science. However, I am not very passionate about this field at all. It was one of the only majors I could get with family support, and I decided to go along this route in order to avoid student debt (I risked them not co-operating with my FAFSA otherwise). Ideally if I were involved in tech I would have a career designing user interfaces, and if I decide this I plan on doing some self work to build a portfolio in order to land a job.

To be honest I am incredibly burnt out. The thought of having to continue a high stress job after college is even more tiring. While yes the high salary would be nice, the toll it takes on my mental health is absolutely not worth it for me. If I could find a job that pays 50-60k I would be incredibly happy, as I grew up poor in a family that routinely made less than 20k a year for the entire household. Yes, I know that there is no “set” income that would bring someone happiness, but that is the ballpark I’m looking for. I’m unsure what job titles to look for, and I hope that having a degree can open up some doors to getting a higher paid office job or at least a low stress job with good benefits. 

What type of office jobs can I apply for with my bachelors that aren’t super stressful? Are there specific keywords I should be looking for? My gpa when I graduate is probably going to be around a 3.0 if that counts towards anything.

edit: I know that no job has “0 stress”, but I’m more or less looking for an average stress job, at least when compared to an engineer."

Under state law, an employer may not require any employee to work seven consecutive days in a retail establishment and may not deny an employee at least 24 consecutive hours off for rest or worship in each seven-day period. The time off must be in addition to any regular periods of rest allowed during each work day. (From Google)

The area manager responded with: 

Our work weeks are Friday-Thursday.
Beginning Friday and ending on Thursdays so you do have your required 2 days off a week.

I was a non traditional student (I'm 33) so I have a lot of ""work history"" but very little of it is anything but miscellaneous call center jobs. I've held what I consider to be three ""main jobs"" where I feel the experience is relevant to careers I would like to pursue: Account Manager for a captive insurance agency (2 years), Assistant Store Manager/Operations Manager (Luxury Retail) (2 years), and Operations Manager (retail) (2 years). The retail experience was back to back from 2010-2015, and when I left in 2015 it was to be able to stay home with my son, though I continued to work in WFH call center jobs. 

I became licensed in P&amp;C in 2018 and got a job as an account manager at an insurance agency, but left in 2020 due to their unwillingness to allow WFH during the pandemic (not that I mention that in interviews). Since 2020 I have been doing WFH call center work for a health care provider that has an emphasis in social work, though this is not a career path I'd like to pursue. 

I just graduated (magna cum laude if it matters) with a BA in Communication and planned to use my degree combined with account manager experience and transition into insurance underwriting. However I am also interested in careers in project management/coordination, or communications. Currently I have one resume tailored to underwriting roles (not that it seems to be effective) and plan to have two others that are tailored to management and communication. I'm concerned about the gaps in what I consider relevant work history. I've always worked, but don't think it's advisable to list a four month stint at Amazon, or a few months as tech support for a telecom, as these were just filler jobs that I bounced around to just to keep a paycheck. I managed to graduate with honors while working full time and homeschooling my son, so I would think that should count for something, I'm just at a loss for how to coalesce this experience into a cohesive resume or how to speak to it effectively. How would you approach such scattered work history? I'm pretty confident in my ability to explain this in interviews, but how to even get this across in a resume so I can get to the interview process is throwing me off."

Wasn’t the right fit and if I’m being honest I don’t think the team was in the right place/time to have been hiring for a junior position. Oh well, these things happen. 

I graduated 9 months ago at the top of my class in sociology, took a lot of research and media classes, had some marketing and social media internships. Picked by a professor to speak at a big conference and present my student research as a rep of the college (different college then where I graduated) 

I’ve worked and done well in sales and hospitality, which have helped nurture a big-picture “finished is better than perfect” and a “I don’t want to mess with these files in case I ruin something that can’t be quickly fixed” attitude that didn’t mesh well with my previous team and that my manager struggled to teach/coach with. I wouldn’t say I’m a slow learner but this is the second time I’ve really struggled in a position under a teacher who struggled to guide or make recommendations outside of their learning style/experience (this is the way it was explained to me so if it doesn’t make sense to you you’re on your own) but I don’t think that should be a universal dealbreaker. Like it’s something I should work on but I don’t think it makes me unemployable or unteachable

I did very well in my data organization and analysis classes in college so I don’t think I’m like horrible with details? I think I just never really properly learned the priority order for them at my current job and that made a self-feeding cycle of managers being frustrated I didn’t ask for more clarification before doing something, and then feeling like I was asking the wrong or redundant questions when I did ask and that made it harder for me to feel comfortable judging what I did or didn’t need more clarification on. Trained from the bottom up when I need to be trained from the top down, or Vice verse? 

I’ve never done this badly in a job before so I feel awkward applying for positions that are so similar without the confidence that I have the skills to be successful in this sort of work, or what sort of work my skills would let me be successful in.

Edit: I am prepared to take a pay cut because of my juniorness but I’m also unsure how much I should expect ESPECIALLY when marketing and sales are both industries(?) that are pretty rife with scam and half-scam jobs. I can afford to go down to about 50k if I rebalance spending and savings pretty easily (I also started this job right as I was moving out of my dorm so it covered a lot of up-front costs that wouldn’t be part of the budget moving forward)"

I have recently been offered a job at a new company as a Customer Success Manager.

At my current job, I started as a Customer Success Manager in March of 2022, however due to company restructuring in August/September 2022 my department was dissolved and my role was changed to a lesser position (Account Manager II). This is what my paystub currently shows. I was told the role would be reinstated in a different capacity for me, however that didn't happen, as my company is currently going through a financial crisis so I was stuck in this lesser role hoping things would change. I also stayed on due to personal plans, my sister was getting married in October, holidays came up fast and I didn't really have the time to job search so I stayed on with that title. Now that the holidays are over I've started my job search to regain my seniority title wise.

I have been interviewing as Customer Success Manager as my current position. Previous to this job, my title was Director of Operations at the time that I left and all of my previous experience is 100% verifiable and truthful. The experience that I have from that role and current role very much tie into how I interviewed and are relevant to my new offered role. I interviewed for this new offer as being a current Customer Success Manager. And that is what my resume states.

I didn't want to put a lesser title in my job search as I have the relevant experience in my previous position and did act as a CSM for some months at my current company, as well as I wanted to gain back my seniority in my new role.

Is this going to be a flag for this offer I've received when it comes to employment verification?

I would likely tick do not call my current employer, but my pay stubs say this my lesser position. W-2 have no come out yet. So I'm a bit worried about this.

What are your thoughts on my situation? Anything I can or should do?"

3,2023-01-07,Manager being overstepped by employee,u/pressurizethecabin,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10670oj/manager_being_overstepped_by_employee/,jobs,"I am a 34 year old female managing a local auto parts store. The role kind of fell into my lap after the manager prior had to be removed due to several ongoing issues. I admit I have a limited knowledge of auto parts, and have only been with the company about a year. 

When the manager was removed and I was given the title, they sent a guy, we'll call him Steve, to come fill the empty spot that us losing the OG manager created. He was designated to be work the counter and to focus on customers, whereas I, as manager, was to focus on inventory in the warehouse, handle any customer complaints, and the administrative and day to day operating duties of the store. 

I don't and have never felt the need to ""lord"" over anyone or micromanage them at work because everyone on the team is more than capable of handling their job duties. 

Steve likes to micromanage everyone at work, but especially, especially me. 

Steve has been with the company for four years, has more experience, and if I'm totally honest, I understand why he's upset that I was given the manager title before he was. I don't know why that decision was made, but it's also not my fault he wasn't chosen for it. 

The problem is Steve is constantly stepping on my toes in front of everyone, correcting me constantly, and telling me to ""slow down"" and ""take my time"" on inventory projects. He even does it in front of customers, which makes me look like I have no idea what I'm doing. He tells other employees he needs them to come in to cover for people who are out when we don't need the help. He also overtakes projects designated for me to handle without asking. 

I completely own that this is at least partially my fault, I should have addressed this with Steve from the first time he tried to overstep me. Alone, they are small issues that would likely seem silly for someone to confront someone on. Combined, they paint a bigger picture. 

At this point, I dread going to work. Steve's head is growing bigger by the day, and I don't know how to correct the issue professionally before it gets even more out of hand."
1,2023-01-07,Should I be honest about being fired twice (if pressed on job hopping),u/schneybley,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1068qyn/should_i_be_honest_about_being_fired_twice_if/,jobs,"So here is the deal. My resume has several years in the military, a university internship, two jobs in one year at two different public accounting firms and most recently several months in a governmental agency as an auditor. 

My first job in tax ended after the busy season when I thought it was going really well, I liked the work and the people but apparently some people were dissatisfied with how I did things and complained behind my back to my director and manager. I got feedback that I improved but months later manager calls me into a meeting with HR and says I didn't improve and my employment is being terminated. When the meeting ends I asked what could i do to keep improving and moving forward in my career and he says I need to work on my professional demeanor (looking back there were some times where I said somethings a little off, nothing too crazy or inappropriate but enough to have a conversation about better wordings).

Second job was in risk assurance. I thought I landed my dream job since I had a great experience doing internal audit in an internship at my university but I feel like doing Sarbanes-Oxley compliance ended up being very different than doing IA in a governmental setting so I quit after 5 months. Unlike the last job the whole thing was not going well and the writing was on the wall.

Most recently I did a federal auditor job. A number of bad circumstances affected my performance, namely my health was really bad due to bad Crohn's flare ups and my doctor was taking too long to do something about it, since then I've been prescribed a new medication and have seen an improvement in my symptoms and health. Other stuff I may or may not mention was that my masters degree distracted me and through that masters I've decided I wanted to do corporate finance hence that is what is making me go for FP&amp;A roles which I'm excited about.

How to do you guys recommend handling this? From what I've researched so far some are saying I should consider just being honest if asked. That people are more okay with terminations and that I didn't do much wrong anyway. I still hate the feeling that my resume as it stands screams job hopper and that being honest would mean admitting to two terminations even if they were a result of bad luck."

The role was sold as a normal writing role where I write blog posts, but slowly I've had more and more responsibilities piled on with no pay increase.

**My current responsibilities consist of:**

* Writing 5+ articles a month (some are highly technical and require a lot of research - When I started it was a minimum of 3)
* Editing approximately 10 articles a month from other writers (some are from freelancers and require heavy edits)
* Creating a quarterly content calendar (this takes a lot of time/brainstorming/meetings)
* Pulling data for the entire blog and writing a detailed breakdown/analysis and sending it out every month (this was listed as ""non-essential"" but my old boss left, and my new boss is now insisting I do it)
* Analyzing Heatmaps and including those in the analysis (same as above)
* Keyword research/optimization for every post
* Posting all content to Wordpress (and performing random updates to the site)
* I also spend probably 15 hours a week in meetings

(This isn't even everything; Other random stuff pops up all the time.)

I make 85K and I'm not in any sort of managerial role. I feel like I'm doing the work of a content manager, a SEO specialist, a data analyst, and a technical writer.

Yes, I'm looking for a new job. But this is getting so insane that I don't know how much longer I can take it. My boss just keeps piling more and more on.

How would you handle this? I was hired as a writer and never received a new job description after the management switch. Should I just tell them I'm not doing the analytics stuff? There's literally not enough time in the day and it's listed as non-essential.

I never received a raise and they actually treated me poorly and included some of this in a retaliatory PIP after I said I wanted another job in the company.

Is this experience even remotely within the realm of normal or should I quit for my sanity?"

Since the school's leadership is full of industry experts and leaders, I was hoping to be around more people with baseline technical skills. Because I'm the database manager, I don't expect everyone to have the same level of technical knowledge as me, but the longer I'm there, the more I realize that the people I work with don't even know how to use fairly simple functions in Microsoft products. 

The assistant controller (who has an associate's in accounting and a bachelor's in business administration) doesn't know how to use pivot tables, one of our new hires (who is in her mid-20s and just got her MBA) doesn't know how to do anything in Word other than making words bold or italicized (she's in charge of doing mail merges for letters of recognition, creating documentation for donor agreements, etc.). No one knows how to use Teams other than the chat. 

I guess I just don't understand how this happens. I only have my BA in English, but I took business classes in high school and college to give me some practically marketable skills. So how did my coworkers get through their business classes?

My boss seems to be pushing me to create how-to's for navigating Microsoft, and it's just bananas to me to even think about doing that. I've already been tasked with creating and documenting so many processes from scratch, not to mention doing regular data management and reporting, that I have no idea how I'm supposed to make up for over a dozen people who definitely should have already learned how to use these tools. 

I guess I'm just curious if any other folks have run into this kind of issue before and if anyone can provide advice on how to manage the expectations.

To preface this, yes I know I let my mental illness and physical injuries win. That's besides the point, feel free to call me whatever name you want/tell me how worthless I am, there's a 90% chance I've called myself it the last year or so.  


Long story short. I haven't worked since pre covid ( I tore up my rotator and ankle and it took a good two years to heal up due to medical/financial limitations ) I'm 36 so I guess that was the death nail in my coffin for injuring those body parts (I've torn that shoulder and the ACL on the same leg before, albeit it was 10+ years ago in a sports incident.)

After it started healing, I was doing a side job of helping family, friends etc with computer issues ( building PC's, fixing pcs,  lessons in Microsoft Office/Teamviewer etc) I've done that the last 10+ years and will definitely put it on resume as ""freelancing/self employment"" 

My background is/was marketing/advertising. I would love to get back into the field, but I know that a 3 year gap looks bad on a resume, even if it was medical related. I'm 1000% open to other fields, provided I don't need to go to college/uni for it. It's just not in the cards right now due to finances.  


I don't drive since I live in Toronto and my shoulder/ankle are perma chronic injured at this point, which means I can't lift anything too heavy.  


Based on this, what are some jobs I can apply for which   


1- Will be willing to give me a chance even with a multi year gap  
2- Wont overstress my shoulder/ankle more than they already are  
3- Doesn't require a vehicle   


Thanks for any and all help. I'm barely getting by with food and working even a job for $20/hr would be life changing for me right now. I can work my way up, I just need to get a foot back in the door."

For some context. I am currently a Teller. He was a Banker a few months back, before he moved up to Insurance I believe. While he was a Banker we worked closely. As often times Tellers and Bankers work alongside each other. I was friendly, as I am with everyone else. But, I don't get close to anyone. Don't really get involved in gossip or any of the deep conversations that my co workers have. So, it is not like we got close as colleagues.    


Recently he sent me an email telling me that he would like to mentor me. As he believes that I have potential that I have not yet utilized. And he would like to help me see and learn to utilize that potential. He even shared that he has had mentors and that has helped out in his personal and professional life. He said that he would like to go out for lunch and speak if I was interested.   


I accepted. As personally, I thought it was a good opportunity to learn from him. As I consider him a successful person and a good individual.  


However, I would like some insight on what to expect from a mentorship, how to go about it. Keep it professional or try to get familiar with him? and just what exactly does someone look for, for a mentee? I always thought that mentorship was between family members.

I've been there for 5 months and its my second job. But today, it was the quietest it has ever been while ive worked there. I was there for 1hr+, and we had 2 orders. Normally, my job is to pack orders and serve dine in, but obviously, there wasnt much of this to do. When not working, I may make pizza boxes, fill the fridge, wipe tables, empty dishwasher etc., but when I got there literally all of this had been done already. I spoke to the person my shift overlapped with, and she said that the whole day, there had been 20 orders, and she had been on her phone all day.

So, for an hour, save for packing two orders and me prepacking some salads for storage (10 mins), we both just stood there on our phone. Then, her shift finished, and I kept using my phone, serving two customers in an hour.

During this time, the shift manager and senior colleague were sitting out the back of the restaurant, on their phones vaping (as they often do when theres a lull, i dont care). Basically, no one was working, because there was nothing to do, not even the usual jobs you do when theres nothing to do.

But then, I get a notification from my manager (who is never at the store but i think owns or runs the franchise), and it was a photo. I open it, and it was a screenshot of ME from the surveilance camera. There was no other text attached, only the photo. My heart literally dropped. I replied, 'sorry, it has been very quiet I will put it away now'. Then, i grabbed a cloth and cleaned something which had been cleaned an hour earlier.

But 2 minutes later, the shift manager came back inside from sitting on the back step, using his phone (i think they do this to avoid the camera), to tell me the boss wanted me to go home, and that I should clock out (I had been there for like 2 hrs when my shift was rostered for 5). When I left the store, I looked at my phone and saw 4 MESSAGES from my boss along the lines of 'you clearly dont want to work, how can you sit there chilling as if there is nothing to do?, go home, and come back to your next shift when you are more motivated'.

I legit felt like i used to feel in primary school when a teacher would tell me off, i felt like i had a pit in my stomach. I figured it would be best not to aggravate, so i said 'ok, i apologise, i wont make this mistake again'. Then, 10 mins later, I get a notification that my roster has been updated, and I see that my shifts from next week have been removed, and I am not rostered to work.

Now, i acknowledge that technically I should not be using my phone, I will accept that I was in the wrong here. But, my problem is with the context, the reaction, and what happened after. For starters, NOONE WAS WORKING. The managers were literally out the back of the store on their phone, and my coworker also used her phone alongside me before her shift finished. Secondly, the fact that she chose to send me a photo of myself, with no accompanying text feels very creepy and passive agressive. Finally, being sent home early, when this is my first ever warning of the sort, and I have had no previous problems like this in 5 months of work, is in my opinion an overreaction. This is genuinely the least busy the restaurant has ever been, so her assertion that i was 'acting like there was nothing to do' ignores the fact that there was nothing to do (and please spare me the notion 'there is always something to clean', the restaurant is tiny, and there was nothing in need of cleaning)

Sorry for rambling but I feel shocked and awful right now. I legit walked around the block for like 30 mins after I left because this feels so surreal. I feel very singled out too, and like this is very unfair. And the fact that she cancelled my shift the following week too is unbelievably harsh. I literally covered a shift on new years day with less than 24 hours notice, only a few days earlier.

What do i do now? Am i completely in the wrong here?"

I know that I shouldn't mind this since it's work, but it happened so often that it eventually affected me mentally, plus there's a constant feeling that I'm being watched, that they're just waiting for my one mistake to happen.

I also don't know if I'm thinking too much about it because I'm really doubtful of the 'peace' we have currently. I feel like it's the calm before the storm.

so for context, the place i work at is also a store and on days we are open, the owners have always gotten the shop clean and ready for customers.  however, last month one of the owners was just like “ok i’m going to have you guys do shop cleanup, one person can do x chore, one person can do y chore, and one person can do z chore”. 

it’s the “little” things like this that piss me off.  how can i bring this up w/o coming across as petty? bc i’m pretty sure my other coworkers will still have to do the cleanup by themselves unless they express an issue with it as well. how do i say no to this and to other small tasks that aren’t in my job description? is this something i could bring up over text? we’re a small company and don’t use email or anything, im dreading having to set this boundary in person. any advice would be appreciated!"

I can’t buy food on that in LA, and I can’t work two jobs (health reasons) right now. I gave notice, telling them I ran calculations and am sorry but didn’t realize the job was this few hours. The manager said she could try to add hours, there was work to do, but “she couldn’t guarantee it.” Given that this is my survival and ability to buy food, I said I need to give notice. I did and now, in the notice period (to the end of the pay period), negotiated that date (since 2 weeks would have started a pay period), they told me to report to a locked building in the dark (6 am) without a point of contact, ostensibly to meet a coworker who refused to give out her cell number to me. I texted the managers and no one is awake at 5:45 am when I got here, telling them I can’t find the lady I was supposed to meet and the building is locked. There are trucks being loaded but you need a safety vest to enter the yard and no one told me to have this. I feel like telling them I will just stop working as of today. California allows that. They also have scheduled me to drive two days, for just two hours of work, 60 miles of driving from where I live. And lastly, (before I gave notice), they told me that my background check to work at the place they said I would be working (when I met them at the job fair) (which would have been close to my home) hadn’t come back yet and I can start working since sometimes it takes 5 months to come back. They didn’t say that before. Now, they’ve got me driving all over the metropolitan area on my own time, but for miles over where I would have commuted to, they pay mileage. This isn’t worth it to me at all. Today’s situation, having me report to a warehouse in the dark without a point of contact and the building is locked except a truck yard is unacceptable. How bad is it if I text them and say I am not coming back anymore to work? The manager got very angry at me when I explained I can’t afford to keep doing this job. They are short 15-20 people at this job and that’s why they are sending me, a person without a health or disability background, all over town. The job only pays $18 per hour. Is it okay text and say I can’t do this for another 6 days? I don’t know what I am doing (no education or background in this field), and it pertains to disability services and vocational/ health matters."

1,2023-01-08,First world problem! Dilemma between 2 offers after losing my job,u/MindNHand,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/106lh46/first_world_problem_dilemma_between_2_offers/,jobs,"I lost my job, like everybody. I was the managing director for a small company (8 figures in annual revenue) and HQ decided to downsize. Now, after frantically applying to any job I can, I miraculously have 2 offers on the table, and it becomes a first world problem where I'm having a tough time to decide. 

**Offer 1:** Managing director at an even tinier company at $200k comp with incentives correlated to revenue (around 5%)

This will be a pay cut, as I initially received $280k in the last company, but what's there to complain about? I lost my job. The high incentive scheme is very tempting, but there is no business yet in my country, and the risk is high being a market launcher. In the near term, I think I can bring about $500k in annual revenue in the first year. Also, there will be equity valued at about $200k, much like the last company. But I never think much about equity in these types of companies. 

It's very high risk, but the company has already 1-2 high profile clients in the country, which is why they are confident in landing boots on the ground and hiring someone like me. Also, I expect high work life balance and flexibility, as I am the boss of everything and will dictate my location and schedule by myself. Great for career as it's in a field where a lot of UN and political funding is at, so I may be very sought after in 3 years if this works out. **IF**. 

**Offer 2**: Senior manager at established company at $300k

Nobody reports to me, I am just in charge of 2 portfolios. It almost feels like a glorified admin. Medium work life balance, I can't dictate the schedule, and it's absolutely mandatory to be in the office 5 days a week, but they respect my holidays and try to keep within office hours. 

The industry here is not super serious like the first one with UN funding and all, but it's super fun! I will be sent to conferences around the world. So it gives me the impression that I will be a highly paid admin in a fun industry but my career would stagnate. 

**Initial thoughts**

I'm trending towards Offer 2, but there might be a tinge of regret in not taking Offer 1. Both industries are recession proof and grew throughout covid-19 and the current economy. Both roles will offer more work life balance than what I initially had, which had a crazy schedule, crazy stress, and no boundaries - I had meetings with the founder CEO sometimes starting at 1030pm. However, at this moment, I am tired of picking roles with a lot of ""ifs"" in the name of career advancement (looking at you, Offer 1). I'd likely be stuck in the same salary bracket and same company for years to come with Offer 2, but I feel like settling down for a few years of stability given the current climate. Debate me, or support me, oracles of reddit. 

tl;dr: I lost my job and now have 2 offers, one is an obvious choice, but I'm tempted by the other."

Just a heads up to let everybody know. If your job is a high turnover job they won't care if you resign. My job is not high turnover but the supervisors describe the job as hard because of our client requirements so even tho they claim they are not high turnover they likely just go understaffed to avoid evidence of high turnover by job postings and hiring.

The 2nd interview seemed to go well. The hiring manager came out directly in the beginning with, ""I'm not going to ask you much about your technical experience, because I've read your resume, and I think you would be a good fit for the team."" The interview was relatively conversational, and the hiring manager mainly discussed the role, his team, and the office. A couple interesting things:

1. The role the hiring manager described was more specific and detailed than the description of the job I applied to. I didn't think much of the differences, because it was generally consistent with the job I applied to, but then I noticed that the specific job described in the interview was posted on January 3rd, a week and a half after my last interview.
2. The hiring manager said he wanted to confirm with my boss that he is okay with me pursuing the internal opportunity. My boss was aware I applied and was interviewing, and he was supportive so this was not an issue. I asked my boss on Friday (January 6th) if he heard from the hiring manager, to which my boss said he did. I don’t know what the hiring manager said exactly, but my boss told me he wrote back that they have his blessing to take me.

Is the new job posting an indication they are seeking other candidates? Is it a good sign that the hiring manager contacted my supervisor post-interview, or does that not mean much?"

\- Resigning is your choice.  Formalize in writing (email, text, etc.) with a specific end date.

\- It's only negotiable if YOU choose to negotiate (e.g. benefits, pay, etc.).  Otherwise, it's non-negotiable.

\- You have no obligation to provide a reason.  You simply say you're resigning with an end date.  2 weeks is an acceptable notice in the US unless you have a contract you agreed to that specifies otherwise (some countries require a longer notice)

\- It is the employer's choice to keep you after you give notice.  They have a right to accept you resignation on the spot and let you leave immediately.

Hope this is helpful."

The thing is, how the hell do I do it? It's a very small company and there is nobody else in the ""chain of command"" that I can hand my notice letter to. I feel really shady doing it while he is on leave but it's the unfortunate timing. I don't really want to disturb/ruin his holiday by calling him and telling him I am leaving. 

Do I write an email and say something along the lines of ""I would have much preferred to say this in person but due to unforseen timing I have to formally do it by email while you are out of office. Of course I would be more than happy to discuss this further with you when you return"" etc. etc.

Any advice please?"

Fast-forward to now I moved out about 2 years ago and started taking a more entrepreneurial route but, due to the current economic uncertainty and the fact I have to start paying for my own benefits soon I'm looking for something more stable the problem is I have a 6-year gap in my resume with only an associates degree in graphic design to show for it. As far as the graphic design, I'm currently taking a slight pivot trying to get into front end web development, but I'm not ready to market those exact skills quite yet. I want to look into local temp agencies in my area as well as get into remote work because I have the perfect WFH setup in my home office. But being that I've been out of the game so long, is there anything else I should know when explaining that gap to employers, and is it even worth it to include irrelevant experience?

Tldr; How should I go about explaining a 6-year employment gap and get hired with only warehouse/ irrelevant experience."

Would VPN be a good idea or does that add a level of dishonesty to my application?

Even though I only work 2 days a week my contracted days really suck. I work Sundays and Mondays with 11 hours in between shifts and my Monday one starts and 5am. It makes me miserable. But i always think about my free time for the rest of the week. 

Now this new job is a creative job which is what I want, it’s drawing designs on fabric which will then embroidered (not something I imagined my self doing but it’s a creative job and I guess that means I will enjoy it? I don’t kno). The job is in the city and is a 55 min drive ( or an hour and half train) in rush hour and It’s 5 days a week. 

I applied hesitantly and then hard cried for an hour afterwards (unsure why) and now I’m having anxiety and regret about it. I hate my current job so I should be relieved that I found something. But I’m feeling regret and anxiety about the travel time and the 5 day week. I really like my free time but at some point I will have to move out and support my self. But I can’t stop these feelings.

I took it initially because it had a high salary but I’m sort of regretting it now because it’s a small company with no employee reviews that I can find on the internet and tbh am not sure what the training and supervision is going to be like, just very unsure overall and want to go to a larger and more reputable company. I got a reply today from a much more reputable company that is also super close to where I live and I would much rather work there. I also volunteered there 4 yrs ago. If they ask to arrange an interview what should I say to my current employer? I’m meant to start working full time so I wouldn’t have any free days unless it was after 5pm… really stressed about this. Should I just quit now?

Would really appreciate any insight or advice"

I’ve always loved politics since being in 5th grade and I’ve interned in the senate and have worked on many campaigns which I loved both of them. When I was offered a job at a place I had previously interned at I thought it was a no brainer and I would love it. 

I knew going into this job that my boss would be stern by wanting to work in office all week and is the only office that requires to be in office and I knew he would have temper tantrums occasionally but I took the risk. 

The first three months went great and I built great rapport with him and I thought everything was great until he was in the office one day and randomly snapped on me for not CC him on an email. After that I had about three months of constantly under fire, everything I did was critiqued or not done correctly which I assumed was part of a stress test. One day during that time period he texted me and asked if I was spreading rumors about his personal life which I was clueless and he was clearly mad, I had my first real panic attack ever that night (that text was sent around 8pm). 

Once he began coming into the office everyday for three months it went smoothly and we were busy. I had a trip planned for Disney but I had to cancel it two days before because we were so busy.  

After he stopped coming in everyday I rarely talked to him and things were fine but being the only person in a huge building in my position started to burn me out and made me feel useless and exhausted everyday. 

In November my coworker wanted the whole week of thanksgiving off and I wanted the Wednesday off before thanksgiving, my coworker had not asked for the week off on that Friday before and I had not asked off for the Wednesday due to respect for him asking for his week off first. I messaged him asking for my coworkers week off (his permission and idea) and my day off and my boss blew up on me and threatened to fire us if we didn’t show up to work. 

In the middle of December I didn’t get a response on an email until 4:30th and I did not forward it to an individual and he called me at 8pm at night yelling at me and then texted me telling me to find a new job at the end of the year. 

That night I applied to two jobs and got interviews with both places, the next day he emailed, called, and texted an apology and told me I still had a job. 

I accepted one of those jobs I applied to and I haven’t told him yet as the start date is over a month away. 

The new job pays $11k more but I am still scared to leave because it’s my dream job. I must be insane…"

The thing is, I like my boss and I like this company, I just don't like this job as I find it boring. However I've only been here a year and they put a good portion of that into training me and were looking for long term employees when they hired me, so I feel bad about quitting on them. I wrote the letter nicely and had nothing but positive things to say about them, but I need ideas on how to actually say it when I hand it to him, because I don't just want to walk in his office, hand him a paper, and leave or just stand there silently when he reads it. But I also feel weird just saying ""Hey, here's my 2 weeks notice"" and handing him the paper. It feels like there should be a better way to do it that is still respectful of his time. 
Again, sorry that it's so short notice but I didn't realize I would have a hard time thinking of what to say. I'm sure I'll figure something out but if anyone has input on this post before I actually do it, that would be nice. Thanks!"

1,2023-01-08,Advice for service bartender interview?,u/royaalbluee,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10737m2/advice_for_service_bartender_interview/,jobs,"Hey everyone, as u can see from the title I scored an interview for a service bartender position at a great restaurant and I have some questions which I was hoping you might be able to answer. 

Firstly, I just want to say I’m actually surprised that this employer invited me for an interview considering the fact that I have no prior experience with bartending even though it said in the requirement that prior experience wasn’t required lol. I do have experience working in fast paced environments at restaurants though which might be the reason that they reached out to me. 

Anyway, I’ve been looking all over Reddit for things that people have been saying about what management prefers in bartenders and all I keep seeing is “a good looking woman and big tits”. This makes sense and I do consider myself to have a good looking face. However, I look extremely young and I’m very thin (95 pounds). And additionally I have a flat chest (a cup) and a not so big butt. Everywhere I go, people assume I’m like 16 even though I’m really 23. I’ve still had men way beyond my age hit on me but I fear that me looking young and not having a hot body will disqualify me from even getting the position. 

Has any woman here been hired for bartending despite looking a lot younger than they are and not having the nice tits that many people think management is looking for? If so, what was your experience? Additionally, if you could clarify what exactly a service bartender is I would really appreciate that. I already looked it up but I’m confused lol because online it says they don’t interact with customers and stay mainly in the kitchen area. However, I think the location I am applying for only has a service bartender position so I’m assuming I would be working in the bar. Any thoughts?"

I got chewed out and had trash thrown at me because a resident can hear the children living below her. She cursed me and our entire property many times, wagged her finger so close to my face she almost hit me and threw her trash at me.

It’s my Monday and I’m just trying to keep myself from going into a depression living around and working with people like her. I am already an introvert and recluse, but incidents like this start to make me feel nervous to be around anyone, anywhere.

It’s an entry level IT job, and the job description listed the salary range as 60-70K, depending on experience. Although one of my interviewers commented saying I was over qualified for the position, I got offered 60K. 

The job is 1-1.5 hour commute from where I live one way. I initially applied to the position under the impression it would be fully remote (I have a connection in the company who told me this). But it turns out the training period of 30-60 days would be 4 days a week in person, and post-training would be 2 days a week in person.

I asked the recruiter if there was any flexibility around the remote/in-person work balance and they responded saying it’s up to my supervisor to determine after the 30-60 days of in person work. For reference, the person who would be my supervisor works from home 3 days a week and in person 2 days a week. 

Ideally I’d like to negotiate working from home 4 days a week and 1 day a week go into the office. How do I go about that? I’d also want to negotiate the salary a bit higher since I do feel I am overqualified, but I don’t know if it’s too much to be asking for 2 things at the same time?

(also, there was nothing in the offer letter about the number of days expected of me to come in person / work from home, idk if that’s normal?)

So unless you’re coming across as offensive, you are fine.  As you can see, I don’t make people jump through hoops, and I don’t “test” people.

If you can demonstrate that you have the qualifications and that you are not insufferable, then a lot of things, unless they are way out of line, are irrelevant.  For example, it’s not a big deal that you have to reschedule because of an emergency, or that your resume has a spellling errror.  On the other hand, if you aren’t qualified, a well-written thank you letter won’t make a difference.

I acknowledge that each job and each team is different, and not every interviewer is as straight forward as I am.  But I also believe that most of us just want to get the job done and go home.  Just show that you can help us accomplish that and stop worrying about the small stuffs.

Good luck!"

2,2023-01-09,Girlfriend got laid off from (dream)job and feels heartbroken. How to move on?,u/RoughReset,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/107680l/girlfriend_got_laid_off_from_dreamjob_and_feels/,jobs,"My girlfriend (22) got told that she would get laid off, together with about 10 other colleagues, last Friday.

She was working in a SaaS scale-up that had about 60-70 people working for them.

The company is facing uncertain financial/economical times.

She applied there in the summer of 2021, started her internship in March 2022, did very well, starting working there in June 2022 and got a fixed contract in October.

She’s really ambitious and legitimately hard working, but of course… it’s her first job.

She’s a pretty sensitive and introvert person that doesn’t always feel accepted or heard somewhere, but has loved working there since day one.

She actually also grew really fast from having a simple marketing assistant role to a role where she would take the lead regarding some employer branding and recruitment projects. She also single-handedly launched a podcast together with the CEO and co-founder, where she was the project manager that had to overlook deadlines of f.e. copywriters, designers, video editors, etc.

I’m an experienced marketing professional myself and I’ve supported, mentored and coached her through the last months.

When she got laid off, people at the company got told that she was the only one of the 11 people that got laid off, where it didn’t had anything to do with performance. She got told the same thing.

Long story short, the news was very unexpected and extremely heartbreaking, since she felt accepted since day one, absolutely loved doing what she did and all the chances and respony that came together with it.

She feels really scary about the future. Scared to not being able to find another ‘perfect’ company where she gets such a role and responsibilities, scared about not getting accepted as an introvert as much and scared about having to work in a company that she doesn’t really fundamentally loves.

Since I was next to her since day one, I basically feel the same anxiety, while I’m a really stable and mentally strong person in general.

She needs to hand in her laptop and iPhone today, and after that it’s done.

What can I do for her? How can I avoid her falling into a black hole without purpose?

We don’t live together, and her home situation isn’t super great… 

She loved having a somewhat busy schedule, being around great people daily and now she will be at home, without having a lot of people to talk to, without really having something to do,… 

It’s like she’s going through a severe and very unexpected break-up…

TLDR

Girlfriend got laid off for financial reasons at her first (dream)job and doesn’t know how to cope with it and move on."

My first week I didn’t really get an explanation of how to do anything, she explained me how to do something once (just showing me) and not checking if I was doing it the right way or basically did not seem interested at all, I tried to understand her since maybe she didn’t do well with other people, but it came to the point where she would just make me fetch her something from the printer, and respond to patients that were interested on coming in on Facebook, and that’s it, on my second week on Monday she put in her two weeks and she never told me directly, she told a patient in front of me and when I asked her about it she giggled (not in a nice way) and said to not worry, that I’ll be fine, I got so stressed because not only was she mean, she wasn’t teaching me anything,  I felt so frustrated and spoke with the doctor about it, he told me not to worry about it and that I would learn eventually, that I was good with people and that was all that mattered which helped but with the days going by it got worse, she still wouldn’t teach me anything and get frustrated when I asked her questions.
I ended up finding my own “how to” on the computers which a lot of it was outdated so I had to figure it on my own, the doctor didn’t really do anything about it except just tell her to teach me something not show me, which she would just respond with “I am” that’s how it was for her last two weeks, her last week a new intern started and she’s very polite, she’ll only be in the office for just three months since it’s just for her university degree, which made me more hopeful.
there were also details that the girl that I worked with gave me like that she was the longest to work there (7 months) according to the doctor because the other people that had worked there did not like it and couldn’t handle it, and that the doctor could yell sometimes and get very frustrated, at first I didn’t want to believe her since I thought she just said those things to scare me, but he is very strict, and I do feel like he’s gotten frustrated with me before, not only that, since she quit now I have to go to this trip to a seminar two hours away on an airplane with this doctor, I feel like I’m left with so much responsibility and only on my last week the doctor really explained stuff to me and seemed to be also interested in training me, I don’t blame him because he has patients and can’t do both at once,  but i feel so lost, I talked to him again last week telling him that I felt like I did not know anything about this job and that I had no idea what to do, that i needed someone to show me, he kept on saying that it’s the girls last week and that she’ll be gone, he didn’t tell her anything after him and I spoke.
I was very exited and happy for this job but I’ve cried so much already out of frustration and how alone I feel, I’ve questioned if I’m even fit to be a receptionist anywhere, I’ve really tried to learn but even going into work I feel so depressed and all I think about is getting out, my eyes water everytime i go in, and with this seminar trip coming up I’ll be gone for three days, away from family and friends and with my mental state right now I know it’s going to be difficult. He never really asked me if I wanted to go, he kind of told me that since the other girl is quitting that i have to go, which I understand because it’s my job, but I just started this job, I don’t know him that well, and with everything that’s been happening in the office at work I just feel stressed.
I wanted to stay at this job for at least a year, I really take pride in hitting at least a year mark at a job and that if I quit this one it’ll look terrible on my resume I know I don’t have to do that, but then it’ll feel like the sacrifice was for a waste of time. I’m scared of even telling him that I’m leaving since basically it will be just the intern and him, and also he paid for the airline and hotel stay, I don’t want to be looked at as a failure or that I wasn’t good enough for this job, but it feels that way. 
Im so sorry if this sounds scattered, and it’s so much text I don’t know if anyone can or will but please even if it’s small advice I could really use it, all my family and friends say to give it a week or a month and see how it feels but it just feels worse everytime I come in, my whole life and emotions feel around this job, I just wanted to do a good job."

I left them on great terms (threw me a party and everything) and still supported them for months after... My biggest fear is getting hired and then fired for whatever reason. Or, taking the job, turning in my resignation and them rescinding the offer. The fears are irrational, but I hear of these situations happening. I am holding down two mortgages, my wife is pursuing her master's, and we have a toddler. It seems that if they want me back so badly, would asking for a 2-year contract be a good idea?

Following the job offer that was sent, the manager started to be flaky. Whenever I tried to get in contact with him, I was told that he had apparently “just left” or had some other engagement. At this point, I had a bad feeling. They’re supposed to schedule new employees for a drug test but the manager wasn’t responding to me. 

The day I was supposed to start shows up and I get an email that the job offer was rescinded. I wasn’t totally surprised. But I WAS livid at the lack of respect shown throughout the entire process. Cancelling an offer on the start date is disgusting. 

My question is, should I report this to the company HR? Will it blacklist me? Is it pointless either way? Thanks"

On Friday night, we were super packed. As a hostess, I have to deal with angry customers all the time. However that’s pretty expected. Well that night we had three hostesses total, and my manager pretty much let’s us do our on thing in terms of taking phone calls, budding tables, etc. Well because there’s three of us and on a busy night it’s best if one person stays at the host stand to deal with customers, I’ve told the other hosts that it makes much more sense if someone else is bussing, therefore we get more done. Well, they pretty much just ignored anything I suggested that night and it was extremely frustrating. I told my manager about my frustration several times with the situation since I always take initiative at my job and have been told that I’m one of the only hosts that do that. Anyways, a few hours later on into my shift it really just gets worse. I have customers coming up to me complaining about misinformation they were given about our call ahead seating (which wouldn’t have been an issue if I were the one answering the phones at the host stand) and co-workers that pretty much avoid my suggestions because they take it personally. There have been countless times where I help bus tables because I know it needs to be done and I don’t complain because it’s not about me. At the end of the shift, I was so frustrated that I walked out an hour before I was supposed to leave and got a ride home. I do feel guilty about this but I genuinely just feel like my managers could have at least said something. I’ve always gotten compliments about how hardworking I am, and I’ve put up with a lot at this job for someone my age. Last year, they messed up my pay stub and I wasn’t even being paid for about six weeks. I was also called a derogatory name by an older co-worker. This was kind of the third strike for me. I’ll miss my job but I feel like little was shown for the effort I put in that restaurant. Am I wrong here?"

Yes - five parts! 

I had a look at it, and honestly in order to do a decent job it's going to take several hours - pretty much a full day's work. We're talking editing a four-page report, writing a 200-word blog post, creating a top-to-bottom to-do list for an event, from concept to execution, conceptualising a 3-minute video (including script and title cards) and editing and designing a 3-page ppt.  

This seems... crazy, right? I haven't even had a phone call with these people yet, let alone discussed the salary. Does this seem off to you? When I've done my own hiring I usually only give a written test to strong candidates that I've already met in person. I don't really want to waste all this time on a lengthy written test only to subsequently get to a F2F interview and realise it's not a good fit and I'm honestly tempted to tell the hiring manager the same.

My manager told me I shouldn’t expect to be promoted because I have been with the company longer (6 years in June). I told him I didn’t expect a promotion due to seniority, I was hoping my hard work and dedication to our team would help me. This was almost a year ago. Several months ago my manager promised me a promotion for a different position that he thought I would do a great job in.
I interviewed for it but he kept ignoring me when I’d ask him when he might know when the decision would be made. He then made it seem as if he never promised me the promotion and acted like the conversation we had never happened. He’d always tell me “it takes time, we are busy, I am being pulled in 100 different directions “.
Two weeks ago I found out that the position was offered to someone in a different department and both manager and director of the company begged her to take it. 
When I confronted my manager and asked why he was not honest with me he said that it wasn’t true that the position was offered to someone else. I know he is not being honest. He still did not mention that I might even get the position. I told him I was disappointed that he’s been straining me along for almost 2 years.
I am in the process of looking for other jobs but I am unsure as to how to professionally and gracefully keep working until I find a better opportunity.
I am so resentful over the whole situation.

Thank you."

While this is happening I can function completely normally I just can’t hear anything which makes me completely useless in any customer interaction. 

For background info I have my own jewellery making business so I have experience in that, I love making artworks whether it be sculpture or 2D.

I received an offer for a position I am interested in. However, the salary is a bit below expectations 
It's 28,000 per year (health insurance included), which is very decent where I live. However, it's less than what I make at the moment (32,400 no health insurance included). Health insurance costs around  $1000 a year.

The management I work with is fairly toxic and undervalues us and under-delivers when it comes to promised raises and so, which is why i'm willing to go for a slight salary cut.


Would you consider this a good reply?

***Hello &lt;Name&gt;
I would like to thank you and the team for considering me for this position. It is highly appreciated.
I am very excited for this role ,however, in regards to the annual salary, I was looking for more around $32,000 to $35,000, as my current package has been increased since our last meeting and it is now around $33,000 no benefits included.

I strongly believe that I will be a great asset to the company and that I am worth this amount based on my prior experience. Do you think this increase would be possible?

Looking forward to hearing back from you***


Thank you for any help




Edit: fixed the email a bit, I included my salary as it has been increased since my last interview with them where we were discussing expectations, and I wanted to iterate that."

It's been about 6 months since I started trying to get help with paying for physical therapy. My back started to really hurt on the job and I told my supervisor about it, nothing happened, then contacted HR and asked what to do and got told to ask my supervisor for an injury report form. I did that. 

For months I asked if he'd gotten the form yet. At first he'd just said he forgot to ask so i started reminding him that the issue with my back was still relevant. Then it became ""I'm waiting in the form from (higher up supervisor)"". The most recent time i asked if he'd gotten the form yet I received a snappy ""no"".

I've been dealing with some very serious personal stuff outside of this issue and I keep feeling like just giving up but am trying to find ways to solve it. I've looked up PT stretches and exercises on my own and have done them every day, multiple times a day. I use ice and rest as much as possible. It's getting in the way of my activities outside of work though and this weekend I wasn't able to do any chores since I was in too much pain.

My job aggravates the injury, but I will lose my health insurance (US based) if I quit. I have to support myself. But I just need to get this dealt with and feel so frustrated and demoralized. It's also impacting my ability to do my job and I told my supervisor already that i was worried about that happening. Im worried that pursuing PT on my own insurance will exclude me from getting help through workers comp and will rack up expenses in copays.

I've had bad experiences in the past when I was younger where my hours/pay were cut in half at a small business after i injured my hand since i ""couldn't work as fast"". I just need some help with this

Edit: forgot to add; I went to a doc on my own insurance 6 months ago and she recommended PT but said i was ok to go back to work as normal. I have the referral still. My supervisor had told me to go to a doctor and tell him what she said so i did, but it looks like I still have to fill out paperwork and go to a specific clinic on campus to get help through the university.  So the roadblock is in filing this report at all through my supervisor. The back issue has gotten more painful since then."

I was hired by my company in July 2022. Today I was told my position is being terminated due to a new agreement with another company and my last date is May 31 2023. I will be getting 6 weeks of severance and I don't have to return the joining bonus either.  My wife is pregnant and the baby is due around the same time, May last week- June first week. Is it better to wait  or immediately start my search . I am also on a work visa. Not all jobs accept visa holders and even if I do get a job it will take 3-4 weeks before I can join.

 My concern with joining early is that I will not be able to focus on the pregnancy and new job at the same time and I will be very stressed. At the same time, I have only 60days from may 31st to get a job. 
 
 What are my options?

Thanks"

I’ve got a lot of pressure from my grandparents (I live with them) who believe I should’ve had a decision and graduated liiike yesterday.  

I was pursuing teaching as I love the idea of being a fun, safe space for my students, I love planning and educating but school has been so difficult and expensive. I’m also nervous because of the education system right now and I dislike the idea of taking work home (lesson planning, grading, and so on) so I searched for other options.   

Becoming an esthetician is significantly less school and less expensive. I think it is something I would really enjoy as I think skincare is fun, I’d have a positive impact on making people feel comfortable in their skin, and I think waxing/tinting/eyelashes would be fun.
    
My only problem is… Will it be something I can do till I retire?  Can I make enough money to support myself and the future I want? 
     I’d describe my “preferred future” as comfortable or flexible. I want to own a home in a safe area with good schools for my kids. I want to be able to go out once or twice a month and give to the homeless knowing that I can still make the payments I need to by the next bill. I want to be able to buy pencils for my future students or good quality equipment for my future clients. 
I have looked up the typical salaries for both and they vary depending on state and experience. Teacher and esthetician can start at 33,000 a year and esthetician also usually get tips. But this is highly based on skill and clientele for an esthetician whereas a teacher doesn’t have to go advertising to get students.

Leaving is not my first choice but it's quickly become clear the issues are bigger than just me and my own attempts to resolve are not working.

I don't know how to explain this in interviews. I know I can't give the answer that there are communication issues, because it will be taken as me insulting the company, but if I don't offer any sufficient explanation, I will be the one that ends up looking bad and I don't think I deserve that in this situation...

I’ve been in my job for almost 3 years now. I started it 4 weeks before the UK went into lockdown and we were all sent to work from home. I didn’t really have any training and there was certainly no handover for my role. I was sort of given some brief guidance, a bit of an overview and sent on my way. I thought I had it together and seemed to be getting on fine. There’s been the occasional bump in the road but I think that I’ve kept it going pretty well — even though I was told by other members of the team that my specific role is something of a poisoned chalice and nobody lasts very long.

There’s been a lot of issues in my workplace recently, not just with my workload, and other colleagues are having a lot of issues too. But the stress is becoming too much. I’m currently on sick leave and I actually don’t want to return — I’m on medication for the first time in my life and speaking to my GP as well as my company’s occupational health department.

Is it strange that I should be knowing all that information prior to my interview? Or have they already decided to hire me and the ""interview"" is more like onboarding?

I'm fairly junior and early in my career; I was initially hired onto a team with a lot of individuals able to provide me support and guidance. Due to company needs, I was recently switched onto a different team without any of the same mentorship available.

On this new team, I'm taking over a lot of work of someone from the same function as myself. Unfortunately, I've struggled a LOT with working with this person, which I'm trying to rectify given that we're expected to work alongside each other.

Working on a new team meant I had to learn a lot of new concepts/processes, which for a junior person still fairly new to the company and the industry it operates in has NOT been easy, and on top of that I lack the same support I had on my previous team. I've done a lot of work to communicate this to both my direct manager and this person, and to level set expectations accordingly, yet this person hasn't been understanding about this.

This mismatch in expectations has unfortunately created an atmosphere of distrust where despite my best efforts to overcommunicate, be proactive, and put out quality work, this person has become incredibly micromanagey and passive-aggressive in their actions towards me. On my end, I feel incredibly unsupported and afraid to ask questions that will help me onboard onto this new team. 

I've gone to extraordinary lengths already to try and fix this (despite it being less than 2 months working with this person): I've literally made a tracker of ongoing work that I keep updated + send to this person, I send them constant updates on everything, I've had conversations with both my direct manager and this person to see what I can do better.

For a week or so, things seemed to get better, but after returning from the holidays I swear something flipped and everything is back to square one with the micromanaging/passive aggressiveness. I noticed it within 2 days back and backtracked to see what possibly could have caused it, but even as a self-aware person couldn't figure out wtf happened in &lt; 48 hours to revert everything.

I spoke to my direct manager again on this and they advised me to have another conversation with this person. I am so frustrated and worn out from being treated like this, and am wondering how I can approach this in a fruitful manner? I am giving my all to try and ramp on this new team and having to deal with this person's mannerisms just adds on top of the stress and anxiety, and I want to put this all to rest."

- Bullying 
- Gaslighting 
- Micromanaging 
- Toxic work environment 
- Manipulation
- Harassment
I had been working at this place for 7.5 years. I’m nephew of owner (age 40). On many occasions I was told I would take over the company. This has been posted on Facebook and sent to me via email. Since the pandemic, owner became very verbally abusive, bullying and toxic. Brought his personal life into the work place. Several workers quit because of the behaviour.

I worked as a contractor, but the whole time I was there, requested to act as a employee. I have in writing that I was VP of company and was to succeed the company. I signed legal documents for client contracts, had company signature in my emails etc. 

I took years of abuse. Once my wife and I had a baby, it became worse. I took a month off and owner would say things like “you know what happens when you take time off, you are usually not welcomed back.” 

I have 13 hours of audio recordings when I knew I was going to threatened or talked to in a abusive, or condescending way. 

I spent years walking of eggs shells. The straw that broke the camels back was due to the owners husband (finance department) going back and forward with the office coordinator in an email, both, trying to micromanage me the VP of the company. 

Here’s the thing. I have no contract. Treated me as a employee. Spent 7.5 years driving back and forth to the city 1.5-2 hours each way, told to work at the office 9-5pm. We had to attend company meetings and events. I had to train new hires, and created company policies etc. 

They were misclassifying me under labour laws in Canada. 

If their a possibility I can get severance ? There’s so much more to tell, but I don’t want to bore you. But this has been really stressing me out. I had finished schooling years ago, had a career path that was challenging to get into, owner approached me with his desire for me to succeed his business. Feel like a lot of my prime earning time was wasted by a narc.

My dad is a single dad and I have a little brother that attends school. We live too far out from the district for a bus to take him to and from, so my dad has to do it. And we cannot afford a daycare situation. This means mon-fri he has to be available in the morning to drop him off, and the afternoon to pick him up and watch over him. and no normal 9-5 is going to accomodate that.

I've been given a variety of different projects and tasks to finish over the course of a few days and completed a few of them with little to no issue, however I'm beginning to realize a lot of the projects I have started are still on going.  

For starters, I was told that I needed to look into tech for starting a small esports club. I have sent her the info on the console, the games, and the projector we will need for the club however she never got back to me on it. 

Another instance, is she asked me to find a printer and some laptops to add to the computer lab and I put together a little list with price tags and website links. However, that was about two weeks ago and I haven't gotten any update on it.

Lastly, one other project that I was recently given was to clean the networking rack. I already started putting together the different things we would need for the feat and send her a price list and supplies, and yet again it's like its on the backburner.

Don't get me wrong, she's a nice boss, but she seems very scatterbrained at times as most of the emails I send her she apparently forgets. It's frustrating because it feels like all my hard work is not really going anywhere. I usually just sit around and just wait for her to give me something to do, or for someone to ask for IT help. This may sound like I'm crazy for complaining about getting paid doing nothing, but I'm just like that. I can't stand having a job where I sit around doing nothing.

I also got terminated two days before I moved into my new house near work and have also dealt with a physical health issue, but these are another story. 

I was in the private accounting role for 3 years and got promoted once. I was on great terms with my manager, but that relationship might have frayed when I quit the day after another coworker quit, refused the counteroffer, and then I called her up months later to inquire about a VP in his 50s who emailed me nude photos (whom she defended - I didn’t accuse him though - just asked if she thought he was professional). It’s complicated because I forgave this coworker and he turned out to be OK - he’s just a weirdo..

I feel downcast because my accounting job was stable and flexible and I even took a paycut for this supposedly “better” job in high finance. 

I see multiple job openings in that very department on LinkedIn, but I do wonder if it’s offensive to them for me to even ask after 10 months of my resignation if there’s any chance of me returning. I don’t think the department has had a history of taking back employees who’ve quit though."
1,2023-01-09,Leave office job for WFH job with less pay?,u/boobumblebee,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/107nsj0/leave_office_job_for_wfh_job_with_less_pay/,jobs,"Anyone have any experince with leaving an office job for a fully remote job, but with less pay?

----

Currently interviewing for a position that's 100% remote.
All in all, the interviews seem to be going well, but its looking like I'll be taking a pay cut of about 10k, maybe more.

I currently make about 60k a year, and the pay range for the new job from what I can gather is going to be a lot less than what I'm making now. I'd guess starting possibly as low as 40k a year. 

though the WFH tradeoff could be worth it, since I wouldn't have a 1 hour commute every day, would have an hour for lunch at home where I could actually do something useful with mytime instead of eat lunch at my desk. 

My wife is also fully remote, so that would allow us the freedom to be able to move out of our crazy high cost of living area to somewhere else and not have to worry about rent going up and my commute getting longer. We would be able to spend a ton more time together, and I'd have lots more time during the week for my hobbies and activities. 

I like the work I do at my current job, but business decisions by the owner make it harder and harder to keep working here.

The work at the new job would be significantly easier too ( my previous job of 5 years was doing this type of work )"

Initially I started with the “be cordial and focus on work” mentality. But as time went on, I became more loose and felt free to just freely talk whilst working. That included side comments when others were talking. 

Last month, someone I’m in good graces with said “now that I’ve known you this long, I can say that you talk too much”. She eventually said it again in front of me to someone else. Additionally, the medical director said “you just love to talk”. There was no vendetta behind what they were saying. This was true.

After being on vacation for a week, I decided to go back to focusing on work, being cordial and speaking when spoken to. But now it’s like the flood gates have opened. Everyone I regularly spoke to in my workspace is concerned about me. I’ve been asked “are you ok?” “Did something happen?” and everything in between; that included the aforementioned coworker and medical director asking me questions of concern. 

It’s gotten to the point where my direct manager has called me into her office to check on me in addition to the admin director due to the medical director talking about this. I don’t want to tell them “it’s because you guys said this about me”. This is not out of spite. They actually did me a favor, as I see this as a more efficient way of working. I get more done and my day is more peaceful. How would you navigate this if you were in situation?

TL;DR- Used to be social and am now just cordial after being told I talk too much by colleagues. Now they are concerned and I’m stuck on how to proceed.

EDIT- It may be too late to tell the truth because I already told everyone, that I was fine and had no idea what they were talking about. And that if there was any difference, that it was because rust because I was fresh off of vacation."

Sustainability or renewable/nuclear energy
More general statistics and data analysis stuff, not necessarily physics related
Transportation infrastructure

Are there any viable job prospects in those vague areas?



Also, another thing. I may be able to switch my flavour of degree from Physics to Physics with Space Science. Is either more attractive than the other to employers not directly involved in space science?

First of all, they sent me an email about when to have a meeting. i put a date and we had a meeting. something felt off, there were 2 indian people (i wish i could ignore it but... you know, 99% of online scams are always people from india :S) , their cameras off, only one of them talked during the interview. Another person sometimes popped and disappeared for a couple times. Also never talked or show anything in camera.

They talked to me about what consists, etc, and they told me the basics on how to do a H1B Visa. They said *i have to pay it* (first scary thing cuz im a brokie and cant afford being scammed)*,* and also where to do it, and so on. they said its around 500$. seemed lot of money, but searched and looked like the price is about right, right? In any case they said ""dont worry about visa right now since we still need you to demonstrate your programming skills"" more or less like this. Should i ask them if they can pay the visa for me and later discount it from my first wage or something like that?  


Well, a day passed (today), and they sent me a new email, which is basically an Excel in which i must fill out all my data: name, phone, university, postal code, PASSPORT NUMBER, ""Passport (With all pages)""... these last 2 seem very odd to me. i repeat, i have no idea, so anyone can tell if it is normal to ask for passport number and ""all pages""?? whatever that last one means... weird to share the whole passport to me... Anyway, and they also sent me a link to perform a test or whatever. Still havent done it.  


I tried to investigate about the company a little bit, says ""An E-Verified company"", and their website looks trustable... except few texts with bad-looking fonts, but as i said 3 times now, im just a little bit too cautious, and i dont know what to do.

1,2023-01-09,"Trying to set up a long term career and lifestyle goal that I can stick with. Looking at a STEM program, either botany, or marine biology. seeking advice",u/foxxytroxxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/107uwga/trying_to_set_up_a_long_term_career_and_lifestyle/,jobs,"Posting similar questions to graduate studies and careers (subs)
Tl;Dr: two questions

1. Is marine biology a good field to seek a research and teaching career from? Is it a more job related field than botany?

2. Is hospitality a good field to start in, especially if I might want to move to a bigger city or to Hawaii? 

3. Any details about the research job market would be helpful if I'm off base below.

30 years old male, bachelor's degree in philosophy from a good state school (university of Oregon). About five grand in college debt that I've been waiting to pay off for the settlement amount, which is around four grand. I should be applicable for some basic scholarships, and I tend to live cheaply, so as long as I'm working I tend to get by and make savings

*I don't mind moving slowly but I am afraid of stagnating and giving myself a career that feels like it's a more shallow or less fulfilling version of what I am trying to manifest for myself.* So any help thinking about the realistic or unrealistic aspects of this plan, that's what I'm looking for. 

1. Interested in a STEM field, and doing research even if it only ends up part time. Looking at marine biology but have a strong experiential background in field botany and have considered forest surveys. They say one degree in a natural resource is often translatable to other related fields so maybe for a job this isn't a big deal, but that's what I'm choosing between

2. Have experience in food service and lots of maintenance/skilled/unskilled manual labor: splicing water lines, landscaping, milking cows on a private farm, subcontractor kinds of work, demolition, construction, working with farm plants, etc. BUT I'm mostly interested in the hospitality job market or maybe getting back into tutoring (several times I've been on track for real tutor certification but I hesitate to make a career out of just that, would prefer to be a professor if I wanted to go that route). Also proficient in writing and math as a result of my education

3. I have a wide variety of interests including primitive technology, bicycle construction/repair (including motorized and ebikes), and music/instrument repair, but I just don't see myself establishing a career out of these things so I call them ""hobby disciplines."" While I hope to further these interests, they can bet ignored for the most part. I'm just trying to include my experience, wondering if this is at all related to the job market?

Question: my main concern is that in spite of these experiences I may never find a realistic career goal from any of them if I don't choose something and stick with it. I would be fine as a plumber or something, except that I feel I can help more people with a STEM degree, and/or as a writer or something. I would rather go into my future feeling like I'm contributing to something of value to others, and helping the world, than ""settle"" for something that is just a career for myself... Is marine biology a reasonable career related degree if we assume I succeed in the schooling? I can pay for it and would receive some public funding, at least from my home state, if I pursued this. I wouldn't let myself waste much money, but would rather save up most of the money before applying for the school.

One final question: I seem to have trouble getting hospitality related jobs but would like one if I could get it, I think. I'm wondering if I may want to live in Hawaii, and even go to school there which is cheap tuition wise; however, I've never succeeded at these interviews for them. Thinking a night auditor maybe. I have relevant experience: service industry, office data entry, and strong writing/data comprehension skills. So, are bought auditors *usually* highly experienced in like maybe front desk work? Or is that often an entry level position? Realistically I'm just tired of only doing manual labor and want that career of mine to be a research career, which will involve athleticism but I feel like I'm not going to enjoy subcontracting or contracting as a profession.

Thanks."

Hey reddit, I have two quick questions and don’t know if this is the right sub to post them in.

The other question was about the CEA agreement, say I work 8 hours at KFC. The max hours legally allowed during a school week is 12. For example, if I work 8 hours at KFC, would that mean I can only work 4 at my second job? Or is it 12 hours maximum overall or each job?

Looking for advice on how to best advocate for myself re: a few issues I'm having at work or if I would be better off just throwing in the towel.

*I am a 34 year old female working in an auto parts store. I was made store manager a few months in after the original one had to be moved for repetitive unprofessional behavior (drinking on the job, etc). However, I have no actual power and make no decisions. I don't choose who to hire or fire. I don't make the schedule. Basically, I just have a company credit card, answer to any angry customers, and take extra orders from upper management. This makes getting everyone on the same page when it comes to work virtually impossible because they don't see me as anyone with any type of authority. I've received no support from upper management after being tossed in as store manager and have mostly been left to figure things out for myself while the company is busy buying up new stores they can't staff. 

Edited to add: upper management is not at the same location as me and my coworkers, so there is minimal oversight. 

*I'm the only female working with four other guys, but I do most of the warehouse work. I will not say I don't get help from them at all, but a lot of times, it is minimal. I am not a wimp, but I am a smaller woman (5'4 and 100 lbs), and lifting things like rotors and batteries kicks my ass. I go home hurting almost daily. This ties in to being a manager with no real authority because I feel like I'm unable to delegate some of these things out. 

*When I was hired, they presented a schedule of 10 hour shifts M-F and every other Saturday. I told them I didn't think I'd be happy with my work life balance and they assured me that Saturdays were temporary and that it was something they were working on reducing company-wide to one Saturday a month. I accepted the job based on this and have heard nothing further about it since. This was almost a year ago. As predicted, my work-life balance has suffered, and I am unhappy going to work every day because, frankly, I feel like I live there. 

I'm very frustrated as I feel like the hiring manager just told me what he wanted me to hear to get me on board. I did find out after being hired that they had received virtually no applications for the position. 

Is it even worth addressing any of these issues to my upper management to see if it can be resolved in anyway, or should I just see them for what they are and start looking for a different job?"

Now I know that offense will show in a criminal background check but will the over 20 year one show up? I hear that employment background checks typically go back 7 years. But can’t an employee try and find out what county you live in and check your criminal record that way? Do companies even go so far to even do this on there own? Just curious? This is for an inside sales position. Even though companies are directed to whatever the offense is and if it’s not directly related to the job they should still hire you. Which I think is compete bullcrap. They really don’t have to go by that. That’s the most ludicrous thing I have ever heard.

SETUP: I've been looking for a gig for a good six months.  I am an IT nerd manager.

RESULT: I finally met with a reasonable employer in my field and we hit it off.  All good...smooth sailing.  Ready to take (and in this case took) the gig.

BUMP IN THE ROAD: I had met with a head hunter about another gig, closer-by too.  We had a great conversation that led to my first conversation with a member of the hiring team.  This was RIGHT AT THE SAME MOMENT I WAS SENT OFFER LETTERS by company number one.

THEN...:The second company (the one with the head hunter) signed my up for a chat with the CFO.  I was in a pickle because I didn't want to drag my feet on the first gig and risk losing it.  So I told the head hunter the truth: ""I have a pending offer.  I think it's a good idea to have the conversation with the CFO but my time frame was very, very short.""  As I was driving (two stinkin' hours) to the interview, the head hunter called me and said that the CFO didn't want to be rushed or pushed, therefore the interview was cancelled.

RESULT: I took the first gig.

LESSONS LEARNED: 1) always tell the truth, 2) be selective in what information you say to anybody, 3) the grass might be greener on the other side of the fence; but it might be an illusion, too, 4) one in the hand is worth two in the bush!!!"

A colleague gave notice abruptly after Thanksgiving break, and I only had 2 days to train with him before he left. 

I feel like I’m behind the 8-ball still, and I’m constantly behind on projects that come up because I have to learn how to do them at the same time. I would bring it up with my manager, but the culture at my job is one of “figure it out, or ask your peers for help” sort of thing. (Though for the latter, there’s only so much help I’d be comfortable asking for.) I’ve been here 5 months, and it still feels like every new project I get is something I don’t know how to do yet. Training resources and documentation are lacking.

It’s caused me a level of stress I haven’t known in my working life, and I get the Sunday scaries pretty much every day. I haven’t been to the gym consistently since this change, and my meal planning has also suffered. I’ve signed up for career-related therapy to get help on how to approach the situation. 

A part of me is questioning how much longer I can stomach this. It’s challenging to say the least, and I anticipate my role to change again in another month due to the nature of my projects. In a positive light, it’s forcing me to be more proactive in learning, but it’s made me doubt my skills and professional worth. It doesn’t help that I’d be on the hook for returning a significant signing bonus if I leave before a year is up.

At what point would I just need to say fuck it? I haven’t been in this situation before, so if anyone has experiences they would be willing to share, I would greatly appreciate any advice."

1,2023-01-10,Should I leave my current position (Small Pharma) for a 50% pay increase (Big Pharma)?,u/dingdingdrop,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1081j01/should_i_leave_my_current_position_small_pharma/,jobs,"I graduated with a Master's in Analytical Chemistry and moved 800 miles across the USA to start my career in pharmaceuticals (by philly). I got very fortunate to find a small company that hired me on with good starting pay. They really are like a small family kind of business. Company has no debt, I have 1 yr and 6 months experience so far making 70k a year with 15k bonus a year. The benefits are hard to pass up with 3% 401k matching, pay for all my healthcare/vision/dental premiums, 100% 4100 deductible plan with 0% copay and 21 PTO a year. Raises are once a year during my evaluation and this year was matching inflation at 7%. Business is booming and I'm really happy working there. 

I'm constantly messaged by recruiters for various positions and one caught my eye with a top 10 big pharma company (GSK-GlaxoSmithKline) down the street. They reached out to me for interviews and I decided to go through the process to see if I could reach the final stages (I have some imposter syndrome for some of these positions not having PHD and being a higher level position). I fit the criteria and they offered me the position. The position is a senior position in my role (step up from my current role) offering $110K base salary, 10K bonus a year in cash, and 10k a year in stocks as well. Benefits is 15 days PTO with 4% match. No vacation increase until 10 years (current job is 5 days increased every 5 years). Healthcare benefits were okay with 20% copay and premiums not covered. 

I really do love working at my current position but seeing a ~50% increase on my pay scale is hard to pass up when I'm young [25M] and helps start my climb in the corporate ladder of big pharma. However, I enjoy the hands on and low stress of my current position. I have minimal meetings and get to do a lot of hands on work where the GSK position would be more meetings, more writing, and less time in the lab.

I also feel bad if I were to leave my current company but I understand its a transactional relationship between me and them. GSK does have yearly restructuring of certain departments. So there is more job risk with big pharma position compared to my current job. 

Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated as I have a week to decide."

They complain they have too much work to do. They complain when I do too much work and I don't want to sit around and do nothing. They complain that they can't trust each other and that everyone is a backstabber. They complain management is actively trying to find ways to ruin their life and make them miserable. They complain that management takes money away from them if they get a promotion. One coworker is going so far as to try to force me to apply to other jobs at different facilities because he doesn't want me working at this job. I love this job - it's in supply chain which is a career field I A) have experience in and and enjoy and B) would like to eventually go back to school for. Most of the people complaining are either leaving at the end of the month or by March. 

I've thought about going to management to see if there is anything they can do, but I'm not sure if that's the right path. I've asked coworkers to stop complaining and try to change the subject to sports or weather or how to find an item or complete a task (since I'm still new), but they switch the conversation back to complaining. At one point, I asked one coworker to please stop complaining, and I was told that he wasn't complaining but explaining the details of the job that management doesn't want to tell new workers. This is also the same coworker that thinks I'm overwhelmed because I stop to take a sip of water every once in a while and that I'm too weak to do certain things like pushing a cart because I'm a woman."

She said no, and then asked my boss who said he never received an email from me. I checked and the email is in my sent folder, and the email address I sent it to is correct. Is it possible that he never received it? I'm thinking maybe he just missed the email and is now claiming he didn't receive it.

I sent a new email to my boss  today with my resignation letter attached along with a screenshot of the original email I sent (including the date and the email address that I sent it to) and I sent the same email to my manager. Can I leave at the end of the four week period that I originally gave notice for, or can my boss make me work for another four weeks starting from now? I don't want to burn any bridges as it would be good for me to have a reference from this job.

I don’t know what I want to be or do as a career, and would like to get some suggestions of careers or majors that may interest me based on my interests. I am a female who loves fashion, thrifting, and shopping. I love skincare as well. If I went into marketing a dream would be to market for a big fashion or skincare company. Another possibility for me is something to do with helping people and animals. This is the one I’m more so not sure of career options. I am not big on math or science, I am strongest in English. I am big on social issues and it would be cool to get involved with those in the government, but I don’t know much about economics, however I am taking required economic classes. I do know I want to travel, wether that’s finding a job that requires traveling or making enough money and getting enough time to travel. 

Based on these interests, is marketing a good major for me, or should I switch to something else even possibly outside of business? What are some future careers I should look into?"

I waited for my work visa before I applied because technically I wasn’t eligible to apply for work at that time but now I am. Also, when applying online or in person, they asked if I am eligible to work in the country or not. And…I want to answer them honestly on that part. Two months after I processed it with my partner, I now have the work visa. However, while applying…I got rejected and rejected through email even if they said my experience and educational background is impressive. It is now three months since the month I received my visa and still no work. To make myself fell better, I just think positively by saying that it is not the right time yet, that I have to have enough patience for things to go right and that I have to be more flexible by not just focusing to my degree but to apply other job positions too. I just felt not okay a bit knowing that I wouldn’t be jobless right now if I stayed in my home country. I got relocated because of my romantic relationship to my partner. I know it shouldn’t be an excuse as I should of secured my career before relocating. I know my partner has not been saying anything about me being a burden financially but I think I am. However, before I got relocated here, we both know of the expected scenario. That my partner will be supporting me while processing the things needed for my relocation and other stuff. But…Why am I feeling pressured? I have not been useless while staying here. I have been doing my share financially through my savings. Although my partner’s share is more than me. I believe, I have been doing my best in other aspects by cooking foods, doing laundry, washing the dishes, and doing other household chores. All I know, a perfect time comes when the least we expect it."

Hi, I'm a fresher in this company, I teach physics to IIT aspirants, after training period I got a location with which I was ok, now after one month here Deputy director asked me to do him a favour, he asked me to go to another location as deputation purpose for 15 days(paid accomodation by company)  only because there physics faculty is not well. 

Here when I came,  I had to take 5 classes per day which was really hectic and exhausting for me as a fresher, still I managed and feedbacks from students were also really good. 

And now, 15 days are over, here permanent faculty is also back and I asked that shall I leave, they are saying that until i receive a mail I can't leave, and by default I have to work here only.. but I didn't receive any letter regarding extension of deputation. And my reporting manager is also changed without knowing me. And when I am saying that I'll leave, because ma'am is also back almost everyone ( even AD's and DD's ) requesting me to stay here.. And, I'm not really comfortable in this location. 

What can I do in this situation ?"

5,2023-01-10,'Beat the ATS' ... just stop already.,u/UCRecruiter,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/108acy6/beat_the_ats_just_stop_already/,jobs,"If you're on the job market, PLEASE don't let yourself get suckered in by the people who want to charge you hundreds of dollars so your resume 'beats the ATS'. Those people are preying on fear and ignorance.

AI, or a bot, isn't deciding whether you get an interview or not. An ATS is a database with search functionality and some automation. That's IT.

Your resume needs ...

* to include keywords that are relevant to your experience
* to be easy to read, in a clear font, without a lot of graphics and crap cluttering it up
* to be formatted well, with the relevant information found in its usual place

It doesn't matter whether your resume is in an ATS, or being screened by a person. In either case, it needs those three things.

If you don't have the skills to write a decent resume, fine .. hire a resume writer. They have their place.

But as soon as you see someone talking about your resume 'beating the ATS', or about your resume being thrown out by 'bots', just run the other way.

&amp;#x200B;

*Editing to add: I'm oversimplifying this a bit, because frankly I'm pissed off with people being taken advantage of by 'snake oil salesmen' who are capitalizing on fear. Especially when they're vulnerable like job seekers, and probably need the money. Some of the comments on this post point out the nuances I didn't originally include.*"

Our managers retaliation was effecting my mental health so bad (I already deal with depression) that I began having suicidal ideations. 

After that July incident and many meetings with HR I was suddenly put on a performance improvement plan although I had no prior issues with my performance. 

Despite trying to fight against it, it just stuck. 

I woke up everyday stressed and not wanting to show up for a job I loved. 

It all culminated at the end of November when I finally quit. I had been hoping to wait it out in hopes of getting fired but I couldn’t make it work. 

The other employee she retaliated against was immediately about to be put on a performance plan as well and negotiated severance / lay off instead.. which I didn’t realize was a thing I guess. 

Although I feel better after leaving and my mental health has improved I’m now unemployed. 

I’m job searching but it’s a process. I also have no savings. 

I was asked by the company if I wanted to do contract work with them in January but once I followed up they ghosted. 

I’ve never been in this situation before in my life. 

Prior to working there I was a pretty successful freelancer so I’m trying to reach back out to old clients. 

But if I don’t get something by the end of the month I’ll be hitting financial strain territory. 

Has anyone else been here before? I’m beginning to feel fear and hopelessness.

I also now have trauma that all corporate and non profit jobs are like this which is making me fearful of getting another job in the same field."

If it isn’t clear yet, I’m a minor under the age of 16. I want to make one thing clear: nothing my boss is asking me to do violates local or federal laws. 

I started this summer. I was and still am an athlete at the same time, my coworkers are also my coaches. I worked four days a week for two or three hours each. Occasionally picking up an extra few hours. 

I love my job, I get to work with kids and I get do/teach the sport I love. My coworkers are all also great.

Come the school year, I made an agreement with my parents that I could work one day a week at a time that wouldn’t interfere with after school activities. We would decide extra one of shifts/covering classes on a case by case basis.

I talked to my boss and this worked for her. She’s been super great with letting me make my schedule. When asked to cover, I generally say yes unless I have an a conflict. She’s asked me twice now to pick up another day. She’s taken the no both times and let up (both times she asked were at schedule change times). 

I just feel a bit bad, I know that I don’t want to more than one day and that accepts that. We, just like everyone else have been hit by the staffing issues. A lot of our coaches use this as an in between things. One our newer ones, who got hired just a few months after me, is leaving. The day that she asked me to pick up is that coaches day.

I’m currently interviewing for a fully remote job which would be amazing for me and put me on a path where I can live the kinda life I want to live. I’m very interested in working for them. 

However, the job is wanting me to take a 4 hour skills test. I have no issue with that, but during interviews they told me they can’t give a pay range until I do the test. 

I’m currently employed so taking almost a full day off work to do the test isn’t ideal without knowing the pay range of the position. Basically I don’t want to take time off work to find out it’s a $15 an hour job. 


I’m looking for any tips or advice of how to tactfully at least get a ball park estimation of what the pay range may be.  I’m almost certain is lower than what I’m making now, but I’m okay with that, but I still need enough to pay bills.

EDIT: my job is software knowledge based, and a skills test along with a portfolio of previous work is commonplace. I don't mind doing the test at all, and am very confident in doing it, Just not before knowing what the pay may be."

I learned a lot and in the first half I was really enthusiastic about the environment and the job. People are really nice to each other and my tutors showed care, passion and patience in teaching me their work, they are really nice people. So, on the surface, everything is going swell.
Problem is, the whole day my outlook is usually fully booked with meetings where I co-work with my tutors; it becomes a non-stop marathon where the second I stop with one, I have to go to the other. On top of that, people keep assigning me stuff to do, even though I would have no time slot to do that. So I have to use every second to complete those tasks, while balancing them with tasks that I already have to get done. Different topics rapidly succeding each other and tasks keep piling up and this makes me always really anxious.
The result is that by 16 I cannot focus on anything and everyday I get back home with a strong headache, fatigued and stressed out. I can only think about things that happened at work and that I have to do the day after, as my brain cannot focus on anything else.
I dream about it and everyday I find myself half panicking and half disgusted from the idea to have to go through another day.
Needless to say, during the weekend I try my best to study but I have to force myself to read, as I cannot focus on what I do. My stomach is always acid and i cannot sleep well as i wake up from stomach aches. 

My question is: of course this post is also a rant, but am I being just a little crybaby that just needs to ""toughen up""? Or is there something wrong with what I do/in the work environment? 

Because if all it takes to do this to me is an intership, I cannot imagine what real work will do to me."

I was working at a high volume vet clinic for about 5 years, part of which was during the pandemic. I got pretty burned out and workplace became very toxic. I decided to leave, partly because I wanted to have different hours (my husband and I are trying to have a baby and I wanted the ability to work part time). 

I started working 3 days a week at a clinic and I work contract for other clinics one day a week. Figured I’d go down to 3 days a week when we have a baby. 

So I’ve been at the new 3 day a week job for about 7 months now and I’m not really enjoying it. Some days are good but some are so boring. I am learning things which is nice but I’m not sure I’m really fitting in either. 

I’m trying to decide if I should look for other part time opportunities. This job is actually paying for my health insurance but I do have the ability to join my husband’s if I need to. There are some places that need veterinarians a couple of days a week and I could still work contract. 

Contract work pays super well and I’m actually enjoying that aspect a lot. I could do this 4 days a week. 

Just not sure what to do. Or I should give my current job more time."

I’ve been at a manufacturing company in total just under 2 years. I started as an intern while I was finishing up engineering school(electrical and computer engineering). I then got a full time position as a controls engineer, which I than got pulled to programming our robotics. In 8 months I’ve revived 3 robot cells that once failed. The last one I did was a pretty complex system full PC ran no PLC all Visual Studio based program. I’m now working on fully designing a robotic machine with a PLC programmer and 2 mechanical engineers. I would call myself more of a automation engineer because I can do PLC, Vision, and Robot programming. 

Here’s my question, I’ve only been there 8 months out of school and I think I’ve set myself up pretty well for the future there but I don’t forsee myself being here more than 5 years but I also don’t want to travel as a typical automation engineer. Should I start to learn more in-depth programming like Java and python to do WFH software engineering or learn machine learning and do WTH data science/AI programming.

I'm currently doing an internship at a museum. It is also a workspace that makes textiles. I really like working here.

As I still need to graduate (upcoming sept for 6 months) but my internship ends in May. I could work the summer and do my project over there..    That would be fun/really cool if that happends. i'm a dreamer maybe you noticed that already :)

Do you have any tips on how to make myself the 'perfect' candidate for this? Also who should i contact about my interest in the company? Like a manager/ HR/ coördinator?

Also should I just ask to work there? or how should I express my interest in a job?

We have at least 119 employees. This has to be a violation of the Affordable Care Act.

Since October. I have tried calling lawyers, the IRS, the Social Security Office, the Department of Labor, Florida's Department of Economic Opportunity, Washington States Unemployment Office, and so many other ABC 123 departments. 

No one will help me and nothing has come of this.

I work at a catering business. I have a coworker, we’ll call him “Dan”. We got pretty close, pretty quickly. He isn’t my boss, but his position is higher than mine. He has a wife, and a kid. 

From the moment we met, he started asking personal questions. I didn’t mind answering them, because he seemed trustworthy. From the moment we met, I could tell he cared about my personal issues. 

He is always trying to help me. He is always helping me finish my job, but doesn’t do it for anyone else in the place. He is always trying to do something with me. Some nights I can do it, some nights I can’t. 

The other day I told him I needed to take the car to the garage to get my brakes done. He immediately said “I can follow you, drop off the car, and take you back home.” I said “Dan you work during the day.” To which he replied “I’ll call off.” I thought this was odd, but I appreciated him wanting to help.

He is always offering to take me places. I told him I had never been ax throwing. He immediately chimed in “Oh I’ll take you. What are you doing Saturday?”

He is always giving me advice, and helping me through my problems. I told him that my ABS light keeps going off in my car. He printed an entire instruction paper off the internet to help me fix it. I told him I wanted to start watching Game of Thrones. He then brought me a box of all seasons on dvd, along with all of the books…

Let me say that this doesn’t make me uncomfortable. He is incredibly helpful, and is always there for me. My dad died in April, so it’s nice to have someone teach me these things. He is always taking care of me. 

I don’t believe he has any sort of crush on me. He is married, and is constantly poking fun at our gay coworker. Nothing discriminatory, just casual joking. I never told him I’m bisexual.

I’m just confused as to whether or not this is normal. He also knows I’m looking for another job, and is always trying to help me find something. I appreciate all of his help. 

I don’t think he’s lonely. He is constantly bringing his friends around. 

I’m just confused. I don’t know what that says about me. I’m just not used to people wanting to help me and get so close. 

We’ve only known each other for 3 months. I don’t want to get too close to him, just to get another job, and never hear from him again.

Is this situation normal?"

That’s why I quit. The manager assured me that they don’t do overtime. 

During the interview, the manager seemed impatient and interrupted me in between so that was already some bad vibes. But imagine my surprise when I have an offer. Somehow, I persuaded myself to accept as I convinced myself that this job will help to train me on the skill of how to deal with moody and difficult bosses. I think I overestimated my ability to manage anxiety and stress.

When I accepted the offer and my new manager emailed the acceptance letter in the afternoon, I didn’t see it as I was out. So they texted me in the evening asking if I received the information. I told them I did as it was just a simple question. But, they followed up with another query at midnight and texted me again on this. I didn’t reply. 

I don’t know if it’s trauma or what but I suddenly feel so afraid of the things that would happen when I start working with them? Like, I’m legit anxious about it. Am I expected to reply outside of work hours? 

It’s so bad that I started to think of declining the offer but it would be so unprofessional? I’m up all night because I can’t sleep.

I'm studying gamedesign in an online university, but I seem to make no progress, because of a lack of motivation.

I already switched my uni multiple times, and even when I think that this is the right thing for me, I seem to not find any motivation.

All the time I see myself doing something, it always has to be something that is challenging me and has some kind of competition or some numbers going up.

I had alot of these things that grabbed my attention in the last years, may it be some game like chess (where I constantly have a challenge and a way to improve, while seeing confirmation by my elo going up and competing with friends), some idle games (constant optimising of numbers and trying to get the best out of it), something like racing games (constantly seeing the improvement in time getting better), tetris (also seeing increase in speed and pattern recognition) and so on.

All these things and more seem to get my attention really quickly and I don't mind investing tons of time into them, especially when I have somebody to compete against. The thing with all those things, even when I would consider them as fun and not a waste of time, I still seem to be stuck and not able to progress in life. I'm still living with my parents and not even earning a little money to live independently of them.

I constantly seem to look for something that catches me like chess or other things I mentioned, where I can constantly work on and either make money or progress for a future career, something where I can see how I get better at it (making me see that when I do it more I get better and better results and increase my income for example), something where I can work on whenever I feel like it and being able to for example invest extra time to get extra reward out of it, something where I have multiple ways of improving different aspects of the job or career (compared to chess it would be just playing games, solving puzzles, watching videos about it or learning and experimenting, everything will improve my skill in another way and I can work on my weaknesses or specialize in my strengths).

I would like to have a career where I can constantly track how good I am at what I'm doing and directly see it in the results.

I attempted alot of other things that interested me like making music (the better I am at it the better the results and the more income, but it involves a great risk and the entry requirement like learning the programs is very high), graphicsdesign (same like with music if working for yourself), Gamedesign was a little bit of a compromise, because I thought I could make use of my creativity, but in the same time I just can't find motivation to get through this learning programs and everything part (which we don't even learn on the uni it's more a general thing).

I also like doing something with other people, even though I'm introverted and have social anxiety, I love to help people and I'm a good listener, but I'm really bad at convincing them of something and it's also not what I would like to do.

In my dream view I would like to have something that I like to do and constantly improve on, no matter if it is my own skill, or my whole business, where I can optimize more and more and be sucessful and especially motivated in the end.

I constantly feel behind in my life esepecially when I see my friends already finishing uni or working in a job, making progress in their careers, while I'm just wasting time, thinking of how to find the right thing for my life, my purpose and learning some skills that maybe make me happy, but won't bring me further in life."

The interview went very well, my background is an excellent match and I meet all of their required and preferred skills and experiences.  No degree, but the posting says “bachelor’s or equivalent experience” and I have just under 10 years in this fairly niche skillset.  Is this enough to negotiate for the highest end of the salary range if I receive an offer?  It would be my first position with the company and I’m not sure if new hires are eligible to be at the high end.  I don’t want to appear arrogant but could potentially receive a huge bump in pay if they accepted.  Thoughts?"

I've been feeling unhappy at my current workplace for a while now and have been searching for other employment opportunities. A full-time job opportunity nearby came up and I jumped at the chance. The interview went well, and they asked for my references. I asked my current boss to be the reference as the reference had to be within the industry I am in. Upon asking my boss to be a reference, she offered me a full-time position and gave me until the end of the week to respond. 

I would much rather work at the new place as I am not really happy were I am working currently, but as far as I know, they have processed a police vet and have not yet called my references. The role they offered doesn't start until 4 weeks from now, so I think they're taking their time.

Background; I have worked for retail, restaurants, and most recently a distribution warehouse. I am very detail oriented and love being a motivator of a team. I did graduate high school but not college due to expenses.

The job is for an assistant/clerical to the head jewelry controller at a local high-end jewelry store. I do have previous experience in a jewelry store. I am very confident in myself however I am nervous that I will just come off boring as recent interviews in the past were basically just me coming and signing an agreement to work.

TLDR; I asked my boss to send an email to a customer, being my manager, and he told me to email him what I want him to say, and he'll stay it. WTF? Am I out of bounds being upset by this?

I am a customer service rep who has taken on sales duties as I work for a small (less than 50 employees) family run company. I am immediately under the owners son (who is a manager). 

The story is I've been having an issue with a customers order, and finally its become long enough where I feel like I've said I'm sorry enough times that the customer will find it annoying. On Friday I asked my boss to step in if this order is going to be delayed further, so he can apologize and explain the situation. 

Monday, I got sick and called in, so absolutely nothing got done. Tuesday (today) I went in, and got 0 updates as well. Finally, we close at 4, and at 3, I get a call from my boss. Long story short we cant do the customer order, and I ask him to then respond to the customer and let him know. Its his job as the manager to step up, and that is what I am asking him to do. Maybe it might seem like I'm being a ""baby"" wanting my manager to take the fall, but I've been apologizing since late October/Early November, and its nearing mid-January as far as production in concerned. 

Now I get the update at 3, saying we cant do it. I ask him to step in and explain to my customer. He asks me to draft up an email for him to send. I was like ""seriously?"" because I was so shocked. He said ""you're my voice!"" like... I am not paid as an executive assistant, I am barely paid a sales person pay, not to mention I'm hourly (which is surprising in sales)."

Sure was a scary and eye-opening moment.

So I kept applying and applying with NO response and eventually I just threw my resume here for you guys to roast me (and the accounting subreddit too).

You guys provided me with reassurance to quit, to tidy up my resume, and how to reword things on there. Applied to multiple jobs across a span of four months, growing more and more desperate as busy season was coming (Jan 1st) and I knew I wasn't going to survive it this time.

To make a long story short. I start a new job next Tuesday. It has insurance and a 30% increase in salary (47% increase if we're comparing starting to starting salaries). It's still a little under competitive market rate, but it's a good start. I kept coming here, whether it was for my own questions or to skim other people in my situation, and didn't give up.

I want to see if anyone has been through this before and if so, how they dealt with it.

TLDR; I have a job offer, but am more excited about another job that is taking a long time to make a decision. I don't want to come out empty handed. 

I just got a job offer for a fully remote job at a company called let's say Energy Power that checks a lot of boxes for me. It's definitely an upgrade for my from my current position (almost a 22k pay upgrade, fully remote, and better job title).

However, I have a better feeling about another position at a company called let's say Education Power that I'm in the final stages of interviewing for, but I don't know if I'll get it or not. Energy Power seems to be in a bit of time crunch and they need to know if I want the job soon as they are very shortstaffed. I would prefer the job at Education Power but I also would take the job at Energy Power if I needed to.

I'm starting to get frustrated because the interview process at Education Power has been dragging on. It's been about two months since the recruiter first called me. I get that with the holidays things are taking longer, but it's been a huge drag waiting this long and being in such a limbo. I noticed that they re-posted the job recently after I had my first interview and 44 people applied. I am thinking that maybe they aren't serious about me? It seems like a red flag that they re-posted the job..... however, my second interview went very well and it was insinuated that I would be getting a follow up assessment or something.

Should I reach out to the recruiter at the first company and let them know I have another job offer and  I need to know soon? I don't want to deny the first job, then not get the second one."

There’s no personal information or pictures in the tweets but I did respond to a couple very NSFW accounts. 

I opened Twitter and for a split second I saw at the top of the page a post from the company I interviewed at and I don’t follow them. It was probably a random ad but Idk I just got the idea in my head that they found my Twitter and it’d look bad.

I didn't pursue internships hard enough and now I have I have no work experience, which has hurt my job search significantly. I graduated in May 2022 with a degree in Finance. I feel like a loser when I see my peers have great jobs and big companies. I was a great student academically, but too anxious and lazy to put myself out there for internship opportunities.

The strengths I have right now are a perfect GPA (idk how much this matters), and school related projects that I can use as experience. I took two courses where they had us working with real non-profit companies on a consulting project. I got to experience working in a team, and managed real clients. It basically operated like a real-life consulting project and our team successfully implemented our solution for both courses. Now I know its not a job, but its something. It’s all I have really.

The cons are that I have no actual work experience besides an odd tutoring job I did my sophomore year.

I know I probably wont land a job at a big company but I am okay with starting at a small, or mid-sized firm to get some experience. The problem is even those are ghosting me. I feel like my life is ruined, and I have let my parents down. They made so many sacrifices to send me to college, and I wasted it. The longer I am unemployed the worse it looks because now I have this 7-month gap on my resume where I did absolutely nothing. What are my options here? 

This post may get lost in new, but I need any help I can get. Hopefully someone reads it and is able to give some advice :) Please let me know. Thank you!"
3,2023-01-10,New Job sent me a nasty gram and then appears to have ghosted me. Should I be the better person and reach out?,u/Jennafibber,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/108ne41/new_job_sent_me_a_nasty_gram_and_then_appears_to/,jobs,"Okay, so here's the first part of the story: https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1038drx/new_job_lowkey_called_me_a_liar_i_havent_even/

Apparently the brief discussion about my working hours derailed their internal process and they told me that since I caused the delay, they'd be pushing out my start date. It was aggressively written and appeared to be intended as punishment. Again, I haven't even started. I can count on one hand the number of times I've received this aggressive an email. So that wasn't good. But okay, I need the money and Reddit mostly said that the smart thing to do would be to continue looking while pulling a paycheck. I replied nicely that the new date was fine and I'd see them then.

Well, now things are upside down in a new way. Someone from IT was supposed to call me last week on Thursday to set up my computer and get that shipped. No one has called me. (Note, I do not have contact information for IT.) I'm away from home for a while, starting tomorrow, and was supposed to have this computer before I left. I had made it clear in my last email that it needed to arrive before then. (They  knew I was traveling during this time when I accepted the offer. It just wasn't going to be an issue because I'd already have the computer.)

In fact, I have heard nothing from this company. I am really unimpressed, and at this point this feels like a sea of red flags. But since I need money, I'm wondering if I should reach out to them again. I really don't want to. I feel like if things are this bad during onboarding there's just no way that this place isn't a dumpster fire internally. I would potentially be able to get a second round of unemployment if they ghost me and I don't back out of the offer, as well. 

I'm incredibly torn. This subreddit really helped with my last time around, so I'm hoping some new Reddit insight will help me again. (I've talked with friends and they are equally torn. Money, man, money.)"

Last year I accepted a promotion that came with a significant pay bump. After months of saving, I found an apartment that would allow me to live decently and within a budget I created around my new salary.

I’d heard talk that my company’s upper management wanted me to take a supervisory role for our worst department. The position is known for its turnover rate and for being the managers’ punching bag due to unrealistic KPIs that haven’t been met in nearly 3 years. Knowing what was to come, I quietly started sending out external job applications.

Now, less than a week before moving, my superiors sprang an ultimatum on me: take the shitty supervisor position, or get demoted to my old role with a $25k pay cut. 

I cant afford living in the new place with such a decrease in pay, but I also know exactly what’s coming to me if I allow myself to get sucked into this other position. I’ve been given a few days to make my choice.

Shortly after my conversation with them, I received an invitation for an interview with one of my top external picks. Normally I get anxious about job interviews, but considering my current circumstances I’m freaking out more than ever.

Any advice to help me keep a cool head and ace the interview would be immensely appreciated. If I stay with my current company, my quality of life is going to drastically decrease one way or the other.

TL;DR: need to not freak out over job interview to avoid either starving or being forced into an unhealthy work environment"

If I end up being offered the job, should I try to negotiate for higher pay?",u/blueskyn01se,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/108ojxq/this_morning_i_agreed_to_let_a_recruiter_submit/,jobs,"At 11:30 this morning I had a phone call with a recruiter who had reached out to me on LinkedIn about a position that I seemed like a great fit for. Well, I’m inclined to believe her about being a great fit, because it’s now 5pm and I’ve been contacted by 5 different recruiters today who wanted to represent me for this exact same position. I’ve thanked them all for reaching out and informed them that I have already been submitted for the position, not thinking much of it until just a few minutes ago when I was contacted yet again. 

But this recruiter actually included details about pay rate, and to my surprised she is quoting over $6 more an hour than the recruiter who has already submitted me. 

I don’t know what to do with this! I know that I can’t change my mind and go with this new recruiter now. I know it’s extremely unprofessional to do something like that, and that my resume is likely to be thrown out by the client if they see me being submitted twice by two different recruiters.

But, the difference in offered pay here is substantial enough that I feel like I shouldn’t just ignore it. 

Let’s say that everything goes great and I end up being offered this job. Would I be in a position to try and negotiate for more than the $32/hr I was submitted at? If I do try to negotiate, should I bring up that I was offered more by another recruiter as part of my justification, or should I not talk about that? Is there at all a risk of the client redacting their job offer because I tried to get a higher pay rate? Would it be best to just take the $32/hr and keep my mouth shut?

I have never negotiated before and would really appreciate any advice. Thank you!"

5,2023-01-10,Job lied about everything...,u/Nyxandnott,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/108qr2j/job_lied_about_everything/,jobs,"So, I just finished grad school in December, I had gotten my MSLIS (Masters of Library and Information Sciences) and after months of searching and trying to get out of the miserable job I had previously, and after a strenuous job search, I had gotten a job offer I was genuinely excited about. I was working in customer service, and I was led to believe that I would now move into something I could use my master's degree for. I don't want to give away the company, but it is a major retailer in travel junctions in North America. When I was given the offer, I was told that I would be working on my own, in my own office, in charge of researching items for the stores and getting into contact with other companies about said items to be put into our stores. I was excited. I was still making hourly, but my hourly rate was almost twice what I was making at my previous position, and I was overtime eligible. I thought that things were finally coming up.   
However, when I arrive on the first day, I introduce myself to the HR representative (different from the HR rep I had been using as a point of contact, she was on vacation at the time).  She proceeds to give me the retail uniform and give me a rundown on best customer service practices. I was confused. I restated that I was told my position would not be on the floor. The HR rep says ""oh we have to give you the uniform, and this is just in case we're completely swamped and need you."" I was definitely suspicious at this point but proceeded anyway. My previous job was so miserable, and I was just happy to do something new. I did two days of training at a different location that wasn't the one I'd be working at, and it was with other people who were doing the role I would be doing. I asked them about the uniform and the rundown I got, which they stated that 'oh yea everyone gets that, but don't worry, you're not gonna do any of that.' I had learned a lot those days I was training and I was excited again. I couldn't wait!    
Cut to yesterday (Monday), I get to the location I am working at for the first time, I introduce myself, and my boss (who I'm meeting for the first time) explains to me how to cash in and out my register, how to treat customers, gives me the rundown of all the pricing information and deals we're running and reminds me that tomorrow to be in uniform or else I'd get a write-up. I was in complete shock at this point. I tell him the role I was offered, he proceeds to tell me ""I hate that corporate doesn't tell me anything, but that position doesn't exist in this location, we need you as an associate.""  
I cannot tell you how miserable I am. I emailed my HR contact, who is still on vacation and not reach out to me until she returns. I emailed the other HR rep I talked to, the GM of the company in my area, and even the other people I trained with. I haven't heard from any of them as I write this. I was legit on the brink of tears both days I was there.  
I just don't know what to do. I don't even want this other position anymore, and I don't give a singular fuck about retail. I can't bring myself to be friendly and happy. I need a job and income, but this is ruining my mental health. I would not have left my other job had I known that this would happen job hunting has been so stressful and I'm pissed off to have to do it again. I don't know what to do, and any advice or suggestions would be helpful.

Quick Edit: something I should’ve specified. I am leaving this job. But I’m conflicted whether I should leave and be unemployed for an unknown period of time, or suck it up and work until I find another position. I’m in a fortunate position where if I were unemployed for a little bit, I could still manage, but I don’t know how long a job search would take.

Update: I don’t know if anyone is really following this post, but, there is a good ending! 
Through some people I know, they called in some favors to help me get a temporary position for a couple months as an assistant while I look for a new job. I’m going in today for my last day just to pick up my paycheck (first check is physical… of course…) and then immediately leaving. I start this new temporary position Monday. Thank you guys for all the advice."

My “red flags” were already up before that but I decided to do the interview to see where it goes. I knew not to give away too much information about myself.

I'll get straight to the point - my entire resume is built on Customer Service and for the last 3.5 years I've worked customer service but at a start up which meant wearing a LOT of hats. This included some things I've come to realize I love doing. 

But the job title that I had at the start up was a Operations Specialist (super vague) and the job position with the stuff that I LOVED doing is listed below as Operations Associate.

 Is there a better title for that type of position? I feel like I'm running in circles trying to find more indepth Customer Service / Customer Success positions on Indeed, Angel and Linkedin and I would LOVE to be in more of an indepth position as below. Is this futile or am I looking in the wrong places? Wrong titles? I feel like I'm losing my mind. 

The thing is I loved doing stuff thats listed below - which I did at the last start up I worked at:

* Running the behind-the-scenes actions for every merchant campaign that we launch — you’re the first line of defense for operational excellence
* Investigating and resolving transaction discrepancies from our issuer partners
* Building out and/or improving our process documentation — people compliment you on how easy it is to follow your instructions
* Pitching in on reporting and analytics requests — you know how to throw together charts and can quickly spot patterns
* Monitoring incoming transactions for fraud and running follow-up processes

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of weeks ago, I applied for another job that offers more money than I make at my current work. It wasn't planned, but given that my current employer screwed me with the yearly bonus and doesn't plan to give me a raise in the near future, I decided to check for other options.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a QA engineer, and it's not my first time seeking a job. Still, I never suspected that getting a job could imply four interviews with different people and a test assignment that seems more like completing a whole project.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I passed all the interviews, and they seemed happy with the testing results, but after the last interview, I was asked to bring my previous three paystubs since they needed additional information before giving me a final answer. When I asked what they were looking for and told them no previous employer had asked for such data, the HR said it's common practice and told me they couldn't take me in without them.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want them to know how much I earn with my current firm, and I said I'd send the pay stubs partially blacked out, but I got a """"Why? Do you have something to hide?"""".

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not against showing them, though it seems weird. The issue is that despite those four meetings, we haven't discussed my wage yet. Whenever I tried raising the money topic, they switched the subject to my skills and professional aspirations.

&amp;#x200B;

I told a few friends about it, but none of them had heard of such a practice. Finally, a former colleague advised me to use a [paystub generator](https://www.thepaystubs.com/) and fill the income fields with the desired salary so they'd offer me better pay. He says they may need my pay stub data to ensure they don't overpay me.

&amp;#x200B;

Did anyone go through something like this? Should I show my pay slips or better search for other job options?"

I’m curious and eager to learn and expand my work experience as well as really responsible and ready to take a job seriously.

First job: 4 months( only took it cause I have no other opportunity and hated it)

Second job(currently): 1 year (love what I do)

Was thinking of staying at my job for another 6 months- 1 year. I do have a valid reason for leaving and it is justifiable in a interview 

I have two questions:

1. Would leaving a job after 1.5-2 years look bad on my resume? I just don't wanna look like a job hopper. As I'm early in my career I rather not make stupid mistakes.

2. I really want to remove that 4 month experience from my resume and just ignore it, it really holds no benefits in terms of what I learned and am doing. And I feel doesn't really indicate my circumstances at the time. Just wondering since I have applied to a lot of company's before if they will notice that it is gone now.

So the OP stated that it was an issue, and he wasn't sure how to deal with the situation. I am posting under a different subreddit as I find the other subreddit full of hatred. It is only my opinion. But it is like, if you see someone wearing a costume from another country, and someone else screams, CULTURAL MISAPPROPRIATION!! And you hear the word ""gay"", and say that it is HOMOPHOBIA!! Then it only shows that one does not have an understanding of other cultures, and what sexuality is all about. Again the need to squash all the discussions about someone saying that someone else could be gay (which can be true! Because I am myself part of the LGBTQ+ community, and I cannot care less about what others say about me, I actually prefer having open discussions about this topic) is only showing that you are homophobic. Because you want to avoid all of the discussions about something that is normal, and point out that saying something about a gay person is not right. This is only going to cause a greater divide between people with different sexual orientations, instead of accepting it as something that can be expressed. For example, when someone says, oh why wear a floral dress, flowers are so ugly! You can laugh about it, as it is part of the normal things that you can talk about, that is flowers. But totally removing that from the conversations, about this topic, is not creating the positive influence of how to accept people of different sexual orientations at work. I think reddit used to be a good place where people could discuss things. But I now have many doubts and I think this is the last thing that I would say before I quit reddit!!"

Should I continue contact?,u/mystic11z,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1091o1v/state_mental_authority_sends_a_dead_email_and/,jobs,"Let me start that I am in the in the currently dumpster truck fire that is the mental health field right now. 
I applied for the only authority in my state that addresses adolescent mental health. It honestly is exactly what I need for my degree and experience with them offering internships and experience with highly educated professionals along with qualifying for a chunk of my degree to be paid. 
Hopefully, I'm painting to picture that this is a big company that is respected and takes all the mental health contracts of adolescents in my state.

So I applied for a position, and the interview went amazing. She said word for word ""If I could give you a job offer right now I would"" and told me when the next new hire training was.The only thing needed was for my references to be called and I go to a interview were I basically explored the different levels of care (I enjoy working with the most intense clients ranging from physical violence to self harm, trauma is my degree wheelhouse) so I could decide what intensity I wanted to join. 
She asked me to email her my references via a very company looking email, and it's dead. It sends it back to me saying the email could not be completed. I tried three different emails and the same thing. I also need to be boosted for this position, so I immediately do so. Naturally, I have a reaction the next day and call her to reschedule my in-house interview (which she herself said was easy and could be done whenever). No answer, so I leave a message and also call the front desk. 
A month goes by (this was the week of December 11th), and I hear nothing. I call two more times, leaving messages and explaining everything. Radio silence. 
I finally get a message via Indeed on the 6th. That's pretty much, ""Oh hey, weren't you supposed to come in for an interview on x day?"" Mind you, I had sent a message about the broken email and everything, and it was ignored. I repeated myself again about the email and lack of response. Nothing back

Should I even continue pursuing this avenue? I have a fair amount of experience in the field and have other interviews set up. This job just would have been wonderful for my career. I also can not burn this bridge because, as I said, they are the ONLY ones that take adolescent mental health contracts in my state."

Without going into too much detail, the reason I describe myself as a generalist is - I've had different roles throughout my career, and have been fairly successful at each. I have a lot of skills, but seemingly none that recruiters, interviewers, or business owners, deem as transferrable to any next tangible position; seemingly because I lack the required number of years spent in one role.

I spent the last six months applying to jobs, after being laid off from my previous position (company downsizing). Even if I get a reply, or an interview, I never get a call back. I almost feel like I need to apologize for my professional progress, and not spending enough years in one role to be deemed hirable for the next one. This is just how my life and professional career progressed - I should not apologize for it.

Same time last year, I thought ""How cool is that? A year ago I didn't know how to do *thing x*, and now I have all this knowledge about it! I feel like I can do almost anything?!"". Nowadays, though, empirically, I feel like the current job market and the whole socio-economic climate is rigged against me, as a job seeker who happens to be a generalist.

Like a lot of people who consider themselves as a generalist, I was raised and educated by the internet. I have a master's degree that didn't translate to anything. I started at the bottom of customer support, pushing my career to project manager, UX/UI designer, all the way up to a lead position in QA, and had to learn all of that while doing the job I was hired for. No, I don't have twelve years experience in *thing y*. I spent my time learning HTML in between writing emails in customer support. I spent my time learning design in Figma in between writing a project scope for that next big feature. I learned JavaScript while doing manual QA for a SaaS. So why is my drive unnoticed? Why are those skills untransferable for that next job?

I am burnt out from applying. I feel the whole system is rigged against me, but if I don't put myself out there, my chances of landing my next challenge are nil. The job market, in all my ten years of tangible professional experience, has never been worse. Just like my anxiety and worry about the future.

I do not have the kind of money to use as runway to set up a business of my own. I have thought about that.

I sometimes wonder if this is one of those situations where I have to ask myself ""If everyone thinks I'm not hirable, and I'm the only one that thinks I am, does that mean that I'm indeed not hirable?"". Is it my approach? Is it my resume? Is it the way I interview with people? All of the above? What does it take to get hired these days?

So, reddit, what do people in my position do? I appreciate you reading my post and venting."

My question is essentially as stated in the title, does the type of degree matter really when looking for a job? I have experience as a junior business analyst and would like to move to higher positions, but I'm more into theology and soft sciences than mathematics. Not that I'm bad at it, but in terms of study and my long-term plans I'm looking to get a BA in either theology or religious studies, and eventually to get a Doctorate in Theology, but in the interim I need a job that pays a fairly high amount of money to fund my projects. 

So, if any recruiters are hanging around here, I'd especially like your input in terms of what companies are really looking for in degrees for the 85k+ region salaries, whether it's just the piece of paper no matter what the major, or if there's some sort of preference in these higher paying job spheres for specific majors. If you happen to what sort of jobs there are for those going into the major I am that pay the amount I'm looking for, that'd be even more helpful!

Thanks in advance!"

I crack jokes as well and it makes my job even more fun. But the downside is that the pay is garbage. I am just barely getting by. I have become attached to my coworkers . Everyone treats me so kind.

So far I received 1 job offer from company A. It’s a good place to work but i was leaning more towards another company B and was hoping to get an offer with them.


This week company B will check my references and, quoting the HR person, “Ultimately you’ll be receiving an offer pending the referrals. It’s just part of the process but we fully intend on making you the offer.” I also wanted to be transparent and told them that I received an offer from company A. 


However, company B pays $3K less than company A. But they interest me more so I wanted to negotiate a salary once I receive the offer.


3K isn’t a big difference but I’ve also never had experience negotiating salary so I wanted to hear about some good/effective ways of doing that. + see what should I do in the case that they won’t agree to match the salary

1,2023-01-11,Feeling Used at Work and Need Help Articulating to My Supervisor,u/Abaconings,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1098bjr/feeling_used_at_work_and_need_help_articulating/,jobs,"So I work in a large company that is creating a whole new department. I was hired as the first person to work in this department. I have nearly 2 decades of experience and a couple of advanced degrees. In fact, my experience and credentials are more than those of the 2 people in the other dept combined. 

So I let the corporate people know a process wasn't working. A meeting was called. We discussed the negative ramifications and a solution was agreed upon. After that, apparently a person (one of 2 from the other dept) decided to change the agreed upon process. Met individually with everyone except me and rolled out their preferred version of the change that did not address the initial problem. So I'm irritated. Then I'm told I'll be asked for input from time to time going forward but I'm not going to be invited to any meetings discussing new processes for the Department in which I'm the only employee. Reason given - because they are developing it for other markets. However, they are using my work to do this. 

I'm expected to develop processes on my own and then give those to the other team for them to ""develop nationwide "" I feel as though I'm being used and getting no pay or recognition for my development work. 

I'm not sure how to articulate this to my supervisor."

Nothing happened tho. I never got a call or anything. Yesterday, I called the original one and told them my mistake and they said they’d send my application to the correct one but I still have not received a call.

This was mainly a shower thought. Someone works at Job A but lands a position at Job B. They tell the boss of Job B that they need two weeks before they start. They work the two weeks at Job A without giving the boss notice and go on like everything is normal. Then that last day (be it day fourteen or sooner) you ACTUALLY quit or stop showing up altogether, knowing good and well you have the new job to hop right into.

Personally I'm a firm believer of the 'effective date' rather than suffering for one more pay period but if you're trying to finesse one last paycheck I don't care if it's 14 days or 5. Has this happened to y'all?"

I hate going into an office. I hate being bound to a certain location. I hate having to work and have breaks when others tell me and not when I want. I hate having to commute even if it's only a short ride with public transportation. I hate needing to get dressed a certain way. I hate having to conversate with people I don't care about. I hate not having my own bathroom. I hate having to share the space with others. I hate not being able to wear a mask because no one else does. I hate not being able to travel to wherever and work from there for a week.

Working remotely does absolute wonders for my mental health. I'd rather take a pay cut than go into an office.

But I also know that only choosing full remote jobs hurts my career prospects and my growth, especially because I'm only a recent graduate and I don't work in tech (but my field is still computer based and rarely requires meeting people physically)."

It's an hour away through back highways that may not have the best snow maintenance (I'm in southern Ontario) but offers 1 day remote after training. It's also an $ 11,500 pay increase. there is upward momentum to the marketing or sales department (I would prefer the marketing department because I'm sick of sales)  

These are the benefits they're offering

RRSP Matching (you mean I may actually get to retire?!?), Benefits Package, Profit Sharing (I don't even know what this means lol, never had it before), Performance Bonus, Yearly Attendance Bonus (yuck, I don't agree with attendance bonuses because our health is important but it's sad that I would get this, I haven't been sick in 4 years), Office Clothes Allowance twice a year, Company Social Events (I do love free food)

I just had a preliminary phone interview with their HR &amp; it went really well. I have a full interview coming up.

I would be supporting their inside sales &amp; marketing department. My background is admin so if they're willing to train, I'm willing to learn. 

Do you think it's worth it? I'm a bit scared to go so far outside my comfort zone. all I keep thinking of is the drive, the gas, the 2 hours I'm losing a day, the fact that there is so much of the job I don't know (but can learn) 

I don't like to count my chickens before they hatch but I need a job lol. I'm also interviewing next week for a small office doing what I had done previously for 5 years. I wouldn't need training and can walk to work (it's a long walk but doable) but they didn't tell me what the wage was so I'm guessing between $15.50 (min wage)- $18/hr tops, the last place I worked at doing that job paid just over minimum wage which was around $12 at the time &amp; my only wage increases came when min wage increased (2015-2020)."

For context: I live in Ohio. My previous two jobs were in small restaurants, my specific duties being cleaning and washing dishes. At my most recent job I threw the chicken in the fryer a lot but aside from that it was the same duties.
My new job is at a fast food chain restaurant. I was told I’d be on fries. I was asked to get a work permit, so I did.
So now I’m wondering- was I illegally working at my previous two jobs? If not my first job, at least my most recent? Because my most recent and new jobs have similar duties when it comes to fryers."

Two weeks ago today I followed up regarding a position I interviewed for. For reference, this is from a smaller, less corporate company. The hiring manager apologized that she hadn't reached out because all the higher ups were away for the holidays and that they needed to iron some stuff out (compensation, etc.) and was promised that she will reach out ASAP once she heard from her bosses.

Unfortunately, I haven't heard anything two weeks later, which is obviously not a good sign.  I know I'm not owed anything, but they way her response was worded towards me sounded like she would let me know regardless. 

My question. I guess it's time to move on. I know following up again will not change the decision, but all I want is official closure. Should I follow up, if so when? 

thanks guys! job searching is such an emotional rollercoaster :( 

Not to mention my computer crashed that had all my resumes saved. I had plans to send off more resumes this morning and I'm dealing with this garbage."

I have recently accepted a dream position of mine in my community. The schedule works to be all day Sunday, Tuesday, and Wednesday as that is when they need help. 

Problem is: the salary does not pay what I am needing it to. In fact it is only about half of my income. I need to find a way to meet budget during this time. This dream job should lead to full time in about a year. So, I need to find a part time job that I can work to hopefully make the rest of my income (about $30,000)

I have googled and googled this problem but am coming up short. Would you have any recommendations of something I could do part time during this year to help makes ends meet and comfort to my wonky schedule?

Thanks!"

I’ve had 3 desk jobs at this point and I’ve quit each of them on the basis of it destroying my mental health. Even serving drunk people at 2am felt better than this.

In the end, the hiring manager seemed nice and was happy to invite onto his team.

I would like some input as a way to better prepare myself as I am a bit worried of this “observation period” / “probation period”. Researching online this is a common thing, but I’m starting to contemplate if I should go further as this is the first time I’m hearing this.

I have a very hard time with job interviews because I don't feel like I'm particularly good at anything special. I feel intimidated by HR and managers that come to interviews. I had a basic office job and before that I worked retail. I didn't feel happy in any of them and I just want to make money to survive I guess. 

I send my resume to jobs that don't require any special skills but I still get rejected. Probably because many people apply. 

Last week HR manager reached out to me because they wanted me to fill some kind of personality test. Questions included things like ""how much do you agree with this statement"" for example ""do you think your supervisor is always right no matter what"". They rejected me yesterday just based on this personality test, which felt unfair but okay. The job looked perfect for me and I had experience in the industry (translation agency). I felt sad :(

1,2023-01-11,Internal transfer and resignation advice,u/Eggsformeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/109eljd/internal_transfer_and_resignation_advice/,jobs,"I was informally offered two internal jobs: 
- a job that would be a promotion in my current office 
- a job that would be considered an internal transfer but is in a different office than my current office 

The offers were informal because in our office paperwork moves extremely slowly so offer letters take several months to get approved. They let you know they plan to offer to you whenever they make the initial selection and start the offer letter process (yes, it’s the worst). 

To further lengthen the process, both offers requested an increase in pay. In our office, these requests have to be sent up the chain for further approval using form X. Once my current office realized I had another offer, they asked me to pick which “form X” I wanted to continue to processing because the approval body wouldn’t know which one to approve or deny. They would pull theirs if I chose the transfer. I felt uncomfortable telling them which form X to “keep” because I didn’t have a formal offer letter. 

To avoid giving basically an informal notice of resignation, I skipped up the chain to tell the person who would need to approve the forms my situation, told them which job I planned to take (the transfer),and they were responsive. Unfortunately, that person then told my current management my decision and they announced it at their manager meeting and then posted my job online so my entire team can see. 

I haven’t heard of what the timeline is for receiving an offer letter from the transfer position I planned to choose, but they continue to assure me that everything is on track. Obviously I don’t want to submit my notice formally because of my lack of an offer letter. 

Am I protected since I haven’t submitting anything in writing? I feel incredibly vulnerable and resent that I was pushed into this situation. I’m in TX, USA. 

(Side note: I reached out to our HR and they were not helpful. Our HR isn’t internal like most jobs as they operate as a part of a larger agency.)"

1) Send letter of resignation to HR + boss over email with an offer to set up a time to speak about the transition over the phone with boss. This makes it so I don’t blindside my boss. I doubt there’s a need for transition conversation though since I’ve been on leave and not in office as it is. 

or

2. Ask my boss for a phone call or zoom, tell him that I’m resigning in that call, then follow up with the formal letter over email to him and HR. This is the way that I’ve read is most professional, but I feel like it can kind of catch my boss off-guard and may be harder to arrange due to the work trip and timezone difference. It allows me to explain myself more which is a plus but also I’m more flustered about it."

I’m a senior in college and just landed a really good job! Of course I had to submit a background check and I have no criminal record or anything like that but on my resume I did notice I left that I had a minor in finance but I dropped the minor for the time being so I could graduate a little sooner(my major is supply chain management) and I was wondering, when they check my education can they rescind the offer due to the “minor” mishap?"

I've done retention, sales, customer service etc. I've always excelled at sales and honestly its hurting me getting promoted.

They never want to take me off the floor due to high productions and it's getting old. I've had plenty of them assign me a team lead responsbilities, call coaching, traning, calling irate manager calls back etc. doing all the work but none of the pay and somehow made me squeeze it in between my normal calls and duties. I left those jobs due to nepotisim and no promotions or raises in sight.

My new job is amazing, I love the people, the culture the atmosphere, They are queer and trans friendly which is huge since I am nonbinary and don't use him/her pronouns. 

The first month on the floor out of training I beat their current reigning champs booking numbers. I'm a top agent here also. 

I've applied to a lead position making about 10k more but the promotions seem to cap there basically due to everyone above being in long term positions, I don't forsee a shakeup soon, however we are a constantly growing company and brand new positions have popped up here and there. I was still a little green and can see why they overlooked me but i had been a strong canidate from what the bosses told me. 

I had attendance issues due to illness  and have too many points to apply for the promotions they just shot out for january, unlikely more will open up with out a major manager shift or change up.
This is the only job I've ever worked where doctors notes don'ts excuse an absence. 

So to try and make this shorter, My dilemmia is I've probably missed out on promotions for the year barring a miracle opens up. (worried my production is too good to get me off the phones again...) 

I've thought about taking college business classes here and try for an AA or  BA in business.
I have tons of experience enough to be a manager with no actual titled manamgent position.I'm sick of being on the main phones and have more than enough skill and drive to be  great in management. I'm just at a loss of how to get there.

I need to make more money period. I did 50k last year and I want far more 65-100k  on salary.

Do I get some classes under my belt and continue this job and hope a position become available this year or try for next year? but them be stuck in a possibly further promotion rut

Or should I start applying for managerial positions now? This is concerning for me since queer inclusivity and WFH are incredibly hard to find in my experience."

Do I have a leg to stand on here?,u/shannont1993,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/109i1zn/tips_for_negotiating_a_salary_raise_do_i_have_a/,jobs,"Hi there, hoping for some tips on how to approach this subject with my direct and HR managers. I’m generalizing for privacy purposes but for reference, I work for a major corporation and am based in NY. 

I was hired by Corporation in early 2021 with a salary of $85,000/year. The range was not public at the time of being hired and I reached this number with a recruiter. Coming from a nonprofit, it was more than I ever anticipated to make, and negotiations were quick, but in hindsight I think I was naive to accept without doing more research.

At the time of being hired, I was part of a team of 8, all with the same manager. Between my hire date and today, 6 of these team members have left the business (through layoffs or personal career moves), leaving the work to be managed by just our manager and myself. My workload literally quadrupled, but I have received great feedback on what I’ve accomplished.

My manager is now hiring a third person to our team, mostly for this workload management. They explained that the new hire would technically be a replacement for one of the former team members (someone who sat at a leadership level between myself and my manager), and offered me the role if i was interested. I declined, because it’d be primarily customer facing and i prefer working with employees, however my manager assured me that they just had to give the job a title and description, and realistically the 3 of us would be dividing work equally the same way free two of us had been.

When the job posting went live, I noticed that other than being listed as mid-senior level (a step above where I currently sit, but lower than anticipated considering the level the former employee had reached), the posting was literally the same as what was used for my position, including the requirements (which i meet) and duties/responsibilities. The only difference was that the title was listed as customer facing vs internal. A salary range of $125,000-$170,000 was included at the bottom.

Knowing that the corporation can afford to pay the new hire 50%-100% more than what I’m currently making is really frustrating, especially considering that the laying off of my previous team members was financially motivated. Also, because my manager said we will all be splitting the work equally regardless of title or seniority level. It may also be worth mentioning that we have not received salary increases or bonuses for the two years I’ve been here. 

Does anyone have tips on approaching this subject with my manager or HRM? Is there anything I can do to try and match my salary to the new hire’s? I know my manager is desperate which probably explains part of it, but I don’t feel that it’s fair for me to help train the new hire and do equal amounts and types of work to them if they are being paid double what I am."
1,2023-01-11,Asking for referral from someone you interviewed with?,u/glizzygladiator34,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/109i5pp/asking_for_referral_from_someone_you_interviewed/,jobs,A few months ago I interviewed at a Big 4 firm and after 5 interviews and a technical interview I didn't end up getting the job.  The final round interview with a senior manager and an interview with a Managing Director went extremely well though and I just saw another position I'm interested in open up at the company.  Would it be stupid to ask one of those people that I interviewed with for a referral?  I obviously don't know them well but thought I might have made a good impression on them and would just message one of them on LinkedIn.

1,2023-01-11,what is everyone's recommendation for a job searching platform?,u/ZOhM_GEE,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/109isjk/what_is_everyones_recommendation_for_a_job/,jobs,"I have been searching for a new job for almost a year at this point. I have applied to literally (not figuratively) hundreds of jobs over that time; some of these I was overqualified for and some of them were fever dreams to hope for with everything in between.

During this time, I have had experiences with many platforms, but the top three obviously glass door, indeed, and linkedin. These are widely considered to be the best in business for job boards, but I beg to differ. Glassdoor has had some pretty solid filtering over all, but I've run into more scam postings than I can count that are some of the most brazen attempts at identity theft I've ever seen. Indeed usually seems legit enough provided I can find an appetizing listing amongst the dung mountain that is sponsored jobs (looking at you trucking gigs). Lastly, LinkedIn is a system that is plagued by sales positions that try to use fancy wording to jid what they are. This isn't even mentioning that the platform that's supposed to be a professional social media doesn't seem to have any profile verification; they're as scam ridden as the others.

So my question is this: what platform would you say is the best of bad options when it comes to job hunting.
What is the least of many evils?"

I am wondering on which one I should take? 

The first job offered me a higher salary than what I had asked for. (I probably low balled myself). The first company seemed very stringent she asked me for an example report and referees that were direct managers and she asked a lot of questions. I’m shocked they offered me a position tbh. The office is further away 30mins but they are hybrid/ flexible. She seems nice too. 

The role I’m interviewing for tomorrow, I’ve interviewed with them before but decided to take another role. I feel bad to cancel because they seem really really nice and chilled out. They were excited to interview me. But I know the salary would be a lot lower say 15K lower. The office is closer to home.

What should I do?

What questions should I ask prior to accepting the role?

After the first interviews, I was tied on which job I wanted. After the second, there's one I want and the other I know I don't. Both have equal pay. Both are four days a week. 

The first job, the job I want, is 32 hours but the pay is such that I would make what I'm making now just working less (which is what I want since I am also going to school full time). After the second interview for the first place, I shadowed for two hours. I know I'll love it. 

The second job is 40 hours and since it pays more than my current job I would make more money but not enough to overlook the things I dislike. The second interview consisted of the team interviewing me. I feel like what I found out would make me not want it. It sounds exhausting and I'm not really interested in ""wearing many hats"" and ""needing to hit the ground running.""  In addition, I do not like the parking situation - I think it truly sucks. it would bother me so much every day to have to deal with it.

The second place will get back to me tomorrow. The first will get back to me early next week. I hope I hope I hope I get the first job. If the second place wasn't supposed to get back to me tomorrow, I'd probably withdraw. Honestly I'm so tired of applying and interviewing. It's so hard to interview while working full time and now that school has started for the semester, it will be even harder."

Long story short I absent-mindedly peed about 30 mins before the test (I was in college and never had a real job), and so when it was time for me to take it I couldn't pee (obviously) and they only gave me 30 minutes to produce. The nurses there were impatient and started pressuring/insulting me, which made it worse and so the time ran out and I lost the job.

Fortunately I was able to produce for the next job I got, but it was incredibly stressful and I had a lot of trouble with it. I'm now interviewing for jobs that pay significantly more than my current one, and my biggest fear is receiving an amazing offer and then losing it (and being unemployed) because I couldn't pee at the right time. 

With all that said, I'm wondering if I can call a health clinic somewhere and just ask to pay for my own urinalysis— just for the sake of practice. I know I can practice at home, but I'd like to actually practice with a real drug test just to instill some confidence in myself. Is this possible?"

Here's everything that led to that mess. One was so me and my mom worked at the same job. My mom is homophobic somebody said they liked girls the manager and another manager wasn't upset that the other manager was gay so my mom quit the next day. What happened after that was hell for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This started dec26th. So i took my mom's schedule and my schedule which means I worked 10 days straight on the busiest week at Taco bell on short staff everybody went to Denny's. So I had days I was short one or two people and busy crowds at the same time. I was fine with this even though I got no breaks it was ok. It was just so I have a past. My last job I was used to the bone made them 3 million in a year and was left three weeks with no work never putting me in a department that had work. After working my butt off and having terrible results for a job I had been doing well I stopped caring never again did I ever care about a job I got hired at and I really busted any sense of giving a care in the job after that where I got the same message if you try you are hated and they don't want you there kind of thing. Because as a person they don't like you. This was right before the pandemic 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I tapped out for like 3 year on unemployment for. Most of it then as an independent contractor for phone sex work which is a lot better because I don't have a boss's hating my butt.i got hired at Taco bell when my mom did. I worked part-time part-time worked for me somewhat but I came on with the baggage of not giving a dang so I didn't learn the menu or really remember anything.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 In fact I wasn't really supposed to get this job. The thing is drug addicts tend to benefit me. Because when I came to get the application an employee saw me get the application on the table. I came in there a mess bald headed no shower and I barely had clothes on pretty much looking like a vagabond. The thing was the employee is a heroin addict and I guess didn't have good memory? Because I went in for my interview a month later and they were there and said nothing to hiring managers despite having to get the people to.interview me which landed me the job. So I went into this literally not giving a care.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 In fact I was going to quit a week later but just ended up late. Anyway so the night shift I worked with generally the woman didn't like me or my mom off of basically looks some people assume if you're black you Like other black people even though her man was related to me she had some animus to both me and my mom. So for me it persisted because I'm younger my mom is near 50. It got worse and worse. I ignored it up until new years Sunday I couldn't take working with her again. Like she wuld stand the staring menacingly at me for no reason and spreading rumors about me and what not Looking for a problem

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Specifically after having 10 strenuous days of work in a row. And problems from everyone. What I mean by problems before all of this on the Friday before Christmas I had everyone in the kitchen cursing yelling screaming at each other to the point I had to stay in the bathroom for thirty minute the shift lead that day was high as a kite telling the people I'm trying to get their orders done in the lobby to get fuck out of his lobby. This is the same man who would bang the counter if a drive thru person could hear him and would scream ""I CANT DO THIS ANYMORE!!!  From the back scaring the customers in the lobby. This was all ok when it was just weekend comedy but having to deal with that and a busy crew and his girl trying to start fights/arguments in a busy drive thru was way too much. I cared less about coming in and started getting ready later to get to work because it was a great ball of stress for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I had to quit the line on Tuesday last week when I had a long line of orders in the lobby and I had to go to the bathroom and have them wait because I was soo sick. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Then Wednesday I came in an hour and a half later because I was sick then had to go to the bathroom a lot indigestion was terrible. The general manager sent me home early because it was that bad. The day Wednesday he told I had to come in Friday in the morning less than 48 hours away. He was already mad I was late. And also added to this on Sunday that week I was in the middle of the night shift lady fighting me and he thought I yelled at him when I asked for a break when he told me I wasn't supposed to get a break because I came in only 10 min late

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

. So I had to be there on Friday in the morning. But I didn't get better over Thursday I just got sicker. And I have to move this week and they needed me to buy new jeans from be new jeans which was 150 dollars worth. I didn't have the money. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So on Friday I put on the crew app I was down I couldn't do it anymore how I felt at my last job and how I didn't want to end feeling that way about them that I was sorry and deleting the app and I was quitting.i put in there that my give a damn got busted at my old job and I didn't think it was ever coming back.  But my mother is still on their app she saw that my  message never made it through. Because of language. All I said was about my last job not giving a damn and how as a phone sex operator I got paid 300 to tell a man how to shoVE something up his butt and that it was easier than doing this as a crew member at the time. For reference I specifically told my manager this in person as well as the heroin addict I went more into detail with him actually then her. And they knew that's what my other job was because I live in the same complex as a guy that worked here he used to be my neighbor so he heard everything. So that in person was never inappropriate I mean these people would talk about being on only fans so I was really not trying to offend anyone I was just trying to be transparent as to why quitting would benefit me but it got deleted by the generator before any managers saw it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So I didn't know until Saturday my mom. Told me it just says I said something inappropriate but no one can see what I actually said. So I sent a text message through textnow sInce my phone was shut off to the general manager telling him my give a damn's been busted since 2019 I would over extend myself in ways back then I don't want to now I am only getting sicker can't pay 150 for clothing and am moving the following week. That I quit as of January 6 2023 the day before and now ii see it says I was fired the nexta day I have a screenshot showing I quit on the 7th can I show human resources that I quit the day before in writing? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And how could I possibly have quit in a better fashion not to make anyone angry? An try to fire me in retaliation? I mean before this week I was not at odds with the general manager at all things were good. It was just the ten days really wrecked me up especialy since. Had to work with the manager which mad it more visible she wanted me to change my outfits shoes etc.....

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For some context, I’ve been working here for 5 months and we will call this coworker D so I don’t give out names. D was pretty cool at the start and he did his work like he should. Over time D has gotten very lazy and very rude as he’s called me and a few other coworkers slurs. D also gotten creepy towards the girls I work with like flirting with them and getting really close to them and even asking one of them to get in his car after closing. Recently my old shift leader quit for a higher paying job, D would only listen to him and he talks back if me or another shift leader asks him to do something or a needed task as we are both afternoon and night workers. I’ve reported him to the managers about his behavior and they give him a slap on the wrist every time. I really do love everyone I work with but D makes me wanna quit but I don’t wanna leave the people there with him. Whenever I close with D, D sits in the back and is on his phone even if I ask him to put the dishes up front or help mop. I don’t know what I should do. My original plan was if he doesn’t stop being calling me slurs or being rude then I leave but it’s turned into so much more than that. What should I do?

Edit: thank you everyone❤️ I wish I could pay you guys back for encouraging me to leave an abusive place. I love doing the whole coffee thing and making people drinks so I might apply to Starbucks, I heard the one in my town has very nice staff and management. Thank you❤️"

Before that I was at my previous employer for over a decade so grabbed a huge pay jump and have lived a comfortable life since. I appreciate the path the organization is taking but it will take 6-9 months still for a product of focus to be market ready. 

A few weeks back I was contacted by a recruiter for a large organization that was a direct competitor of my previous employer. Because of my background and product knowledge, they mentioned that my salary ask (which was about 40K higher than the too of their range) would not be an issue. i have gone through 1 round of interviews and have the next one lined up.

Yearly reviews including salary increases are planned for March in my org and my salary ask at the other organization is about 17% higher than my current salary.

1. I realized I may have asked for too little at the interested organization. How do I bring up that I can’t burn bridges/quit for 17% and that I would need closer to a 30%?

2. How do I turn this interest into a higher salary increase in my current organization without having a written job offer yet? I also can’t stretch the interview process till March when reviews come around. Any salary increase will probably not be the same 17% if I don’t make them aware of a 3rd party interest"

Also, my employer posted my job position same day.

The job listing didn't say anything about the internship being at another company (although the company page in LinkedIn does describe the company as ""career development and placement company""). Currently, the job listing is closed.

I tried looking up the company in Glassdoor, but there were only 10-ish reviews, with the few negative reviews describing completely different experience from positive reviews.

Also, LinkedIn described the company as having 2-10 employees, which doesn't seem right together with the company's description of ""\[providing\] 1-1 training by an expert"".

I froze at some time but the interviewer smiled and assured me everything is okay (told him I just recovered from bird flu)

I mean, the interview did not cut short but usually if it’s good they would introduce me the flow? I’m not sure because I have had other interviews where they didn’t introduce me regarding the company at first interview, only fourth.

Currently. I am 23, unemployed and going pretty much nowhere. dreams unfulfilled and generally I suck. I have been applying for jobs but they either need experience. or they are shady as fuck. I have gotten a few interviews but have gone nowhere. I have recently been thinking about applying for an apprenticeship as a boilermaker. I know its a 4 year at TAFE, hard working job but i want to do something with myself. I figured Boilermaking as i enjoyed welding in metal class. I was ""Decent"" at welding. doing metal work as a class for 2 years. Despite the time since i last welded. I can still remember what to do. 

I'm at a point in my life where i need to be doing something. and it seems like not a bad career to get into. Pays good when you finish the 4 year.  there is a place nearby that is looking for a first year.

I just want to know if i'm too old to be doing an apprenticeship. 

Btw. I am Australian if that matters."

20,2023-01-12,How do I get past being fired and feeling worthless?,u/letsalljustdie,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/109uemp/how_do_i_get_past_being_fired_and_feeling/,jobs,"Backstory: raised in a cult with a toxic family. Went into business with toxic family, got taken advantage of and left it all behind in search of finding my own identity. 

Found what I thought was my dream job working for a couple who owns several companies and multiple locations in the pet industry. Even negotiated for higher pay for the admin assistant position. I was hired on the spot in front of potential coworkers. 

There was no training, just onboarding of HR handbook. I thought I was assisting the owner. Somehow I was assigned many different tasks with conflicting priorities attached to them from several different admins and the married owners. Many of the tasks assigned appeared to be dealing with contractors and handymen across multiple business locations. I didn’t ask questions, instead I completed as many tasks as possible. 
I thought I was doing well in that I received multiple compliments on different occasions from both owners, co workers, and multiple admins in regards to accomplishing tasks. 

4 weeks in, husband Owner suddenly started to tell me I was incorrectly prioritizing tasks and needed to consider “what would help the company gain or lose money.” I would complete the specific tasks he gave me first then continue working on the lower priorities in preparation for when they became higher priorities. 

6 weeks in I was suddenly fired because I had “a negative personality and was having a negative impact on the team and it wasn’t a good fit. I assigned myself tasks, disrespecting the owners, and acted as a manager rather than an admin assistant”?! I was shocked. None of it made sense to me. I felt completely torn down and misjudged. 

While working there as a new employee, I had no sick days or pto yet. During the 6 weeks though, everything outside of work went wrong. Every week something went horribly wrong-I had the flu, multiple UTIs, two family members die, my cat had a late night ER visit, then I got Covid.  Through all if this i kept working.  I didn’t stop. Maybe that made me come across “negative”?

Now I’m having trouble finding another job and I feel completely worthless. How do I find my self worth outside of a career or job? I can’t even sleep through the night without replaying the nightmare of being fired."

1,2023-01-12,Best way to go about...,u/Momentoftriumph,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/109wm07/best_way_to_go_about/,jobs,"A little background: So I've been at my new job for a little over a month (data management) I answer to the GM of the company, who is also relatively new. This is a new environment for me as I was at my former job for a long time. Coming from a large company to a small one, it seems very chaotic and a little disorganised. Maybe thats normal? I dont know.
It's a rapidly growing business and theres a lot of new people - my whole department all started at the same time. I'm finding it difficult to settle in amongst the chaos. It's a hybrid workplace, so people are often in and out of the office.

Anyway, my GM seems very keen to prove herself, and as such has delegated task time slots to each member of my department. That's fine, but apparently she doesn't want any of us working on the same task at the same time so has taken each task, and split it up into micro tasks, which makes absolutely zero sense to me. So, for example, from 10-12 i work on an allocated task, then at 12 i have to abandon the task and move to the next one, then someone else takes over the task i was previously doing. It's like stopping half way through something and passing it on to someone else and then starting something else that someone has started earlier and then abandoned. Its just not efficient at all, and I can't get a flow going. We're also trying to clear many months worth of backlog, and that is so hard to do when you have to keep stopping and starting, and trying to figure out where the previous person has left off. And, every time a time block ends, we have to email each other (CCing her) to tell everyone what task we're doing next. I don't feel like I'm explaining myself very well, but hopefully you get the gist.

I want to bring this to her attention, and propose a more efficient way of doing things, but not sure of the best way to do this without coming across like I'm undermining her. I am autistic, so can come across quite blunt without meaning to, and confrontation isnt my strongest suit, so need to plan my approach. The job could realistically be done by 1-2 people, and once the backlog is cleared, could definitely be done by a single person, so I dont want to talk myself out of a job. She's still learning also, so I need to cut her a bit of slack, but geeeeeez.

Any words of wisdom?"

I’m a recent graduate 23F and accepting a job offer 1 month after I completed my studies.

(Graduated from a Bachelor of Commerce; Major in Accounting and Minor in Statistics)

I’m working at a consulting firm as an Analyst. The initial offer was $50k (CAD) but I felt that was low and asked to discuss compensation and got it to $52.5K (CAD).


I’ve been working here for 2 months now and it’s semi-annual performance review time in January. I don’t know if I’m in a position to ask for a raise or negotiate salary.

One thing I did note was that a fellow coworker who was interviewed 2 weeks after me (same start date) was offered $52.5K starting salary without negotiating. He is a cis white man with an Economics degree.

I feel as though it was unfair that I was offered a lower salary (I’m a visible minority and don’t know if factors into it).

I’m located in ON (Canada) if that matters, but in general I feel as though the salary is poor. Okay benefits and good work environment otherwise.

Any advice would be helpful.

Thanks!

A few months later, in August, the CEO (this is a small company) asked me to move to a higher position. I didn't request a raise at that time since I had just gotten a raise two months prior. I spent a few months transitioning as they found and trained my replacement, so for much of that time I was kind of doing a job and a half. Also during that time, I was the main architect of a project that led to a huge contract. (I wasn't the sale person, I was the person who built out the actual product).

It's been 6 months since I've stepped into this role and I'm wondering if I can ask for a significant raise that reflects the promotion. I know 20% is a lot, and the new role isn't *that* much higher than my current, but I also think that I went above and beyond in terms of performance.

To be specific, I live in NYC and make 100k. My previous job title was Solutions Architect (although the functions were closer to something like a no-code developer) and my new title is Product Owner. I don't have prior Product experience."

I applied for a job a week prior to Christmas, and was immediately contacted for an over the phone interview the next day. The interviewer said that I should be reach out to towards the end of the same week. 

The end of the week comes and no contact. I emailed them to let them know that no one contacted me from the branch I applied for.

They follows up with me and apologizes, saying that it’s been a bit busy due to the holidays, which is fair. They said to let them know if I haven’t heard anything. I haven’t and I let them know

A few days after New Year’s, they replied and said that they’ll reach out to the branch by Friday if they didn’t message me on Thursday; if they haven’t, reach out to the recruitment team. 

I message them on last Thursday. And haven’t heard since. 

I am in need of a job, I’ve been unemployed for over half a year. My gut is telling me to reach out because maybe they haven’t seen my email, but if it’s like then if I work for them… oh boy."

I do admit it was unprofessional and left my current employer (healthcare not a nurse) in a bind because we were already short staffed. I was there for 5 months. 
I am applying for a job at a VA hospital so I am not sure if they just use the references you provide or do they contact your employers."
11,2023-01-12,Did I negotiate job offer too aggressively?,u/idriveawhitecamry,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10a2305/did_i_negotiate_job_offer_too_aggressively/,jobs,"Hey there,

I recently received an offer from a Fortune 500 company.  I am an embedded software engineer and I received an offer of 85k base in a medium cost of living area.  I am currently making 80k base as a new grad at another Fortune 500 company in a lower cost of living area, and have about a year and a half of experience.

&amp;#x200B;

I took the standard advice of negotiating 10-20% but the recruiter has not gotten back to me yet.  It hasn't been quite 24 hours yet.  How long should I expect to wait?  Growing a bit anxious about the possibility of the offer getting rescinded.  I asked for $98500 base assuming they would meet me in the middle at 93ish.  80k in my current area is equivalent to 91k in the new area based on a cost of living converter.  I'm just worried my initial counter put them off.  Should I be concerned?  This is a huge company in the top 50 on the Fortune 500 list."
2,2023-01-12,Has anyone heard of a 90/10 flexible time off benifit?,u/boobumblebee,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10a2nuf/has_anyone_heard_of_a_9010_flexible_time_off/,jobs,"In the process of interviewing, and they gave me a copy of their benefits and when I asked about their vacation/PTO policy, here's what I was given.

&gt;Flexible Time Off - It is the policy of [Buisness] to forego implementation of
a leave accrual or bank system of any sort. Eligible employees will be free to take
leave when they require it. At [Buisness] discretion, leave will be tracked
for business purposes (i.e.: attendance, resource planning, etc.). Employees will
be expected to maintain a 90/10 ratio (&amp;gt;90% working hours, &amp;lt;10% FTO hours).
Eligibility - All full-time employees with 90 days of continuous service are
considered eligible under this policy. A full-time employee works an average of
40 hours per work week.

I've never heard of something like this before, I guess to me it sounds like you basically earn 4 hours of 'flexible time off' for every 40  hours you work. 

Sounds pretty good to me, since my current job I only get 10 PTO days, moving up to 15 after 7 years."

My spidey senses noticed: 

1. Email is dry
2. Meetings are being canceled
3. Was encouraged to take a walk outside
4. I was surveyed about my position recently
5. I sit at my desk all day doing much of nothing.

The last time I was laid off I waited forever on unemployment.

Should I apply for unemployment again while looking for a new job or should I apply for a full time retail job so I don’t lose the amount of money I lost when I was waiting on unemployment.

Any advice? 

I have retail experience dating back to seven years ago. I didn’t want to go into retail again but I will to pay the bills.

Also are they any free resume services available?"

The conversation was great, she told me where the company is located etc and she also told me she would call me the following day to guide me to the next steps. I anxiously waited for that call but it never came.

So my questions are, should I call her back to follow up? Also note that I don't have their recruitment email so I can't email them as they only contacted me through the call.

Another question is do you think I have a chance of getting the job coz I definitely expect a person to contact only the candidates they plan to interview or they plan giving them the jobs. I don't think it's a great move to call candidates you are not planning to interview or hire as you are giving them unncessary tension.

It's been harder and harder to do work in the last few years. I'm disillusioned with life and school, as I feel like my job is mostly administrative, and I don't really get to use my skills and knowledge. You get fed all this stuff about ""cutting edge"" and ""lasers and robots"" for years and then coming out of school at 28 and working in industry boils down to clicking around on websites and filling out forms 99% of the time.

Often I'm too depressed and just stare at my screen. I let work pile up, and then the depression switches to crippling anxiety and I freeze. This is all coming to a head now and I've made a few major mistakes where my boss has had to step in, including a 2 month delay.

I've had a couple talking-to's from my boss, but he's incredibly nice so that carries a lot of weight. I expect to get formally reprimanded soon. I don't think I'll get fired due to all the projects I'm tied into, but who knows, I wouldn't be surprised.

I started SSRI's a couple years ago after an anxiety attack, and they initially helped lift my mood, but I'm ultimately worse than I felt then. I started therapy last month, but I know that it takes time to ""kick in"", so to speak.

I guess broadly I want to say ""What do I do?"" and say ""HELP"", but I should be more specific:

* In the short term, in firefighting mode, how do you guys put aside feelings of anxiety and dread to focus on tasks?
* In the medium term, assuming I stay at this job, how do you guys get motivated? Like maybe I need a new job or something, but every job is going to have a bunch of stuff that sucks, that's just life. I need to figure this out whether or not I leave. (Easier said than done). So how do you guys stay motivated and especially consistent?
* Long term, any open-ended advice? I know this problem in the modern workplace is common, so sharing any experiences would be appreciated. Tough love is fine too."

2,2023-01-12,Ignored keywords in Job Search Engines,u/LeighRobin,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10a4cd7/ignored_keywords_in_job_search_engines/,jobs,"Has anyone else experienced major job search engines (indeed, LinkedIn &amp; google) ignoring your keywords?
And better yet does anyone know how to fix it or know of an engine that doesn’t do this?

I’ve found that my keyword is consistently ignored and the results often don’t even include it. For example— Im searching for work related to COVID and I want to only see job posting with that word mentioned in the title or description. I would think there would be tons of results because lots of jobs not even relevant to what I’m looking for will mention COVID (for example, in regard to vax requirements or other things). I’m getting totally irrelevant results with no mention of the keyword anywhere.

Solutions I’ve tried:

1. Using Boolean search terms, specifically, quotes, for example “COVID” and “COVID 19” I only use one keyword.


2. I thought maybe this was because there weren’t enough jobs using that keyword but as I go through the search results, jobs with that keyword are mixed in among others without it. I know this for certain because I’m doing a page search (control F) and can see the word is definitely not used, even when I go to the individual job listing and do a page search, nothing.


I’ve had this with other keywords. It’s enough to drive someone who has been job searching for months insane to be honest. Anyone?"

To give you guys insight, I’m 21 and in my senior year of college so I haven’t graduated yet, I’ve been working customer service jobs before being moved into vendor relations for 18 an hour. My rent is going up in august to about 1300 and with my current checks, I only make about 1200 or less. With my current job being a smaller company lots of things are disorganized and I get a lot of work with little pay for what I do. This new job i would be in trade and was offered a 50k a year job which is the highest number I’ve ever seen. I’m a full time student and I work full time because I have no family so I’ve really applied myself these past few years to be successful. 

Well to get into the new job, when digging I found reviews of people saying long hours, overworked, and people can get fired for no reason and that worries me because I financially cannot be without a job yaknow. Like I’m really worried about job stability and being overworked and seeing all these reviews. The industry and job is basically what I do now but I’m worried about the reviews. Should I still take the new job despite the reviews? I’ve never been offered this much but the idea of finally having money seems so appealing to me and being able to afford my rent and have money left over seems like a dream but I’m scared of the job and starting fresh and having no one and possibly being fired if I don’t do good enough. What do you guys think I should do. Please help with advice I’m a big over thinker and I stress out"

2,2023-01-12,Unsure about HR meeting motive and confidentiality.,u/RPF0X,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10a50hz/unsure_about_hr_meeting_motive_and_confidentiality/,jobs,"I was asked to attend an HR meeting at my company. My position is deputy team leader but I am fairly new to this role and have not had much experience with these kind of meetings. The meeting was with the head of HR, myself, and another employer in a similar role to mine, though I do not work with him directly. The meeting was billed as an informal chat to discuss any thoughts and concerns we might have.

During this meeting I was asked to discuss what I thought of specific named employees and problems that have been noted with HR. She asked me who I thought the 2 best employees were and then immediately followed up with who I thought the 2 worst were. This caught me off guard and I hesitated, feeling wrong about naming my co-workers like that. Seeing me hesitate, she then said ""come on, be honest"" with a big smile. I felt pressured and had to say something but tried not to say anything too bad. I also heard about 2 other employees absences, one due to a wrist injury and another due to family issues. This has nothing to do with me and feel it should have stayed confidential. 

The way she was questioning me made me feel she was just playing me for information under the pretense of listening to any thought I had. I also later found out she asked me a question which she already knew the answer to. Almost like she was testing me. Also, at one point I brought up what I thought was a very valid point and she gave me a counter point that didn't challenge anything I'd said, which made me feel like she wasn't really listening to me.

I may be over reacting, we didn't discuss anything particularly sensitive but the fact she pushed me to talk badly about my coworkers in the presence of another employee (who for all she or I knew might be close with one of the named people, unlikely but not the point) felt very wrong to me. The fact someone else was there meant that it could not be a confidential conversation.

It's been playing on my mind since it happened so any thought would be appreciated."

I have been promoted in my department, but the promotion has put me in a management position I do not want to be in. I originally applied for and took the job because I just needed the work, and I took the promotion to get out of the first position. Both feel like mistakes. I'm nearly five years into working for my current company and don't see a way into a different department where I can flourish.

I know the ultimate solution is to find a new job, but that seems distant. I'm trying to consider more immediate solutions (taking time off, asking to be transferred to the old position), and I'm wondering if leaving is a possibility. My only concern is how it will look on a resume to other potential employers. How much does quitting a previous job factor into an employer's decision? What affect would leaving my current job have on my canidacy in gaining another job?"

I would like to get some advice about my current situation between two job offers.

I’ve been at this one place for 5 months, it’s a remote position. I work Monday to Friday 10am to 6pm. The monthly pay here was $3k before tax since I joined, and they’re now offering to pay extra to keep me there as I left my two week notice last week. It’s a very laid back job, I sell stuff to leads and that’s it really.

They’re now offering: 
$4,000 base 
$500 commission base + uncapped commission of whatever I sell 
$350 back in insurance costs

They’re also offering an upgrade in three months (but they can’t commit to it): $5,000 base
Unlimited cap in commission 
$700 back in insurance costs

The new company I might start working for (next week) is also a remote position, back it’s more stressful is what I’ve heard from people who work there. They’re offering: 
Benefits from health or life to pet insurance, 401k benefits. 
$2,500 base 
$unlimited cap in bonuses if I sell well.

Only problem with the company I’m with right now is that they gave a good offer within three months but they can’t commit. 
AND that new company requires a lot of work just to reach the $4,000 base I’ve been offered. 
Although they’re stating sales agents there make 100k a year, so who knows how successful I could be there too.

What do you guys think? 
Thanks in advance!"

I just received a job offer for a position I’ve been interviewing for since mid December. I’m pretty excited about the work and location compared to my current job.

During the initial phone screen, the HR rep told me that the salary range for this position is $95-105k.

After going the through the interviews a few weeks ago, I got a phone call with the HR rep saying that they would like to move forward and extend me an offer, with a salary of $85k. I was kinda pumped up haha, but asked to be sent all of the offer details and I would read them over. She sent me an email with the details, and $85k salary in the body of the email (so no document formalizing it I guess?).

I’m just wondering how I can tactfully negotiate for a higher salary, as stipulated in the initial conversation with HR.

Something to note is that, regardless of negotiation outcomes, I’m prepared to accept this offer. I would be satisfied with the current offer, though it is about what I make now. I’m trying to switch jobs ASAP, since my current role and it’s location is not conducive to my mental health. I am also wondering if I can negotiate for relocation assistance too? I received relocation assistance ($10k) from my current company (2.5 years ago when I started).


Any advice would be much appreciated. :) This would be my 2nd job out of college, so I don’t have much experience with job negotiation!"

I've had multiple interviews that seem to go well and then when I'm expecting a third interview I get a rejection email. I have plenty of qualifications and a good job history. This last employer laid people off or made them work for a horrible third party that's not worth staying with. Anyway, with all my matching qualifications, professionally done resume, list of references, it's been a month and no offer. I'm starting to think maybe these companies are calling my company to get a hold of my current manager and they are giving bad word. I know it sounds paranoid but I have the type of manager that acts nice and says things they'll help you achieve goals and get to where you want to be. But there's passive aggressiveness here and there and snooty remarks and hardly any acknowledgment when a job has been done well. There's also things I've omitted from customer that we are supposed to say and it helps to put my managers team in a lead where they get bonuses but we get nothing. 

Do any of you know if employers won't move forward with you if they don't get any type of confirmation from your current manager or last employer? Do they actually make calls and check references?"

2) 45 minute behavioral interview plus a LIVE assessment 
3) 30 minute “culture fit” interview

I have a college degree and this job position demands one but I am getting paid a minimum wage. 
I've never worked at this field before so I expected that someone will be helping me when I need help and be there to teach me and explain me well what I am supposed to do and how but I rarely get a decent  help I need. Sometimes even days can pass that I don't get even one single answer to my questions so that I could go on with my job.

I came really enthusiastic and I got good reviews but as it goes on it just makes me think that they are only trying to put as much as possible work on me.

 Working overtime is  not paid, weekends are also not paid and if I want to do all my job for that day I could easily be at my job everyday day for 10 up to 12 hours. I was staying overtime before and came few times on weekends but since it is not paid I decided that if it is not strictly said to stay for that day that I'll be going home at the end of my shift even if I didn't finish all my work for that day because otherwise I am afraid that I'll burn out and I can tell that some people have started giving me weird looks because I only stay for extra 15 minutes to half an hour after my shift is done and then go home.

I am paid minimum wage as I said and I doubt that I'll get any raise here. I don't have anyone at work that is regularly available to me for my questions and to explain me things well since I am completely new at this field but I am constantly being given new assignments to do that I don't know how to do (I understand when someone explains them well but that rarely happens).

 As time goes on I lost my enthusiasm and I don't want to leave this early but also I don't want to burn out for a minimum wage. I am not a workaholic type of a person, I Mean I'll work my ass off for 8 hours but after my shift is done I would like to go home and enjoy my private life that I cherish a lot more than a professional one. I don't know if I am overreacting about this and am some spoiled brat so I would like to hear your opinions on this matter. Thank you."

Long story short, had a few different roles, got completely burned out and left my last job in September last year, vowing never to return to the industry.

At this time I also moved towns to live with my partner. I needed a job and wanted to do something totally different, so I took a job at a small manufacturing business in October. It's 9-5, average pay for that kind of work, and they've been decent to work for.

I then got talking with a local veterinary practice this month, and in a nutshell they offered me a position I didn't expect them to agree to - half the hours for more money than I'm on now.

I decided to accept, one because I feel drawn back to the industry having had a short break, and two the pay and hours benefit, giving me more free time for my mental health etc.

I told my employer today, and they were disgruntled, shall we say. I think they thought I was staying long term, and when I interviewed with them I thought the same myself. They have big plans to expand and I was part of that plan. I feel so guilty but in my head it's a no-brainer decision.

Have I been really horrible doing this after 3 months at the job (2 weeks of which were Christmas factory shutdown)? I know what I would tell a friend in my situation, but it's hard to tell yourself!"

Fast forward 6 months, I’m really enjoying my job and excelling and pulling off spectacular events with limited supervision. Everyone only has positive feedback and comments on my work and ethic. The board is saying the past 6 months of events have been the best yet. 

It’s also worth mentioning that during my interview process I was clear that I was seeking an employment opportunity that would provide appropriate training and development goals since I was new to Event coordination, to which they agreed.

3 weeks after I came on board they canned my boss and the only other person who was the lead on events.

My 2022 was shit - a breakup of what I thought was my forever relationship, losing my house, changing jobs, etc etc.  Big life changes that I didn't expect to be making.

And I am burnt out as fuck.  I think I was even before this, but I've just hit a wall.

I've also Peter Principaled myself into a job that I am not great at.  It's probably a combo of burnout, anxiety, and genuinely not knowing how to do my job.  So I'm floundering.  My new manager has noticed, and I'm not sure I'll pass probation.  And even knowing this, and desperately wanting to remain employed, I still procrastinate, and watch the hours tick by.  I literally can't force myself to work.  

I don't know how to pull out of this.  I'm casually looking for new jobs, but I think I'll run into the same thing.  And I don't even know if I love what I do anymore (marketing and communications) but have no idea WTF else to do, or how to support myself while I work it out.

I'm so stressed and so stuck.  Anyone been here?  What did you do?"

I’ve been at this company five years, I’ve never missed more than 5-7 days a year in the entire five years, I’ve never said no to a client or to covering shifts or working more hours when they need me to.But the whole of 2022 I missed a lot of work because I had Covid twice, a family member died and I took a few days off to help with funeral arrangements, I was in a car accident, my fiancé left me so I was homeless, I had to take time off to move my things from his apartment, and I was temporarily suici*dal, and then I got sick a lot while homeless because I was living in a cold leaky car with no heat. So needless to say I’ve missed a lot of work this past year, but also always came in when they told me there was no coverage and I always offered to come in while sick as long as the client was comfortable with it (im a caregiver for elderly and disabled people so it’s important to be in good health)
Since November they’ve cut my hours to 18 a week in an attempt to make sure im still “up for the challenge” and im barely surviving. At first I thought they were being kind but now im wondering if this is a manipulation thing?"

One assistant manager constantly quits and returns. The other assistant manager is always late. We lost workers. They're in a scramble to try and hire anyone, talking like ""now that we have problematic ppl gone, we can  mfunction again"". When management is bumbling and moronic at best. While they're doing that, they're reducing everyone's hours.

Everyone tells me different things. I'm still not sure if tomorrow we're supposed to be closed, regular hrs, or I come in later. I've wasted over 2 hrs already waiting outside on a few days thinking that it was just the late manager, but no, it's hard to tell when he's just late or we're closed. Because nobody says anything, and if they do, it's all contradictory.

The shipping area is not up to regulation. There are no pathways, it is unstable, and we are not organized. They're trying to cancel some trucks in the hope we can somehow clean it up. The store itself is dirty and messy. Nobody is set to clean up messes and we're too understaffed to keep things neat. Also breaking regulation by having U-boats and other things we're not supposed to in the aisles. Scattering of cigarette buds all around the entrance. Cracked and broken tiles accompanying missing light fixtures. Glitter and garbage on the floors.

I'm likely to move on anyway because I can't have this kind of inconsistency and incompetence. I don't even mind the work. But I also kinda need it. I'm just kinda on edge cause I can't really afford to job hunt when I haven't even been here a month, but everything is screaming at me that this place will either sink or it's awful enough to avoid anyway...

Edit: And as an aside, we have too few employees to meet the mandate that says the employees need to be informed of a closure"

Considering it’s an LLC, after I’m done with being an intern, when I go out and apply for other jobs with a similar skill set, is this something I can add to my resume and how will HR verify this since it’s a small family company and I’m not even getting paid aside from pizza/food.

Splicing panels, nodes, installing internal and external hardware, running main fibres, testing, even managing small teams now and then.

I have no qualifications in this field except street works, cscs card. Have done some basic splicing training but don't hold any certification.

I'm paid £120 a day (four days a week, most the time twelve hours from when i leave to getting back home) I want to become qualified and am prepared to pay for this myself. My boss only pays the supervisor 140-150 a day...

My boss also  pays for van use/diesel, I can also use this sparingly for leisurely use

I'm happy to have the chance to get my foot in the door, but feel I'm being somewhat mugged off to be honest. Especially given the fact this is profitable trade. Perhaps I'm being ungrateful... 

Where can I go from here?  Any engineers in this field know what course I should apply for so that I can gain PAYE employment for a bigger company?"

I recently joined a new company back in June 2022 after finally getting out of an extremely stressful position that I held for 2 years at a small SOC. 

This new company is miles better than the previous one, but there is still a lot of room for improvement in my eyes. I now work alone in my tool for the most part, which I don't want. Not that I can't do the work, I just don't enjoy working by myself. At my previous job, we worked with a wide variety of tools as well whereas now I'm only primarily working in one. I also miss the variety. 

I had a particularly stressful day dealing with process breakdown and finally started to think about leaving again. I'm someone that thrives when I'm comfortable, not chronically stressed. There is also my compensation. They offered me my minimum and the health plans they offer for my state are poor. This new job would offer a 20% bump in salary, less stress, and better benefits. However, I've only been at my current company since June. I like the people I work with, but I'm being presented with potentially a better opportunity.

Tl;Dr: Torn on if I should stay at the current company I've been at since June 2022 or leave for a better opportunity with better pay, lower stress, etc. Will it look bad on my resume? Is it worth it?"

Training is nonexistent I’ve had to figure out stuff as I go which is fine but I have no guidance really or resources. I guess my question is should I stick out to get some experience on my resume or get another job where I’m happy. If I was looking for another job should I list this one on my resume?

I was just extended a job offer from a company that I am really excited to work for. The thing is that I am currently employed and I live in California. In California, there is a “Ban the Box” law where all questions about your background and background checks are conducted AFTER a job offer has been extended.

My main concern is the background check. I have a misdemeanor DUI that is 1.5 years old. No one hurt and nothing damaged, but it will still ding on the background check. I told the recruiter if this would affect the job offer and she said that this was an HR problem that will be dealt with once the background results are received. The job does not involve driving, but it’s still a crime. I could not find anything in the company code of ethics. 

My question is do you think it’s fair to ask the start date to be moved to two weeks after I receive an all clear on the background check and once the paperwork is processed? I want to ensure that I give my current employer a proper two weeks’ notice once I am confirmed by the hiring company.

Thank you."

Background: I have PTSD and my workplace are aware. I have being going through therapy in the last 6 months including EMDR which is very intense. Talking to my therapist he said that I have a tendency to self-destruct because it better suits a narrative I have in my head if I am a failure. I also have been struggling to sleep that I have been surviving on 3 hours sleep most nights and I completely crash and I am unable to get up at all/ function. 

I am good at job and when I am good, I am really great. I have been giving new responsibilities and my workplace want to train me up. I love my job. 

This meeting is to consider whether I will receive a formal written warning. This will stay on my record for 6 months and I will need to agree on a plan to prove myself. 

The thing is, I don’t know if I can keep up to promises. I don’t fully understand why I do this or how to free myself from this behaviour. 

I was genuinely upset when I woke up because I was looking forward to the day but I woke up at stupid o’clock and missed the working day. 

I don’t know how to approach this meeting because I know I am in the wrong here. So far I am thinking of bringing in a colleague to write notes and also I will probably write up a statement that is fair and levelled.

I'm 37 years old. I headed back to school before covid to complete my bachelors in mechanical engineering because I found time and time again that jobs kept saying: ""Hey you seem cool, but we really need that degree"". Okay cool! I left my comfortable job, risked much, took out loans, and am a semester away from getting the degree (I graduate in May).

This month I started applying again to jobs. I'm specifically interested in leveraging my professional experience during my search. The positions I'm interested in sound something like ""manufacturing engineer II/principal mfgr engr"" depending on the company and division. I worked for about 6 years in manufacturing in senior management positions. I'm interested in aerospace &amp; defense mainly and have been applying to all of the big companies etc.

I've tailored my resume for each company and position. I've worked to highlight important skills etc, and to ensure that, when I do apply for a specific position, I meet at least all of the basic qualifications. I haven't gotten so much as a single positive response thus far. Not even an interview. The only thing I've discovered that seems to work is to directly message recruiters on LinkedIn and try to speak to them. However, my experiences with these recruiters is often confusing and discouraging. Many it seems, have not actually read my resume (much less the email response they ask me to craft them in response to the already redundant questions they've asked me once they want to move things off LinkedIn).

The other thing I'm discovering that's truly confounding is this..

A recruiter I had a phone call with yesterday told me that I ""had all the skills but you're just missing that piece of paper"". I'm sorry but is it not clear that I'm on the verge of graduating? Isn't this the practice of hiring new graduates? Why aren't my years of experience being seen and appreciated? Why does it feel like these supposed ambassadors to these companies don't understand the urgency of this endeavor for those of us seeking employment? Is it simply a matter of the fact that companies won't hire for positions this far out from a pending graduation date?

I'm no spring chicken, and know that ultimately it's about how hard you pound the pavement but the more I engage with these sourcers the more I feel like this is a broken process. Can anyone shine a light on any of this? I'll never give up, and will outwork everyone to get the job I want but the poor communication on behalf of these recruiters feels really frustrating.

Thanks for listening to me vent. Take care ya'll."

1,2023-01-12,Stay in old fashion work environment or move back to tech,u/farielly,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10akiaw/stay_in_old_fashion_work_environment_or_move_back/,jobs,"Need some help. I recently switched jobs (2 months in) to a more traditional marketing-based role (360 marketing + PR + comms role) and I came from a tech background (specialized social media marketing role). The switch has been hard and I've also been feeling like:

1. My talents in social media marketing is not really appreciated or growing at the current moment 
2. The culture of the working environment is SO OLD SCHOOL (e.g Shamed for taking MC, formal wear, no work from home or flexibility) I don't know if I can take it 
3. Boss is a bit of a dictator, a lot of things is dependent on her mood and what she feels like. Also I don't get clear direction in my work or what she wants out of me, a lot is figuring it out on the go and I believe I seek more mentorship/collaborative work &gt; being a one man team at the moment. 

At the same time, I do feel a bit burnt out/tired from the speed of tech but yet at the same time the current role feels a bit too slow for me to develop my career. Am pretty upset cause I did get an offer from a big tech company that I rejected for this role as at that time, I was hired by a friend - who was going to be my mentor but shortly she left due to some company restructuring. So these is also some disappointment in that.

Am unsure of how to move on from here and also am waiting for offers from a similar tech company that may be a bit more fast-paced, with also the potential of becoming overly fast-paced for me to manage. This is currently my second job. One of my fears is that if I continue staying here, I may not eventually be able to jump back into tech. 

Pros of staying:

* High paying for a traditional role
* Corporate discounts (think hospitality group)

Cons of staying:

* No career growth? Unsure about this aspect but tbh work feels a bit too painful or a dread daily, feel a bit more like a glorified intern at this point

Things were going really well, and I was asked to be more involved and take on more hours (15 to 30) about 5 months in. I ended up leaving my second job in order to do this. Up until about a month ago I was receiving great feedback and was happy to be doing the work. I should mention that from the beginning it was clear to me that this small business was struggling. I was there to help, and was doing my best to help fix the MANY issues bringing this business down. 

Seemingly out of nowhere, my boss began criticizing me far more frequently. They would ask things like “why haven’t you been doing this? Why didn’t you do this months ago?” This immediately rubbed me the wrong way, as all of the things I was being criticized on were things I had suggested doing in the past, or asked for more support or resources for, and was in one way or another told no. I began doing my best to rectify the “errors” on my part, but was still not given the support or resources necessary to do these things correctly. It’s important to note that if these tasks are not done correctly, there is no point to doing them at all. 

As the new year came and went, I think it became clearer to the owners just how bad the financial picture is. I realize now that this is about the time I began being criticized more. 

Yesterday I received an email with almost nothing but criticisms, with a note about me only working my “agreed upon” 15 hours. I responded with confusion, as I have an extensive list of responsibilities that can barely be completed in a 30 hour week, let alone half that time. I also have not worked a 15 hour week for this business in about 5 months. 
My boss responded with, “there may be a disconnect on the number of hours we settled on.”
I was clear in my response that I was extremely concerned about their belief I would ever have agreed to work a 15 hour week after our last discussion, when I was told I would not be working full-time, but close to it. My boss was also aware I was leaving my second job in order to give more of my hours to this company. I can’t afford to work 15 hours a week, I have bills to pay. If they need to cut my hours that’s one thing, but to pretend I already agreed to it really had me thinking. 

We now have a meeting tomorrow to talk and thinking about the last few months I don’t expect to be with this business much longer. 

I’m currently thinking that tomorrow (Friday) they will either try to get me to quit, or fire me. The fact that the negativity towards me began when the financial issues became clearer makes me think they just can’t afford to have me anymore. 

My suspicion is this: 
Instead of being truthful and laying me off, they’re trying to find a different way to get rid of me so I can’t collect unemployment. 

TL;DR
The company I work for is struggling financially and can’t afford to keep me. I’m suspicious they’re looking for reasons to fire me instead of laying me off to stop me from getting unemployment benefits. 

What do I do?"

For anyone in the above situations, please take advantage of the federally funded programs that may be available to you through your local One Stop Center.

I worked in the public workforce system for 5 years and not enough people are aware of the programs and services available to them. 

Career One Stops are resource centers to connect individuals to employers. They do this by providing services through Department of Labor funds. These services can include helping employers fill vacant positions, providing on the job training, and paying for certificate programs. 

The most well known program is the WIOA (Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act) program. The goal of this program is to train individuals for current workforce needs in their area. This is done by paying for associate degrees and industry recognized certificate programs for those who qualify. In my area, we had a $9,000 cap for individuals and we payed for a lot of IT bootcamps, nursing and dental assistance, CNA, CDL and apprenticeship programs. 

Types of trainings and the amount that can be covered do very by the area you live.

I’ve seen so many success stories because of these programs and really just wanted to share how they might be able to help. 

Mods, I hope this okay and not breaking Rule 1. I’m not self promoting, just providing a PSA."

\- I dont like the industry

\- Stressful environment, hard to balance private and work life

\- Being always in 'it's an emergency' situation never leaves any space for you to improve things/processes or develop new stuff

\- After more than 3 years working closely to the board, my value is highly recognized, but not reflected by my salary.

I have been moving forward in the selection for a similar position to what i have now, but for a much smaller company working in the **SaaS industry** (20 M$ turnover; 160 employees)  where I would manage a team of 2.

Next my doubts:

\- Would moving to a smaller company decrease/kill my chance of advancing later in my career?

\- Is it a good move to jump into the SaaS industry?

I'm 26F and in the UK. Looking for a bit of advice a few months into my new job. I started 5 months ago at a new company and I am starting to notice some toxic behavior among my colleagues. The culture at work is overall fine, with good pay &amp; benefits. The issue is my direct manager and her boss.

My manager talks horribly about her boss to me pretty much all day – essentially about how incompetent she is. It seems like she's trying to get me to side with her and be close friends with me, but it's really just draining 24/7. During my probationary period (3 months) I was trying to play it nice and just listen to whatever she said while staying neutral. However, it's really immature and distracting me from my work. Now my boss has almost gotten used to me as a sounding board and I don't want to ruin my own reputation by telling her off.

However, my manager recently got a slap on the wrist from senior management for gossiping in the workplace and now she's doubled down on the bad-mouthing of her boss to me (as her boss was the one who brought up the issues to leadership) - the tension is incredibly awkward now as the team is just us three. I don't know how much longer I can be the neutral party here.

Would it be better at this early stage in the game to just let it go and stay calm, or cut my losses while I can and find a new job? I don't love the work itself and this is making me dislike it even more. Ideally, I would to stay for a year at least (my notice period is 3 months) but I don't want to look bad to new employers.

Thanks!

TLDR; toxic managers in my new role, not sure how to deal"

I (33F) have never had a job because I'm disabled (mentally with some physical problems) and used to receive SSI but lost it due to the government's error after my mom passed away. I'm married and my husband is the one working and on the hunt of finding another job that pays better so we can afford the mortgage and bills. I want to be able to have some sort of income to help and was trying to find a job but having no luck. 

We've tried to get help from services but kept being told we don't qualify to receive help. Can't even get food stamps since we're struggling to barely pay the mortgage and bills. I don't have a high school diploma or GED (tried getting but missed 2 points and never got it). I've been trying to find jobs with no experience and don't need a high school diploma/ GED finding no such luck. 

So I came here to see if anyone can help me because I want to be able to help my husband out with our house and everything. I'm in the state of FL if that helps any. I'm not very good with interacting with people but I want to try at least. I just want to know if there are any jobs out there for people like me with mental disabilities with some physical problems.

I work in IT for a smaller company that works with very large IT companies so it is a great opportunity to learn, develop and hopefully a chance to move up in the company. 
At first, it was going great for about 20 days (i didn't have a laptop for 10 of those days), and my manager asked me to complete a small project. I completed the report and sent it to my coworker and CC'd him (my manager was out) because I did not know the process to post the report.
My manager didn't read the email, and he sent me an email on a Saturday and copied his manager and said, ""he gave me a simple task and I didn't complete it and he made a mistake hiring me"".  I showed where I sent the email to my coworker and he didn't reply. 
Every since then it has been petty issues for him to complain about. 

I have stayed on for over a year because I didn't want to look bad on my resume. But I hate coming to work to deal with him. I just know every Teams call I get from him is something I am going to get yelled at about. 

I haven't reported him to HR because what is the point? On his first insulting email his manager was on the email and nothing came of it.

Once again, they sent me a simple test task, in general, there are many similar ones: build a tree from a list of vertices.

***Test***

    Write a function that builds a tree based on a list of 
    tuples of id (parent id, offspring id),
    where None is the id of the root node.
    How this should work:
    
    source = [
       (None, 'a'),
       (None, 'b'),
       (None, 'c'),
       ('a', 'a1'),
       ('a', 'a2'),
       ('a2', 'a21'),
       ('a2', 'a22'),
       ('b', 'b1'),
       ('b1', 'b11'),
       ('b11', 'b111'),
       ('b', 'b2'),
       ('c', 'c1'),
    ]
    expected = {
       'a': {'a1': {}, 'a2': {'a21': {}, 'a22': {}}},
       'b': {'b1': {'b11': {'b111': {}}}, 'b2': {}},
       'c': {'c1': {}},
    }
    assert to_tree(source) == expected

And I suddenly thought, how could the hype chatGPT cope with such a semi-realistic, but quite useful task for me? The thought came, and the hands were already looking for information on how to break through to chatGPT. After some time, I broke through and right in the forehead, without changing anything in the text of the assignment, I send a test and wait with interest.

Pretty quickly, chatGPT sends me an answer with their solution and even explains something.

***The very first decision***

    def to_tree(source):
        tree = {}
        for parent, offspring in source:
            if parent is None:
                tree[offspring] = {}
            else:
                tree[parent][offspring] = {}
        for parent, offspring in source:
            if parent is not None:
                tree[parent][offspring] = to_tree(
                    [(p, o) for p, o in source if p == offspring]
                )
        return tree

It looks plausible at first superficial glance, some points are confusing, but this is quite a code. I run this code in Python and of course it doesn't work. With a sense of the superiority of human intelligence over a soulless machine, I'm trying to squeeze something else out of chatGPT and ask him to annotate the types. He more or less manages. Then I have asked to rate the algorithmic complexity. In general, he correctly evaluates as O(n\*n) and even gives advice on how to improve - use, he says, specialized data structures.

I am also not a simple guy, and I ask him to improve the code in terms of algorithmic complexity. And this *miracle* gives me something very strange.

***Virtually meaningless code***

    def to_tree(source: List[Tuple[str, str]]) -&gt; Dict[str, str]:
        # Initialize an empty tree
        tree = {}
        
        # Iterate through the source list and add the nodes to the tree
        for parent, offspring in source:
            tree[offspring] = parent
        
        # Return the tree
        return tree

After that, I rush to a friend of the developer in order to *sand off* chatGPT behind the eyes for curvature and stupidity. In the course of a condescending discussion, we come to the conclusion that, in fact, the work of a developer consists of half the correct formulation of the problem. With that thought in mind, and with a slightly diminished sense of superiority, I decided to tweak chatGPT's solution a bit using his own advice on using special data structures.

***My edits***

    from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Optional, Any
    
    
    def to_tree(data: List[Tuple[Optional[str], str]]) -&gt; Dict[str, Any]:
        children: Dict[str, Any] = {o: {} for _, o in data}
        tree: Dict[str, Any] = {}
        for parent, offspring in data:
            if parent is None:
                tree[offspring] = children[offspring]
            else:
                children[parent][offspring] = children[offspring]
        return tree

And I send him this code. To which chatGPT notices that this solution is better and almost praises me. *Thank you, of course*, chatGPT, but then let's work on. After we solved this difficult moment for the task by joint efforts, and my arrogance left, the work went much easier.

Asked to write tests - he wrote some good ones. Asked to write tests with non-formatted input data - he also came up with something. Asked to update the solution so that tests with unformatted input data would pass - he again added code blocks. We did the same with him with various other boundary conditions. Of course, I had to correct something *because we are friends*. We've become friends. Well, in the end, he asked him to describe in detail the algorithmic complexity in time and memory, which he also coped with.

***Final source code***

    from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Optional, Any
    
    
    # Time complexity:
    # The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of tuples in the input list. The reason is that
    # the function iterates over the input list once and performs a constant number of
    # operations (a constant number of type and value comparisons) on each element of the list. Therefore,
    # the total number of operations is directly proportional to the number of elements in the list, which makes
    # the time complexity O(n).
    #
    # Space complexity:
    # The space complexity of this function is O(n). The reason is that the function creates two data structures: tree and
    # children both with the same size as the number of tuples in the input list, to store the tree and
    # children of the each node. Therefore, the space complexity is directly proportional to the number of
    # elements in the input list, which makes the space complexity O(n).

        if not data:

There were finishing touches, but then chatGPT got tired - too many requests per hour, so he said.

Well, in this form, I sent the decision to the employer. I'm waiting for an answer now.

&amp;#x200B;

As a result, the experience turned out to be interesting and, it seems to me, chatGPT can become a good tool to help the developer, he can take on some trivial and routine operations at his level of abstraction, and the developer himself will have to learn to set tasks more clearly, review the code and build architecture.

&amp;#x200B;

***UPD: response from the employer***

Any news! The employer replied that in general the code was reviewed, but there were some doubts about the fact that the position does not provide for ML / AI tasks that I generally aspire to. But, given this, they proposed the next stage of the interview. **So with chatGPT we have successfully passed this zero stage!**

But in the next letter, the employer wrote that they saw this article and refused! With the wording that if they wanted to hire a speech model, they would have done so. *On the face of discrimination of artificial intelligence! We leather bags are going to give this AI a second Luddite move!*

But in general, I also want to publicly apologize to the employer for this experiment and I hope it will be more useful than jokes.

&amp;#x200B;

***UPD: employer's comment on the results of the article***

Below is a comment from the employer on the results of the whole undertaking, without cuts, a direct quote, with the permission of the employer.

&gt;The creator of the test answers:  
&gt;  
&gt;This, of course, is better than 90% of the solutions sent, but still they gave birth to a shit together with the robot. By the way, in order to use what the bot gives, you need to be able to read a lot of someone else's code, and this is more difficult than writing a little of your own.  
&gt;  
&gt;From myself as HR I will add that if you warned about the use of GPT, we would most likely appreciate the sincerity. Otherwise, they wouldn't even call for an interview. Starting a relationship with deceit is such a thing :)"

My co-worker (50s), who has decades of experience and was hired as a Senior Copywriter last January (which I assumes come with pay higher than even 58K), was just fired. 

My boss told me privately yesterday about her leaving and alluded it was due to budget cuts. Yet, I just got a promotion, and a few months ago they just hired a new writer full-time (30s, more experience than me, too). 

All of us did good work, so I just want to understand what's really going on and if it places me in any danger.

I've managed to land a job that is 3x my current salary and it is for a Business Management Consultant job, I checked out some of the requirements and it's almost as if they didn't even look at my resume as I have no prior experience in this neck of the woods.

I have some experience that they prefer but am lacking in a lot of the other places. I am still going to do the interview and act like I know what i'm talking about but I need some tips on how to not mess this up as this would change my life DRASTICALLY. 

Are there any fellow BM Consultants that could offer any advice? I'm lacking in the whole ""Sales"" part as I hate trying to sell people things but i'm sure I could get to a decent spot given the opportunity. 

Is there anything that they'd look for in particular? I'm almost positive i'll get through the interview okay but i'm 100% expecting them to move on to a better candidate, especially with that high of pay.

Edit: just had the first round of interview. It was me and 2 other people. I think i set the bar pretty high for my group. As soon as the interview ended they said they'd let us know via text if we made it to progress through to the 2nd round. I got this text almost instantly. 

But. The job is customer service/sales for the first 18 months then POSSIBLE promotion to Branch Manager. And i definitely was not looking for CS/Sales position. Not too sure how to progress from her but I may just let them down easy and tell them it wasn't the position I thought it was."

I’ve been here 3 months now and at times I feel so bored out of my mind because we mainly market for a majority of industries like construction, hgvs, things that basically bore me.
I also just think about how it’s not flexible. I have to make the time up if I want doctors apptmts, if I spend any longer than 5mins in the toilet/kitchen they ask questions, I can’t fit in the gym before work because I have to get the bus and I don’t feel like I have much time to relax as well as have 8 hours sleep. On top of that I get the bus, as I can’t drive, so if the bus is late it can take an hour and a half to get home like it did today. If I’m lucky it takes 45mins total from when I finish but that happened to me once.
So I know I wanna work from home but whilst I’m training (and because it’s a small office) I can’t exactly do that yet.
And I don’t even really enjoy the work either… it doesn’t thrill me. I’ve thought about being an estate agent or even a primary school teacher but I know if I get into it I won’t be able to work from home at all so I might just be stuck again. Advice please?

TL;DR: I don’t entirely like the work I do but I can potentially wfh if I carried on until I got more experience. However becoming an estate agent or teacher has recently tickled my fancy but I know the hours can be long or unsociable and I need a job where I could potentially wfh as I prefer the work/life balance"

I was doing simple tasks like getting to know the various projects in my job, and I got to work on a relatively simple one.

The past few months or so, I got moved to a difficult project. I'm still not sure how a lot of this works, and the application itself is a complicated one, to boot. I also got moved to another application, an old one that I needed to update, which is also a bit of a learning curve.

I'm really struggling to finish some of the issues or tasks I'm working on, simply because I don't really understand the projects. They seem way over my head and I constantly have to ask for help. I'd Google but I'm so stumped, I don't even know what to look up.

Additionally, my coworkers are busy, so it's hard to pull them aside to get help.

I'm panicking because it's 3 years in and I still don't really feel like I know much. I'd start applying for other jobs, but I'm worried that I don't have enough knowledge for the amount of years I was here, and I'll have a hard time finding a job because of my incompetence.

I think I'm getting exhausted and stressed because I don't understand what's going on, I'm having a hard time understanding even when I do get help to the point where I'm wondering if I'll ever understand. And then I get so stressed, my mind can't rest and it results in mental health issues and I think it's contributing to how unreliable and forgetful I am. And then I end up doing worse at work as well as at home.

Any advice?"

For one, it puts me back in my chosen career field which I can never opportunities for. Two, it allows me to move out of my current state and go across the country which I really need to do. Like badly. And three, I’m capable of doing the job. 

Virtual interviews are the bane of my existence. Generally, they don’t go well. In the first interview, the director for the department did like me. The second was an interview with him and another team member, I was shaky and came across awkward. The third was with a panel of managers from adjacent departments. I tried to answer the questions as best I could but ended up being nervous and displaying a lack of confidence. 

Today the director called and told me they were moving forward with other candidates. When I asked if there was a particular reason, he stated that while I met the criteria and had everything on paper they wanted, they didn’t feel like I necessarily engaged well. This sucks. In a face to face setting, I know I could come across confident and more engaging. 

I want to salvage this. Would it be weird or inappropriate for me to call the guy back and offer to fly out this week for an in person meeting even though they’ve stated they are wanting to move to different candidates? The guy did like me and the issue seems to be how awkward i come across over video interviews. Hell, even over the phone the convos seem better than the videos.

People are not fun, you can tell me no, that doesn’t bother me what does bother me is the viewed as the scum of the earth because I knocked your door while you were eating chips and watching ESPN. 

So, I’m seeking advice on what would be out there to transition from direct to home. I have an associates degree in business management. I currently earn just over 100,000 a year with my job, and I’m wondering if anyone else has switched from direct to home. OR, advice on how to reinvigorate the job. People say you need a “why” or something to grasp onto mentally to push you to continue but I’m just not able to figure it out. Some weeks I make $4000 some weeks I make $200.

3,2023-01-13,Suggestions on Jobs Outside of Retail?,u/Hactima,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10b2vu8/suggestions_on_jobs_outside_of_retail/,jobs,"Hello all, I am a young adult college student in the United States, living independently. I work at a local Target in their tech section, part-time. The hourly salary is supposed to be enough to support me -  Issue here is I'm supposed to get 24 hours a week on average and the entire month of Jan they've given me no hours, and I keep on calling to find out the situation, they always put me on hold or don't respond. Even before then they would always give me about half of my submitted hours. I've tried explaining that I need around 24 hours to actually make due and survive, and to no avail.   


Therefore I've decided to look for other job opportunities and will leave Target once I find a new job. I'm not interested in working in retail again, as it is bad for my health. I have had over two years in retail, always have been a valuable employee, and have a small amount of time doing lab work as well as an accessioner. In addition to this I'm a digital design major and have had quite a few tech jobs as well. Would anyone have any part-time recommendations for a full-time Junior in college (Classes mon-thurs) who lives independently? General answers are fine as well. Thank you in advance."

It didn't really pay much, so I'm not really depressed about it. I'm just wondering if it was because of me or does it more have to do with the fact that my company doesn't really need me anymore? One of the reasons that my boss told me was my lack of communication and other specific issues(like not including something in a shipment). The prevailing thing he stressed about, was me failing to setup an IP phone for our CEO in the company. I followed his instructions though which was to take one of the phones in someone else's office and install it in the CEO's room. He didn't mention it for weeks, only to bring it up this week, where I explained  that I had it set up. He then said that that phone was not zoom compatible and had me install another IP phone for the CEO. Other things he mentioned were that i forgot to include a power cable for a computer that I shipped, as well as not thinking that I sent enough old equipment within their IT room for recycling, even though it wasn't really specified what kind/how much equipment should have been sent for this recycling. He also mentioned he wanted someone ""more stronger for this position"". Do these just sound like excuses for a larger reason, like just not liking me personally or not needing me within their office? For the past month, I had virtually nothin to do, as noone really had any technical issues within the office. I made sure to do what was told of me though, was very responsive in email, and  there was no real indication of them expecting more from me until now."

I know you are not supposed to badmouth your old job, or your old boss, so I give a different reason.  I say I got inadequate training for new responsibilities (logistics), which is also true, but pretty close to badmouthing my old job.

Part of the problem with this is that one of the people I am counting on for a good reference (and my immediate supervisor) is the woman who was failing to train me.  She tried, but she did not know how to do it very well.

I am not good at coming up with a bullshit answer like ""I am just looking for new opportunities"".  I am looking for better pay, but I don't think I am supposed to say that.  What should I say instead? "

I just received a verbal job offer for an admin position I interviewed for. The recruiter told me that they are looking over and getting approval for the offer letter right now and that I should be receiving it early next week.

In my initial application, I put down a salary expectation of 55k. I didn't read the entire job listing and ignored all the typical stuff after responsibilities and didn't see that they actually listed the salary range for this position being 60k-70k, so this is entirely on me. I didn't even realize this until after my first call with the recruiter where she had already asked and confirmed that my salary expectations where 55k. I was already kicking myself for this.

I do two rounds of interviews (no mention of salary with those managers), and the recruiter got back to me today. She asks me to reconfirm the salary I'm looking for, and I changed my answer and said I was looking for 55k to 60k. She asks if getting 60k would increase the possibility of me taking this position and I said that it would.

Now I'm wondering I should've asked for more since 60k is on the bottom end of their listed salary range for the position. Would it be wrong to negotiate again after getting the offer letter, especially since the recruiter already spoke to me twice about salary expectations? Could I possibly lie and say that upon receiving the offer letter and speaking to my current boss that I was offered a raise at my current position at 65k and if they could match that new offer? Or should I just accept what I've got, especially given that my current salary is only 40k? I'd like to leave my current position, mainly because my pay is so low."

I work full time at an outpatient mental health office doing  reception, insurance, and some minor billing. I am doing this while I get my Master's online to be a  counselor.

My other full time coworker, who does the same work as me, is currently salary and makes the equivalent of $18.75 an hour. She has been at the company a year longer than me. 

My original plan was to ask my boss to switch me to salary at the equivalent of $17 an hour, but I found out from another coworker (who works part time in the same role) that after a year and a half, our boss only approved a 45 cent raise for her, meaning she makes $15.45 now. I am not sure if my expectations are too high, but I will be really upset if I don't get at least a $1.50 hourly raise. 

The coworker who makes $18.75 is smart and knowledgeable, but she often takes naps during the day, leaves early, and she takes more personal days than the rest of us. Our boss works virtually so he doesn't really know what goes on in the office. She is also really good at painting herself in a good light to authority.

I am a technical writer and have owned a small mobile bartending business. Previously I was an engineering technician. I've worn a few hats. I've learned how to organize my tasks. I like solving problems. Getting to joke around is great too. 

I'm an introvert. So throwing me in the deep end every day would not be good for me lol... I don't like larger group meetings where you have to make snap decisions. Other kinds of meetings are fine. I mostly prefer the one-on-one types of collaboration. I can actually get into more in-depth kinds of conversations.

&amp;#x200B;

**(Finally, the part about being calm)** 

When I had a small biz, customers would tell me that I have a temperament or an ability to make them feel less anxious about their big, upcoming plans. That's always nice to hear. And as the owner, there seemed to be mutual respect between them and me. 

Otherwise, I haven't been a supervisor very often, but I've enjoyed it when I have. I would figure out the plan ahead of time, check in with the stakeholders, and delegate. If experienced, I would let my people decide how to do things in their own way and pair up the newbies with the experienced (no need to micro-manage). And if they had a better idea? Let's do it. 

So what can I do with this? (No pressure, take your time 😂.)"

- i haven’t made enough money to owe taxes yet (according to my dads accountant), so i don’t know if my employment status is really affecting me negatively (other than emotionally)
- i think someone at my job may be undocumented so if i report my employer, will i be screwing that person over? plus there are other young ppl who seem totally happy and are relying on this business for survival
- also does this have the potential to end my employers business? they are already going thru financial stress and i’m not sure if me reporting them is actually necessary or will do anything
- they know everyone i know and i’m pretty sure ppl will take their side, and i’m not sure how burning this bridge will affect my career. i’m new to the workforce so i’m just trying to make the right decision.

for context, i did try setting a boundary w my boss the other day, saying that i don’t want to help clean the shop for customers and i need to keep my tasks in line w my employment status as an IC. boss was NOT happy that i said that and made me feel like shit for not wanting to “help the team” bc people also clean up after me apparently. so i’m thinking of just quitting next week with only 1 weeks notice, but the question remains, do i report to the DoL?"

I guess the thing is, I want to know if anyone has similar experiences or if anyone has coworkers who used to act like X but became Y.

Today, my boss sent me an email that was worded politely, but can essentially be summed up as “You need to be more independent, and I’m disappointed that you have not come to me to ask for a higher workload.” 

I was very surprised to receive this feedback based on my last 2 visits to her office, and a bit confused as I was not aware I was supposed to be *asking* for more work.

I am tentatively supposed to go for an on site interview next week (company has a strict three days a week in office policy), and if I weren’t out of work due to a layoff I would be long out of the process. 

The first thing that has me nervous is that this interview is supposed to be about two hours long with an as-yet unknown number of people. I’ll know more next week. This is not a management or executive job. I’ve never had a two-hour interview before at my level so this seems kind of crazy. I think I’m nervous about having to be “on” for that long and it feels like there are high stakes if I don’t click with one interviewer or don’t do as good of a job with Interviewer A than I did with Interviewer B.

The second reason is the commute and eventual relocation. As I said, they are three days in office with no exceptions…even when a well-liked employee moved to another city where they didn’t have an office they wouldn’t let her be remote. Until I can move I will have to commute by bus 2.5 hours each way three days a week. I’m worried I’ll feel burned out and will want a remote job or something closer to home sooner rather than later. And at 37, I’m a little more risk averse to relocation than I would have been 10 years ago. 

Any advice to help me be less nervous?

1,2023-01-13,Promotion delayed but offered a raise?,u/cat_ear_flipper,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10b74ts/promotion_delayed_but_offered_a_raise/,jobs,"Updated: turns out other people on my team got promoted today. Leadership held me back but not them (I wasn’t allowed to start the new projects I needed for promotion immediately because ‘my skills were needed to finish the existing projects’) and now promotion was out of time for me, but apparently, not them. 

Guess that says it all really. 


I’m in STEM, and after working freelance for a few years 2021 I accepted a junior position (say level 1) at a medium sized company because although I’d been working level 2 freelance, it’s tricky to prove. But I have a PhD and was told they would promote me quickly  back to a level 2 once I proved myself etc.

After 8 months in the role when I asked about promotion I was told no, because working on my current projects I’d been given, I couldn’t demonstrate the (fairly basic) experience they needed to tick off. My line manager arranges for me to get that experience, I tick it off, great feedback received etc and it seems all is good, and I’m going somewhere.

However apparently this month my promotion wasn’t finalised in time for this round of promotions (only done in Jan and June apparently) as one of the leadership team who was on leave. So I’m told it’s not happening this time, but no feedback on when. But I get a teams message from a director saying I’m getting a ‘merit based’ raise (but not what, I find out next week apparently). 

I’m pretty fucked off. This round about 10 people have been promoted, some of whom are very senior so I don’t think it’s budget and the company is doing well considering the economy. There is just zero communication from leadership and I feel like they are taking advantage tbh, I’m over qualified for my role, get great feedback and have lots of experience yet they won’t promote me? Maybe my face just doesn’t fit the company IDK.

I can afford to quit and look for another job. Frankly I don’t care I will take a job anywhere, but I just don’t want to feel unappreciated and shat on tbh. I’m nearly 40 with a PhD in an assistant role and it’s just embarrassing, everyone must think I’m shit at my job to still be at this level. But my feedback from managers is always great for attitude, ability etc - I just don’t get it. But maybe I’m an idiot for considering leaving a job with a decent wage in this climate just because I feel slighted they won’t do what they’ve promised and promote me. 

If anyone has any advice I’d be very grateful."

Not only that: the company is bigger, they say there's room for growth, it has a lot of other benefits beyond pay. I would have to move to a different city, though, so it would be a big change in my life. This new city has a lot more job opportunities than the city I'm in, though.

I don't think my old company would have enough money to make a counteroffer - not that much, anyway. I don't completely dislike my current job, although I have some moral issues (the company's political views are completely opposite from mine) but I always did my job professionally.

I was also recently promoted for my effort, and I was assigned three interns over time - the last one hasn't started yet. Overall, I do have a lot of autonomy, I can pretty much choose when I want to work on a task or the other, I can create new things to do for myself without having to wait for others to tell me what to do, and I do follow different and various activities, with a good degree of creativity.

I'm afraid in the new position I wouldn't have as much autonomy, and that the tasks assigned to me would be less various. I can't really know beforehand, though.

Also, I'm having a really hard time with the thought of leaving, thinking about how my boss would blame me for ditching her company after their faith and time spent on me, placing her in a pinch to find someone else to replace me while they're facing a hard time, and how irresponsible they would make me feel for agreeing on a new intern and bailing shortly after their arrival.

Should I switch jobs? How do I cope with my boss blaming me, in that case?"

i am working a part-time job in social media and it gives me a lot of stress because my managers are very incompetent. i am being given very last minute tasks (make up a graphic, a caption, wait for them to review it, and then having to redo it if they dislike it), and i am exhausted because this is my second part-time job, and i work around 45 hours per week. 

this is a hybrid position but i started working remotely first, and now they want us all to gradually transition into working into an office, starting one day a week, and then two, and you get the idea. 

i don't want to pursue a career into social media management/marketing after this. i would like to quit this as soon as possible but it's very hard finding other jobs right now. i need to save as much money as possible before i have to move out (currently living rent-free and have about 15k usd in savings, if i stay with this job, by may i should have \~22k usd in savings). we all work remotely pretty well but the senior management spent tons of money on a new building and now force us back into the office.

more than that i genuinely despise the work culture here. at my other part-time job it's optional to socialize with others and i greatly enjoy participating on my own! but here it's mandatory and it irritates me because I'm forced to pretend i am interested talking to people twice my age about how much i love this company when i don't. 

i do hope to get a better job soon and i am trying my best but it's so disheartening how whenever i do find jobs, its low hours, and a shit pay. i also need to go back to college and make sure i got enough savings to fall back on because i don't want to return to my toxic family.

this is more of a vent tbh but yeah i was just thinking if i maybe it's a good idea to allow myself to quit with the amount of savings i got right now to enjoy my spare time since i still have my another part-time job anyway. my manager told me she will do her best to see if my contract will get extended here so that would be great but i don't hold much hopes. i just really want to leave this place because it gives me tons of stress every day and i hate everyone here."

This job promised a lot of things were not fulfilled despite my extensive efforts and ruining my life at home. 
I do not get full time or the hours that I even requested, 30 hours a week. 
I reached out to several people in management including my supervisor. 
I make my own schedule and clients cancel on me despite any effort made to accommodate them. This has severely impacted my ability to pay my bills like nothing before. 
I was lied to so many times, or possibly scammed. 
I met with my supervisor and spoke on the phone with three people in upper management including a new employee mentor concerning my struggles. All of them told me to go to the next person and still no help. I went to my director 3 times to speak with her. I ended up sending an email about how not getting enough hours is affecting me personally. I travel, so I have to fill my car up twice a week. Sometimes it's not even more than $10. 
Last week I told them I was resigning and they offered more help with scheduling instead of just quitting. I did another week and it was worse. I couldn't believe that I was offered that help and still nothing for me to stay. On top of getting even less hours from clients due to their own personal reasons. 
I started applying to new jobs, and got an offer for the company my mom works in, same position different location. They gave me an interview and now I'm meeting next week for an in person intervenes. 
I spoke to my supervisor about this and was told that if I leave before 90 working days of being employed, I would have to repay the money for the training I went through. Which is over $2,000. I'm so stressed, infuriated and lost on what to do. I have literally never left a job like this before. It was never my intention. My supervisor keeps making small threats on top of that and guilt tripping me into staying because I would be abandoning my clients. I am mentally and physically exhausted. It isn't possible. I don't know what to do to get out of repaying this. I have tried to stick it out as long as possible. I felt like this the first month of working there. Please someone help.

She schedules people with disability to be there alone with no help, schedules minors alone at night. She even fired 2 people for disability and she made one employee verbally abuse another in order to make that one leave. There's even rumors of her being inappropriate with the male minors; touching and vulgar commentary. No one ever stays at that store more than a year or two (with the longer employees being the few on good terms, the ones who please her). She asks for when everyone is available, then ignores it.

I felt slightly bad that there's MLK holiday and I had also planned to take the Tuesday off as well (before the offer came along), so it technically wasn't 2 full business weeks but 8 business days. BTW My new job starts on Monday Jan 30th, and I intended to take a week off in between.

At that time, my manager was very busy in the middle of a conference in another city and she was taken aback by the news but the conversation went fine/civil. Couple days later (she's still at the conference), she called back asking for a few more days to ensure smooth transition as we're in the middle of a lot of different important activities. BTW we ALWAYS are busy. There is no good/chill time ever to resign just by the nature of our work. We also happen to be short of staff because honestly the senior management hasn't done a good job at retaining people. To clarify, they are still very decent people and treat everyone with respect etc. My manager has also been quite supportive of me and my career development with recognitions, early-ish promotion, raises etc and we have a good working relationship.

In any case, because I already felt guilty not giving them the full 2 business weeks I immediately and graciously offered 2 extra days (now I've given them 10 business days, 2 full business weeks), and my manager appreciated it. Thought we were done and good.

Then comes today, now my manager is finally back from the conference and during my call with her, she starts by asking if I could give them yet another few more days, which is understandable but she phrased it as ""I've been very supportive of you here and you've only really given me 3 business days for the transition"" with a bit of an aggressive tone. I mean that's just patently false - not even sure how she's counting! Sure it sucks that she had to be away due to a conference but I've been faithfully working all those time to wrap things up (I've been a high performer all along and she knows I've been at work all week) and it's not at all my fault that there's a conference this week, is it?

I was able to keep it cool but told her firmly that there's no more flexibility but that I'd be happy to hop on calls after my last day if necessary. This has left a bad taste in my mouth but I also wanted to see how you think about this. AITA for not giving my manager more time?"

3,2023-01-13,"SCAMMED by a fake ""HR Manager"" from ASOS",u/kateyblaire,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10bboge/scammed_by_a_fake_hr_manager_from_asos/,jobs,"I want to post this in case this has happened to anyone else recently AND so this possibly stops someone from getting somewhat scammed like I did.

I received an email a few days ago from Elia Simmons, HR Manager at Asos, who had a very legitimate-looking email address (info@asoscareers.info) saying that he found my profile on indeed.com and wanted to interview me for an Apparel Design position (which I'm very qualified for). It seemed like a great opportunity, for a remote position, to help on an as-needed basis that could eventually turn full time. We scheduled an interview for a few days later....

So today was the ""interview."" I'm prepping and looked up the recruiter/HR manager on linkedin. He had a profile, but with no picture and no connections. This was the first sign of suspicion, but I looked past it at first. Next, he wanted to do the interview via Skype. I thought this would be fine, so I messaged him with the link he previously emailed me and when it was time to start the interview, his responses were super delayed. I asked if I should call him, and he then replied that ""the process would be an instant text-based interview to monitor and appraise all section accuracy"" and to see first if I qualified for the position and to learn more about the company. He asked me to state my name and location and how I should be address, so I answered with my full name, city, state and nickname. But this started to make me very suspicious....

I will hopefully be able to post screenshots of the conversation and the point I called the ""recruiter"" out on being suspicious and eventually ending the conversation, but this is just a super weird fake job interview that I don't understand what the point would be of scamming someone in this fashion. Just wondering if this has happened to anyone else or if anyone has heard of this happening?"

They are willing to train with no experience necessary. They don't list an hourly wage but indicate that the yearly salary would range from $65,000 to $99,000. 36 and 48-hour weeks, 12 hour shifts. 

From what I gather from the reviews it seems that basically you get paid for the work that you do. And that sounds great, but I'm wondering how much the work will vary. Is it BS to work for a piece rate like this?

Also I'm curious about the working conditions. In the winter time would I have to wear a coat in the shop? General pros and cons would help me a lot. Thanks."

She is quite corporate and very process oriented. She is very by the books and standards. Offloading tasks is done more then delegating.

I am an agreeable, enthusiastic, flexible, collaborative employee. I need direct, clear communication. I have a hard time reading between lines, so that may be why we do not get along on a professional level.

She is a wonderful and funny lady to chat with, but our working styles just don't mesh. During our 1:1 meeting, she questioned performance and ability because of a task not being done according to instructions. However, they were done to instructions that I was given.

She said she doesn't want our office to look incompetent if I keep forgetting to do things or inaccurate or not by the deadline. I agree with this but I have also been doing 2 jobs (a colleague took sick leave) at the same time.

I don't feel like I'm in a psychologically safe workplace. She doesn't look at my calendar before scheduling things, but expects the team to drop everything for her meetings. She however won't make time for an urgent 10 min phone call from me. When we do daily team meetings to see what we are working on everyday, I feel like we are being micromanaged and graded based on how much we did that day. She inquired aloud during a meeting she wonders what I'm doing for the other 7 hours of my workday. I felt very publicly humiliated.

I ask for clarity or direction on some things. And then get told that we already discussed this or were you listening or I don't want to say this again. I don't feel comfortable bringing up things and feel like I need to think about each move I make to not rock the boat. I really dislike my office dynamic where the workload is high, communication is unclear or piecemeal, blame is placed, information is gatekept...

I can't even talk to anyone about this because my manager is the problem who is HR. But my managers manager the executive so I can't talk to him freely.

Am I being gaslighted?"

I’m 26 and have been working mostly full time since 18 and taking classes here and there. When I was a bit younger changing jobs often, working multiple jobs, “just trying something” felt a lot more acceptable. Especially when just about any role I took was entry level. Currently I’m a property and casualty insurance agent selling personal lines insurance (home, auto, toys). It’s only been 7 months, but this job has been particularly rocky. I’ve noticed that just “being good with people” doesn’t take me as far as it usually does. Besides for being decently smart, following rules, and being reliable I’d say that’s been 90% of what has made me successful in other roles. It’s not that I don’t want to do ANYTHING technical.  I’m a very goal-oriented person and enjoy taking the reigns. 

Some of the roles I’ve been in with cliff notes:

* Working in a group home with bipolar patients. I was VERY good at this. Setting boundaries with staff and clients while being kind came very naturally. I did things like cook big meals for the house. Picking up extra hours. Taking clients on fun outings and doing some extra cleaning around the house. I generally felt well-liked and respected. I was promoted to a lead position.

* Car Sales. I knew the hours/pay of human services wasn’t sustainable. Plus I had multiple clients die in close succession- it’s a job you take home with you. Sales was pretty natural. More stress as far as “performance” you can’t just be nice and hard working, they need results. Especially frustrating when it’s not consistently in your control. But I was doing pretty well. Being well-liked helped me get training and advice from my coworkers. I LOVED teaching people. It sounds odd, but my favorite part by far was walking people through the credit process. And generally teaching people who “don’t know how it works” how the car-buying process works.

* Assistant to a pair of financial advisors. I got this job thinking it could be a path to sales + consultation. Obviously there would be lots of technical exposure. I hated it.. working for only 2 people with no direct coworkers, stuck behind the scenes. Plenty to learn but I felt swamped with menial tasks.

* Life insurance intern/front desk. Super fun. I didn’t provide a list of friends and family as leads. I was paid to learn a lot, participate in group sales meetings, and explain the benefits of life insurance over and over. 

* Account Exec for a copier company. Honestly this is the biggest one I regret not sticking out. I worked with about 7 coworkers directly, and 200 at monthly sales meetings. I didn’t love my boss, but I had no trouble cold-calling and setting appointments with businesses. Copiers aren’t a sexy product, but they’re necessary. I enjoyed business to business, people were generally professional and kind. Boyfriend and I broke up- couldn’t afford the area alone and they wouldn’t let me transfer so early in. 

* Call center temp- it was just a gig when I moved back home. Explaining HSAs. I really liked it. The whole “cog on a wheel thing” sucked, a computer randomly assigned 15 minute breaks and even tracked bathroom time. But basically all I did was answer questions.

* Bartending - I got paid a living wage to work 3-4 days a week and talk to people ALL day long. Loved that. Stuck to it for way too long. Messed with my joints and I dealt with a rough crowd. I moved on in 3 years because I wanted to focus on my future. I felt myself getting dumber bullshitting all day.

* Bank teller - honestly I suck at math. Especially when overwhelmed. But following procedures is my cup of tea. The pay was way too low for the responsibility. At this point I was done working multiple jobs or weird hours. The clientele and coworkers were great. I just would have rather been in lending and couldn’t justify years working to get there.

* Insurance agent- where I am now. I feel crazy distracted and overwhelmed. My biggest complaint is I’m constantly getting jerked around. Answer all of the calls, take this bad lead, we need you to do our accounting, I’m too busy- do this for me. Very little training, varied and unpredictable responsibilities, perfection is expected. I LOVE talking to clients and being helpful. But I hate being pushed around. I’m a hard worker, but for me driving the ship is SO much better than whatever falls from the sky onto my desk. Especially with larger projects in-between. I might have 16 hours of focused work to do in a week but have 0 ability to time block or plan ahead. Constant surprise big tasks or urgent “do this now!” Ordeals. 

I plan to stick out another year and a half. Insurance is a big field. But I want an end game. This is a 5 year plan max. This is NOT an environment where I can thrive. I just want some financial/career stability and to know enough to dangerous.

I’m amazing with people and driven. Is sales the obvious choice?"
1,2023-01-13,How can I handle multiple job offers?,u/Super-Dealer1816,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10bfrp3/how_can_i_handle_multiple_job_offers/,jobs,"Every night I think about this what to say to them if I get jobs offers, even if it is in the retail store? Suppose I got a job in both Walmart, and Lowe's (both of which are supposedly my top choices) for temporary position, and I decided to commit to Lowe for temporary due to them letting me work in flexible schedule where I can pick any hours based on my availability. However, I supposedly get let go from Lowe's in good terms 90 days later, probably because of budget cuts or my temporary contract with company is over.

The question is would I able to join Walmart without doing multi-steps interview all over again, and having needs of answering extra conceptual questions. I mean to say if there is possibilities to defer my job offer for Walmart for 90 days? I know they can of course give my spot to another applicant, but it would nice if they give me spot as long as I committed to Walmart within 180 deferral days.

I heard I can defer my job for Engineering/Tech companies for specific period for time, most of them allows up to 90-180 days? I want to know if it can be same for Walmart, where job offer can be deferred for specific period?

\[Note : I do realized that the interview won't guarantee me a job, and subjected to change based on how many spots available for applicants. I applied to both Walmart, and Lowe's, so that I can join Walmart in case Lowe's denied me the offer. Lowe's in my opinion got pretty competitive ever since our state (NYS) significantly raised minimum wage over the years. It is very true to Walmart, and other retail stores too.\]"

I don’t want to schlep down there every week such a waste of time and gas. I’ve done the job for other companies and it’s always been remote even when I started 10 years ago.

But I guess that's the ""reply.""
      
Is that normal? I expect lack of response from external recruiters because of the large pool of applicants. But it just feels weird to get that from your own company. And I'm feeling burned because my note was short but thoughtful. 
    
And I am frustrated with my job and frustrated I can't find anything else after years of searching. Maybe it's clear I'd dislike that team even more. And that I should still push on and keep looking elsewhere. The search is so difficult. And everything feels futile."

It was well paid, a really great contract. Unfortunately, the start of the job coincided with a number of events in my personal life and there was just some really bad timing that resulted in a full blown mental health emergency. I had to quit during my first week citing personal matters that I needed to urgently take care of. They were understanding but also upset because my skills are relatively niche (even though I am only a recent graduate) and they need someone soon to get the project going but it will take a long time for them to fill my position again. I said I was sorry and reiterated that me leaving has nothing to do with their company or their team. I also told them it was better to go right now rather than in 2 months so that I wouldn't waste everyone's time. So they sent me the end of contract letter and we parted in ""relatively"" good ways although I assumed we'd never see each other again.

Now a couple weeks later, I'm much more stable and my health is under control. I do know that the company hasn't yet filled my position. This is not in the US and finding skilled employees is hard, plus hiring processes are long and involve multiple interviews. Could I just try and send them an email explaining very politely that I am free now and if they want they can take me into consideration? They would have to re-prepare the training all over again but it's still gonna be easier than preparing it for someone else and going through the hiring process. Or should I just not bother?"

The owner told me it was paid training and even mentioned getting my hours up after the other employees go back to college. So after the first week goes, I expected an update to my schedule from the email that sent my training schedule, but I got nothing. So I checked the website that the email was based on and I couldn't find anything relating to schedules anywhere on it. So I emailed the owner directly about it. No response.  I lost my voice a while ago (bronchitis) so I couldn't call, but I emailed them about the doctor's note I had just in case... no response. As soon as I was able to barely speak, I called and the person who answered said that they'd tell the owner but still no update on that. I'm worried I'm not gonna get paid at all or I got fired or something and they just forgot to tell me? I don't know, I'm just overthinking. I wanted to wait another day because I know some jobs wait till the 15th and 30th of the month to send paychecks.. but I'm getting a bad feeling from this I guess. Is there anything I can do other than bugging them by calling and emailing more? Thanks!

Some background info: 
Last year I (26F) gratuated from a bachelor mechanical engineering and I was planning to enroll in a master degree right away. However, there would have been some overlap between the two universities. I contacted the University and I can start with my master next year. No problem. 

Now, I found a great job within the field and I am learning and enjoying myself a lot (they know that I am planning to stay for one year). Some of my colleagues have a master degree, but I am doing similar work and managing just fine. First decent paycheck in forever and stable working hours. Meaning I can finally start my life/boyfriend/house/dog/car ect..

I feel that working experience is as valable, or even more valable than another degree. But ""choosing the money"" feels like I am setting for less somehow. 

My questions:
Is a Master degree worth it? 
Is there somebody out there that regrets not doing a Master degree? 

Thank you!"

I've been working at a place for six months. It's a remote travel company doing reservations/data entry/document management. My boss is really hands off unless he has to correct me, and he also lets me work 8:30-5 and doesn't hassle me about working OT or working weekends, so I like that a lot.

However, I find that my workload is increasing, and it's hard to get everything done. Nobody tells me outright to work faster and they seem understanding, but my coworker is taking a two-week vacation and I'm supposed to cover for him + do my own work. This will set me back a lot, which bothers me because we have a guy on our team who is supposed to help but he 100% refuses to do any work and he is still employed there. 

I'm not exaggerating. He does absolutely nothing, and management told us they're taking care of it but it's been going on two months now. 

How do I not care and not have anxiety about all this work? Things won't get done, but it's not my fault. I'm working my 40 hours and was working almost every second of my shift, and now covering for someone will put me back. Plus I'm constantly asked to do more and more, and yet my pay isn't increasing. I'm struggling to not care."

I've a hard time convincing my parents that remote jobs are safe and that the future of the working model will be like this. ( For Remote Software Engineer )

Here are the points that they are using for their argument,

1. Job Security
2. You can get the same salary even in full-time jobs, then why this unwanted risk?
3. You'll lose social skills (already I'm an introvert in nature) and you cannot build networks.
4. Recession fear: Why the risks at this time?

They have the mentality of working for the same company throughout their lifetime and have a dependency on their bosses.

Dear ""Remote Job Posters"" and ""Remote Job seekers"", 

* why do prefer remote jobs over the points mentioned above and how do you convince them?
* why you're looking for remote engineers?





Update 1: Thanks for your supportive comments guys. I can see a few cmts blaming my parents for not saving much to survive on their own. But I'm more than grateful to them for spending all their money ONLY for my education and expenses to get a graduation and my first job.(I'm the first graduate in my family)

So, It's my time to pay them back in terms of taking good care of them as they are not working anymore and I got a well paying job right before their retirement. And I feel even though they're my dependents, there is nothing wrong in taking their consents for taking my own life changing decisions. (I'm in my early 20s and just started my career). 

And I guess their arguments are at some level valid to me, so, all I'm looking for are some valid counter points to make them understand that remote jobs are a new working culture going forward. (I got a few notable comments from successful remote workers, which gives me more confidence! Special thanks to everyone!)"

Hello everyone. I am an eastern-U.S. based student currently in the final semester of my 4-year undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering, with an elective concentration in energy based processes. In September of last year I began my search for full time entry level positions by sending a lot of applications to various companies. I’ve known since I was a child that I wanted to live in the Rockies, so I focused my efforts there. Almost immediately, I received a request to interview with “Company A,” a Fortune 500 firm that participates in contracting work with the U.S. Department of Energy. I completed the interview with three of their engineers and received a lucrative offer just two days after the interview, which I readily accepted. 

However, a representative from “Company B,” which is actually a state government, contacted me yesterday and informed me that they would like to interview me for a position that I applied for back in September, as the number of applicants has been lower than they were expecting. Considering this, I feel that I already would have an upper hand in going into a hypothetical interview with Company B, as there aren’t many other applicants that they could draw on to fill the position. The problem is that while the representative promised to stay in touch if I agreed to an interview, the formal interview process would not start until March, while Company A would like me to start in late May or early June.

I’m just wondering if it would be wise to proceed with an interview with Company B given their timeline and if I did, and subsequently received an offer, how I could leverage my first offer from Company A to my advantage in negotiations. 

Edit: Company A would require me to move to eastern Idaho while Company B would require a move to Wyoming. Company A already agreed to fully fund my relocation, should I go that route.

Thank you!"

My role is primarily communications, brand development, and promotion for fundraising purposes (but I'm not the fundraiser).

The primary problems are:

1. **Late and incorrect paycheck**. Because I was scheduled to be paid on Dec. 31, I couldn't find out about the delay until Jan. 3. The issue was finally resolved in Jan. 6 with a lot of back and forth and numerous calls to the direct deposit system. When the check did hit my account, it was $300 short, but that was addressed by Jan. 10. Sigh, I was supposed to have my full paycheck at the start of New Year's Eve.
2. **Bait-and-switch**. The job description, interview, new hire paperwork, and information on the website are all for one type of company. However, I received information during my second week on the job that my employer actually changed to another company under a cost-sharing agreement. I had no warning about this and may have declined to take the job had I know how unstable the organization's finances are.
3. **No onboarding documentation**. The position was vacant for nearly a year, so the CEO handled the main responsibilities. This translated into inconsistent fonts, photos, distribution timelines for goods, and some tasks simply left undone. Now, I'm left to pick up the pieces and take on the assignments with no guide (brand, style, communications, schedule, etc.), so I often find myself frustrated and confused.
4. **Overextended CEO**. The org's leader is a middle-aged woman with three children and is taking care of her sibling who is in the final stages of a fatal illness. The sibling's ailment leads to frequent doctor's visits, emergency departments stays, and tons of medication. The CEO feels obligated to help as she can, which means meetings and other information are often delayed.  
Another element of CEO's packed life is that her youngest child has recently been diagnosed as neurodivergent. She's gone into her office space and taken calls from the school about it.

I really would like to keep the job. But, I find myself endless annoyed, angry and disappointed in everything.

2,2023-01-14,How do I keep my job at a barely functioning organization?,u/AllIWantisSOPs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10bqa6b/how_do_i_keep_my_job_at_a_barely_functioning/,jobs,"Last month, I started a new job as a strategic outreach specialist with a small organization. My role is primarily communications, brand development, and promotion for fundraising purposes (but I'm not the fundraiser).

The primary problems are:

1. **Late and incorrect paycheck**. Because I was scheduled to be paid on Dec. 31, I couldn't find out about the delay until Jan. 3. The issue was finally resolved in Jan. 6 with a lot of back and forth and numerous calls to the direct deposit system. When the check did hit my account, it was $300 short, but that was addressed by Jan. 10. Sigh, I was supposed to have my full paycheck at the start of New Year's Eve.
2. **Bait-and-switch**. The job description, interview, new hire paperwork, and information on the website are all for one type of company. However, I received information during my second week on the job that my employer actually changed to another company under a cost-sharing agreement. I had no warning about this and may have declined to take the job had I know how unstable the organization's finances are.
3. **No onboarding documentation**. The position was vacant for nearly a year, so the CEO handled the main responsibilities. This translated into inconsistent fonts, photos, distribution timelines for goods, and some tasks simply left undone. Now, I'm left to pick up the pieces and take on the assignments with no guide (brand, style, communications, schedule, etc.), so I often find myself frustrated and confused.
4. **Overextended CEO**. The org's leader is a middle-aged woman with three children and is taking care of her sibling who is in the final stages of a fatal illness. The sibling's ailment leads to frequent doctor's visits, emergency departments stays, and tons of medication. The CEO feels obligated to help as she can, which means meetings and other information are often delayed.  
Another element of CEO's packed life is that her youngest child has recently been diagnosed as neurodivergent. She's gone into her office space and taken calls from the school about it.

I really would like to keep the job. But, I find myself endless annoyed, angry and disappointed in everything.

2,2023-01-14,New Hire Question,u/lomarti457,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10bqcva/new_hire_question/,jobs,"I excepted a position with a company that pays fairly well for my degree. The salary range was 57,000 to 71,000. I was offered 64,500. My main duties would consist of traveling to local vendors as in industrial sports medicine professional. The job requires quite a bit of travel from my home. The closest store is 45 minutes away, and once a week I need to make a four hour round-trip drive to a city nearby. Mileage is reimbursed from location to location, but not from my house to the location. The four hour round-trip would be mostly reimbursed, and the hours do count towards my weekly 40

I got an email today that the company opened up the exact same role, but for locations within 10 minutes from my house. Is it inappropriate to ask if I could switch to that route? I am aware the pay scale may change, but the amount of driving time that I would save , would benefit myself and my family so much."

So i was working a `contract temp job` at a global hvac company through a little staffing company.  It was told to me 6 months then evaluation and renew;  now 2 weeks before it is 3 months, no evaluation nor renew.

This job was rough on me in multiple ways,  including
* the staffing company didn't pay me every other pay period which is against state labor laws,  i had to spend 2 weeks every time chasing down payment past due while continuing to do my full job. 
* my supervisor said it didn't matter that i was not receiving my pay and that he can't make the staffing company pay me
* boss and coworkers repeatedly refused to answer my questions that were necessary for me to do my job
* boss insulted my profession,  then later my name,  then later my phd, all while laughing in my face. 

Here's what bothers me the most:  my job was to develop tableau dashboards for their incoming cloud data to help employees,  installers,  and end users.  I made a whole suite that are indexed with a dashboard linking them all together and navigation throughout.  I also started submitting status and error reports,  investigating why certain logs did not reach the tableau database. 

But i can see access stats and neither the boss nor the employee who set up the little data pull have even looked at any of my work.  To boot,  3 reports last week and as always,  silence from them.  Reports that they requested. 

So i feel like i did all that work for nothing as they are purposely ignoring its existence,  and i feel like their company would greatly benefit from using what i have produced here. 

My question is,  so i have 2 weeks left going in to this job And i don't have anything more that needs to be done as the dashboards and connecting framework have been competed for quite some time,  and no response to my 3 reports nor direction to go in next to help the group.  Do you think I'm probably just going to be sitting at my desk for the last two weeks?  (In spite of the above,  I've no intention to quit).

I'd rather keep contributing,  but they've funneled me into a dead end.  So i don't know how to spend my last 2 weeks there."

I had a mentor/former boss share with me that I wasn't competing against others in my organization but competing against myself.

This came up one year when I was pissed off at the bonus/raise I got. I told him I was upset because I outperformed others in the organization and our department.

He told me a story of a time when he felt the same and how his boss shared with him some perspective that helped him understand the process.

He wasn't competing against others in the organization but against himself the previous year. If he wasn't growing and learning, then why get a higher bonus than someone who grew and developed?

Some could take offense to this and be upset. But it helped me take control of my future in a way I previously had not."

I work for a small business. It’s fine but there’s no benefits and I’m trying to move up but nowhere seems to want to hire me. 

I’m currently getting my MS in IO Psych. I’ve basically taken research classes for like 30 weeks (3 classes, not including undergrad) until I can take classes that don’t make me want to rip out my hair.

Recently, my class needs us to get certified for a “human study” (it’s so we can post a survey) BUT I was browsing around and found a “Conflict Resolution” certification I’m in the middle of.

My questions are: 

- Will these certifications make a difference if I add them to my resume? 

- What are good certifications to have added that might impress job prospects? 

- Should I add that I’ve basically taken almost a year of research/stats courses?

- What are jobs that I can look out for?"
1,2023-01-14,Looking for strategic career advice on when to do a UX bootcamp,u/milkbug,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10bwu57/looking_for_strategic_career_advice_on_when_to_do/,jobs," I just landed my first job in tech doing customer service at a SaaS start up. Currently, I have an associates degree in art psychology but that is my only educational credential. I'm currently doing the Google Ux course, and I'm reading The Design of Everyday Things. I've taken quite a lot of art classes and know my way around adobe Photoshop/Illustrator, but I'm by no means a graphic designer. I'm familiar with the tools and understand the concepts of design theory and color theory.

The company I work for is very UX centric, and I've noticed that quite a few of the people on the UX team at my company have done bootcamps and/or have taught at them. The thing is, I'm very new to this industry and my company (almost been there for 3 months), so I'm wondering if I should focus more of my energy on self study, moving up from my current role, and networking within my company before attending a bootcamp.

There is one I've been looking at that is pretty affordable, and it even has scholarships for women/diversity (am neurodiverse), but I'm not sure if I would actually get the scholarship at this point. I'm thinking that if I focus more on making myself visible in my company, I would maybe be more likely to get a scholarship since a few of the people at my company have gone to the bootcamp I'm looking at. Also, if I do some more self study, then once I am in the bootcamp I think I will get more out of the experience. At the same time, I don't want to prevent myself from doing something that could advance my career and needlessly prolong the process.

I'm eager to advance as quickly as I can because due to my neurodivergence I'm pretty sensitive, so working in CX can be very draining. I'm actually quite good at it because I'm highly detail oriented, persistent, and empathetic, but I can already feel the stress build of from having to talk to people all day. I believe my strengths could be useful elsewhere and healthier for my mental state.

I would very much appreciate any advice on this, as I know my path and personality is a bit on the unconventional side, but I do see this as a possible strength to be cultivated."

I loved that it kept me in shape, having me walking all around the property and going up and down stairs and lifting things and moving things around, and I loved the social aspects of it with being part of a big management team and overseeing a large staff. 

But I left because of the hours and the lack of growth and development, and the low pay. It was a nights, weekends, and holiday gig. Sometimes, I didn’t get home until 4 in the morning. My pay was capped at $24/hour. Anything after that, it would have been a salary gig, no overtime, needing to be available 24/7, no work-life balance. 

After that job, I landed an office job in project management. I got a bump by a couple dollars an hour, and they’re pretty understanding of any OT I need to put in. I’m hating the sedentary lifestyle. I work from home most of the time but even if I go into the office, I’m just at a desk all day with zero team-dynamics other than that with my direct boss and the project director. I’ve put on weight and I’ve become lazier in my personal life, and it’s affecting my mental health. Just like my last job, any shot of career advancement would be into a salary gig where I’d have no work-life balance. 

I’m approaching my mid-30s and I hate that I haven’t been able to breach $30/hr

I want a job that’ll give me a solid hourly pay, that’ll be a 9-6, Mon-Fri gig, that’ll keep me on my feet and moving. I need to be part of a team. 

I have no idea where to look. Any suggestions?"

I exaggerated my qualifications (not intentionally, I was just trying to phrase myself as professionally as possible to make me a more appealing candidate), writing that I had 7 years of experience in research.

After reviewing my resume, my recruiter contacted me to dedicate a paragraph in my cover letter to elaborate on these experiences. As soon as I got this response, I realized that I had given a rosier picture than was true. The fact is that for 7 years I tried to graduate from college, retrying my thesis several times, taking a mental break because of COVID and my own depression, and trying to write papers through most of that. Technically speaking ""research"", although in hindsight I realize this is quite a stretch. Additionally, my previous major was also a major which factored in a lot of research, but again, a bit of a stretch.

I don't want to start my career lying about my qualifications, but I also really want this job. I am very anxious about what to do right now. I want to be honest, but I'm afraid that I will lose every opportunity to get this job. Nevertheless, it does seem that they are hiring a lot of people as a friend of mine has applied to the same job independently of me. It's also something which I've been frequently approached for even before graduating, because the company has a lot of good experiences with people with my Major.

Therefore, my question is: what should I do?

Hi, I'm 15 in the UK, autistic and looking for a Saturday/weekend job to get some extra cash but I can't see anything working. Firstly finding jobs that will take a 15-year-old is rare especially when you are looking online, then most of the time you will have to go and ask in person which is just a no. If it is an online application they will call you if they want to offer you something, which is also a struggle for me, so I say please text or email me instead but I think that scares them away and now I'm just stuck.

also, the types of jobs that 15-year-olds can do are all the same sort of things like a waitress or shop worker and these ones would really stress me out."

1. HR to do the preliminary phone screening,
2. A face to face meeting with the hiring manager that lasted 2 hours.
3. An all day interview-a-thon with 10-11 sessions of around 45 minutes each. The hiring manager that day said he wasn't sure I was technical enough and wanted more.
4. A six hour group technical interview with 8 top engineering managers. I took them from the top level of architecture (comparing architecture frameworks) all the way down to talking about the effects of selecting the correct IP protocol and all points in between.

At the end of each interview, I always ask what may be considered an unusual question, ""How did I do?"" Every single one of them said I was the guy for the job. The final day had HR all excited telling me they would be in touch with me and the hiring manager telling me they really found something unique in my skill set.

The next day, the HR guy called me up to tell me they were not going to offer me the job. When I inquired why, he said he didn't have anything official, but he suspected the hiring manager was worried I would take his job.

(Here’s an explanation how the timesheets work) 
For the workdays on the 1st-15th we get paid on the 26th and for the workdays on the 16th-last day of the month, we get paid on the 10th of the next month. Our timesheets work by clocking in and out at the clients home from an app on our phones. So after our last working hour on the 15th or last day of the month we’re able to submit the timesheets for payroll processing. For the three years I’ve been here we have a two day period to submit them, so the 17th and 2nd was the last day to submit. Which I think is a reasonable time. Our clients also have this timeframe to sign the timesheets. The office has 8-9 days to process the timesheets and pay us which is longer than any of my other jobs has taken to do this. 

The emails they have been sending out say the new timesheets cut off dates are now the 15th and the last day of the month so the last days of the pay periods. Reading the emails I thought it was a little crazy because on some of those days I don’t get off work until 10:30pm or 11:00pm meaning I’d have less than two hours to realize the date and submit them. The timesheets app doesn’t show the date or anything like that to help either.

I’ve always submitted my timesheets within the two day period, I’ve never been late. But those two days really help. I figured I’d just have to try a little harder to pay attention to dates. What I didn’t know is what the consequences are. 

I received an email yesterday saying I submitted my timesheets for the 16th-31st of December late (I submitted the morning of the 1st). It said they have made a one time exception but starting now if the timesheets are late then my payment won’t process until the next payroll period! Meaning I’d have to live off one check for a whole month. 

The even more frustrating part is now all five of my clients have to sign the timesheets within 24 hours of me submitting them or my payment will also be withheld. This is putting my clients in an uncomfortable place because if one of them forgets then they’ll feel bad because I won’t be getting paid the rest of the month. I already message all of them when I submit them so they can sign them but guess what? Parents are busy, especially parents of developmentally disabled kids. 

I can see when a time sheet has been signed by a family but I can’t even see which families signed them meaning I’d have to be pestering five families about who hasn’t signed them yet and waiting for responses only having 24 hours to do so or I won’t get paid for a month. 

I’m debating quitting because I can’t risk not getting paid for a whole month because I submitted them a few hours late. I’m also thinking about asking my clients if they want to switch to a new company with me since I’ve grown close with them and their families over these three years. If I do quit I wouldn’t know how to word it or do it because I’ve never done that. Any advice is welcome."

2,2023-01-14,Bosses seem to be holding a grudge against me since I started school -- need advice,u/sphinoid,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10c34em/bosses_seem_to_be_holding_a_grudge_against_me/,jobs,"Thanks in advance to whoever reads this, I'll try to keep it brief. Will provide context for anything in the comments if needed.

For about 8 months I worked full time for this company. It is a small business with a few locations in my state and those adjacent. For privacy I don't want to reveal exactly what it is. I had taken a semester break from college to apply for a competitive career program within the school.

School is/was about 35 hours a week, so naturally my hours had to decrease, but I tried to compensate by putting extra effort into my job and picking up extra shifts when I could. By all accounts from current/former employers/coworkers, I was and am an excellent employee, and I was redoubling my efforts during this time. I had/have good relationships with everyone at work except the bosses.

Fast forward to now, despite nothing changing about my behavior, my bosses are treating me like a pariah and talking behind my back.

I had hoped to bump my hours back up to 30/wk during winter break to save up money, but struggled to be put on the schedule for more than 1 day. This is not for a lack of shifts, either; during the time we were scrambling for new hires and everyone but me was getting stretched thin. I communicated multiple times in person and over text to Boss 1 that I wanted extra time and could work any/all days of the week, but this request was ignored (she later blamed it on me for ""not telling her"").
 
If someone asked me to cover their shift and I agreed? Boss 2 would come up to them later and tell them not to give me any extra time and made up a reason why like ""he's only part time and doesn't need extra hours"".

If I stayed late to help with a crunch while others leave early? I get blamed again for similar reasons.

I learned a difficult, in demand skill to up my value as an employee and show my dedication? Boss 1 makes a stank face and says it could be better.

I have held this job for a year now, and had intended to keep it for at least 2 more while I found my feet. This industry is one with a very high turnover rate; many new hires don't make it to a month. I genuinely enjoy and take pride in what I do. If it weren't for this management I would have no issue coming in every day indefinitely. But seriously, I get the sense that my bosses are petulant that I put school first, and want to catch me out on anything except my actual performance. The scapegoating really is ridiculous sometimes.

Please note also that my strategy for dealing with this thus far has been to keep my head down and try not to stir anything up while keeping up my performance.

I just don't know if it's worth it to stick around or not. The pay is good and the day to day work not too bad, and Boss 1 and 2 are both fake nice to my face. But I know I am being undervalued at least. On the other hand, I hate job searching. Any advice on what to do would be appreciated."

I have gotten my footing into what I do and feel good about handling my day to day—while I’m not “crushing it” yet, I’m meeting KPIs and feel like my roadmap to success is finally visible and attainable. This is a place I could see myself staying for a while and I like our work culture/the people I work with.

However, I turn 30 at this year and my boyfriend and I are talking about being engaged before the end of 2023 and starting a family shortly after getting married. Having kids is about 2 years away right now.

Our company was recently acquired and they just announced that we are adopting a new maternity leave policy. When I started our policy was 12 weeks paid. Now it’s going to be 3 weeks paid, 5 weeks short term disability with 60% pay.

Honestly it’s very jarring to have such a shift. More than half of our staff are young women.

I’m not sure what to do. I wanted to wait to have 1-1.5 years under my belt before moving into something else. But with the timeline of my life, I’m at a crossroads.

I'm now filling out applications for short-term summer jobs and would love to list this skill, as it is highly relevant to the positions I am trying to score. I feel uncomfortable with just straight-up listing it on my resume, since I'm just learning it, but I also don't want to undersell myself and make it seem like I have no experience with it (particularly because by the time I would start a summer position, I would likely be decently proficient in this new language I'm learning).

In my city, craigslist is pretty much strictly used for three jobs: HVAC, trucker, and salon both rental, and of course the rideshare/food delivery spam.  Indeed has...sales.  Sales and sales and sales, and despite me setting the geographic location to my city, it still shows me sales jobs on the other side of the country.

Obviously it's not 100%, but I'd be lying if I didn't say it was 90+% HVAC/trucker/salon booth rental on craigslist and 95+% sales on Indeed.  I'm not even sorting by a category, those are just what come up.

I'm not living in the middle of nowhere.  It's a reasonably large metro.  It's not one with a particularly specific job market like New York, Los Angeles, or the Bay Area, but I figured there would be more than I'm seeing.  Maybe I need to look longer, maybe I need to sign up for different sites, maybe...I don't know.  But I'm not qualified to drive a semi, I'm not good at sales, I don't have any technical training for something like HVAC, and I don't know how to cut hair, so I feel like I'm exceptionally limited here."

Obviously, there must be dark sides for working from the remote. I mean I'm NOT referring to the disadvantages of remote work (which are manageable though) like,
1. No social interaction
2. Not a good work-life balance ....etc


But, I'm looking for the serious reasons which forces them to go back to work from office apart from above reasons? 

What makes you regret choosing the wrong decision to work remotely?

Earlier this year, a recruitment officer at a company was talking with one of my club advisors about me and they said they might be willing to hire me. Communication went on for a week or two between them but went cold (idk why) and I didn't hear anything about it for a while.

A month ago, I sent an email to the company asking about possible internship opportunities and attached my resume, mentioning the previous communication. I still have no response and I feel like it might be due to the subject line of my email, which was ""Employment Inquiry"", which seems like it could get easily lost in an inbox.

In the position that I recently left, I had attained a PhD. Little did I know that this could be a problem later.

My areas of work in higher-education have been 1st as a technology librarian and one to provide library instruction. 
2nd,  I earned my PhD in Education  (specifically Instructional Design and Technology). I applied this toward my work for 10 years.
Lastly, I was had the position of Academic Coach to help students.  Primarily,  I helped guide them in research.  I did this from Bchelors, Masters, to Doctoral levels.

I seek advice on the ""perfect"" positions I discover that only require a bachelor's degree. My best credentials are at grad level.

Any suggestions and/advice is greatly appreciated.

Was it because I wasn't White? Was it because I am older? The new employee is clearly younger than me and was White - prior to me, other previous employees have been White.

I try to not let these things get to me and make me overthink, but when you're a WOC and struggle to navigate the world of professionalism, it does get to you and it makes you question a lot of things about yourself, no matter how qualified you are.

Now, suddenly there's work available. I'm happy to see that their business is finally picking up to a point where they could hire someone again.

What gets to me is that my former boss said that they'd contact me if things change. My former boss never did.

I found out the news when I saw my boss post about the new employee yesterday. They talked about the employee's accomplishments and how excited they were to be joining the company.

My former boss did no such thing for me.

Needless to say, it broke my heart. I cried yesterday and today. I finally stopped crying enough to be able to post here.

I'm trying to find a job and run a business. I struggled a lot last year and even considered taking my life a few times due to struggling with work. Thankfully, my loved ones have been supportive and my therapist has been great.

Sorry if this isn't the place for this type of post but I'm trying to set up a meeting with my bosses soon on this and I worry that I might start crying! lol

Basically, I need to tell them about all the communication problems I have with them and the manager, leading to frazzled running around and Bullshitting my job. I have asked for clarification on multiple occasions but I feel like I'm being brushed off or they explain in a way that makes sense to them because they've worked there forever but I'm only a year in and they get annoyed when I ask for more clarification. 

The problem I have is that they are very defensive about their business (it's a small business) and I want to come across as wanting to point out these problems in order to help grow the business and be a better employee for them. It's a great place to work but if these problems are fixed it would be even better. 

I just don't know how to present these things in a manner that isn't like ""Here are all the things WRONG with your business, please fix them asap okay thanks bye!"" lol 

I hate confrontation so I want it to be a productive meeting. I also don't wanna cry (that's more on me and my anxiety) but I also think it's because I didn't express myself well enough so I panic and back off or just start crying lol

Do I:

\-make a list of all the problems I see and maybe some examples (to prove that I'm struggling basically)? Maybe offering possible solutions?

Ex) Communication between Owners/Manager to employees (I'll just mention myself) is lacking. Examples a b and c. A possible solution is a better system and checks and balances to insure everyone is on the same page. 

\-express my feelings in a way that, because of these issues, my performance of my job is more difficult than it needs to be? 

Ex) Lack of communication between the owners/manager and myself leaves me feeling frustrated and most of the time not spending my energy in a productive way. I'm left running around doing tasks haphazardly rather than in an orderly fashion. We need a better system of communicating changes/expectations that aren't just word of mouth and need a better explanation of those changes/expectations. As well as a sign-off from everyone who needed to know of these changes/expectations so that we all are on the same page and no one is surprised of a change in their tasks/job etc.

I could just write an email but I don't want them thinking ""where is all this coming from you never complained before!"".  I want to prepare for my meeting but I want to be professional and not emotional.

Please if you have advice I would appreciate it!"

I have been trying to obtain the job I have for a few years. Taking the time to learn as much as I can, gather as much experience as I can and perfect the craft. I've never had a job that paid as well as this one with so little direct supervision (I've previously been a supervisor for a few years). 

Now while I know that I know what I am doing, and I am confident in my abilities, I am not sure the company does. I was veted by a previously employed friend before starting and actually got the interview and job offer before the job even got posted to job boards.

My concern is that I am not busy enough but when I ask what I can do to maintain being busy or to even have anything to do, they don't seem to be to worried about me not being busy. 
I think this concern comes as I am the first in my family to have this type of success (family has always struggled with money and I grew up poor) financially with very little work. 

How do I over come this if the company is not concerned about it?

Side note: it's slow season. Come summer in the Midwest I'll be very busy non stop from June to November no matter how efficient or good is m at my job. This is the nature of the industry I am in."

The obvious thing to do is look for another job at another place. I'm afraid to take the leap, get paid significantly less, and still be stressed.

Also I feel like I am doing my family a disservice if I take a lower paying position in this crazy world of inflation.

Being in the office is particularly useless in my case considering that half of the teams I work with don’t even work out of the same office as I do.

The real reason is I want to just travel and bounce from place to place, but obviously you need to formulate a better argument to your employer. There’s no meaningful difference in how well I work home vs office and their return to office is “building culture” or something, so I’m trying to think what I can offer them under the new arrangement.

2,2023-01-15,If I got the 4-40 Florida Insurance Customer Service Insurance License could I strictly do customer service with that license and NOT SALES?,u/nelsne,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10cfzlv/if_i_got_the_440_florida_insurance_customer/,jobs,"I have a sales background and I'm very good at sales. I have several years of customer service experience, and 4 years of sales experience. I have sold sports memorabilia, cars, and did telemarketing. I was even a sales manager for a door to door sales company. Yes I can do sales but I've hated every sales job I've ever had with a passion. I also have 2 years of office assistant experience. 

I'm considering getting the Florida 4-40 license which (from my understanding) will allow me to do customer service for all different types of insurance companies. The reason I'm making this thread is that I'm considering getting this license to do customer service NOT SALES. So if I got it would I be just doing customer service and not appointment setting or anything like that?

Also would I be able to do this from an office? Remote work sounds great but rent is so expensive that I have to live with my family just to make it. The house is so loud that remote work wouldn't be an option for me."

9,2023-01-15,"I quit my job because of a toxic work environment, and found a new job, but now with other issues there.",u/Eepien,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10cgsbi/i_quit_my_job_because_of_a_toxic_work_environment/,jobs,"Last year I decided to take both my mental and physical health seriously; went through a bunch of doctors to sort health issues out, and probably most importantly, I am having weekly therapy sessions now. So instead of being able to push emotions/traumas away, I have to face them at least once a week. It's a harsh process, but I hope in the end it will be worth it.

Anyway, quitting my previous job in a bakery, because of the extreme mood swings of my manager and her completely disrespecting our personal lives (working 10 hours a week on top of a full-time master's student), was one of the actions I needed to take to get more peace in my life. However, I need to hold down a 10-15 hour job next to my studies because of financial reasons. 

Long story short, I quit that job and found a new job in a small restaurant. Although I am in my mid-twenties, I have never worked in a restaurant before, I always had other types of jobs. So I have a lot to learn because it is a small place where you need to know how everything works. The manager told me it takes approximately two months, when you work two shifts a week, for an employee to be fully trained. 

Now, I finished the first two weeks at the new job (4 shifts in) and I start having doubts about this job. The other serving staff members are super nice and helpful, but then the two chefs are... something else. 

Both of the chefs are the parents of the manager, and emigrated from an Asian country to Scandinavia, learned the language a bit, and then moved to another Scandinavian country. The languages are to some degree mutually intelligible. Meanwhile, I moved to Scandinavia 2 years ago, thus my language skills are not perfect (B1), but they are good enough to have conversations and help customers. However, I am having a very hard time understanding what the two chefs are saying, and they do not have the patience to say it again or to pronounce words more clearly. They are very strict with the serving staff, but also on occasions when I thought it was not valid to say those things. For example, that one of the chefs was yelling at me and another colleague that we have to work and not talk, while the other colleague was explaining to replace a part of a machine... 

Some of the other colleagues have already said that the chefs are always grumpy and made some colleagues cry on some occasions when they made a mistake... I thought I was capable of not taking this personally, but I noticed that I started to worry about these things late at night after my shifts or already started dreaming about it! But there are good parts about this job as well, the serving staff is super friendly, the location is great, and the pay is better than at most other places. 

I want to take my mental health seriously, but I also need to think about the financial aspect..."

Massage therapist 

TLDR at bottom. 

Ive been sending applications for various part time positions, looking to replace a studio i work at. The problem with quitting a massage therapy position is that you have to quit about 50 times over two weeks, explaining it to every client that you've improved their quality of living. Also, the industry is in INCREDIBLY high demand. And im looking to upgrade my part time job as a result, since I can get interviews at places that are typically outside my reach.

Id like to make a clean break, and give notice, but to be fair , quitting causes anxiety for me. Just because I know I'll never see any of the clients or employees again - two of whom I'd consider to be friends. On top of that , the two week notice seems very arbitrary. 

I'm undoubtedly booked out for the next month or month and a half. So how does a 2 week notice benefit the employer in this scenario? They'd have to make 90 phone calls if I quit tomorrow versus 60 if I quit with 2 weeks notice. 

Im interviewing at a place Monday morning that is offering a SIGNIFICANT pay bump over the studio im leaving. On top of that, the studio I'm leaving is run by :

A passive owner who is hardly ever there. Who doesn't communicate except saying stuff like "" we need to be upselling"". 

A manager who is hardly ever there. Seriously I think she is in office 24 hours a week, max. 

A nepotism-ridden front desk and assistant manager who is all friends with the manager , but much younger and unprofessional (they get a lot of complaints).

And the massage therapists I work with have so much experience in the field that they don't work hard at all. You know the type. 

TLDR

current owner / manager suck, dont know anything about the industry. 2 weeks seems like an arbitrary figure when you are booked out for 2 months. And I've got plenty of references aside from this job. 

Whats the point of giving a 2 week notice instead of just saying I'm Injured and can't return?"

This is mostly just a rant on my situation. If you do decide to stick around and read, thank you for your attention.

I'm a 22 year old international student in the US about to graduate this April. Apologies for any grammatical or spelling errors, English isn't my first language.

Last summer, I had an internship at this company as a software developer. I absolutely loved the work that I was doing, my colleagues were kind and friendly, and my supervisor (let's pretend his name is Max) was a great mentor.

I learned a lot throughout the internship program, and was actually able to contribute quite a lot. Max and my team members were all very impressed by my performance. I actually remember being proud about contributing the most on one of our agile sprints, and enhancing our project with a step that no other team in the organization had implemented yet.

After the internship had ended, Max actually informed me that he was willing to hire me once I had completed my degree. I actually immediately agreed to it since I really did like the culture at the company, and believed that I was contributing in a meaningful way.

Fast forward to January, and he informed me that due to budget issues, he is unable to offer me a role right now. I'm not gonna lie, I was really looking forward to this role, and my heart immediately sank. I never realized how invested my mind was towards this job of the future, and when it disappeared right before my eyes in an instant, I felt a rush of sadness. 

Now, I don't really think I am upset with Max or the company. I mean, the economy doesn't seem to be doing too well, and there very well might not have any need for a new developer at the time. I understand their circumstances, but nonetheless, I am pretty bummed out by it.

And now, I actually am feeling a little scared as I now have to search for another job within the next 4-6 months (I believe that international students need to leave the US if they don't find work within a certain time period).

My game plan is to start applying to roles, maybe modify my resume slightly according to the job description, reach out to my professor and use any resource my college has to offer (professional coaches, career fairs, handshake, etc.) to secure an offer.

If you think there's anything else I should be doing, please do let me know. Any advice is appreciated.

If you read it til here, I thank you for your valuable time. Have a nice day :)"

My boss is probably the greatest boss I’ve ever had, and probably will ever have. She isn’t demanding. She lets us take off as many days as we want. She gives us PTO when we’re sick. She handwrites birthday cards for us. She goes above and beyond for us. 

I’m at a crossroads. I’ve been applying for jobs, and interviewing. I just get sad at the thought of not seeing these people everyday.

I love these people, but can’t fathom waiting tables for much longer. 

I know this isn’t a healthy way of thinking. I know it’s not a good reason to stay at a job…but that’s where I’m at.

Do I bite the bullet and leave? Or maybe cut my hours back significantly and focus on a new job?"

I messed up. I made mistakes with time management and, as such, was terminated from my position. As someone who has struggled to find a good fit career-wise, I am devastated. I am 33 and feel like I keep starting over. I am afraid I will not find another good opportunity. I mean, I can rationally understand there are an overwhelming number of jobs out there. However, finding one that is a good fit greatly reduces that number. 

I want to feel less alone right now. This termination has sparked the deepest depression I have ever endured. 

So, anyone else out there ever lose your dream job? Are you still thinking about it? Are you happy? Please share your story to help someone who is hurting right now."

I am an essential worker. No matter the weather, I am supposed to go to my job. 99% of the time there is no issue with getting to work. An interesting ""perfect storm"" is brewing that will make it hard for me in heavy snow to get to work. I am seeking advice.

A few details.

I live in Central Maine where we can get heavy snow, sometimes a foot or more in one night. Snow commonly starts a few hours after sunset when the temperature drops below freezing. My shift starts at 7am and I live an hour away. Getting 6 inches or more of snow at 5am is not uncommon. Waking up early, say, at 5am or 6am is no big deal. Cleaning off my car and snow blowing my driveway is no issue, but there is another snag...I live a 1/2 mile down a Town Road, owned and plowed by the town. The plow truck often does not come and plow the road until noon after all the snow falls. This greatly impacts my ability to go to work on time because I have go through the 1/2 mile Town Road to get to work.  If a foot of snow falls in one night, how am I reasonably expected to get thorough a unplowed road to get to work? Would it be reasonable, safe, fair for employers to ask me to drive through a foot of snow to get to work because the town is not prompt with their plowing for people working early morning jobs?"

The way it works is you have a certain production schedule that you have to get done within the 7.6 hours that we are paid (0.4 hours is for a break). The person on bowl who is mixing and dividing all of the doughs controls the speed of the day, as he pushes all of the bread forward to be baked on ovens. None of us go on this break because if we do, we risk not finishing on time and slow the day down for the other person we are working with who may not wish to go on a break either. Up until recently, we had been doing 2-person days on weekdays and 3-person days on weekends which are busier. But now that it is school holidays and Sundays are now less busy, my boss has decided to take one of the bakers off and make it a 2-person day. 

I got pretty pissed off about this decision. The person that I work with on Sundays insists on only doing bowl at this bakery, and he only works here 3 days a week because he works at another store. Then there is another baker who was working 5 days a week until the boss took him off Sundays so now he works 4 days. And then I still works 5 days a week, and lastly my boss comes in to help baking when he feels like it. The problem is, the baker on bowl that works Sundays with me is half an hour slower than me on bowl and 1 hour slower than my boss to give you an idea of his speed. I don't blame him for his speed, in fact I believe he actually works at a decent pace, isn't lazy and does his best. My problem lies with our boss who could have just kept things the way they were with 3-person days on Sundays, but instead he decided to take a baker off to save himself money. I messaged my boss explaining that we were finishing like 10 minutes late and in addition to that aren't going on our breaks that we are entitled to, so total we are actually working about 20 minutes for free. He doesn't pay overtime. So he said he would come in a bit sooner and help out a little bit.

When I confronted him about it, he used a lot of different arguments to defend himself so I'll just have to list them out:

* ""I'm not God. How am I supposed to know how late you guys will finish?""
* ""Do you know how much money I have to pay that 3rd baker to work?""
* ""I'm able to finish early so it's reasonable that I should expect you guys to finish on time.""
* ""I'm helping out now so why are you complaining.""
* ""I'm trying to keep myself happy too.""

He didn't seem to be able to wrap his head around the concept of me being annoyed that he was making our life harder than it needed to be in the first place. After I messaged him and he started helping, he was like ""the problem is fixed, just ask when you need help"". But if he had of just kept 3 bakers on Sundays this never would have been an issue. I've had this problem time and time again with him where he seems to value his wallet over our well-being and I'm just sick of feeling conflicted about who is right and wrong on this."

I don't do ""networking"", as my brain is just not wired for that. I've tried it in the past, it hurts my brain and it has not helped my employment status. (Intp adhd personality/brain). 

Feels like wasting time in trying to build a network, so I simply do not have any network. I just want to work, at some slow paced night shift job. I do not want to get pulled into performing these circus acts of using contacts as disposable stepping stones which are easily forgotten once hired or need forever maintained in some false sense of friendships due to the odd/weird perceived idea of 'favor' (otherwise known as networking). 

Of my last two jobs, I barely found both of those through craigslist ads. From my past experience: indeed, linkedin, career builder, and monster are worthless and didn't connect me with any employment in the last 10 years. Those sites also required too much networking, and felt soul draining and/or raised my blood pressure (to put it a polite way).

I spent the past year trying to be a realtor, but, I've worked nothing but lukewarm clients who never went anywhere. I don't really blame them because the market is crazy, but, now I have a kid on the way. 

My wife and I own our own house and we have plenty of space to grow into it, but,  I moved in 2021 to here for my wife's job and now she is quitting in the summer once the baby is born. We want children, but this will be our first and was an unplanned happy surprise. 

The past few months have been the most stressful I've ever endured. And my wife's job as a teacher has been supporting us while I was trying to get real estate to take off but a year later and it hasn't happened. 

My childhood kind of sucked and as a result I am now 31 with no degree, some college. I am a 30% disabled vet, and I am hoping to find a work from home job that pays a minimum of 24/hr with good benefits. 

I have accepted a tentative offer with USAA that meets my salary requirements, but, I found out last week I need to do a drug test, and I am a medical Marijuana patient, and after some checking, it appears that USAA is not legally required to care about that. My drug test is on Tuesday, and I have prepared myself for that as best I can. And hopefully that will actually be enough. If I fail the drug test then I have permanently burned my bridge with USAA. 

I have put in apps with Progressive, but, I was passed over after getting to the video interview phase, and I can't reapply for the position for another 5 months. 

I have apps in with Allstate, but I've only reviewed a handful of rejections so far from them. I'm still pending on a few, but idk. 

Other than that, I am starting to freeze up with panic. My wife has been supportive so far but I know that our situation has to be stressing her out. 

Additionally my dog has developed some medical conditions which cost us a lot to fix and now we are on the financial hook for that as well. 

This year our escrow increased by a lot too. As well as our homeowners insurance. 

I still have my post 9/11 GI Bill but even if I went to school full time my monthly payment would cover mortgage, let alone additional fees like utilities and phone bill. 


People tell me all the time that I am (allegedly) very Intelligent. I think I am, even though I feel like a fucking idiot for letting myself get backed into this corner. I have some gig work to carry me through to April, but it will be barely enough combined with my wife's income. 


If I get the Job with USAA, I'll be fine. But it's not a guarantee and I don't want mine or my wife's heart to break if I fail the piss test. Allstate would be perfect for me, if I would ever get a call back or even a hint of positive feedback from them. Progressive would be swell, but if it comes to the summer when I am eligible to reapply and I still get passed over I'll be dead in the water. 


I want to be able to provide for my family, to give my wife the freedom to choose to be a stay at home mom (it's what we both want, especially because childcare in our area is crazy expensive) 


I was planning to try going back to school online after I get my job situation settled maybe starting in the summer or fall semester.  But, if I do that the benefits will only be sub 1k. And it will be all my free time so, I won't have time to work a second job on top of full time online school on tip of a full time job on top of being a dad. 


Tldnr:

I am about to become a father and I need to become the sole breadwinner, but I live kind of in the middle of nowhere, so, I need a good work from home job that pays a minimum of 24/hr I have decades of work experience (started working full time when I was 9) but I have few to no credentials, and I will probably pop positive for mj on a drug test because I am a mmj card holder in FL I stopped smoking last week and I won't touch it again. Until I get a job, but I was a daily user and it's going to be in my system for up to 90 days. 

Can anyone help please direct me to who might can help? 

Or, a job I can do without a bachelor's degree that pays 24+/hr? In FL? 


Thanks for at least reading and thanks in advance for any help."

(I'm only 27, I have an 8 year old son and have some problems in my personal life) - I didn't think I'd reach this goal until much later.

I'm having issues with not feeling intelligent enough. The learning of the job is difficult, and I'm afraid that I'm not cut out for it. It doesn't help that the guys that I work with aren't exactly the best at training. 

We have two years to become fully licensed, which includes study at your own pace - write department of energy exams whenever you decide to schedule them, and then periodical assessments with the manager.  

I'm afraid of these assessments as I do'nt know if I'm  behind on learning or even motivating myself enough. I'm afraid of embarrassing myself or losing this job. I feel like I'd be letting myself and everyone else down too.

Has anyone else felt this?

I've already decided that I'm leaving my job in May to travel (I know, I know -- the recession), but I'm most likely getting promoted in April.

Thing is, even though I worked at this MNC for 3 years, I've learned basically nothing. I'm treated like my department office admin and perform duties that require no special knowledge. There was no formal training options, and our department went through tons of drama and 3 leadership changes since I started. What's worse is that I'm working overseas, so I'm often treated as an in-house translator rather than given actual responsibilities.

I'm worried about taking the promotion bc it feels disingenuous to future employers that I'm more capable than I am. Besides Microsoft apps, I have no technical knowledge. But I was also planning on trying a different area of work, so I wonder if this is a non-issue? Thanks in advance!"

This course is something I’ve always wanted to learn, the issue is that is 3hours long from Monday to Friday from 10am-to 1pm, and there’s no way of changing it.

I’ve searched for different courses but they’re all the same in terms of so alternate sources have been looked for.

I am 23, just graduated from college, I like my job but I want to take this a step up so I can eventually pursue a masters elsewhere and is something I’ve always wanted to do, although I don’t know if its worth it, considering there’s no way it doesn’t interfere with my job shouldI do it?

The only way of it not interfering with my job is by quitting which is also put of the question.

My job performance my drop , I might need to re-organise my work assignments but idk , has anyone done something similar, like taking online classes at work or so?

Any advice is taken."

I've been doing a ton of research on jobs and find plenty of options yet I'm eager about the prospect of working in a state I want to live in, confirming if I actually like it before committing to it, and getting housing/pay through that seasonal/temp job while I decide if it's the right fit for me.

Ideally, where I move will be where I start my life. Get a full time job, maybe a part time job at the same time, eventually attend community college and get a degree, travel in the neighboring states. So I really want to make sure it's the right place.

I don't want to move across the country and realize I fucked up and dug myself into a deeper hole, now further in debt, stuck in a bad living situation somewhere I don't want to live. I took a roadtrip to New England and around the country (stayed long enough that now I say ""wicked"" when referring to how much so things are, and am very confident that I would love living in Maine/Mass/New Hampshire area, or in that area- yet I've never truly experienced it, so I don't know.

I've toyed with the idea of just working my butt off and saving up \~20k and packing up my car and just going as well. Spending a month or two (or three) exploring different states and really decide if it's the right fit. I've saved up 15k before and that's how I did it last time, thanks to the sale of my old car and an immense amount of overtime in my current work.

I've tried Coolworks before which is a great website the only downside is it's more mainstream so there isn't a lot out there and it tends to get snapped up real quick especially from people abroad. Looking for websites similar."

She had another job a couple of years back that she loathed which tracked _everything_ and this new tracking system from the new job just raised a red flag.

1,2023-01-16,Job Decision,u/jackfrostyre,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10dadqz/job_decision/,jobs,"Hello, 

I'm an American

I worked at summer temp job and ended up leaving the place due to being extremely overworked. We were so efficient, that our boss expected us to finish in unreasonable time and that attitude caused me to leave. 

I also found out about a narcissistic boss (learning about tendencies) I worked under that misery for awhile. I am extremely grateful bc I now know so much about Narcs.

So I started a job in September that is probably the best job I have ever had bc they are proffesional and everyone is very nice and non judgemental. 
I work the closing shift, I asked my boss to relocate me a restaurant that is closer to campus(sort of ghetto) to save money/gas.
 But today he implied that he wants me to stay bc I do such a good job closing the restaurant. So I think he wants me to stay for sure. Only been working there for 5 months

The thing is, everyone in the job is really young and I am 21.

I have flexibility bc I have an interview for a part time job near the school that is a packing vedgtables supplier and it pays more and it shows that I can only work weekends which is great. (15 hour a week)

What are your thoughts? I'm not tight on money since I have 30k saved up and I'm halfway done with my associate degree. Should I move to the picking company?


TLDR. Leave restaurant (far) for a picking company near school or stay where I am at. 

Thank you"

This was my first job interview and I was very nervous.

There was a 3 hour long technical interview which I studied very hard for and long story short I  apparently  did really well even though I didn't think I did because despite answering most of the questions there were a few that I couldn't answer that I felt like I should've been able to.

When It was time for feedback I was ready to be ridiculed but I was surprised when the supervisors started praising me instead. They said I was one of the best candidates they had so far, called me smart  and even said they didn't expect me to answer many of the questions. This went on for a while and I'm not sure if It's because of how much I wasn't expecting that or because I've never been told these things before but nevertheless I teared up as they were talking and they had to stop for a bit while I calmed down then continue with the feedback.

Worst part is there were like 4 other people from the department I was applying for in the room with us watching it all happen and even though we sort of laughed about It afterwards and continued, I still feel like I messed up big time. But I just couldn't hold my tears back.

I've always been the type to cry easily at the smallest things and they're probably not looking for overly sensitive people (they jokingly mentioned at the end that I should work on that) so I feel like I ruined my chances. And even if I didn't ruin them and they hired me, I feel too ashamed to go back there after what happened and be known as the person that cried during their interview...

I wonder if this is normal or if I'm making a bigger deal out of it than I should be? I should be hearing back from them in a week or less.

&amp;#x200B;

Update: I got the job! I'm adding this in case someone goes through something similar and sees this post in the future. Also, thank you everyone for the kind and wholesome comments, I can't express how relieved and happy they made me and I know they helped other people too.

I have an interview on Monday for a job which pays less but I’ve worked in this industry before and loved it. I left because there was nowhere to go in my department and I’d been there 6 years with little development. 

I’m getting bad anxiety from the thought of having to tell my managers all of this. One of them takes things personally and I’ve seen her act like such a funny bitch with others. She has no issues with making snide comments. 

I don’t how how best to approach this. I KNOW if I’m honest with her and say I’m not liking the job she’ll move me into another department. I know she’ll do anything. During the interview she was almost bragging at how low their staff turn over is and some people have been here over 40 YEARS 💀 on my first day she even joked that she won’t tell me the notice period because “people don’t leave us”.

Is this how it is will all staffing/recruitment agencies?"

Hi Reddit,

I recently graduated with a conversion masters in data analytics and landed a job at a tech startup last October. 

Since the company is very early stage, there are no clients, and mostly I’ve only done data entry on excel or secretarial tasks. In total, I think I worked 20-30 hours since I joined. Moreover, although the CTO has experience in IT, he’s not knowledgeable in data modelling, machine learning, etc, so he can’t mentor me. 

At the beginning, I did some online courses to upskill, but I quickly became tired and unmotivated, and couldn’t learn at all. 

Recently, I got headhunted for an analyst role at a big corporation. Today I received my contract, and I’m getting cold feet. Although it was agreed I was going to WFH and go to the office (in another city an hour away) only as needed, my contract states I’m working from the office Monday to Friday. I contacted the recruiter and he assured me I can work from home and they just need to put an office in the contract due to the company’s policy. 

In addition, my duties and responsibilities are not outlined in the contract and are subject to change as the manager wishes. This is exactly what my contract with the startup says, so I’m nervous I’m going to end up in a similar situation again. 

Now I’m scared of losing my free time and regretting it. However, I’m also scared of hurting my career in the long run if I stay at a job where I’m not learning anything. 

Just looking for opinions or any advice?"
1,2023-01-16,Career change to Home Design,u/Hammerofchaos,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10dg61u/career_change_to_home_design/,jobs,"I resolved a few months ago that I want to switch careers. I have been in manufacturing on and off for a total of about ten years, but I am aiming to move into Home Design. It's been a bit of a convoluted adventure trying to figure out what role I can play in this industry.

I have always loved construction and designing floorplans. I used to think that interior designers just decorated, chose curtains, and painted accent walls. But I'm beginning to think that's the direction I might want to go. I am not afraid to jump into any other job along the path to get the experience needed, but I'm worried about the pay cut ill take if I have to swing a hammer for a while. While I have experience in many aspects of constructing a house(excluding electrical, concrete, and roofing), I am getting told I lack experience. I cold applied to 34 builders over the summer, got 2 interviews and both told me I didnt have the experience for what they need.

I am not unwilling to go back to school to fill in any gaps that I may be lacking, but I don't want to spend that money before really dialing down which positions I want to shoot for.

Ultimately, I want to draw floorplans, design both interiors and exteriors, and manage the construction processes.

I am asking here to find out where I fit in?

Does one job encompass all of this?

What education and skills do I need to highlight or develop?

Is there a better place to ask this question?

Where should I start?"

So I work at a marketing agency as a video production specialist. A once 2 person department, that has now turned into a 1 person department. There's more than enough work for 1 person, but not enough work for two people. Management doesn't want to hire another employee because the company don't have the funds to keep a second person employed.

Lately, I'm experiencing burnout like no other, and to top it off my wife and I are having a baby in mid-February. My boss is reluctant to give me any time off for the baby even though i have 4 weeks of vacation time in the bank. I want to leave so badly, not because I'm burned out, but because of how negatively the direction of the company has gone in the past 4 years. I feel like there's no way that I can nicely leave without destroying relationships that I have with the company.

How do I kindly say, ""I don't want to work here anymore, hire another person because I don't want to screw the company over?"""

Today I didn't get a job. Again. Probably 10th or 15th since September. I cannot say I am loosing the hope but I feel it's getting start to crack. I have no idea what to do. 

The most important part... so many of these rejection's letters are promising smth. They say they'll contact me in the future once some positions will be open (of coure they won't) or they make that email super personal and all about my strengths and share some sadness because they had to select another candidate. I understand that they were just being polite but in this way they give me feeling that i was soooo close to get a job i applied for. 

I asked some of them what was missing in my interview but usually they answer that they select people with more relevant background and experience. And it's heartbreaking, because I have a master degree and 3y job experience abroad and in my country and I am not applying to high positions.

At first i thought it's all about bad luck but know i am not sure.

I left my job in museum this September since it was devastating to work there because of colleges and i had no idea that i will be jobless for such a long time. But here I am.

Today i cannot leave my bad and i am afraid it's just a start."

I don't really like it for a couple of reasons, but I want to switch to another department. Thing is, I don't know how to bring it up. Do I bring it up to my manager? Human resources? Both? Which one first?

Also, we have a company portal that shows jobs available, but would it hurt to ask if there's anything available that doesn't show up on the portal?

So questions are:

- How to ask current boss/human resources if there's another role in a department I want to go into?

- Will it look bad if I ask? 

- One concern I have is if I ask, and nothing is available, it will burn bridges. How can I avoid this?

EDIT: there is a rule at the company that says you need to stay in your current position at least 1 year before transferring. Would it be appropriate to ask now, or do I wait 1 year?"

One company called and texted me after business hours to talk, saying he really liked my ""outstanding"" resume and to call him as soon as possible.  I delayed responding 'til the next day and this should have been my first red flag but when I texted to say what time I was available to call him, he said He was not available at that time and was I available right now?  I said yes.

He then proceeded to call and talk to me about the job and basically hired me on the spot. I didn't stop to think about it and he started me working that same day.  Even though the job is in another state and I was planning on moving there, he disregarded all that and said I could start remotely.

Came to find out that the job is actually not the one that's advertised but a similar one which I have no experience in. I was trained for 4 hours and then expected to just jump in and do the job instead of shadowing the person currently in the position longer.

On top of all this, I've been working for 4 days and still haven't heard a peep from the office manager (they have no HR department) and they never asked for any onboarding paperwork, ID w4, anything.

I haven't been in the workforce for 18 years but I'm feeling like there's a lot of red flags here and that maybe I've made a huge mistake. Am I off base for feeling this way? The pay is good and the boss is flexible on when I move out to be in the office permanently, but I'm just feeling like something is not right.

Edit:  So many people ITT are so quick to jump to conclusions and shout ""SCAM!"" without reading the whole thread. I KNOW it's a legitimate business, I met and WORKED WITH the doctor in his office. He has been in business for 20+ years, that is not what's in question here.

I am feeling bad about having to give notice to my current employer and would like input from strangers on the internet prior to doing so :)

Long story short, I work remotely for a company that is based out of the New England area in the US and I am in sales capacity in the southern US. I have really enjoyed working for this company and had no plans of leaving until recently and in matter of fact, the company is going through restructuring at the moment where they have me in mind for a new team that they are creating. To add context as to why I am leaving, my family owns a small business back on the east coast. Due to some extenuating circumstances (I'd rather not get into specifics), my mom is going to have to unexpectedly step away from the business and my dad is in Corporate America and they rely on his job to provide health insurance for the family. Due to this, I am going to step up to the plate and take things over. I feel really bad about leaving my current employer and I feel as though they are going to be pissed with this coming completely out of left field. Anyone think that I am in the wrong here?  


To add some further context, my sales manager left the company not long ago which led to the restructuring. I feel like I am kicking them while they are down so to speak. I also am feeling stressed because I am going to have to quit remotely (which I've never done before) on a web call. To make matters worse, the guy who is now my manager was a colleague for a long time and I know this will directly affect him greatly. I also have only been with the company for just under 3 years.

TLDR
I have a 5.5 year gap at the top of the ‘work experience’ section of my resume. This is due to caring for 2 family members coping with terminal illnesses. (One after the other) 

How much detail should I provide recruiters and hiring managers? Are they allowed to ask about such things?

—

I’m looking for a job after being out of the workforce for sometime. And I am trying to figure out how best to respond to recruiters and hiring managers when asked about the gap on my resume. It is 5.5 years. 

The following questions are just spinning in my brain.  Any information would be great. 

Thanks!!

-Should I be completely transparent and share everything?

-If you were in my place, would you limit the info provided? 

-Have you encountered something similar? If so any suggestions appreciated. 

-By chance are you now or ever been a hiring manager?  If so I would appreciate any insights. 

-Suggestions from anyone would be great. 


~~~

If you are curious about what transpired during the 5.5yrs here is a bit more info.  It is long though. 

I voluntarily resigned my position upon learning a family member had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. Soon after resigning my wife and I reloaded to be closer. This meant selling the house and all the other details that come with it. 

As the Alzheimer’s progressed it became increasingly difficult emotionally to deal with it. 

Shortly after she passed (~3mon) a second family member was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer. Also terminal. Stage 4 is the final stage. 

People diagnosed with Stage 4 have a short life expectancy. Around 8 months. Only 4% make it to 5 years. 

I consider us very fortunate. His oncologist prescribed radiation (no surprise) and Keytruda. It was not a cure. But it gave us 3.5 more years with him."

I finally received an offer which i'm thrilled with for an IT support position. I am just so anxious because on my resume I put that I worked there for about 7 months, while I was there for at most 3. I was never really let go, but realistically I just stopped working there.

Another thing I will say is that our company allows us to have max 20 min per week of this unscheduled personal time status and I always track my times. I normally never use it to begin with, but when I do it normally doesn’t even go over 10 minutes per week so it’s not like I’m abusing this privilege.

I have a 1:1 meeting with her in the morning tomorrow, and want to voice my concerns to her that obviously you can’t control when you need to use the restroom! Any tips on how I should voice my concerns without sounding like I’m trying to pick an argument with her?

Thanks in advance!"

I  have two jobs since graduating college and one meaningful college internship under my belt. My last job was awful (not the people, but the company), so I quit and solo-traveled for a few months, and now I'm job searching. 

I'm applying online, but everybody is telling me to utilize my network to get the next job, and I know they are right. Out of my past jobs, I have about 4 people who I feel comfortable reaching out to. I am just struggling to reach out to them (all of whom I had great relationships with). I have social anxiety, and have never done something like this before. It just feels weird, and I don't know where to start. One of them I haven't talked to since my internship, but he told me to reach out to him if I ever needed anything.

So any advice for how to do this? How to word the messages so it’s not awkward and not too expectative (I know I’m not to expect them to respond with “yes! I have a job for you” lol)

 I'm sorry for such a basic question. TIA."

How do I answer “have you ever been fired”,u/elhombremysterio,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10dwcmw/fired_from_unpaid_internship_and_left_it_on/,jobs,"I’m a relatively new cs major after switching to cs about 10 months ago. Last summer I took up an unpaid internship at a startup to boost my resume. To be honest it was clear I was the most inexperienced intern and about six weeks in my manager sent me an email saying I was fired because I wasn’t grasping concepts at the level of the other interns. I was pretty pissed off that day, but brushed it off and proceeded to relax for the rest of break. I left it on my resume because frankly my resume was pretty empty.

Fast forward to today and I’m applying for paid roles and I’ve made it to a final round where I’ve been sent a questionnaire with the dreaded question “have you ever been fired”. The unpaid internship was on my resume but I wasn’t sure how to answer the question.

On one hand I was thinking that since I was never paid that role wasn’t really a job and thus I was never “fired”. That being said I don’t want to risk losing a good opportunity.
How should I answer this question?"

It's been a little over a year since this happened and I am looking to get a job again. In the mean time I have done some unpaid work for a small business in my family and a few trainings on Udemy to introduce myself to some skills I've wanted to learn, but nothing extensive. I'm having a dilemma on how I should go about the past year on my resume and I'm interested in feedback.

Option 1: Use the family business on my resume to cover the gap, even though I was not paid and it was not full time work.  If a phone call is used to confirm my 'employment' I am sure they would confirm it, however I would not be able to provide a W2 or pay stubs, if requested. 

Option 2: Use my previous employer as my most recent experience and create a cover letter to explain, without giving away too many personal details, why I took a year off from work and what I did in the meantime. 

Option 3: Any other ideas? I'm open to suggestions.

I've been really anxious about what to do. I read/hear so much about a gap on your resume being a huge red flag so I lean towards option 1, but if there were an issue with the employment check and documents were requested, I feel the offer would get pulled if I had one. With option 2, I feel as if I'm being more honest and wouldn't have to worry about issues on the employment check, but may not be able to get my foot in the door. Am I screwed both ways?

I've applied for a bunch of jobs and I've been asked to go for interviews but I'm not interested in any of them. One interview I went to I got on to the second round but I cancelled because during the first interview I realised the job wasn't for me. I've got another interview on Thursday, which I'm also thinking of cancelling as I applied to it on a whim and I don't see the point going to all that effort and being stressed over something I'll probably turn down if I do get it. 

I think part of my problem is that a lot of jobs where I live are all STEM, which I was never really inclined towards. I've applied to well over 20 jobs, most of them just out of wanting to feel like I'm actively looking and being productive but the ones I'm only hearing back from are finance, recruitment, sales jobs etc. Their salaries are typically competitive which makes me uncomfortable and doesn't exactly encourage me to go to their interviews. What the jobs entail doesn't excite me either. When I was discussing this with my mother, she commented that I'm going in the wrong direction, that I'm not applying to the right jobs, that I need to get a job that utilises my MA but I honestly can't see anything. 

My sister tells me I need to do something I love, that she's worried I'll get stuck in a dead end mediocre job, that I'll be too afraid to leave it. But I'm not sure what I love and I'm worried that my sister is right. I'm hoping something more suitable comes up, something with research or a good graduate scheme outside of STEM or finance. 

But in the meantime, I don't really know what to do because I'm being contacted pretty much every day by potential employers and I'm not quite sure if I'm being foolish by not responding or cancelling interviews. I'm not really under any pressure to get a job, financially I'm fine but I'm conscious that it's been over a year since I've worked properly and I know my extended family are wondering about me now."

Edit/Update: Today we had our meeting and I outwardly admitted to her that I agreed that the job is not a good fit for me. What we ended up deciding on was that I will begin to search elsewhere and start interviewing at new places. She is going to post a job posting to replace my position but she told me I can work until I find somewhere new to go. She even told me if there’s overlap I can stay and train my replacement if needed. Im feeling like this was the best outcome at the moment. Thank you to everyone who gave me advice in the comments I truly appreciate it. When she sent me home the other day I already applied at a lot of new places and even received 2 emails today asking to set up interviews with me so hopefully i’ll be able to move on soon."

I know folks might think “you get winter, spring, and summer break,” but we don’t get summer break and we are expected to do research up until the nationally recognized days off. Even though we aren’t teaching, we are doing lab work. 

In about one year from now, the final event for my greatest hobby will be occurring. It’s been announced as the final since the founding members of the organization are all retiring and there really honestly isn’t a way for it to continue when the founders quit. 

I was supposed to go in 2022, but a bunch of organizers got COVID and it was cancelled. I didn’t go this year because it happens the first week we get back from “winter break” and start teaching again. I won’t be teaching in January of 2024, but there will be research obligations. 

I basically want to attend this no matter what, but I’m deathly afraid of requesting the time off and being rejected. I’d rather just say I am unwell for 2-3 days. Usually it’s a Saturday-Wednesday event or Thursday- Sunday event, so I wouldn’t miss many workdays of work. I don’t care if they don’t pay me, it’ll honestly be worth attending without pay. I’ll feel pretty guilty about lying though, as it’s a year away and is eating at me already. 

How would you handle this personally?

ETA: the reason I’m especially worried of the request being denied is because it’ll be less than a month after “winter break” has concluded which is kind of weird. Most people who get PTO even though we technically aren’t offered it ask for like June/July. Also, there’s no way this is educational or will build character per say. It’s international and a universally understood as fun event. I can’t pass it off as I’m bettering myself by going other than mentally."

Background:
I am currently declared as an entrepreneurship major which is a Bachelor of Arts. However, I decided to start transitioning to majoring in Marketing which is a bachelor of science because I am unsure if I want to start my own business and I believe marketing would provide more job opportunities. Every class I am registered in for this semester goes into both marketing and entrepreneurship, besides the math I am taking to start the transition to marketing. However after reading the syllabus of my math class (Finite Math??) I am worried and stressed about not doing well in it, and also having to complete calculus next year. 

The question: I started looking into the major called global business studies, which is a Bachelor of Arts. If I took this major I could minor in marketing, and the global aspect is cool because I know I want to travel for my career. Best of all, I don’t have to take any more math! Will this major provide me as good job outlooks and opportunities as a marketing bachelor of science? I don’t know what I really want to do, but I figure business will give me opportunities."

My husband was a stay at home dad to our now 18 month old. His pay at the time was just not worth putting our infant in daycare and I made enough that it was a struggle at times but we made it work. Anyway, we were very lucky and his old job offered him his job back with a raise, but still not nearly as much as what I was making. At least we have some stream of income though and my unemployment claim was approved a couple of days ago. So currently I am caring for a toddler and applying for jobs, doing interviews, and talking to recruiters during naptime, etc. We plan to either put him in daycare or if I'm able to get another remote position possibly hire a nanny or a combo if it's hybird. The problem is we can't afford to do anything until we have a confirmed second income.

Is it appropriate to discuss this with potential employers or at what point should I bring this up? I don't want it to prevent me from getting hired.

It's all very stressful and the thought of putting my baby in daycare makes me want to throw up, but we won't be able to afford our mortgage + bills on my husband's income alone."

I thought I did everything right. I thought I finally had the experience/ education necessary to get me a job that I loved.. turns out, I don't. 

I just don't know what to do at this point. It seems like all the jobs want people with 15+ years of experience in a field, which I clearly don't have since I am not 35+ years old. I only started my career at 20 and was able to move up fairly quickly.

To be fair, I am blessed, and I should not be complaining about my situation. It does get frustrating at times, especially when it seems like no one wants you.

First day I was already thrown into the deep end. No orientation, no training, no mentoring, nothing. I had to learn everything myself and having absolutely zero experience/ basic understanding it was really hard and frustrating. The job is super repetitive and downright alienating. It's essentially data entry, I'm just a mindless robot plugging in numbers.  

The job is barely tolerable, what makes it worst is the company, a sterile, depressing pit of despair. There is absolutely no synergy, no one talks with each other, and everyone just does their own thing at their desk. I don't if it's the economy or what but the company is super quiet. There are days when I get no work at all, but I still have to sit there and pretend to be productive. Imagine Neo's office in the Matrix, that is exactly how I feel every day. I was promised a raise after passing my probation which was a lie. I feel like I'm wasting my life there. 

I really want to quit but I've only been working there for 5 months. Would that really affect my CV, or should I stay a little longer? I really don't know."

I have been out of work due to a lay off in August, and I have been diligently applying in mass to whatever I feel I may be even remotely qualified for. I'm about to run out of unemployment now and have considered just going door to door in local retail stores! I don't know what I'm doing wrong and I am really starting to panic I won't be able to find a job in time! 

I have data entry/admin/ call center experience and prefer a remote position (though at this point I've been applying to anything local as well).

I have talked with several staffing agency recruiters and have tried to stay in touch and reach out for updates on opportunities weekly, adjusting parameters several times to hopefully broaden opportunities.

I have done weeks of research on current resume practices and cover letters and have done rewrites to my resume and custom tailor my cover letter for each opportunity. I have applied through LinkedIn, indeed, several one off job sites, directly through company websites, you name it.

During all this I've also started teaching myself how to code to hopefully expand my career options, but I feel like I'm still a ways off from being able to apply for dev jobs. I'm on the process of creating my portfolio website and I have a GitHub with all the practice I've been doing. I've been toying with the idea of applying for junior dev jobs, because I have the basics of HTML/CSS/and JavaScript down, and just giving my GitHub to show what I know, but in my searches junior dev jobs rarely come up and they typically ask for more language proficiencies. I told a recruiter about how I was teaching myself to code and she seemed really impressed and I thought that it would show that I am self-sufficient and dedicated as a person and set me apart, but it doesn't seem to have helped at all.

 At first I was a bit more choosy, I only applied to remote close to my previous salary... But now I am applying for literally anything in my area or remote that even sounds like I can do it for half the pay I'm used to. 

I have barely gotten a handful of interviews, most of which were very early on in my search. I don't think I've gotten an interview since October. The interviews I had seemed to go well but they just ghosted me so I don't actually know what went wrong. I typically don't hear back or I get the ""thank you but we've moved on"" email, and if it's not a noreply email address I typically send back a thank you email. 

I really have to find a job before my unemployment runs out or I have no idea how I'm going to pay my bills.

At this point my anxiety is through the roof and every time I sit down to apply for jobs I just start crying. I need help. I have no idea what I'm doing wrong and any advice would be so greatly appreciated!"

We handle mail and shipments.

Now don’t get me wrong some days we do get mail and shipments, but aside from that, when people ask what I do, I say nothing. 

My job is waiting for shipments of mail to come in, send them interdepartmentally, or out of the institute, 

and then do pretty much whatever inbetween. I’m pretty sure my managers manager has to know, because there’s no real way around it. I’ve even asked my manager, if there’s anything we need to be doing in the meantime and he just says no not really, and we either chit chat, or he watches videos on his computer, while I watch movies or YouTube on my phone. 

When I first got hired they actually increased my hourly rate by $5 so I went from $10/hr to $20, and I only work 6 hours right before the crack of dawn so I’m home before noon.

I used to come in dressed business casual, then I stopped because I noticed him and everyone else wear jeans and slightly business **casual** shirts, much more casual leaning.

I forgot my ID last week, but the manager just changes the clock in times for all the employees because of the institutes strict policies

I really don’t know how tf I landed this job, but I’d love to see if any more of these exist because this is awesome lmao.

I’m also open to any questions, just thought that this was interesting enough to share."

The role itself is boring, has no career progression and the pay is incredibly low for the amount of work we're required to do. Unfortunately, for the past four months, I have been dealing with frequent anxiety/panic attacks, and other personal events in my life (which I don't wish to disclose) has also taken a toll on my mental health. I work primarily from home, and usually come into the office twice or thrice a month. I'm usually a decent performer and always get my reports done on the designated due date, but I will admit I have been slacking off and not putting in as much workload as I should. 

Two days ago, my ""manager"" (I use quotation marks because he's more of a senior version of the work I do) has called me out for always being inactive on Slack and for not ""pulling my weight"". I believe he was brought it up, because I asked him to be a reference last week so he is aware I am looking for a new job, and probably felt now was the opportunity to voice his concerns about my performance before I leave. I let him know truthfully that I have lost motivation in performing my duties and personal events/mental health have impacted that. Now he wants to have a meeting next week to discuss what I've relayed to him. I'm a bit worried that I may potentially get fired, and I also don't feel comfortable disclosing my issues with him."

I have done some internships and intensive academic projects in this. I haven't had a full-time job yet. I have completed Bachelors and will be completing my masters in this same field now.

Is it okay to use this term? Or should I use something like ""With a strong academic background in"" or ""With a strong educational background in"" in terms of how recruiters read into it?

My whole summary is for example:

""With a strong background in biomedical engineering, medical devices and programming languages, I am seeking a challenging opportunity in the medical field to utilize my skills and knowledge, and to make a positive impact on patient care.""

I need some advice. My current position was eliminated about two months ago, and I’ve been transitioned into a different role as I was a manager. It’s something that I’m good at, don’t 100% love but could lead to additional promotions as long as I continue to do well. I absolutely adore the team I work with overall, I have a great W/L balance, get to be creative and I’m paid fairly well.
The issue is that a direct competitor reached out about a position that would be a significant jump in pay, responsibility and scope and I’m actively interviewing for the position. I know the person that would be my supervisor from previous attempts to get me to work for them and they seem like a good person who cares about their team. My concern about the role is two fold…if I don’t perform or it doesn’t work out, I don’t want to burn bridges (I absolutely will with my current company if I accepted an offer, and if I were to not enjoy it or not do well the job market is tough enough, and I’ve got kids and a wife to support and don’t want to be unemployed ), and I don’t necessarily want to leave, the pay and new position are enticing though. 

I’m not going to try and overthink until I get through the interview process, but I’m struggling with how to handle this. This seems like a significant risk for an unknown situation. 
Once my position was eliminated I essentially got to choose what I wanted to do, as they said I was such a valuable member of the team. 
I also understand that those words don’t mean anything and I would be cut in a second if need be.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

I’m currently considering an offer for an account executive role from a logistics company. They require a college degree and minimum 5 years sales experience to be considered for the role.

I have a college degree and 8 years experience as a top-performing sales professional in the medical field (medical devices, hospital outfitting, surgery room, medical imaging and testing, lab testing, etc…) 

They sent me the offer letter and it’s as follows:

- $40k base
- NO commission for the first year 
- NO PTO first year, will get 12 days after completion of year 1, then 12 additional days at the end of every year.

**Commission will start after year one and it seems like an ok commission structure 

**The reason there is no commission during year 1, they say… is because I will be building my book of business and moving from role to role shadowing others in the company and helping them sell/close, see how they set up logistics, etc… they basically want me to learn the ins and outs of the company and how they function. If I do make any sales of my own the first year then that commission just goes to the company.

Now I know this is an extreme lowball offer from them. $40k is nowhere near enough to cover my bills for a year… folks at McDonald’s get paid more. I’m going to counter and ask for $75k base and 21 days PTO per year effective 3 months from start date. 

What do you guys think? How should I go about this? Any specific things to add?

Edit: After typing out this post I’ve realized that this is probably a job I should steer away from"

First, I need to add, we live in Canada! Not sure what to do about this, but it is something that stresses out me and my siblings a lot (though we are young adults now). Most of the older generations in my family did not pursue higher education, or even finish high school. Growing up, my parents owned a carnival (that's sort of my families thing, extended as well). My parents split up about 14 years ago, and lost everything, since then my dad struggled with addictions but now is running a pretty successful moving company, however, my mom hasn't really been able to find work. She did her GED, then she did a 2 year college program in business administration, but the program took her more like 5/6 years. She had a job right after my parents divorce, but was laid off, then after that she would work for family members (carnivals) or get factory jobs from temp agencies (these are popular where she lives). She ultimately really wants to do real estate, but she is taking a long time to finish her courses and get her certification, and as pessimistic as it sounds and I don't even like to think it, I feel like she is running out of time to start another career.

She is no longer able to get social assistance, student funding, or anything else like that. She got lucky, my dad owed a lot of child support money, he paid her 50K recently to settle things which helped her buy a car and get ahead on a few things, but she has no savings, no job prospects, and my brother lives with her paying half the rent so if he moves out i don't even know where she would live. I also have a feeling she holds herself back, she gets very angry and defensive if I try to say that to her, but she doesn't want to have jobs where people can see her a lot (cashier, ect) because she is older and also a huge thing is she is very overweight and that has always held her back. She also says they don't call her back anyways. She can't do manual labour/factory positions anymore because her body can't handle it the way it could even 3 years ago.

She is at the age most peoples parents are retiring, and while not my place, I find myself angry at that she didn't make different decisions, around necessity/reality and not what she wants (or wants to believe). But, ultimately, I just want to know she can provide for herself and find happiness.

What can I do to help her? Is there any suggestions for jobs that might suit her? Whenever she goes for an interview, they are taken aback by her age, and she doesn't hear back. It is giving her a lot of stress and when she runs out of the money from my dad she's going to have to start selling things she has (which isn't much). It makes me very sad that towards her senior years, this is the situation.

I told my boss this morning that I have an interview on Wednesday. I was asking to see if she wanted me to take the time off or stay late to make up the time. She told me I could take the time, but next time I am applying for jobs I should tell her.

I am very good at my job, but there is no promotion from my current position. I also am forced to work with a truly toxic employee. Otherwise, I am very good at my job and genuinely love what I do.

All of my other interviews in the last 2 years went no where and were not during my scheduled time. Since they were only round 1 interviews, and outside my hours, I never felt I needed to bring them up. I am conflicted with why she seemed upset I was interviewing.

Is it better to say nothing or keep the boss up to date?

Update: I got the job! I spoke with my boss during the whole process. Her response to my news was ""if this is a better opportunity for you them I'm glad you have it"".  Well, yes it is, and here is my two weeks."

Last spring, I took a leap of faith by leaving for a high finance job. It was entry level so I took a pay cut, but I felt it was worth it…unfortunately I was part of a round of layoffs at the end of last year and I was on the chopping block because I was (and still am) injured and couldn’t travel. 

I still regret having left my previous job. I had a mentor (a VP, but I didn’t report to him) who always helped me, so he played a part in my promotion and stellar performance..
After I quit, he wasn’t appropriate but I didn’t want to lose him so I didn’t block him. 

Now, it’s gotten to the point where this VP is coming over a few times per month to bring me groceries, take out my trash, do my laundry, take me out for food (he always pays), and then we have hour long hug sessions in my house. I feel bad because he’s doing these things for me that he should be doing for his wife (I don’t mention it though). He cheers me up and I’ve been feeling depressed because 1) I’m unemployed and 2) I have an injury that’s nowhere close to being healed (been 6 months) and it’s ruining my life. 

Should I ask this VP if he can help me get a position at my old company? Or not bother? To this day, I still don’t know why he’s risking his reputation, his marriage, and his job in order to stay in touch with me. He initiates everything and my self esteem is too low right now to deflect people like him who care. I’m 27 and he’s almost twice my age, but I grew to find him attractive over time even though perhaps he’s been emotionally manipulative."

For the most part this is bc 2020 ruined the year that I planned to go for co-ops and internships. I finished my engineering degree and was proud to have made it out. 

Someone how I landed an amazing opportunity with a really big company that manufactures pulp and paper. Going into the position with a completed curriculum but no real world application on how to use that, I struggled to find my footing and it showed. With everyone busy taking care of their own projects, I often had to scrounge up help/resources on my own. So did everyone else though. About 5 months into the job, I found myself sitting in HR’s office with my supervisor who told me I was being let go. This was devastating. 

At the time of my termination I was working 55-60 hours a week, renting hotel rooms bc the commute to work was 65 -68 mins, and I housed my dog at my parents place until I could to a stable routine at home. I had some pretty rough moments in college when I failed a class but nothing was more defeating than this moment. 

Fast forward to the end of 2022. I applied for jobs and gotten numerous interviews. Unfortunately, I’d been rejected from a few jobs i thought i stood a chance at. During this time, I reflected and thought I was doing everything I could. Needless to say, I struggled to maintain my confidence in getting back in the industry. 


****END OF BACKGROUND**** 


FINALLY, I’ve found the most ideal position at a private consulting firm located in the same town as my family and they’ve decided to push me through to the next round of interviews. I want so badly to get this role but I don’t want to make the same mistakes I’ve been making that prevented me from getting any of the other jobs in the past. 

The first round covered a bit of my skills and my personality match to the company. I think both parties are a mutual fit. 

The next interview is supposed to last half as long and with someone of a higher authority in the company. I thought maybe I would prepare to showcase my skills and working knowledge but I’m not sure how to prepare and share my skills/ experience/ how I can add value to the company in a 30min interview, as that is a very short amount of time. 

Is there any advice on how to prepare for this second interview?"

I was told they need to move people around to get the position for me and they would have a contract for me the next week. Fast forward to week of Christmas- they up my salary by 8k to show “ they are serious” and that I should hear from them mid January for the contract and that they apologize for the wait.

This is a first for me as I usually just leave if I get a better offer, but I have good benefits and generally like my job because it’s low stress.

However, during the past year I was doing my Master's at university wherein large sums of money had left my account (it says the university's name in the transaction). The money was put into my account by my uncle who has his own business and was helping me fund university. I didn't get a student finance loan as he was happy to fund my Master's degree. During my Master's degree I eventually realised that I didn't want to do it anymore, so I dropped out and applied for this graduate scheme and got it. For example, my uncle would put in £2500 and £2500 would be taken out a few days later by the university as a part of the direct debit I had set up with them.

I'm looking for a job in finance. Really anything that relates to my major at all.

My classes were online and I was off-campus for half of my sophomore year and all of my junior year, so I really didn't get to network much apart from a few events online. I did senior year, but most of the recruiter events were for companies like Goldman, Amazon, Google, etc. All have highly competitive applicant pools, and I was not a stellar student by Stanford standards. That's not to say I haven't tried though.

I've had internships each summer. One in economic policy, one in wealth management, and one in private equity. I also had a research job freshman year, then another research job for the other 3 years.

I've tried to message recruiters on LinkedIn at the companies I'm interested in and usually don't get a response. I don't really know how I can go about networking at this point. I come from a poor family in the Midwest, so I don't have many, if any, built-in connections. I missed a bulk of my college experience due to covid so I don't have even have a particularly large network of friends I can look toward. My friend group kind of fell apart after I returned for my senior year, and I pretty much stuck with the same 3 people. I didn't really have time for much outside of classes and studying, as I was behind on my major due to covid. Honestly, it's hard to even believe I even went to college at this point.

I've revised my resume dozens of times through the career center at school. Paid a ""resume expert"" on LinkedIn $400 to help me. I use an AI service to tailor my resume/cover letter to the specific job using the description.

There is very much a sentiment at Stanford (and outside of it too) that you can get any job you want once you graduate. I stopped buying into that as the years went by, but, still, most of my graduating class did have a job lined up before they even graduated. A lot of them at high-paying, ""prestigious"" companies. And I can't even get a finance job at a mid-size manufacturing company in SE Michigan.

I've applied to jobs across the United States. Most of them haven't been in highly-competitive markets like NYC or SF. I've applied at high-paying jobs, low-paying jobs, jobs I'm qualified for, jobs I'm not. Almost nothing. My expectations are in the toilet.

I don't want to come across as a victim or entitled. I know it's hard for everyone especially getting your foot in the door, and I know I'm preaching to the choir. I've just been gradually losing hope over the past 4 months and honestly just needed to rant. I spend hours and hours everyday carefully tailoring both my resume and cover letter, just to throw them into the void. I don't know what has caused such a dramatic difference in response between my classmates and me.

I will be starting a master's program in software development through BU's online school soon, but that won't help me to find a job for quite some time."

Some never responded and the rest were scams. I had some legitimate recruiters and companies reach out but the positions they were offering were not fully remote. I understand the remote job market is just flooded with others like me trying to find remote work. I also am finding that LinkedIn is just not totally reliable for finding a new job that's not a scam. I was hopeful since I landed my current job through LinkedIn. I also had a lot of hope because I work for a big company that contacted through the US government so I thought I'd get a new job easily. So I feel pretty lost at this point. I'm seeking a fully remote job because my spouse and I want to leave the area we live in (too expensive) and also to better my mental health. I have (diagnosed) depression and anxiety. It's only gotten worse as I've gotten older. Not to mention I have so much anxiety driving after getting into a car accident a few years ago. I'm happier and more functional at home and I know I'd be even more productive for a job if I was working remotely.
My spouse works remotely and has for many years now. This year they are looking for a new job as well. I can't try for their position as it's something I don't qualify for (they are a systems analyst. I do secure data handling/entry, some administrative work. I also was a social media coordinator at a previous job).
If anyone has any advice on where is the best place for us to look for remote jobs and how best to navigate this oversaturated market that would be awesome. I'd also like to know what types of remote jobs there are. I'd be fine with learning something new if I can learn it on the job. This was also a little rant because this has been weighing heavily on my mind. Thanks everyone."

I’ve tried to have some grace with them because it’s a new position in their company, so I’m sure it will take awhile to get everything situated. In the meantime, I’ve still been applying for other job just in case. I’m just a little frustrated because I have to relocate for this job and would like to start looking at places to live in that area.

However I'm absolutely burnt out beyond being burnt out.

I dread absolutely everything about anything work related with my company. I took this position because I was guaranteed growth again. However after frustration I finally spoke to a manager and his response was pretty much that I'm not going anywhere higher unless someone dies or retires. 

My love/hobbies consist of anything automotive, customizing, or general maintenance. I've spoken to friends in the field and they've pretty much said the same, that they can 100% get my foot in the door since they know me but I'll be looking at about half that salary for who knows how long. 

I'm searching online, but with no specific degree in these options I'm at a loss. I really don't want to push my luck just yet talking to the head honchos yet in fear of them just firing me.

Do I have any other option at this point? 

Although I want out of the manufacturing world, I'd be open to stay if I felt like I'm treated what I'm worth."

I have a degree in psychology from a non-US university. Pursuing a career in psychology isn’t on the cards for me; when I did this degree, I was dramatically oversold the career prospects attached to my degree, and being honest the course content killed any interest I had in pursuing any further education in psychology to actually get into work.

I have been exploring other options for going back into education, from doing another bachelors degree, to certifications, to masters programs not tied to psychology. One of these that keeps coming across my screen is a 10 month boot camp in cybersecurity. Would this actually prepare me for working in cybersecurity, or would I need a traditional degree or something else to make it worth my while? The ad claims that there’s no need for prior experience, but 10 months to come out into growing field with high pay seems a little too good to be true.

If anyone has any interesting recommendations for education or career options, I’m all ears. I’m feeling kind of lost at the moment. Happy to answer any questions that anyone may have.

Thanks y’all."

The compensation was: 115k yearly with a 15-18% bonus and overtime at 55/hour.

I got another offer for the same amount but only a 10% bonus and no overtime. I chose to accept the first offer because of the extra bonus and potential to make more on overtime.

When I got the official offer letter it said “you MAY be eligible for overtime to be paid quarterly if billed to the customer”

It also said “we have no formal bonus, bonuses are given at the company’s discretion”.

The wording made it seem like both the bonus and the overtime are maybes. I don’t want to work overtime if I won’t be compensated for it, especially since the other offer is strictly 9-5. I also want a guaranteed bonus (obviously provided I get a good employee evaluation).

So I've been interviewing with a company and just got done with their final round (this was post panel/presentation etc.) It was a fairly informal chat with the most senior person in my department (C-level exec). We just talked briefly about my experience etc. and they were kind enough to go 20 mins over the time allocated to answer questions etc.

I got an email from the recruiter 10 mins after it ended asking how it went, what the timeline is for other offers and that they should have feedback in a day or two and that they'd like availabilities to get on a quick call. So they have now setup a meeting to reconnect and Im just wondering what this means? They haven't indicated its to discuss an offer or anything. 

Does this usually mean a rejection? I've never been rejected after talking to a C-suite person but also whenever I've gotten the offer its either just been a call or they will tell me over email that they want to setup a call to discuss an offer.

I guess i'm a bit anxious and will just have to wait but wanted to see if anyone's been in this situation before and how it turned out for them etc.

Hoping I can get some insight and idea what waiting for head count mean. 

I applied for a job on November 18th 2022, and completed 3 rounds of interview. Next step I received was a email for back ground check and reference check at the beginning of December. 

Back ground check came back without an issue, and I follow up with HR as I have received an offer from another company. The hiring manager called me directly after the email explaining they are aiming for a January start as they are working with head count at this time and end of year, but their intention was to move forward with offer.

&amp;#x200B;

First week of January I did another follow up, and was explained still currently working on head count and team members are just coming back from vacation.

overall I'm just confused on why a opening opportunity was created without a head count in place. it seems like a waste of time interviewing for a position that technically didn't exists."

I said there has to be some mistake I making that it’s not saving or entering into the correct worksheet on excel still I was treated like a liar then I screenshot it once I got back to my computer, where I saved each days first pass yields. OK, then the conversation changed to me being told to pay attention in a leadership meeting when I was having a migraine, shut my eyes for a moment, but kept moving my leg so they knew I was not sleeping or dozing off. I had an extreme headache, even asked my coworker if I’d get in trouble for stepping out of the meeting since the quality subject of the meeting was already finished. I was yelled at by the production manager “BRITTANY PAY ATTENTION!”  I replied “I’m sorry and I am”.  So after the production meeting,  I went to my manager and told her what had happened she shrugged and said “well”. So today when I was pulled in for the excel mishap, this subject was brought up as well but yet again it was my fault because supposedly the production manager was only worried about my safety?? (Mind you this is a room where we stand in a circle and give the prior days reports).  So then I asked “ if he was only worried for my safety then why did he not ask if I was OK instead of screaming for me to pay attention”.  She raised her voice a bit and said, “he was worried for your safety”?  I am new here and I hate being on the radar.  I like things to be smooth sailing.  Now my manager is doubting me I can see it and I can feel it. At the end of today she taught me the correct way to enter my FPY in CORRECTLY but, whatshould I do to make my situation better also, they are having a layoff and I’m super scared. Does it sound like I’m in danger, or does it sound like I was just getting coached which is what my boss told me all this was, was a coaching.

I had my last job over the summer and decided to focus on college instead of finding another one right after, as that was a particularly stressful semester and I doubt I could have balanced a job with it. 

I've tracked every single place I've applied to; at this point I've sent in applications for 40+ places and 50+ positions, all in retail, food service, etc, and that number is only increasing.

I had an easier time finding a job in the beginning and during the end of the heat of covid, so why is it impossible now? (by that, I mean when everyone had to wear masks.)

I doubt I'm in any system because I don't have a criminal history, hell, I haven't even received a parking or speeding ticket in the 3 years I've been driving. My credit is normal, I haven't messed that up either. 

I believe I'm doing everything right; I allow new employers to contact my previous employers, I have a neat and organized Linkedin profile, I show up to interviews (when I even get them) in a clean white oxford and slacks, with my hair all prettied up. 

I'm not particularly visually alarming; I'm about average looks, I don't have any face tattoos or ""job ending"" features as many older people like to complain about (I personally have nothing against these, and am dating someone with them) 

I don't stutter or struggle to come up with interview answers, I do basic research on the companies I'm applying to days in advance. I get everything together and it still doesn't seem to be working. 

I swear to god, the people who say ""no one wants to work"" are so out of touch, they're beyond help."

Letter:  
As you are already aware, inflation has affected all aspects of the economy, particularly the housing market in south Florida which has steadily increased within the last year.  The cost of living in south Florida and commuting to the office has become too costly for me.  I need to move further out but I would like to keep my position at ABC Co.
 
Since the scope of my job duties can be performed remotely, I ask that you consider allowing me to work from home. 
 
Since June 2022, I have processed, on average, 300 invoices per month at a total average sales amount of $1.3 Million per month. I have successfully learned to acquire purchase order and job numbers on my own. I believe that I have mastered the mechanics of my position that equips me to successfully perform the responsibilities of my duties remotely.  The few times that I worked from home in the past, I found that I was able to complete my obligations with more attention to detail.  

I would be available during my normal working hours and my team would be able to reach me through email or on my cell phone. 

I don’t know what else to write after this point.

I graduated with an engineering degree in December of 2021. I had a job lined up and ready to go for after graduation. I began working in early January of 2022. Immediately, things did not go as planned. At my job I was extremely bored, ignored, and was also commuting very far. After 5 months, I found a new job and quit. 

My new job is better than my first job, however, I’m still very bored. The work I do is very unfulfilling and because of this boredom I really don’t do a great job at work. 

I’ve had talks with my boss about how I’m just not understanding what’s going on and why my work hasn’t been up to par. Which makes me feel even worse now that others have noticed my quality of work. 

There is another component to this, so bear with me. A month after I started my second job (July 2022) I began experiencing severe mental health issues related to anxiety and panic disorder. It was an extremely difficult time for me and I went into inpatient treatment for 3 weeks. After I got out, I continued to work. I am doing better than before, however, I am extremely stressed out about my job and my interactions with other coworkers because I simply am not good at my job. 

Lately I’ve been thinking about quitting my job and taking 2/3 months to get my anxiety under control and find a job that would truly make me happy. I wish I would have taken some time to reflect more after college instead of jumping right in. I just feel guilty about not working. But the way I’m working now isn’t admirable either. I feel so stuck. I can’t see myself doing this like of work forever.
I do have enough money saved up to last me probably 6-8 months. 
—————————————————————————————

It can’t seem to search for ONLY the search string you enter.  I searched for ""Administrative Assistant"", and it returned ""cashier"" and ""tax preparer"".  It has no filters to exclude certain words, so you can exclude jobs you don’t qualify for (like “Nurse”).

1,2023-01-17,Internship - bust or boom?,u/BigBowserBoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10esldq/internship_bust_or_boom/,jobs,"Im not sure where to post this, and would appreciate any insights.

Ive got an internship offer for a startup charter services company, they've been business for 4 years. I'm going to add some background before asking my question

I'm going to be graduating in Dec with a bachelor of commerce - finance major. I have min 2 years experience in the military intelligence, cadets, and my schools investment club. I have a year or so sales, experience as well and I helped get my cousins business running in the past couple years. Leading a team is no issue for me and I've put in the work even while in school. I have at least 3 years of leadership experience in a job site (construction/maintenance). Currently I'm 23 M

Recently I completed three internships with riipen, one sales and one operations. Two of which was with the charter company. Things seemed pretty good, and I was asked about what wage I would accept in the summer for a potential internship. I mentioned the 22-24$ ball park was the market average. They told me they've offered 17.5 in the past. I jokingly said I could make more at costco and said I would be comfortable in the 22-24$ area. 

Fast forward to today, I got news that the owner wants me to be an executive assistant and run sales + operations. I was really exited. We then discussed pay and it was said that 19$ for 30 hours would be the wage. There would be an option for commission but no details were given. 

I was told that I'm valued but any wage increase in the future would have more work expected.

I'm thinking on this more and that wage would be less than 30k a year. The company wants me to work for them for 6 months (this may to dec) but said money right now was tight since covid business slowed their earnings. In the next breath my potential boss said the booking for the services was up 900%. It sounfs like beyond 2023 i would be an executive and i might have a team but no solid plans were discussed or any wage implications.

I have a suspicious vibe from this experience, I was told that i am valued and trusted but then the pay dosent seem to reflect that. I checked Glassdoor and the alberta website (canada) for similar wages. I saw a lot that were from 18$ up to 24$ an hour for 40 hours a week with entry level experience.  The lower end being the lowest job I could find. Most being around 22$ with more hours.  My potential boss also has told me they've had issues in the past hiring good people. The company is also applying for hiring grants to help cover my wage, my gf last summer was on the same grant and was paid 19.3 + weekend premium @ 38 hours at a library.

My question: am I being lowballed and is this a good idea? I've read lots online that people get baited into this type of situation and then when it comes for the wage increase it dosent always happen. Im worried it could turn into a sales job. Sales isint bad by intself but i expressed interest in being oprrations. I've know my boss for about 6 months through my riipen internshipm

On the other hand, getting in early with a company now could be beneficial in the future. The cashflows seem good, and the business model is decent overall. I'm just worried my hardworking attitude will be taken advantage of especially because they want me to commit to 6 months for a below market wage with no direct compensation later on for taking a pay cut. I would also be her exec assistant so to me that should be payed above market.

I've thought about negotiating working for 4 months and then reavaluating, not working there at all or waiting to work for them when things stabilize.

As another thought, I could also pursue an investment career, to get my cfa or to work in futures. I had some expereince in futures trading through a competition at my school.

Any feedback is appreciated. These times are insanely stressful and I want to make sure ive thought of all angles. 

Thanks"

So is exactly what the title says. This company took a dip in terms of not having their shit together on the customer care side of things as the person that was previously there fucked up bad (that was said to me in my 2nd interview) so now they want someone who will clearly know how to do the following :

- Create an easy way of managing tickets

- Create Documentation on what to do for each situation step by step (with flow charts of business processes if I can) and SOPS (standards operating procedures) 

- Further refine their FAQs (so as to lower users logging tickets when they can just troubleshoot themselves &amp; find a fix that way too instead of creating extra tickets.

- Know how to utilize SharePoint in creating Response Templates


In their words they simply want it to be a specific way that if 2 New people had to join the company under me, all I would have to do instead of helicopter-ing around them, is literally show them this system of documented procedures and what processes to follow in order to know what to say and who to go to for what information.

I'm freaking out because whilst I have managed teams before I have never had to create any processes and document stuff.

1. Are there any easy Softwares out there to automate Documenting procedures and processes or make this easy to do (free ideally)? 

2. Are their any easy resources to easily learn how to create or custom make SharePoint into a central point of information? 

3. How do I wing this post? Any words of encouragement will be really welcomed, I can feel the imposter syndrome tingling lol


Any and all advice is welcomed too! 

Thank you so much for reading!

I recently got a job in a firm, where I was promised a coding based profile, but ultimately ended up with AWS cloud architect based role.

This is my third job where it happened, and I have very carefully chosen this role after talking to the manager and the teammates, apparently this is where they have a requirement suddenly so they shifted me to this as I am relatively younger in my career compared to others.

I finally figured out that I am gonna end up never coding again, will be stuck at this DevOps roles and never live my passion.

I was very clear and transparent both with the supervisor during the interview and with the HR employee during my offer phone call that I could not work on Sundays due to my other job. But my January schedule email from my new supervisor says my regular days off will be Mondays and Wednesdays. 

This happened at both of my previous places of employment to the point where I'd have to continuously remind them every time a new schedule was published, which led to frustration on both ends. Since this seems to be a common occurrence I'm wondering what the best way to go about this is. I want to be respectful and not make enemies before my first day but this other job is very strict and it's completely out of my control.

I have a very specific skill set that this company requires. On paper I am a 100% match for what they are looking for. I went through 3 interviews all were great conversations, the person I would be working under even said ""you check all the boxes."" I then interviewed with their boss and it went great. We talked about the interview process and how I am the last person they have interviewed in the second wave of people (apparently other interviews haven't been close to what they want). I was told I would hear back within the next week to week 1/2 (Tomorrow marks 1 week). 

I have not followed up as I am giving them the time they told me they would reach out. 

The ONLY issue I see with all of this is it would require me to move cross country for this job. I have stated through all interviews it is no problem at all when they need me there I'll be there. In the job description it even states they will pay for relocation! 

This job would be life changing for me in compensation, location, and work opportunities in the future.

For those that don't know what FYE is, it's basically a pop culture store that used to be only about music and movies.

Within a week of getting hired, the store manager who hired me had left. That followed by the DM and a DM in training making me basically run the store by myself. I dealt with tons of people being late, the store being left a mess the night before I opened, and even dealt with some of the stores lights being on fire. The place was absolutely trashed after I fixed everything the previous day.

I had planned a trip to see my family up north (I live in Florida) for the holidays. I was able to get off through approval and everything. On the way back down from the trip, we were driving back and got into an accident on the interstate. Guy slammed his brakes in front of us. We stopped in time but an elderly woman behind us hit us at 50 MPH. I injured my knee in that accident and I was supposed to return to work the next day. I explained it to them and sent them pictures. The day after that, I had gotten a TEXT MESSAGE, NOT A CALL about two hours before I was expected to return to work that I had gotten fired.

I called her wondering what's going on and she explained to me that my ""attendance"" was bad. I had never called out, nor was I ever late. We're a low income family and I got screwed out of providing for my family over getting into a car accident. Unfortunately, Florida is a hire/fire at will state. So I don't think I could do anything about this. I got blamed for the store being a wreck when I wasn't present and accused of being late every day even tho I'm on time. I had a coworker sexually harass me and nothing was ever done about it. Don't ever work for FYE."

It’s like the pressure keeps mounting on me. Since I’m handling so much this means I forget to do something trivial here and there, or I’m not fully organized.

Many of the applications are through county government websites and have supplemental questions that ask a question such as:

""For the question answered above, please provide the name of the agency, length of time, position, and level of responsibility by each function listed. Please note that ""See Resume"" or ""See Application"" will be considered an incomplete response for this question.""

You are basically asked this question twice. First as far as your professional librarian experience and then again for your management experience. 

How are you supposed to answer this and format it. Previously in the application you list your experience with a space for a job summary. Are they looking for detailed answers? I've never encountered this type of application before, so I'm just confused as to what they are looking for here.

Any insight is appreciated.

I feel like I have done something so wrong and can’t even be eager about my new job at the moment. Worried I may have burned bridges, but I thought “the sooner the better” was always the best way to go about giving notice.

Is it always the standard practice to set up a video call and verbally tell bosses before sending an email?

UPDATE: Boss is letting me go early. I can’t help but feel down about myself and what I have done.

2ND UPDATE: Spoke with him, I let him know I am still learning and was trying to make sure I literally told him within 2-weeks time before waiting the next work day. He understood, reassured me we are in good standing, and wished me well on my new journey!

Thank you to everyone for your kind words/advice!!!"

What's best practice? 

I interned for a company while getting my Masters. I cold called the company and elbowed my way in for a mostly independent internship. Amazing experience I loved the company and people, but there was barely any room for me as an intern so definitely no opportunities to keep me as an employee. 

Unfortunately shortly after my departure they lost some of the work I did for them (I wrote policy, data collection, and research). They reached out like a month after I left and asked for it, but I didn't have it since I left everything in the intern email GDrive. They said nothing was there but I didn't take anything out of the GDrive, so I think it's probably like IT erased everything sort of thing, but no one knows. Either way the documents were lost so we just moved on.

It's been 2 years and they're hiring! I'd like to apply because I really did like it there and would like to go back. Will that loss of work affect my chances? Is there any way for me to address it? Additional note, I'm hesitant about sending a flag email of my interest to my old supervisor because the application says they're doing it ""blindly"" so no names on the application or anything identifying. Even so, they'll definitely see my prior internship listed on the resume anyway so it is ok either way. So I probably shouldn't flag it then right?"

Unsolicited advice from someone who has been through 3 layoffs: 


1. This is not a reflection of your worth, your ability or your performance. It’s a business decision and that’s all. 


2. You have a huge tech company on your resume. That’s something to be proud of and it will open doors for you. 


3. Find the silver lining. There is one there, I promise. It could be that you get to use your severance to take a month or two off work, and spend time with friends, family and yourself. Maybe your job is stressful and now you can walk away from that stress. Maybe you have been delaying applying for a higher position, and this is the push you need. 


4. It feels horrible right now, but it will get better. Sharpen your resume and put yourself out there. As bad as it feels, the sooner you let everyone in your network know you were impacted and that you are open to work, the sooner you will have a new opportunities."

Instead of laying off and paying unemployment, they sold the workforce to a vendor. Same wage and schedule, ok fine. A few weeks before the new training, we had to sign offer letters and paperwork. This new company has more intrusive policies for the remote workers. This is includes camera monitoring and motion detection for the whole shift as well as biometric data collection of yourself that they keep on record for a few months once you leave. Needless to say most did not want to sign. However it was explained if we did not sign it we wouldn't be onboarded and we would be effectively ""quitting or resigning"" from the previous employer, thus become ineligible for unemployment. And yes, I know there's unemployment laws and people should seek out an attorney in this case. I did just that and was told it would be $250 an hour and no guarantee of course for the outcome.

Anyway, documents were signed to be onboarded and we were told it would take months to receive new equipment that would have these cameras and monitoring. Well it's coming a lot sooner. It's something most people feel intensely uncomfortable with for obvious reasons. 

Are there ways or have anyone come across methods for stalling this new equipment set up?

Important things I'll include. This company won't pay for technical outages. So if the camera is a requirement to log on and get paid, but the camera lens is obscured, I can see them most likely not allowing you to clock hours til it is fixed and the employee is meeting the requirements.

Before posting I'd like to say in response to the likely comments of getting an lawyer; I do not have the money for that."

I work 32 hours per week so part-time, the thing is I'm a quick learner and complete the tasks fast so the boss has noticed that and keeps piling up more tasks and responsibilities for me to the point where it's leading me to failure because I can't fit all the tasks in those daily hours that I work, then they ask why I missed out on tasks and I tell them that I'm trying to finish others... what aggravates me is that the boss sits me down and says ""how long does this task take?"" I say ""it depends, it can take 30 minutes or sometimes it can take 1 hour and 30 minutes"" then the boss says ""on average it takes 30 minutes"" the boss basically asks me how long it takes me to complete each task, they made me do an excel spreadsheet of each of my tasks and the time ""I THINK"" it should take to complete... the thing they don't seem to understand is that things like this are basically impossible to predict because every day can be different because things come up or things can be more or less every day, anybody who's worked in an office-setting or is a 'coordinator' understands this. On top of that, they say that there is really no room for error... wtf?!

The most demotivating thing is that the pay has stayed the same. The boss only cares about getting things done, they don't really care about anything else so I don't even want to sit and ask them for a higher pay nor do I want more hours to work. It's stressful and I'm at the point where I'm thinking of looking at finding another job.

Any tips and advice would be helpful."

4,2023-01-18,Boss dependent on gossip for performance review.,u/PopDiddilyBop,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10f7s26/boss_dependent_on_gossip_for_performance_review/,jobs,"I 22f worked at an assisted living facility. It was a very small shop with no human resources department, and about 12 employees. The turnover rate was extremely high, and the boss was close friends with a couple longer term employees. Like would go to their houses and hang out with them. 

I avoided my coworkers because they often would go behind my back and complain about me. There was no training program so I depended on them for training, but really felt like they wanted me to fail. So I just did all that I could by myself and only worked with them if I had to. They wouldn't give me feedback and complain to my boss immediately, which resulted in many aggressive texts and unwarranted phone calls off the clock. My boss would ask coworkers about how I am doing, and what they said determined if I would get fired or not. They were all in a clique and I gave up on trying to get into their friend group. 

My last performance review my coworkers complained about some small mistakes I made on things I wasn't trained on - such as laundry. Apparently those things are common sense. But my boss often contacts me off the clock for basically everything, so I became really scared to do things around the facility. My boss said that I wasn't catching on and that I need to appease my coworkers otherwise she would fire me and give me a bad reference to any other facility that called about me. 

I no longer trust anything I do, and I am now terrified to do anything around the facility by myself. I cry constantly and I have thrown up on the job due to stress. Am I overreacting? Is this normal?"
3,2023-01-18,Need references for graduate role but boss likely not too pleased with me leaving,u/sssourgrapes,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10f7umu/need_references_for_graduate_role_but_boss_likely/,jobs,"I recently accepted a job offer for a graduate role at a tech company in London - great salary, benefits, fully remote. The offer is subject to successful probationary period and references. 

As I’ve only just graduated from University late last year, I haven’t had much working experience except for my time working in my current company, which is a startup. I have decided to leave as the startup wasn’t adequately compensating us for our work - it almost felt exploitative. Despite this, I’ve always had an amicable working relationship with my boss. He would often recognise my achievements and praise me in great detail. However, I’m hesitant to use him as a referee due to the fear of sabotage or malicious compliance. He was going to promote me once but the promotion fell through. 

I have asked my professor at my university for permission to be listed as a referee, and she has said she’s more than happy to support me on this request. Another professor whom I did my research under has offered to help. 

I’m also planning to list 1 or 2 of my co-workers whom I’m working with, who have previously helped me a lot. One is of a senior role. One has already agreed to help, she is a team lead in another department. We have a good relationship even outside of work. 

So yes, the only problem here is my boss. 

However, being a startup, me leaving has implications as it’s a very small team, and I could tell that my boss isn’t too happy with me leaving. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to manage this situation with references? Is giving a reference from your current boss necessary? 

Thank you 🙏🙏🙏"

My husband and I are in the process of relocating out of state. The industry I'm in has a heavy presence in my current city, so most of my network - and thus most available roles I'm interviewing for - are based in this city. For roles posted that are denoted as hybrid or in-office, when should I tell recruiters/hiring managers that I am looking for a remote role?

My opinion is that I should disclose this at the start of the process, like during the hiring screen or first interview. I am a ""road warrior"" and given I do a lot of partner management, I am no stranger to jumping on a plane and traveling to partners and to the office as needed. I feel like this model will work for many teams and companies, but not all. Not disclosing this right away feels disingenuous to me, not to mention if a team or company cannot accommodate this I don't want to waste anyone's time.

However, some of my closest confidantes (and leaders at their own large companies) have pushed me to keep this information quiet at first. ""Let them love you and make you an offer, then you can negotiate location.""

I’m hesitant to apply since I do plan on leaving once I complete my masters in a few months. I’d like to start applying for new jobs after I graduate in August but who knows how long it’ll be before I actually am offered and accept a position, so that’s why I’m giving myself about a year/1.5 left at my current job. Hopefully, it doesn’t take that long, but I remember how long it took me last time so I’m not trying to get my hopes up for nothing.

•	⁠I recently got a job working at a retail store that tends to have a considerable amount of downtime between customers.
•	⁠As I am still in training, I am required to always work with someone, with there being one in particular that I often paired with more than others. After working with him for around a month I have noticed some things that are making me think that he might be a narcissist.
•	⁠The main thing that is making me suspect this is that literally every time I work with him, he will spend hours throughout the day talking about himself or telling stories that always end up complimenting himself somehow, usually without any sort of prompt.

Examples

1.	⁠His main form of self-praise revolves around what a tough guy he is, with him often telling me how he doesn’t take crap from anyone and isn’t afraid to get physical if a situation calls for it. This is probably motivated by the fact that he is a very big and strong guy, as he was a former body builder. He’ll often tell me stories about times when he acted tough with rude or confrontational people and how he got them to back off. It seems like no matter what the topic was that we initially started talking about, he will find a way to segway into him complimenting himself or putting himself on a pedestal. Just the other day we were talking about Game of Thrones, and he said that white he probably wouldn’t win a fight with Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, the actor who plays the Mountain of the show, he would at least leave him bruised and give him a fight that he would not forget. We also got into a conversation about policing in America, and he ended up turning into a conversation about how whenever he gets pulled over for speeding or whatnot, the cops will always call for backup because of how big he is.
2.	⁠He claims to have gotten a degree in psychology and trained to be an expert in reading and interrogating people, as he originally wanted to work for the CIA as an interrogator, but he was disqualified from being able to get such a job because his wife at the time was from New Zealand. He claims that if he wanted to he could analyze and verbally break down anyone using his skills, but he would not do something like that because he isn’t a bad guy. He seems to think that he is the ultimate authority on all things that relate to psychology or mental health. He recently told me a story about how another coworker of ours told him that he thinks he might be on the autism spectrum, but he told this other coworker that based on what he has seen, there is no way he could be on the autism spectrum. And when this other coworker tried to say “but”, he cut him off and said “no buts”, and that there was basically no way he was wrong. He has literally told me that he will “destroy” anyone that tries to argue with him about anything related to mental health or psychology.
3.	⁠Finally, there is a specific way we are supposed to try and sell things at the place where we work, but he claims that the best way to do things is the way HE does things, and that I should listen to him if I want to succeed. He also claims the only reason he is not the manager of the store we work at is that he did not want the hassle and responsibilities that come with being in charge, which is why he “let” the current manager have the position

•	⁠Does this sound like a narcissist or something similar to you, or am I just over-analyzing things?
•	⁠TLDR: My coworker at my new job constantly talks about and tells stories that always revolve around ways he is so great, and I am wondering if he could be a narcissist."

I also have tons of like ""special"" deals with my boss like i can always hop to the store for 10-15 minutes etc.



The job i applied for the person has to be trained since not many people can do this straight away, so they always need to be trained and then learn as they go. They are company with only 5 workers, 1 accountant, 1 manager/owner.  3 workers (one is owner and one is pretty close to retirement)  they need 1 hard worker that can and that they trust to maybe in future help to run the company and also so the owner can work less maybe cause he is also old and has been running the company since 1999.


They really like me and i do not have the skill but the fact i'm young and willing to learn, grow and develope new skills is what makes them like me tons, i spoke to my boss about this and he asked me what they would pay me if they hired me and i told him i didn't know and he said to me when you know i should let him know, so he could try to match whatever they would pay me cause he does not wanna loose me.   


I am going to the 2nd interview at the other job on Friday and we will talk salary and the work outside the work hours since once your skilled enough you will have a phone and if something happens you might need to go and fix or solve the problem which is ofcourse paid and you have a work car.  Launch time is also depended on what your doing etc so you do not have any specific hour for launch. 


Since i have never done any interviews before and i'm safe at my current work. **What should i be asking in the 2nd interview? What should i ask to be paid?** In the first interview they told me they only need 1 hard worker and do not want to hire to many people cause they wanna be able to pay very good money.  Also occasionally 1 or 2 of the workers have to go somewhere and spend maybe 1-2-3 nights to fix something,  you get ofcourse hotel paid and dinner.  But she said instead them paying ""day money"" they just pay higher salary all the time.
Also their work hour is 09:00 to 18:00 and 09:00 to 15:00 on Friday


**Pros at current job**

Good money for what i do.


I am safe for next few years.


I work Mon-Tue 07:30 - 16:00 


I am done 12:40 on Fridays.



When kid is sick i can work evening shift instead.


I like my boss and co workers.


I basically can pick what i do since i am ""alt mulig man"" at current job



**Pros at other job**

They say they pay very good money (do not know how much.


Only few people work there


Chances of being the future boss of the company later on.


I get a work car.


I would be safe also for next few years if i am good worker."

Recently had my manager submit her two weeks notice to our boss and thus leaving me with all the responsibilities of this office - just us two were part of the management team. My boss called me and said this is my time to step up and take over her responsibilities as he plans to hire a more junior person to help me out. Effectively this means I am the manager, I’m very capable and can handle the duties but there will be an increase in work load. 

I stated to my boss as there is more responsibilities I will need a wage increase to reflect that, but she decided not to give me a raise and we can further discuss in 3-4 months time. 

Currently I am underpaid in my industry and feel slighted. Should I leave?"

Here is my pet peeve list.

When calling a business, please say your name.  I'm neither your mama nor a mind reader.  Something like this would work ""Hi, my name is (insert name) and I'm calling from (business) regarding (topic)"".

Know the difference between your time zone, area code, and zip code and understand them all.  Please do not assume I'm in the same time zone as you.  Also, know your country code.  US and Canada are 1.  

If I'm taking a message for you, please give the information in the order requested.  I ask for your name first for a reason.  The form I fill out is in a certain order and it's quicker to tab then go back.

Don't get snippy when the department you need is busy and will call you back.  That's how businesses work and remain profitable.  The world doesn't revolve around you.

This is all I can think of right now, but does anyone else have suggestions?"

This is a question related more to defense contracting.

This would be my first contractor position, and I do not have prior experience as being a network engineer, and my only real related experience I had prior to this was in the military for 2 years and as a student researcher for 2 years.

I just wanted to ask a few things:
- Is the salary appropriate (should I ask for more) for the level of the position and also for my experience?
- The offer states something like "" we also offer optional medical, dental, and vision coverage"". Is this normal that it says ""optional""? Also, in general how much comes out of the employees pocket for medical, dental, and vision coverage? (Sorry if this is a stupid question, it's my first contractor position once again)
- In the offer it doesn't mention vacation days, sick days, or even start date. Should these be written in an offer?

I haven’t tried reaching out to my friends in the team, but it’s strange I wouldn’t hear from them like this.

Luckily I have two interviews set up already but I messaged my manager about how the career services program is zero help for technical interviews and I’m just being ignored; seeing my boss messaging in Teams group chats while ignoring me. At this point, why should I even leave a passdown"

Background: I interviewed for a position at an energy nonprofit in November. I made it to the final round and the team members told me they were looking to offer the position to someone before Thanksgiving. Two days before Thanksgiving, HR called me to let me know that I was their top candidate, but they had to wait until January to make an offer. I did some research and realized this isn't too uncommon (correct me if I'm wrong).

Current situation: I had not heard anything from the HR person so I emailed him last week (Thursday) to see if there was an update. He responded and let me know that they were about to go into their hiring meeting and would give me an update that afternoon or the next morning. It is now Wednesday of the following week and I have not heard anything.

I'm not sure how to handle the situation. Basically - am I freaking myself out? Should I reach out again, or is it too soon? Is this normal or am I justified in my frustration? I'm genuinely not sure what to do, if anything. This is my second time feeling like I'm being given the run-around by a prospective employer and I'd just like some closure. I would really appreciate any advice or insight into this situation since I'm new to the job hunting scene!

Thank you for reading!!"

For some perspective I’m leaving my current job because my boss is horribly unprofessional, basically uses me as the scapegoat for everything, and on top of it consistently questions my pay or says I make “too much”, and has zero boundaries what so ever. My point in saying all of this is, the owner of the business I am going to knows my current boss. I know that when I give my notice my boss will want to know where I’m going, and I don’t know exactly how to address that. I don’t want to lie, and I don’t want to tell her that I’m leaving her to basically work for her colleagues business. Any suggestions would be helpful"

Maybe I'm just ranting and getting this outside of myself.

On my work history: after graduating college 10 years ago, I had grand visions of changing the world by working at a nonprofit and managing volunteers. I devoted a year to ""professional volunteering"" through Peace Corps-like program, but here in the US. After my term was up, I had a difficult time trying to get a job in the nonprofit field. I temped around for a while, until I started working at a wholesale company by the grace of a friend. It was a terrible experience with terrible colleagues and a terrible boss. I moved on from there after three years and worked at an association for five years. I was kind of comfortable, got very good at my job, but maintained a major inferiority complex due to my treatment by my boss and incredibly gossipy colleagues. Finally when I couldn't stand it anymore, I moved in to a consulting company, only to feel like I'd been set up for failure once again in a role that had no clear expectations and ultimately felt like a scam.

Enter last spring. I interviewed for a professional services firm, and got the job within a day. I joined an incredible team, with a supportive boss who established the most psychological safety in a job I've ever experienced. He believed in me, recognized my skill set, and wanted me to succeed. He coached me through difficult situations. I had the opportunity to be recognized as an expert and wrote articles. I finally felt ... happy ... at work. Until the end of last year, when the firm announced it would be acquired. My boss found a new role and will be moving on. I'm of course happy for his new endeavor but am left feeling like nothing good lasts.

I'm just so disappointed to be in this position again. I don't know what the future holds. Maybe the new company that I'll be working for will be good, but I've heard horror stories about the team that my role would be on over there and I'm nervous. I just feel like I'm back in this cycle of being miserable at work, being at the behest of an employer that I hate, barely being able to make it through day to day. I finally started feeling like I'm worth something, like I can make a positive contribution and  work actually being meaningful to me rather than just a way to survive. It's like I'm mourning the death of a very temporary happy period of my professional life.

I guess I'm just looking for confirmation that this situation isn't hopeless. That out there, there are jobs and teams that recognize a person's worth and serve to build them up rather than tear them down. I'm so sad and afraid for the future."

I’m ready to go full time and found what seemed like a great position. The pay is more than I expected, the flexibility is great, the job itself is fine. I’m in a management role and was told there’d be times I would need to do after hours meetings or happy hours with new hires, totally fine. I started this week and found out it’s not just once a quarter but every 8 weeks and that it’s actually an event that happens where I’m expected to stay until the party is over, around midnight. There are also other multiple late night requirements that they either didn’t mention or downplayed the amount it happened. They also said travel to other locations across the country would also be an option if I wanted but wasn’t mandatory, but now am told it’s looked down on if I don’t.
This isn’t for me. I know it’s not. If I were single, I would thoroughly enjoy this. I’m family first, and having to stay out to party, while enjoyable 15 years ago, just isn’t now. I believe I’m going to start my search over and would love to hear opinions on how to handle this. My resume now shows I’m unemployed, unless I add this position I just started.

Anyways, I've gone through all of their interview rounds, but the company has not updated me on my status - it has been about a month and a half. I've obviously asked for an update before, but they keep saying that they'll get back to me within a week or so and then never do.


The one thing that stands out to me a little is that in all of their communications, they always ask me to keep them updated on any offers I get from other companies. I suspect I might be just being paranoid here, but I'm worried that maybe the company looks at whether a candidate has any other offers to determine if they are quality (as I said, this company is apparently very prestigious), and maybe that's the reason they haven't given me an offer yet (because I don't have any other offers). They also haven't rejected me either, so I feel like maybe they're waiting to see if I get any other offers.

I make $18/hr. I’ve been here since June.

When I was hired, I was originally hired to do overflow paralegal work as a legal assistant because Im In college to get my Paralegal certificate.
They started me at $16, after promising me $17. They sort of fixed the mess up and put me at $18.

Later, because of poor planning, I was transitioned onto phone work. (Very grueling and stressful work.)
I’m what they would now call an intake specialist. But, over a period of a few months, I was doing a little bit of paralegal work bit by bit, and now I’m pretty much on call for attorneys.
I’ve done trial prep, drafting some motions, trial binder delivery, scheduling clients, evidence compiling, etc.
On top of this, I’m on the phones all day. Taking up to 15-20 calls a day. Most of which are rough 30 minutes long. I take payments. Make files. Etc.

Some weeks I hardly do any paralegal work, other times, I’m printing 2000 pages for a trial binder and sorting them out.
Basically, I’ve developed certain skills over a period of time in different areas of the department.

I would like to propose $20/ hr.

For reference: the other paralegals make $23-$26 an hour.

I don’t expect to further anything else in my career at the firm. I’d be fine to stick with $20 till I go to Uni after community college.

So, I emailed the recruiter for confirmation and she tells me that yes, I should be hearing back about next steps after the team is finished with the round of first interviews. 

I feel like I made a mistake that might take me out of the running for both positions honestly. What should I do here? The option to withdraw my application for associate PM isn't showing up for me, and I might have to contact the recruiter if I want to withdraw. At the same time, I'm not sure I will get the chance to move forward for the PM role yet."

I work in sales for a small, successful company. I have worked my book of business from $0 to where I make a little over $1 million a year. Again, I am very fortunate.  

My boss/company owner has always been a little shady but the company is successful and most everyone does well financially so everyone just looks the other way.

Well, something didn't seem right with this month's commission check so I asked accounting to look into it. 

Turns out they were miscalculating some things FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS. My boss estimates this is around a $500-600,000 error.

When I asked when he was going to make me whole he clammed up and tried to change the subject. 

So it seems like the only thing I can do now is to report him to the State and possibly sue him. 

However, that would undoubtedly sour our relationship and I do not think I will pay able to find a job that pays this well anytime soon . 

However, I am obviously finding it difficult to just forget about $500,000.

I have had 3 positions since working here but the main responsibility was the same throughout; only more responsibility was added. Can I format my resume to have the organization's name and the year I worked for them and then below, show the various positions I had? For example:

Place                                                      (July 1928- July 1929)

Position 2                                                                                                        (August 1928- November 1929) 

 

* Position 1's responsibilities

Position 3                                                                                                       (November 1929- July 1929)

* Position 1's responsibilities 
* Stuff

It's a horrible place to work and would like to leave as soon as possible. If I have to wait until I had a year at this position I will be here until August. I was suicidal months before due to this place. I want to leave as soon as possible. The majority of the people in my department are crazy and honestly cruel.

I'm afraid of not finding a job because I do have a gap for a few years before I worked here. The majority of that gap was due to the health of a family member. 

Will jobs look at this formatting, or even just everything as a big fat negative and disregard my resume?

Even if I leave without a job lined up I don't care at this point. This place makes people sick; they all look miserable."

There are two jobs that are both admin related but in different sectors. I applied to one yesterday and then the other was posted today. When I went to submit my application for the second, the system told me I can only have one resume and cover letter submitted for all applications (they are using iCIMS which I am unfamiliar). I usually tailor every resume and cover letter for the specific position Im applying to…but now have the resume/cover letter tailored for the second position uploaded. I have the requirements for both but the second position is in the same department I was in previously (development). Should I withdraw my application for the first position since now I have the resume/cover letter that’s tailored to the second position on my profile? I see it says that the first is under review but I don’t want to ruin my chances altogether for having two applications out in different departments.

Would it look bad to withdraw an application? Should I just keep both applications open even though my cover letter says I’m applying to the second position? At my last institution I applied to numerous jobs so I haven’t run into this before.

TLDR: applied to two different roles within same university. Application system only allows me to upload one cover letter and resume for all roles I apply to. Should I withdraw from one or would that look bad?

I’m in a situation I’m probably overthinking but just wanted to get some input on. 

So I currently live in a small college town (girlfriend is getting her masters) where I have a fully remote job based in a nearby metropolitan area. After my gf graduates in May we are going to move back to that metropolitan area, and after we move I am intending on applying for a new job at a large company that employs a lot of people n that area (don’t like the industry of my current job). 

However, I am always checking the company website for job openings and one just opened up that is not only remote eligible but is very applicable to my skills and experience (more than any listing I’ve seen.)

So my question is, if I utilize an employee referral, apply for the job now and go through the process but end up not getting it (maybe they prefer someone not fully remote even though it is “remote eligible”) can I apply to the company again when I move to the area in May? Or will they see they’ve already rejected me for a similar position and not entertain any further applications?

I’m sure every company evaluates differently but would appreciate any insight!"

I do have a blemish on my record (felony conviction of common law robbery two years ago with no jail time), so I know my prospects are limited from the get-go. I even had a job offer from an organization that didn't do a background check but didn't get it since the staffing agency I went through did (smh).

To survive, I've been doing Grubhub deliveries and side gigs for income and my bills, as well as borrowing money from family and friends. Throughout everything, I still maintain some hope but I feel that it is slowly dwindling. 

How do you stay motivated throughout all of this?"
3,2023-01-18,How CAN you positively frame negative employment gaps on a resume along with your work history?,u/rawbery79,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10fpz1o/how_can_you_positively_frame_negative_employment/,jobs,"Someone else asking a related question got me thinking about this one, because I've now been fired three times in a row (yes, I'll explain) and I have done things with those gaps that could be appealing to employers, but I don't know how to frame that around the jobs I've had.

Firing One: Management was toxic and non-communicative, but I was also having a mental crisis because my husband's cancer had come back in less than a year. Once my coworkers found out, I became a social pariah. They forced me to take FMLA for myself (I was trying to save it for his treatment) and then when I came back and tried to explain what I needed from a disability accommodation standpoint (my AD/HD and depression were off the charts, even medicated) and asked procedural questions, I got fired.

I was out of work for about three and a half months, in which time I reorganized parts of my house, took a cross country rail trip, and tried to learn things from LinkedIn Learning.

Firing Two: This one was especially shady - I had a bad afternoon once and wrote a bunch of stuff down in a Word document to get it off my chest. It helped, and I didn't give it a second thought, until my supervisor looked through my files on the server and came to me weeks later acting like I was suicidal. I wasn't and explained that, but things were never the same after that. I also had unexpected urgent eye surgery, and was asked to do manual labor (it was an office job) when I was restricted from doing so. I politely let my supervisor and hers know that I couldn't do what they were asking me and why I couldn't, and they fired me. Did not expect that.

I was off from April to December this time, which really sucked. I took another train trip (which had a lot more logistical things I had to quickly decide on), learned a little about filming and video editing, and researched what kind of career I wanted.

I got the last job in November and started in December - it was in a totally different field than I'd worked before, and was interested in the job enough to apply. I was there exactly six weeks and they pulled me in last Friday and said I ""wasn't a good fit"" (with no explanation of what I should or shouldn't be doing) which was kind of disappointing. I didn't 100% love the job (who does?) but I was enjoying myself and I was enjoying the new skills I was learning. I was even on LinkedIn Learning with my boss' knowledge and acceptance trying to learn about IT support. I saw the job posting for my position yesterday and I'm only more confused - everything they have listed was what I was doing, and I never got any feedback about anything, so I have no clue what that was about.

I know how to frame what happened with the previous jobs in a way that makes both parties sound good, and I'm just going to call this last one a temp job (because it sure ended up being one) but how do I formatically weave the skills I learned in my time off between my actual employment on a resume?

I'm in my early 40s and have had a terrible run of bad luck, coupled with my own mental health and my husband's physical health. (The cancer is back, it's stable, we aren't treating it) How do I make all this make me stand out as a good candidate? I feel like a big failure, and I feel like this ""rah rah, mental health"" is just an excuse for employers to screw you over."

1,2023-01-18,"I'm planning to take a 2-month trip this spring, around April-May. When is the best moment to disclose this info during the interview/hiring process?",u/ProtestTheHero,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10fr0qf/im_planning_to_take_a_2month_trip_this_spring/,jobs,"I'm on mobile and tired so I'll try to keep this as brief as possible. I can provide more details/context in the comments if it's asked. But essentially, my current workplace is very old-school and rigid where taking even 2 *days* off is a bit of a battle. So of course, when I brought up this trip to my boss, she was somewhat understanding of my motivation and my place in life, but a few days afterwards she confirmed that there's no way that she or HR will approve it. 

So naturally I immediately started sending out some CVs and I have a couple of interviews lined up next week already. My plan is, sometime in March, to tell my boss like ""Listen, I was always going on that trip whether you 'gave' me 'permission' or not. I'll be back in June. Do you want me to come in or not?"" Most likely, she's going to show me the door, despite the fact that just to post a job listing due to my leaving, wait for applicants, interview them, hire them, wait for their medical tests and other pre-approvals, nevermind *training* them on all our idiosyncratic softwares and procedures.... That would all take way more than 2 months, and I'd be back at my desk. But they're most likely too bureacratic, by-the-book, and set in their ways to do the smart thing. They'll probably tell me not to come back.

So. I'd feel a lot better if I had a plan B, and a plan C, and..... Something to fall back on in case it doesn't work out with my current job. In my search for another job, when is the best time to tell them about my trip? Before I even interview, to save everyone the time (and myself the stress of interviewing)? But that eliminates the chance that I'd blow the other candidates out of the water to the point that they'd be okay with waiting. Do I say something *during* the interview? Or wait all the way until if I have an offer, and make it part of the negotiations? 

I'm in a bit of a pickle because if I get hired tomorrow hypothetically, we're sort of far enough away from April that I could still get at least a couple of months under my belt before the trip. But we're very far, 6 months, for anyone to wait until AFTER the trip, in that case any employer would probably just choose another candidate. And the longer I wait, the more likely an employer might be willing to wait a couple of months until after I get back, but in terms of my own peace of mind I don't want to end up April 1st with a plane ticket in my hand and going like oh shit once I get back I am full on unemployed. But alas it's the choice I'm making and the risky game I'm playing.

Would love to hear your thoughts on this."

I’m an associate at my current employer, they gave me a huge bump last year. They’re moving me into more responsibilities and I do a lot of things relating to our office “culture”, probably much more than anyone else with my job title. They made it clear I’m valued. At the same time, I also know that my current salary is 15k less than the starting salary for my position and it’s not even “senior” level. 

The job I’m being asked to interview for, the top end is 37% more than what I make. But even stranger. She said, I’m going to be blunt, worse thing to happen, you can take our offer and use it to leverage yourself a raise.

Huh? Is that weird? I said I would consider an interview. But is that a good sign that they really want me to interview? Is it a trap? I’m so confused. And to be honest, the last couple of weeks at my current job have been pretty disheartening.

I recently accepted a job offer which is contingent on a background check.

I applied to this job back in December, interviewed the week after my resignation, and got the offer. I was not asked in the interview if I still worked there, all my resume info was technically based on December info which was 100% accurate.

I quit early this month because I wanted some time off/wanted to 100% focus on my job search (would not have time to do so otherwise due to the nature of my job). 

Now in the background check (First Advantage/Stirling type of check) I must provide my employment dates (no change - it's January) but also whether I am currently employed there or have resigned. At the end of the day, my employment dates are still the same because they are only requiring month/year but I will need to disclose that I've resigned on the form since they will contact my employer (no issues, left in good terms).

Am I overthinking this or would this be fine? Do they only care about the month/year at the end of the day or would the 'present' listed on my resume vs 'resigned' on the form result in the check failing?

I spent nearly a year finding a job that wasn't an high school level secretarial job, and finally got an offer within Health Administration in April of 2022. Unfortunately for me, I didn't know what I was getting into and it was a mess (shady operations, unreasonable/rude boss \[who was the CEO too\], very high turnover, not enough pay for the work, etc.) the commute was also hell and I could tell I was getting depressed. I stuck it out for a total of 5 months, applying to jobs desperately and got one offer in October for a non-profit in my state. It was a pay cut, but not too different from the last job because of different state taxes, and I now work from home 4 days a week.

 The problem is that while I don't feel as stressed doing my job, I am worried that in the future this will set me back when I do go to find another one, because its in Event coordination, whereas I think I want to go into Marketing, Data Analytics, or Business Development and I am not necessarily using those skills at the moment. My plan was to stay here at least a year since my last job was only about half a year, and try to start a masters program part time. Basically I feel like I will have to start from scratch for a third time, and will be behind both career-wise and pay-wise compared to my peers. I believe that I had so much potential, a quick learner, and a hard worker (my ex-boss literally cried because I was leaving) and I am not sure that future employers will see it because I will have spent a year at a non-profit in an irrelevant field, especially seeing as it was so hard to get anybody interested in me the first time.

I’ve done everything they asked, had great references, and now they want more! It’s not a big company either…

However at the end he again said I’d be a great fit but this time he also said that they’re interviewing other candidates. So is ending a 60 mins interview within 30 mins a bad sign?

It’s been less than 2 days since the interview but I’m feeling really anxious as this is a great company and a great role.

I've always been interested in techy stuff and like fixing stuff or building hardware together.   
But I'm kinda sick of having it as a job. I live doing it for friends and family, but not as a Job. IT wasn't necessarily industry I was most interested in, it was the job that least ticked me off. And back then it felt like it was the closest that connected to my hobbies, which was playing video games (and still is my hobby). It turned out to be totally wrong and the thing that related most to video games is programming, which I couldn't do and never learned ever since I started my 1st apprenticeship . But I already took my path and didn't want to end up with no diploma or anything. 

Ever since I am working, my days and nights always feel horrible. I always have to force myself to go to work. Everyday when I wake up, I get up too late so I have to stress every time and in the evening I try to delay my sleep for as long as possible, just so I can get the most out of my freetime and going to sleep means the next thing I do after sleeping is getting up for work. I refuse to believe that I am going through some sort of depression. Sure it's not bad 24/7 and I'm feeling good going to work sometimes, but the excitement usually comes from the upcoming weekend/vacation and the planned events in the near future.

I know I am young, but this is exactly the reason, why I don't want to fall in a life full of regrets, by not doing things that I actually like or enjoy doing. I envy my dad, who is a chef in a more noble restaurant. He has been there for over 15 years and he loves doing it. He has to do more than I do, work way longer, he has to coordinate his employees and earns just a tiny bit more than I do. But I can't get to the same mindset. Am I weird for being that way?"

I'm struggling to overcome \~10 years of tunnel-vision SWE resume building. Whenever I search for advice on converting technical resumes to non-technical, usually the opposite comes up, or generic resume advice.

In tech, there are very specific ways to build a resume: keywords to include based on the job, how to form each sentence with the STAR method, experiences to include or exclude. Those exist with other resumes as well, but differ greatly, and I'm not sure how or what to convey on my resume given that almost everything I've kept track of over my past 5 years of work experience has been technical.

**In short, is there a solid guide on converting a software-focused resume to a general / pre-med focused resume where the goal is getting volunteer / clinical experience / post-bacc premed program admission?**

For reference, here is a snippet from my resume's work experience section:

https://preview.redd.it/at5qv77o00da1.png?width=1606&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=66e3bc53d1e3ad9e2286d88fafe7cb8cebd3354d

I don't have research, volunteer, clinical, or other experience to add yet, so this is purely trying to convert work experience.

Since January 2022, I’ve had the following roles:

- May-September 2022: worked in duty free in an airport
- October 2022 onwards: I’ve been working in a mostly office based role in the tourism industry. 

I’m just so worried about how this will all look on my cv. My current job is okay, but I want to leave at some stage over the next year, as I want to do a working holiday visa abroad. My current job also has no real opportunity for progression, isn’t very well-paid and has a horrific commute. I’m worried I end up with a long list of jobs that will put a potential employer off. 

I know that being made redundant wasn’t really my fault, but I just feel like a moron for job hopping so much. I’ve no real idea what I want to do with my life and I’m nearly 25, so I’m starting to worry about how this will all look if I ever do finally settle on a career path.

1,2023-01-19,Best timing for Accepting a promotion vs. Quitting for pursuing a new carrer,u/biztomato,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10g3mzu/best_timing_for_accepting_a_promotion_vs_quitting/,jobs,"My supervisor is moving to a different country in two months. I got offered his job position, and while I am grateful for the opportunity, I have been (secretly) planning to change careers for a while now and with this new information it has been hard for me to decide what next step I should take.

&amp;#x200B;

A little backstory here, I was planning to start applying for new jobs in about 1 month from now. I will be changing from an administrative job to pursue a career in software development. Now it's a great time for me to change careers as I am finishing a certificate for software development and I have friends that could recommend me for a few job openings. Also, I feel that I've reached to a point where I have enough knowledge for pursuing a software dev job.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, with the news that my supervisor is leaving, I kind of feel bad for leaving the company too. They are planning to hire a new person for my current position and give my supervisor's position to me. While this is a boost in benefits + salary, the position is not even remotely related to the career plan I intend to follow.

&amp;#x200B;

My two options are either to stay in the new position and delay my search for a new job in my area or leave right away regardless. I actually enjoy my current job and the company has been great for me through all these years I've been there. While it is still a company, I know I would feel bad to leave them without a proper person in the position (it takes quite some time for me to learn my job, and my supervisor has been with the company for the longest time).

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to hear from the people who have gone through some similar situations and what they decided to do at the end. Whether you decided to stay in the company or move to your career path earlier, how was it for you after your decision? The more specific the better! Also, if you have not been through these situations, but would like to comment on what you'd think I should do, feel free to drop in a comment too! Any input is much appreciated!"

If you can comment on specific roles/positions or firms that would be appreciated. I'm particularly interested in ""buyside"" asset management roles in specific industries but really open to hearing about any finance related role. My research leads me to believe that IB and PE have the worse work-life balance but pay the most annually (maybe not per hour). I'm trying to find a finance related job that allows for family/personal time yet still provides a high compensation (maybe not as high IB &amp; PE but close to it). I would like to be finished with work by 6 or 7 pm. Thank you for taking the time to comment!"

3 Months ago, I was offered a new job paying 68k and just yesterday I was told that my salary was jumping up to 72k. (And it showed in my paycheck today).

I had to send an email on 13/01 because I had applied for a job with the same company in November last year, but when they sent me an invite to interview I was ill and did not see it until too late, so I emailed to explain this and that I was still very interested in working with the company. 

It doesn't say how long it will take to shortlist this role, but they did have Christmas/New Year's break from 23/12 to 03/01. I heard from a friend who works in the department that his boss was going through applications yesterday - but whether this was simply going over them or still shortlisting, I'm not sure. 

If I don't hear anything by Friday, would it be wise to send an email on Monday to just reiterate my interest?"

She can be uptight and make the workplace tense sometimes. I got a new job, and I'm kind of how she'll reply when I put in my two weeks notice. Should I write a letter and pass it to her, a long with "" I'm formally putting in my two weeks notice""? If so, should I do that at the beginning or the end of my shift? Should I send her an e-mail of my two weeks notice? (Which is what I'd honestly like to do)? I'd honestly leave if I didn't want to come back, see co-workers/ friends, or shop there myself. I don't want to quit right today, but it has to be before Wednesday. Any suggestion?

TL;DR- I need the best way to leave my current minimum wage job because I got a consistent gig with my degree. My current boss is tense, uptight, and gets agitated easily; so Idk how she'll reply."

He will be cool one minute and passive aggressive the next. 

Since I’ve been here, I’ve always thought that I was the only one who noticed his behavior and it seemed like I was always the victim of it. Until last weekend my coworker confided in me that she has been suffering from his ways too (she’s only been here 11 months).

He is sick (he misses a lot of days to see doctors) and old but he refuses to retire. 

She is very frustrated and is looking for something better because she can’t take it anymore. Whereas I want to leave too, but I just got promoted and I want to start grad school soon and I really don’t wanna have to apply for new jobs and school at the same time.

As a millennial I’ve heard that after 2 years you should find new jobs and I’ve been here almost 4. I’m tired of walking on eggshells around him and him always making faulty assumptions. I’ve been gaslighted by him for so long I really don’t know what to do anymore. I’m not passionate about this job anyway."
