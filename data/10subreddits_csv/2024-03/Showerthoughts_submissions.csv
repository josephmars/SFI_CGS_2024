1,2024-03-01,Differential Neuronal Resource Allocation Hypothesis,u/Professional_Crow564,https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/1b3pijy/differential_neuronal_resource_allocation/,Showerthoughts,"So there is an idea that's been simmering in my mind for a while now. It popped up a few years back but I didn't give it too much attention – it was like one of those numerous 'shower thoughts', and I soon forgot about it. But lately, it's been coming back to me for a few times, and I have decided it's time to jot it down and see what you all think.  
Differential Neuronal Resource Allocation Hypothesis  
It is a widely accepted fact that the brain is responsible for an array of functions, from the basic (like breathing and movement) to the advanced (like abstract thinking and creativity). Given its diverse responsibilities, how does the brain manage its resources? Specifically, does the size and physical composition of a person's body influence how their brain allocates its resources between managing bodily functions and facilitating higher cognitive processes?  
The core claim of this hypothesis is that individuals with larger, more muscular bodies require a proportionately greater number of their brain's neurons to manage and control their physicality. Consequently, this could leave fewer neurons available for cognitive functions compared to individuals with smaller bodies.  
Imagine two individuals who have the same exact number of neurons in their brains, the cells responsible for processing and transmitting information. One individual is much larger and more muscular than the other, who is smaller and less muscular. The hypothesis suggests that because the larger person has more body mass and muscle to control, a greater number of their neurons would be dedicated to managing their bodily functions. As a result, fewer neurons might be available for complex cognitive tasks such as thinking, learning, and problem-solving.  
To understand this, let's compare the brain to a company where neurons are the employees. In a large muscular individual, it's as if more employees are needed in the 'physical department' to manage the extensive muscle and body operations. This department takes care of everything from coordinating movements to maintaining posture and performing physically demanding tasks.  
Now, looking at the smaller individual, their 'physical department' doesn't need as many employees because there's less body mass to manage. This might mean that they have more employees free to work in the 'cognitive department.' This department is responsible for activities like planning, creating, and strategizing—what we might think of as higher-level thinking and intelligence tasks.  
The hypothesis is based on a presumed fixed total number of neurons (employees). If more neurons are busy with physical tasks (working in the physical department), fewer are available for cognitive processes (working in the cognitive department). So, in this scenario, the smaller individual could potentially have more neurons available for cognitive tasks, potentially resulting in higher cognitive functions."

As someone who complains a lot about every little discomfort, today I did some self-reflection and realized how I struggle with appreciating what I have and counting my blessings. 

I know how important it is to count your blessings, focus on the positives, and be grateful for the good things life is giving you. But it's tough sometimes, especially when you go through more stressful times than good times. 

It becomes a bit difficult to appreciate the little goodness of life, and easier to complain about the negatives. 

I've decided to change, but I just wanted to know if there's anyone else who struggles with counting their blessings sometimes. Is there? 

(P.S - I'm not looking for advice or criticism, or anything like that. This is just my thought, and I just want to hear from people who relate to this.)

But also The Hunter paradox is a few things.

There's what animals ie lions do, which is they select an animal from a herd, usually the most sick or youngest as they are easy catches. But sometimes they select incorrectly and get an animal that can outrun them. Yet they will likely continue chasing, an example of sunken cost. Something the animal may do inherently, because tiring an animal out is also a method of hunting. 

Humans got it worse, because we are exhaustive hunters. We just run forever to catch our prey. So selecting a prey that may be hard to catch, may not even matter, because the process of the chase may tire the animal enough to catch them.

This eventually becomes a heuristic, where chasing something and being persistent on it, regardless of if it's possible, will still be a technique, because at some point in the savannah this worked.

This leads to the sunken cost fallacy, where humans throw good money at bad, because the heuristic we've developed through evolution has had success of chasing a bad deal, because chasing a hard catch in the savannah still worked.

When I asked why, he said people were leaving blood on the bags and could become a health hazard. 

I've cracked open a knuckle or two doing this and it hurts immediately, before any blood is escaping the skin. So some incompetent (and frankly stupid) people were ignoring the radiating pain in their hands, continuing to hit the bag over and over again. 

So now, as someone competent, I'm punished by no longer being allowed to do bare knuckle accuracy drills at my gym.

The same thing can be said for speed limits, building permits, driver's licenses, concealed carry permits, and to a degree, taxes."

- AI is generating contents (also video, soon, with OpenAI's Sora) faster than humans and faster than it can be verified
- A lot of AI-generated content is inaccurate or wrong
- Internet lives on fresh content, better if accurate and true
- Internet will become soon completely unreliable for most of the informations that will contain, as AI contents will be always on the top of searches for a lot of motives
- Instagram will die as one of the first, because users surely will use AI to generate video faster and algorithmically optimized for money (it's already happening) until no contents on Instagram will be user-generated, true and so valuable to be seen.

I'm interested on knowing what is your opinion and how many other directions internet can take with the AI evolution and omni-presence.

OT: my vision is only one of the many, please don't be rude if you think differently, I really love talking about these arguments and I know that everything can go another way.

The notion of good vs evil is seen throughout all of life and the world. Why do I feel so entrapped by this concept? Is one truly not possible without the other? I know without up you cannot have down. There is no day without night. Sound breaks silence. An with life, comes death. These paradigms are ever present. Yet why do I feel so compelled to seek the light in life? Why do I have such disgust for the darkness of the world? Yet I know there is also darkness in myself… Can you truly not have one without the other? Will there ever be a day when we may all shine in the light of this life together? A day when no one suffers with the darkness that can consume a precious soul. We could all just be so happy… together.. right? But it’s not that simple no? Or could it be? Why am I constantly thinking about all of this? Why am I here and what am I doing? I don’t feel like I’m doing anything. I wish I could convey my thoughts and feelings to the world so we could share in this wish.. I want to change the world.. But.. I’m just me. How could I even possibly begin to do that? How could I get 7 billion people to truly know what I feel in my heart, and then somehow understand and then want to be a part of my dream? Or is this all me being selfish? Does what I think is truly right for the world hold any merit? Who’s to say that evil has to exist? I wish everyone could experience a life full of happiness. However you cannot know happiness without its antonym sadness right? Are these parallels what hold everything together? Would this all not be possible without these opposing forces? Is this duality essential? Am I just supposed to accept there will be hate, pain, and suffering if there is to be love, joy, and blissful happiness? For every answer I come up with, five more questions arise. Ones without answer. Or at least.. I don’t have the wisdom to answer them yet. However I feel I must keep searching for those answers. I must keep fighting for my dream. For maybe, it is our dream. "

Important: this theory uses the Multiversum. Here‘s a litle background: So let‘s say you die in a car crash but in that moment it creates another universe where you didnt die. Now imagine this FOR ALL scenarios! If an atom moves, an electron changes, you say a word wrong, you breath in a different patterb for a second. If ANYTHING in the whole wide universe happens, it creates a new universe where it is not like that. Now you think that possible amount of universes is HUGE and infinity, but exactly this is what I call my number of infinity. All possible universes that can exist.

Please tell me if there‘s already a theory like that and yes I hate maths. (Btw i dont know in what community I should really post this)"

I'm quite skilled in my sport which requires highly specialized equipment. At a certain level, equipment that is subpar will absolutely feel awful and hinder your ability. If you're aware of WHY the equipment isn't working it is not likely due to your lack of skill. And many times, you'll still be able to perform somewhat with subpar equipment but just with less ease, not to as high of a level, and they'll have every right to complain about it.

A bad workman does not have the skill to perform well whatsoever on subpar equipment. They would not be able to name what is wrong with it. A skilled person would be more likely to be able to make do. 

The same theory applies to all other hobbies and activities. If youre a professional artist and your pencil is dull of course you cannot draw in extreme detail. You can still draw well. If you're a racecar driver in a Toyota vitz, you can safely admit you are not as fast as you are in a Ferrari. "

The fall seemed to adhere perfectly to the laws of gravity and momentum as I envisioned it. This prompts the question: does our brain possess its own grasp of physics or perhaps even its own internal physics engine?

If we were able to capture this simulation and compare it with real-world physics, would it align flawlessly, or would there be miscalculated?

So can someone explain to me when this shift occurred? Our parents and grandparents didn't have a choice, you had to work. I'm all for a balanced work/home life and I'm all for a 4 day work week...but if you're at work, you're at work, sleeping is for when you're at home. Why not get a job somewhere else? It just feels like a domino effect where if 1 person sleeps or slacks, then that causes the next person/step/process to fall behind, and the so forth and so on...but yet people are trying to find ways to not work during the time they get paid.

 I get satisfaction from what I do, I feel good about the work I put in and at the end of the day, I'm fulfilled. I can't imagine sleeping on the job, or even the shit jobs I had growing up making $7.25 trying to be an adult in my first shitty apartment. If I had slacked that much, I would've been fired and then been in a worse position, so what's gives with Gen Z?

Presenters who use their platform primarily to sell products or services can be off-putting. We already encounter enough advertisements on platforms like YouTube; we don't need more during conference presentations."
