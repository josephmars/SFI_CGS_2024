So today I've been thinking about if any company can genuinely stack up against Apple in the mobile space. Recently stumbled upon the Nothing phone, and it's kind of refreshing to see new players in the field. Plus, gadgets like Rabbit and Humane AI pin are popping up, making me think that there is interest in more simplified but powerful AI devices. But a lot of the negative discussion that I‚Äôve seen surrounding these devices is about how phone apps could easily replicate these features. Given Apple's resources, I'm surprised Siri hasn't become the ultimate AI assistant by now.

  
I've been in the Apple ecosystem my whole life‚ÄîiPhone, Mac Mini, MacBook Pro, iPad, AirPods, and Apple Watch. It's the seamless integration between my tech that's kept me loyal. So I‚Äôm curious, do you think that there is room for a new player in the mobile space? And if so, what kind of features would pose a real challenge to Apple?

  
Personally, I‚Äôm drawn to the simplicity of gadgets like Rabbit and the HumaneAI pin but I agree with the people who say that these devices don't do anything an iphone couldn't do better with the right app. I love all of the new AI applications that are being created but sometimes the features seem gimmicky. I can also get overwhelmed trying to figure out what are the best tools/apps to use for a certain task so I would potentially be interested in a phone that streamlines these applications directly into its interface, offering a user-friendly way to access the best of AI without the clutter."
