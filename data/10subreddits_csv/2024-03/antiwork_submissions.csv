So I am a state employee at a college, who is under a job probation of 12 months. Recently, I had my 7 month review which indicated very poor performance. The reason for poor performance was due to alleged sick time abuse. 

The problem is, I have been in 5 motorcycle accidents and used all but 3 for medical reasons. 2 times were used as make up hours (against the rules but approved by my supervisor) and one was a leave without pay because I got stuck at the dmv unfortunately trying to register my truck, this was considered LWOP (leave without pay)

Their alleging 10 sick time abuses (basically using sick time for personal reasoning) and HR wants documentation. OK, not a problem. I provided my Dr notes for all the dates applicable, but was told that those are not valid. It was requested that I give receipts and billing information to ""prove without a doubt I attended medical appointment X on day X"" 

So I complied and Gave my medical billing statements along with the appointment dates, historical list for each Dr (showing treatment for the past 3 months) the doctor notes saying that they did treat me on day X. 

I just revived a email today saying that they need similar information for all other past doctor appointments. But they never said which days in specific, and I'm absolutely lost as to what else they want. I've given them literally everything in regards to my medical history, billing and Dr notes. One day in particular, my wife miscarried and I had to accompany her to the hospital. I gave hr and my department head the hospital notes for this event. But they said that I ""could still come to work"" and it's considered an unexcused absence. 

The talk of separating me from employment is more and more spoken of, and now rumors are running around my department that I've now been made aware of. I'm fucking terrified man. I can't lose my job because of Financials at the moment. I DO have job applications out and apply for 3/4 jobs every day since the first meeting with hr. Like, I  use the food bank once a week just to have food to eat. An now I'm being told that my leaves are sick time abuse. Nobody notified me before my 7 month review, and I was constantly told I'm doing a good job. I have never been written up for any offense, and have never been in trouble outside of this one event. 

I don't want to lose my house or fall back into crippling debt. I'm lost and honestly terrified of what's coming next. I guess my post on anti work is to search for guidance? Rant? Seek help? I don't even know man. This is such a jacked up situation and I feel like I'm being pushed into a corner even more :/

29,2024-02-29,"Company actively kept trying to poach me from a competitor, hired me & 4 months later let me go after ""360 evaluation""",u/miroa12004,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b3hhp1/company_actively_kept_trying_to_poach_me_from_a/,antiwork,"Backstory:

I worked in an MSP in the New England area. Was really a star at my team. This company kept trying to hire me over the summer, persistently so, they finally offered me $40k over what I was making. I told my employer at the time if they matched it, I would stay but they said it was hard to do so.

Anyway, I move on with the blessing of the old company's manager. Got hired and there's nothing to do. They put me to shadow people the first week of the job then nothing, covered some people over the Christmas period and got some escalations where I solved all tickets and pretty much all clients to a T, sent a thank you email afterwards. Since the start of the new year, there was basically no work. I texted my manager (who never did any 1 on 1s since my hire) if there was anything I can work on or any improvement and always got that I was doing fine and that work will come soon.

Well, today I found the dreaded sudden 1 on 1 meeting in my calendar, and obviously showed up and HR are there and you know the rest. They did a 360 review and the feedback they got was bad. I asked what kind of feedback they got since I started on October 1st and all the client visits I did on my own was two and I closed escalations where I got them with no problems. The snake of a manager have nothing to say and just says HR will continue with me. Evidently HR lady got to admit that it was a position being eliminated and it was because my billable hours being low, which I raised with my manager before and was told to wait as there's more to come. They are giving me two weeks of pay, which in this economy covers nothing and my PTO of 40 hours. 

TLDR: company aggressively tries to recruit you from a competitor, hires you to do nothing despite you asking for projects and work then your position is eliminated. Welcome to corporate America. "

I was looking at SharePoint for our team group - which is about 20 of us. I was looking for the schedule and I noticed there were two tabs on the bottom left, one which said “salaries”.

Of course I looked, and came upon all of our hire dates and salaries, as well as purposed pay raises each year.


I have been at my company for 7 years. A couple of people that got hired 1-2 years ago, with 1-2 years of experience, are getting paid significantly more or the same as me. I feel so undervalued and unappreciated.

I can’t hold it in. I am a stellar employee with surveys in my profession that come back remarkable.

I feel I am underpaid and taken advantage of. I texted my manager to ask if our salaries were supposed to be publicly shared, and that I am a bit upset. I’m not going to cause any scene or share this with anyone - now - but I wanted them to scramble of guessing what I will do with this information.


Any advice? I’m feeling I should start looking for another job. I won’t share this unless I leave, and then they can deal with the aftermath of their very huge fuck up of it being public and all of my colleagues knowing what they think my company thinks they are worth."

Dirty and sweaty  
With just enough to get by  
Calluses on his hands, calluses on his soul  
Hard-boiled son of a bitch  
Scraping away on the downhill grind  


\[Verse 2\]  
[It's a means to an end, a mean end for most](https://genius.com/22681836/Lamb-of-god-boot-scraper/Its-a-means-to-an-end-a-mean-end-for-most)

Turn and bite  


Turn and bite the hand that bleeds you dry  
Throw yourself a bone, no one else will  
Compromise leads to self-loathing  
Money, the excrement of labor  


\[Bridge\]  
And you don't get to keep shit  
Except politics and power trips  
And a bad breath down your neck

Toiled in the halls of the mighty  
And not received  
A teardrop in...

A bucket, motherfuck it

But you do (Motherfucker)  
The world doesn't owe me a thing  
But you do (Motherfucker)

*So crooked when you die*  
*They're gonna have to screw your ass into the ground*  


\[Verse 3\]  
As life slowly unravels  
With nothing to show but wasted time and dust  
A thousand points of lies falling  
On the deafened funeral eardrums of the blind masses  


\[Guitar Solo\]  


\[Verse 4\]  
Rise above, extract your life  
Will you look within  
Then turn around and bite?  
Day by day, the mask suffocates your life  
Is this any way to live?  
No, no, no fucking way"

I know she has a couple of kids at home so I thought she was just tired.

I tossed a joke out about a hard work week and asked if she was tired.

Dez ""got a text from my mom that my best friend since I was 10 hung himself today.""

Me ""Jesus.  You shouldn't be here.  You should be at home with friends and family.""

Dez ""my manager won't let me leave.""

They were overstaffed on a slow night.

From the politicians who made it so that jobs would go overseas, to the shareholders and corporations (who will often call themselves patriots) who shuttered the factories in America to open elsewhere with lax safety standards so they could make higher profits while blue collar workers suffered, to the billionaire foreign investors who come back to reopen factories while paying slave wages and expecting American workers to work in unsafe conditions, to the Judas Americans who lick those billionaire boots and suppress unionization efforts.

The politicians and corporations have squandered the quality of life and workers rights that were won with literal blood and it's a goddamn shame that we Americans let our slight differences divide us so that we could be conquered. The greedy people at the top won't be satisfied until we're putting nets around buildings (to catch people commiting suicide) like at Foxconn in Shenzhen.

Vote for workers rights, hold politicians accountable, think critically, and tell the robber barons of all ilks that you are a human and you don't exist simply to funnel money up to the top while only making enough to survive and come back to work.

I’ve been working at a startup for about 2.5 years now. Late last year, I hit a point of stress and burnout where I became physically sick and developed an autoimmune disorder which I completely blame on my job. Most of my stress came from feeling unsupported in my work ; I am one of a few employees that have a software focused skillset and therefore I work on automating processes, creating specific software tools that make other people’s jobs a lot easier and writing code that generates reports that would otherwise take days if not weeks to organize. I did a pretty kick ass job for someone with little to no guidance and fresh out of college. I brought up this idea to create a software focused team to our director of engineering but she said she didn’t think I’d make a good team lead and that it didn’t seem like a reasonable goal for the company for at least another 5-10 years. Well she ended up taking my idea straight to our COO with no mention of me and he loved the idea so much that they decided to implement it right away. I now have a new manager that micromanages the shit out of me and asks me to do managerial tasks such as coming up with software projects for team members, creating project roadmaps, and writing value proposition all while being paid what is considered an entry level salary. Aside from a company wide salary inflation adjustment that was given over a year ago, I have not received a raise since I was hired. Our business development team constantly makes snarky remarks such as “hopefully none of you are living paycheck to paycheck” when that is certainly the case for many of our employees. I’ve been looking for other jobs for a while now and I just can’t wait to quit.

Basically, not wanting to give up the money. I guess that's just business. Anyway, on Tuesday, regular manager was sick, so the manager that took over for the day gave out VTO or to stay the entire four hours. Some took the four hours (like me) and others VTO'd. After two hours, the manager told us to clock out and said ""Whoever needed the four hours will get the full hours and the rest will not"". Fast forward to today and an employee said that the regular manager was mad the other manager even told us to leave and we were supposed to stay all four hours. At end of day, I talked to the manager that I haven't been credited the four hours that I was supposed to and asked the manager about it. He didn't give an answer other than ""I have to talk to the manager that allowed this to happen and you guys had to work for four hours"". I already texted my temp agency about this and will see what happens tomorrow. 

Surely I'll be credited the four hours, right?"

The was for an on-site system admins job.

People in the room were 3 boomers in vp and director positions and 1 middle age HR rep.

Very first question I asked was why this was fully on-site with no remote possibility. The answer I received was 'we found it much easier and friendlier to see each other in person to interact. It's a better way to build relationships and collaborate with one another' my response, 'I've been remote since covid and I've managed to build great relationships and collaborate with others, are you saying that it's wrong or not possible?' The reply 'well, you may have your preference, but we like being in person and find it more productive, especially with being able to walk in with an issue and not wait for it to be resolved, so this position is in person'.

2nd question, how many people are part of the IT team? There's a total of 5 people, you'd all be sitting in the room together to be able to monitor each other and provide input to each other.

3rd... do you have any projects in the works for the position? They said they have a 5 year plan, I asked to elaborate, they mentioned moving from their old equipment to cloud prem. I asked why is it so old, why did they not upgrade or make the move sooner. The boomer IT director said because he didn't believe cloud would take off and why change hardware if it wasn't broken?

4th, they slipped the position has been opened for a few months. I asked why has it been opened for so long? They reply because everyone wants a remote job. We'd rather have someone who's under qualified that's willing to be on-site and fits our culture.

5th, in the description it mentioned work life balance, can you elaborate? They said 'well, we don't expect people to come in early or leave late, we expect 40 hours, 8 to 5 Monday through Friday.' I asked how is this work life balance, this is a normal schedule. They said 'well we give you your weekends, but you'll need to have a phone for any on call issues'

6th, do you have a salary range? They all looked at each other and the HR guy said well, it might be 100k, maybe a bit less, it's all based on experience. Vp of HR says he can't remember but it might be 90k. A brief moment of silence... IT director says well we can change the pay, we can be flexible.

Last thing was they mentioned the next steps. I'd have to be in person to interview with them again, then a 3rd interview with about 10 random people and take a technical and behavioral test.

Guys, I was baffled, I almost withdrew my application, but I decided to wait for a response on Monday, whether or not they want to move forward (I doubt they will because I challenged everything they said) or they reject me, I'm going to tell them I was withdrawing my application regardless and did not like the way they are as management and the way they are stuck in older times.

Save yourself from old generation boomers and them stuck in their ways."

9,2024-03-01,Restructuring the US Tax System - Thought Exercise,u/whoisaname,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b3mjuy/restructuring_the_us_tax_system_thought_exercise/,antiwork,"Not looking to get into arguments, more of a thought provoking discussion.  

Right now, the majority of US revenue comes from personal income taxes (it hovers a little over 50% on average) generating around $2.6 Trillion in tax revenue.

Corporate taxes are around 6% of US revenue generating about $0.45 Trillion.  However, that amount is generated from about a 9% effective tax rate, which is the lowest it has been in a long long time, when the statutory rate is currently 21%.  

Proposal: Eliminate all personal income tax, except for taxes on personal income over $1 million (top 1% of income earners). Capital gains taxes would still be taxed at their current rates (about 15% of personal income taxes).  Income over $1 million would be taxed at the corporate rate, which would now be a minimum effective rate of 30% (this would be like the current AMT where if some sort of provision caused the effective tax rate to fall below 30%, it is still 30%). All other taxes (FICA, excise, etc.) remain the same. 

This would actually generate more revenue for the government as, based on current numbers, a wash would be an effective corporate rate of about 21%.  

Pros of this?

Cons?

How would the economy fare?  

Could this be sold politically to the majority of the US since it eliminates personal income tax for almost everyone?

Would you tweak this in any way? If so, what?

Something to consider, this would give most people in the US a collective spending power of $2.2 Trillion more annually potentially going back into the economy, and with that impact on jobs and sales taxes to local/state governments, etc.  "
89,2024-03-01,Union Organizing Should Be Taught In High School,u/OneOnOne6211,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b3ml1c/union_organizing_should_be_taught_in_high_school/,antiwork,"Why do we go to school? To pick up skills that will help us in life and make us informed and responsible citizens? No! Of course not. We go to school because we are being forged into the right cogs to be shoved into the big profit machine that's going to make billionaires into trillionaires.

School these days is basically there to make us good tools for corporations to use.

But you know what I think? This is a crazy idea, I know. But I actually think the school system should serve the 99% of people rather than the top 1%. And to that end I have a wonderful compromise.

Let's keep school as the job training academy it is. But let's add in some stuff that's useful for employees to know.

Every student, because nearly every student will be an employee some day, should be taught about the current laws surrounding unionization where they live. They should be taught about the history of unions bringing wage increases, shorter work weeks, etc. as well as familiarized with the statistics which show stuff like that wages in right-to-work states are generally lower than non right-to-work states. And then they should be taught the practical side of how to organize a union wherever they are if it doesn't have one.

Do this and I practically guarantee rising wages, better working hours and even a better democracy. Because unions mean the average person can apply labour power. Which means they can organize strikes or even a general strike. Which is basically a very direct way to make demands of our politicians.

Our politicians may be able to ignore us protesting peacefull with signs in our hands. But most of these corporate funded goons will shit themselves if we start holding back their corporate donors from making a profit.

So, basically, I think reforms in school should be an important priority. And they should start with teaching about the value of unions and how exactly to go about organizing one."

Through the firm, I've been working on a project for a healthcare company for a year now. The deadline for this project is 3/31. At the end of January the health care company asked for a major feature they had not originally asked for to be completed asap. At the time, my team lead was out on PTO, so I was asked by the CEO of my firm to create a brief work plan and estimation on when myself and my team member could have it completed. He used the verbage ""we are under the gun"", so I made the estimation as conservative as I could and said we could have it done by the end of February. Long story short and many technical difficulties later, we are now about 6 weeks behind. During the last 6 weeks I have worked 10-15 hours a week of unpaid overtime to try and make as many deadlines as I could. I have also had to correct much of my coworkers' code to ensure we passed tests. I received an angry letter from my ceo today asking why we are 6 weeks behind and why that has not been communicated. He said that I will now have to come into the office every day (I was hired remote) and that I will be micro managed until the project is done and that the deadline is now two weeks sooner. During all of the time I have worked on this project I have been transparent with my team leads about the pace of our project. By the wording in the email it seems my team leads have not relayed any of the information to the CEO and now it has all fallen on me. I am honestly so miserable at this moment and I would rather save face and quit. I would love y'all's advice. Thanks. "

Manager took my tips to cover a customer shorting me,u/dickswthchicks,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b3nv7h/delivery_driver_in_ca_manager_took_my_tips_to/,antiwork,"Before anyone asks I have been looking for a new job. I deliver pizzas. I get tips in both cash and from people adding it to their total on debit card. End of night all my receipts and cash were given to a front worker to count. 

My tips on card are written on the receipt. I did around ten deliveries during my shift. About half were card and half were cash. 

I walk up to the door, read the receipt to see if I need cash or coupons, count the money, and leave. I will admit I have made a counting error on at least one occasion I recall (in my four years of working at this location). During this shift I received several cash tips as well as receiving at least $10 in tips from card that I read on the receipts. I have been struggling financially and was excited to take home my tips at the end of the day.

At the end of my shift, my tips and receipts were left on a counter for several minutes until someone was available to count it. 

I was then told I was $10 short and sent to look in the delivery car in case I dropped it while it was recounted. I didn’t find anything. I come back in and am told I am still short $10. The manager on site tells me that because it’s just under $10 I won’t get written up.

I have never been short before. I was unsure how to respond or what to do. I regret not asking to count everything myself. 

But I was given $0 at the end of the night. I was clocking out within 5 minutes of this exchange and while doing so am told by a manager that they took money that was waiting for me in the office so I was only short $6. I didn’t say anything because I was pretty defeated by the shift. Now that I have had time to think I have several observations and questions-

1- My money was left unattended for several minutes and handled between two people without my supervision. I have no way of knowing whoever counted it didn’t steal from me.

2- There is no way to distinguish what cash is tips and what is payment. They get a cash total to count out and whatever is leftover is given to me. Then they take out what I was tipped on card in cash and give it to me.

3- This means that the total cash I received as payment PLUS cash tips PLUS card tips came out to $10 short of the total cash I should have received for payment. 

4- This also means that while I cannot confirm how much I made in cash tips, they covered the shorted cost in the tips I should have made from card. I know this because I know I received tips on card but took home nothing.

5- They also took $4 of tips for me that were in the office (we collect loose change from tips in cups in the office they swap for bills later sometimes) They did this without asking me and despite the fact that I was told I would already not get in trouble for being short less than $10. They took $4 from me to bring the total to $6 at no benefit to me.

I am under the impression that labor law prohibits managers from taking tips to make up for shorted totals (My manager made a point to mention that asking me to cover the difference would be illegal). They treated it as if they were doing me a favor taking my tips instead of writing me up. But I am considering going back tomorrow and asking if they can pull up how much I was supposed to be tipped and just take the write up. Even if it was my fault and I didn’t notice I was underpaid or thought a cash delivery was card and didn’t ask for payment I don’t feel like I should be punished in this way. I am missing at least $15 from them taking my tips and I feel as though that’s not worth not being written up. I am pretty upset about the whole thing and would like advice on how to go forward."

It's scary as Hell, and I'm in an insanely privileged position to be able to do this. And I didn't want to do it, really, but it was the healthiest thing I could have done for myself. I was deep in that burnout depression, and it was making me physically sick to continue in that job. And every time I think about it, it makes me angry how avoidable it all was. 

The biggest thing was that I couldn't get an honest and consistent answer out of management. At one point, I had a conversation with a trusted coworker who had been there much longer. He told me that it was very possible that the middle managers themselves had been given inconsistent answers. I swear I felt my brain break. Ok, that's a problem in and of itself, but as a middle manager, isn't it your job to demand consistency from your own managers? If I can't trust you, that's already the beginning of the end, because I know you're going to screw me over, it's just a matter of when. 

The second thing was the lack of desire from senior management to do anything about the obvious problems. I once made a suggestion and was told that it was a pretty good idea, but nobody would actually do it, and senior management wouldn't force it. This was probably the thing I was most depressed about. I felt like I was powerless. And the longer I stayed, the more I realized that I would constantly be burning myself out to replace what senior management could, but did not want, to do. 

There were a lot of things that I didn't like about my job, but I figured that no job is perfect, you find the least objectionable one and do that. But the bad management took it from fine to intolerable. And that makes me angry.

Not sure if this is the right place to post or not but would really like a bit of advice.

Had a conversation with my boss yesterday that really left me feeling uneasy and I don't quite know what to do.

I've been working for a software company within the UK for just over 4 months now. 
There's been a lot of delay in getting my HR forms/payroll sorted, which I wasn't a fan of anyway, as I'd never been in a job where these details were being taken so late after my initial start.

I was asked to submit an emergency contacts form and on the form, it asked for a brief medical history, any diagnoses etc.
I filled this out in complete honesty, disclosing I have been diagnosed with PTSD, which is something I already disclosed with them in my second stage interview.

He called me on Teams and said, ""I've looked at your form and I'm surprised, you don't come across like someone with PTSD, are you sure you were rightly diagnosed?""
I was taken aback and made it clear that I had already informed them of this before they chose to employ me and yes, I'm very sure.
""Well, the thing is, we can't really be seen as hiring someone as customer facing who has ""active depression or anything like that"" - We have to look at is from a business perspective and if you had an active mental health issue, we'd have to make accommodations... It's just a lot. I've also seen you with customers, you have a great personality, so I'm sure you don't actually have this PTSD""
He then proceeded to ask me to ""retract what you've wrote about having this condition""
I refused to, explained that I see no reason to lie or hide part of who I am and that I believe in honesty and ultimately, if something were to happen where it becomes a relevant factor, would I not have to deal with worse if they thought I'd hidden it from them?
He suddenly changed his tone, said how of course I shouldn't be ashamed and he was just, ""wanting to know best ways to support his employees because we really care"", and asked me to instead edit the form and include when I was diagnosed, so ""it's pretty clear this is an issue that probably still isn't affecting you.""

The conversation basically ended with him reiterating multiple times that they care about employees but also that he was sure, ""my doctor labeled me wrong"" *Laughs in dickhead* 

It made me super uncomfortable and I've never once been approached like this nor have I felt the need to hide or pretend I don't have PTSD? 
I guess I don't know if I'm blowing it out of proportion but it really gave me a bad feeling, I felt quite judged and certainly that I was working with people who didn't have the slightest clue about mental health.
I found it beyond insulting that he implied (outright said?) that those with mental health should either not be working customer facing or that they wouldn't be capable of doing so."
123,2024-03-01,It’s insane that people assume competence and intelligence of business owners.,u/ThatOneDude44444,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b3ofrp/its_insane_that_people_assume_competence_and/,antiwork,"Howdy, y’all.

I so often see people automatically side with a business owner *just because they own the place.*
Countless times I’ve seen people argue, “well he owns the place and is the boss, so clearly he knows better” or other such argument that assumes superiority of a capitalist.

And that makes no sense.

Starting and owning a business isn’t impressive. You don’t need to be exceptionally talented or intelligent.
You don’t need to be exceptionally *anything.*

In fact, you can be a total idiot and open or purchase a business.

Think about the owners of the places you’ve worked at. How many were actually good at what they did?

For example, the owner of my work/the boss I have now is hands down the most incompetent person in the office.
Every time I work on a project with him, he screws shit up and I have to fix it. Every single new hire he’s trained, I’ve had to re-train.
Every client that gets forgotten, disappointed or misinformed by him, I’m the person who has to answer the angry phone call and then make everything right.

Before college and starting my career and all that, I worked in restaurants. Almost all of those restaurant owners were dumb dicks that couldn’t even flip a burger or make pasta sauce.

There’s also the issue of how they answer to no one, and if you ever bring up the problems they cause they can just pull the “well I’m the boss” card.

Help me Break Free from Excel Hell: Bitcoin Needed ASAP

It's your pal **the lazy dude** here, coming at you with a request that's as wild as a rodeo bull on a caffeine high! 🐂 So, picture this: I used to be the number-crunching, spreadsheet-wizard extraordinaire, slaving away in the world of accounting for a solid decade. And guess what? Despite all those years of crunching numbers, I'm still as broke as a joke at a comedy club.

And I've got a wild request So, here's the deal: I'm on a mission to break free from the chains of corporate slavery and embrace the finer things in life, like napping whenever I feel like it, chasing sunsets without a care in the world, ooow and having beer as a breakfast because I love beer so much and im not going to that fucking office, and watch movies as soon as its released im tired of waiting these pirated movies it takes forever. But to make that dream a reality, I need your help.

I'm not a fan of the whole ""working for money"" thing. In fact, I'd rather wrestle a grizzly bear than spend another day chained to a desk. So, I'm putting it out into the universe: I need **1 Bitcoin** to kickstart my adventure into the land of eternal freedom and fun.

Now, I get it, not everyone's swimming in pools of cash. But fear not! If you're broke like a joke (been there, done that), you can still lend a hand by hitting that share button faster than a cheetah chasing its next meal. Spread the word far and wide, and who knows? Maybe the universe will conspire to send some Bitcoin my way.

And here's the kicker: 1 Bitcoin equals a whopping $62,503.14 USD, or in my world, a mind-blowing 7,375,370.52 Ethiopian Birr! That's enough to buy a house, a car, and still have a boatload of cash left over for snacks and shenanigans.

So, if you're feeling generous, have a heart of gold, or just want to see what happens when a dreamer gets a little crazy, slide into my DMs and let's make some magic happen together! And also I promise to upload my new crib and car after I get your hard earned money

Both of the classes I work with are 6 hours a day, August-May. In June/July, my students and teachers are gone, but I still have to work. I know I have enrollment stuff to do, but I could easily have a month off in the summer (maybe even more) and I would gladly take it unpaid (I’m lucky my husband makes more money than me). 
Apparently they used to have party year social workers for my position in the past, but they quit doing it. I don’t know why. I have gone as far as to make “jokes” to our director about how much money the agency would save if they gave me summers off. They just laugh like “oh, you silly jokester.” 
I’m also just going to be very lonely in the summer bc the best part of my day is interacting with the teachers and the students. 
Anyway, my best friend is a very type A workaholic type working towards her doctorate right now. And she just doesn’t get  my feelings in the situation. She said “work is good for you” which lowkey triggered me thinking about all the times I was treated like a lazy person in my life (in my opinion because of my difficulties with ADHD). "
9,2024-03-01,The Craven - Edward Allen Poverty,u/Regalzack,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b3wmon/the_craven_edward_allen_poverty/,antiwork,"Once upon a midnight dreary, as I wallowed, weak and bleary, Over countless bills and letters, reminders of my financial gore— While I nodded, nearly sleeping, suddenly there came a peeping, As of someone gently creeping, creeping at my chamber door. ""'Tis a creditor,"" I snarled, ""come to haunt me, nothing more— Just another debt, another chore.""

Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the dreary December, Each unpaid bill a cruel ember, burning holes into my floor. Desperately I hoped tomorrow; vainly I tried to borrow, From a bank, or even sorrow, some respite from this financial war— From the mounting debts and loans, promises of riches and more— But they're gone, forevermore.

And the sad and solemn rustling of the bills, each one disgusting, Thrilled me, filled me with despair I'd never felt before; So that now, to quell my panic, I stood, my mind in a manic, ""'Tis a bill collector, frantic, demanding payment at my door— Some heartless wretch, demanding payment at my chamber door— This, and nothing more.""

Deep into my debts I'm staring, my sanity slowly tearing, Doubting, cursing, despairing of ever being rich once more; But the silence offers no solace, only bills to leave my soulless, And the only word I hiss is a bitter ""Nevermore!"" Echoed back, ""Nevermore!""—a cruel reminder of my financial sore— Just debts and nothing more.

Back into the darkness turning, my heart within me burning, Soon again I hear a yearning, louder than it was before. ""Surely,"" I mutter, ""surely this is just another creditor, early— Here to hound me, berate me, and leave my pockets sore— 'Tis just my debts, and hunger knocking at my door— Nothing less, and nothing more, for poverty's grip is evermore.""

22,2024-03-01,IVE HAD ENOUGH,u/GhostxKitten,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b3wqwr/ive_had_enough/,antiwork,"Ok so. I work as a veterinary technician at a corporate owned pet hospital which is a joke because they also own a candy company. 

For the past year we have been short staffed and overworked. Ive been pushed past my limit a while ago, probably since my 4th month there. Its a great place for learning and the only reason Im still there is I don't drive so I don't have other options. Its either deal with this bullshit or go back to retail. 

So, our practice manager is on maternity leave as well as another employee. We don't have a regular doctor because both of them quit, including one who has worked there for 10 years. So we're really just floating on relief doctors that come in. WE ARE DROWNING and they still think its ok to schedule the required amount of pets to meet their quota. Plus after working a 12 hour shift of doing exhausting and mentally/emotionally draining patient care, we're still somehow expected to clean the entire hospital because we don't have a kennel assistant. Many times we have to work two positions because we're short staffed. Like, if there's no front desk person scheduled until later, the techs in the back have to check in patients as well as do their regular job. 

But here's what's really pushing me further.   
The scheduling. Schedules are put up a month or two in advance, so I figure, ok I'll schedule my appointments and plans on the days Im scheduled off. NOPE, because they'll put me on a day I was scheduled off last minute, WITHOUT TELLING ME. When I talked to the shift leader about it she said ""well you can put in a request that you're unavailable for that day"" Im already scheduled off that day, I shouldn't need to put in a request. So I was like ""Ok, could I put in a request that Im unavailable for each day that Im already scheduled off to avoid being put on the days I have off?"" She said no, that the unavailability thing is only for when you're unavailable. But, they're my scheduled days off that were made 2 MONTHS ago. Also when I told her I would like to be asked or notified that my schedule changed, she asked ""do you check your work email?"" NO, I am not checking my work email if I am not on the clock. 

I have a few appointments scheduled for each tuesday this week because that's the only time I have a ride. The practice manager who is taking over for our manager while she's on maternity leave scheduled me for the 5th. I told her I have an appointment that day and she said she'll take me off but requesting unavailability doesn't guarantee that day off. But Im already scheduled that day off... A MONTH AGO. Today I noticed she put me on for the 12th. I have an appointment to get my permit. I messaged her with my frustration and told her I don't know how much more I can put up with. I told her I'll reschedule that appointment but I can't have my schedule constantly changing. I respect the company's time by coming in when Im supposed to, staying until Im supposed to - actually WAY later because we never get out on time. Sometimes we get out 2 hours late. So why can't my time be respected? I am flexible and can work whenever, but if Im scheduled off, that's my time off. 

There's so much more I want to complain about but honestly Im getting so mad thinking about this. I just want to play video games and forget I even have this job until I have to go back in 2 days.

Yes, you.",u/flavius_lacivious,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b3y6dj/have_you_heard_whats_happening_on_tiktok_how_you/,antiwork,"TikTok users are organizing a massive quarterly consumer boycott targeting rapacious corporations. These videos are going viral on the platform.

**Since few of us have the time or money to organize a labor strike, workers are being encouraged to strike with their spending.**

This is a small act of protest you can participate in with very little effort on your part. No letter writing. No showing up to a protest to get your face in some government database. No losing your job.

There is no risk of backlash against you because your protest is anonymous. 

All you have to do is not buy their products for a minimum of 90 days to destroy their earnings and hurt their stock prices. You get immediate feedback of your efforts and the joy of watching the leadership scramble to try and fix it while whining publicly for consumers to stop.

TikTok is an influential Chinese-owned platform (which pusses off western governments) and the posts won’t be pulled and the message sandboxed. Regardless of how you feel about the social media platform, it is the only big site that will allow such activities. 

(I fully expect this message to be pulled by Reddit because it hurts their advertisers. TikTok doesn’t give a shit.)

Each quarter, a few companies are selected for us to stop buying their products. The boycott lasts at least 90 days to destroy their next quarterly earnings. 

Recent boycotts have been highly successful against Starbucks and McDonalds, proving that you can protest with your dollars. 

April 1 starts with Kellogg’s and Wendy’s. Find alternatives or take this opportunity to move away from eating highly processed foods. Familiarize yourself with their products and simply buy less or none at all. 

Let the games begin. The odds are in our favor."

Now the company has it where it sounds like it will be manager-led meetings meaning I sit there and give feedback in their format to the employee and it seems the aim is to ensure the report is aligning with company goals. Don't get me wrong, I give feedback currently but it's not every week but more monthly or if the feedback is crucial (e.g. I notice something noteworthy whether positive or negative).

I'm conflicted because I always EOY reviews are trivial as a report should know where they stand already through manager feedback feedback. But to structure the meeting around my feedback conflicts with my philosophy that it's the reports time to explore topics they want.

There's a form I need to fill out every week now to keep track. I am averse to formalities but the whole thing feels like an uncomfortable itchy sweater instead of a comfortable familiar fleece sweatshirt."

So I walked out.",u/SatanicKitten69420,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b40fot/2bn_revenue_company_with_a_ceo_worth_61m_treats/,antiwork,"This happened today. And this is long, so bear with me. 

I had been working at this company since September as a data entry clerk for the real estate appraisal division. When I was hired on I was excited because the job seemed to be everything that I wanted. A sit-down office job, relaxed environment, flexible hours, PTO, insurance, etc. And the only reason I stayed so long was because it was easy and it worked for me, because I am autistic and also have fibromyalgia, which makes it hard for me to do things that involve a lot of standing or lifting. 

My first day of work I was told that an HR rep would be calling me to help me out. She did, but she was new and temporary and didn't do anything to help me. I had to figure out how to access all of my HR info, direct deposits, benefits, employee handbook, etc on my own. 

I came into this job in the middle of a project, and since I was new and didn't have any training, they put me to work stapling permits together. I did this for 5 months, dude. 5 months of stapling fucking papers. 

Don't get me wrong, it was easy. But there was so much other bullshit that I finally had enough. 

It started with problems with a coworker who was hired after me. He's extremely eager to the point of annoyance, a brown-nosing tryhard who micromanages and analyzes everything despite it not being his job. He was constantly breathing down my neck despite being on the same level as me. It frustrated me, but I let it go as best as I could. 

Around christmas, my boss took a month-long vacation using all her saved up PTO. She was gone from like DEC 2nd to Jan 9th. During that time we had performance evaluations where we were supposed to evaluate ourselves and then she would evaluate us. I asked about it because I felt I hadn't been there long enough to fill it out properly, and was told to ""do my best."" 

After christmas I ended up having to go on a leave of absence due to health issues and my grandmother passing, and it was all coordinated with HR and our STD provider. I was paid for it and everything. 

I came back 2 weeks ago, and it's been a load of bullshit since. First, I had issues with that same coworker, again. I was having problems accessing a remote desktop (which had its own UN and PW) and then another website through that which also had its own UN and PW. Both of these things had separate IT departments, which I had to contact. It was a multiple email/call/hour affair and was extremely frustrating. When I finally got it solved I said to a coworker 

""Omg I hate technology"" 

to which this putrid scab of a human (who I wasn't even talking to) said ""Well maybe if you learned to use it, it would be your best friend."" 

I was so pissed off but I tried to hold my tongue. I said ""I mean I only went to school for computer science but okay."" 

He made another remark about how I apparently don't know how to use technology, and I said ""I literally build computers as a hobby and design games for fun."" And he said ""But you didn't build this one!!!!"" 

And I just rolled my eyes, but this really pissed me the fuck off. During this whole time I had only been quietly seething or commiserating with my friend. I hadn't mentioned this formally to anyone, all I wanted was to be a good employee who kept my head down, collected a paycheck, and came home. But this was the last straw, so I talked to my boss about it and she seemed responsive. 

This week I was sick monday and tuesday, thanks to my husband, who works in a factory with a lot of gross, unhygenic men who aren't vaccinated. It's not my husband's fault, he washes his hands and takes precautions, but my immune system sucks and his coworkers are always sick, so sometimes I get sick. On wednesday I was still sick, but I know that the ""i'm sick"" gets old, so I told my boss I was having car troubles. I try to pride myself on being honest, but I panicked in this situation and made a bad choice. I am aware of that. She called me out on it and I admitted my fault and apologized, and then came into work anyways. This has not happened previously. 

She sent me + hr an email saying she would be putting me on an ""attendance coaching plan"" and would get back to me about it in a few days. I want to make it clear that my attendance has not been a problem. In 2023 I missed 1 day that wasn't covered by PTO, and in 2024 I missed 1 day that wasn't covered by PTO. Every other day that I had missed was approved and covered by PTO. 

While I was looking through my hr portal I stumbled upon the employee review information(completed 12/31/23), which I had forgotten all about, since I had never heard anything about it since. I pulled it up and was shocked by what she said. She gave me the lowest score and claimed that I ""needed to work on my communication with staff and management"" despite always communicating with my coworkers (with proof of that in teams) and her (also proof in teams). That's all this section said. No specifics. 

She also said ""\_\_\_ needs to work on her decision making. She has made improper decisions in her work without asking for direction or not acknowledging direction she is given."" I was like what the fuck? I constantly ask for clarification to ensure I know exactly what I am doing. There are teams messages with all of my senior coworkers where I have asked them questions clarifying. And, how the fuck am I not following instructions or making ""improper"" decisions? I have literally been stapling permits together and putting a stamp on them for MONTHS and then filing them in a drawer. How am I fucking that up? And if I am fucking that up, why has nothing ever been said to my face? Why is it only coming out now, in an official HR document that determines whether I get a 36c raise? 

She said ""\_\_\_ is often absent or makes the decision that she is working from home  with prior permission. She has not been on the job long enough to effectively work from home on most projects."" So you're saying that I'm frequently ""absent"" but all of my ""absences"" have been covered by PTO? That's not an absence, and I clarified that with HR. You're also complaining that I'm working from home, even though you just admitted that you've given me permission? If you don't want me working from home, you're the boss, you have to say something. And she's right, there is stuff I might have to do in the office, but typing numbers into a spreadsheet or STAPLING FUCKING PAPERS is not one of them. There is 0 reason why I shouldn't be allowed to do that at home. 

She said that ""working from home is not conducive to training"" and yet when I am in the office nobody is training me. What training? I have gotten no fucking training. She said she ""can't continue with the constant requests to work from home"" THEN SAY NO? You can't allow an employee to do something, make them feel like they're doing a good job and that nothing is wrong, and then pull the rug out from under them and claim that they're doing things incorrectly when you have provided 0 feedback, 0 training, 0 anything. Also ""constant"" requests LOL I wanted to work from home 1 day a week, just like 90% of my office does. But alright. 

She also tried to claim that I was not working the hours I reported, and said that based on the logs from the system we use, I had started my work at 11 am the other day and not 9 am. Well, she wasn't there. She was trying to say that I had only worked 5 hours. I was like, dude, did you forget about the mandatory training that everyone was assigned? Of course I wasn't in the system, I had to watch 2 hours of videos about not leaving my password on a sticky note. She was trying to change my time card to reflect this. She said that my ""hours worked"" is based off of when I am keying information, not when I am in the office. I clarified that with HR, too, and she is full of shit. She is also trying to deduct hours off of my time card saying that I was on break during that time, when I was not, I was working. I said that if she tried to screw me out of this (more professionally than that) I'd contact the labor board about wage theft. 

At one point a few months ago, I messaged her early in the morning on teams to let her know that I was sick and would be using PTO. She sent me a really nasty message about how she had notifications on and that I was bothering her and to only contact her during work hours. I apologized and said  that I have quiet hours set on teams and assumed everyone else did, too. I get that you might not respond off-hours, but I was trying to give her advanced notice so she could plan, and also I really wasn't expecting a reply or for her to see it until work times. I understand enforcing a boundary of separating work and home, but it was the way she said it that really bothered me. It was cold and rude, for no reason.  If you can't turn quiet hours on/mute notifications, that's on you. She's kind of a live/laugh/love boomer who wears shirts to the office all the time that say ""I love Jesus"" and shit like that. 

She and other employees also gossip about people behind their backs, especially another coworker who I think is mentally disabled/ill. They shit talk him all the time and it's really unfair. It always bothered me. 

My project manager is also a 60 y/o super misogynistic man who treats all of the women in the office like something he scraped off of his shoe. He called my asshat coworker a ""boy genius"" because he can do excel macros. You know who else can do that? ME!!!! But this guy literally won't acknowledge that I exist. Won't look at me, say hello, nothing. But he'll go talk about football to the other dudes. 

Also, this company made a big deal and sent out a mass email to everyone about how we did so well and made $2 billion dollars in revenue and profits and the shareholders are so happy and everyone is getting a raise!!!! Oh wait. Everyone except my division, because apparently we ""aren't profitable."" So they sent our division a separate email about that. 

This company also tried to make my coworker (separate dept) do training of newbies. When she asked if she would be compensated for that, they said no. You know what the average yearly raise is? 40c. Our CEO has an estimated net worth of 61.2 M dollars. I can't afford food. 

Honestly, I'm really smart and my intuition is usually sound. I could tell from the beginning that this place was really cliquey and that I wasn't going to fit in. I could tell after wednesday with the ""coaching"" plan it's code for pre-firing, but I really didn't want to stick around and suffer through that. The stress I dealt with with this job was too much, and so much so that I had to take a month LOA. So fuck that.

I have a family member that works a state government job (library) that is just being bullied by their so called “management”.  Seeing the power go straight to peoples head is astounding. Every manager that has been hired was not an internal hire, but a friend of another manager. Plus it seems like any complaint brought to them is not even looked into, but taken as law. For example: I could tell management that Jim kicked a dog of a patron the other day (obviously lying) and they go to Jim to inform him he is being written up without any research into it. Always seems like the dumbasses and ignorant get into these positions of power. Wish I could help this family member somehow but not sure if it would do any good."

We’re in Italy, he’s working as a waiter in a restaurant and yesterday was the last day of his fixed term contract.

Since it was already his third renewal they promised him that this time they would have to give him a permanent contract by law and this was the only thing that made him stay in that workplace.

Unfortunately yesterday they give him another renewal till august saying that they can’t make a permanent contract since they’re having some issues with “work above the average” (what does it even mean).
He was already having so many problems because of the shitty manager, the lack of staff and the overwork (he’s working way more hours than the part time he signed for) so he rejected to sign this new contract and didn’t show up today.

2 hours ago his colleagues called him and asked him to help just for today and he decided to go. Now he just told me that he’s arguing with his manager because they already “accounted” (I don’t know if it’s the right translation) him and his words have more value than his signature.
Is this true?

He can still resign now and in 15 days he would be free but seeing how stressed he is due to how he has been treated in recent months, he would obviously prefer to avoid if possible. 
I don’t know if anyone knows how to help but thanks anyway, we’re both pretty upset."

I’m 26 and have been working my ass off full time in the trades for just over a decade since high-school. 

The new employers bought their fuck boi son the business and while he gets up and goes Mexico with his gf for 10 days after being there for like 3 months, they dump more work on us because they just HAD to replace the former owner’s desk with their fancy new personalized desks (We’re carpenters). PLUS dozens of jobs to serve their existing construction company.

They don’t know how to schedule the work and had my supervisor busting his ass and even agreeing with me and venting to me every day at break. 

They sprung a last minute service at me the day before and gave me hardly anytime to assemble what was needed and were gonna send me alone to do a 2 man job because they had us spread so fucking thin. I put my foot down after weeks of anxiety and took the day off to show them they can’t treat us like that. I got called out the next day if I was actually sick and spilled my guts and explained my situation. 
I lost my close aunt to cancer at 49, haven’t fully healed and have been having a fucking existential crisis. THEN found out her younger sister (other close aunt) was terminal. 

I was told to “leave my feelings at the door” and that he likes to go to work and bury his head down “face down ass up”. 

I get work can be a distraction. BUT NOT EVERYONE IS A FUCKING WORKAHOLIC. I work to live, and they even told me i was the most talented one in the shop and because im taking some extra time for myself they talk down to me and compare me to the biggest slacker the company has. FUCK this shit.

Either due to low/no raise, the ridiculous new hire salary vs. Seasoned employee, or bosses make 300 to 1 ratio income and you've never seen them work.
My brother worked in the file room of a good sized law office. Now if you've never had the pleasure, outside of education,  law firms truly embody shit rolls downhill and a huge work vs. pay disparity.  His team of 6 were crushing it in the file room. Everyone from partner down was pleased with the team.  One of the team left. As a collective they went to their boss and asked if they would propose to the partners that rather then fill the spot, they take that income and divide it amongst the 5 of them. They could handle the workload, and they would all agree to stay until at least the planned digital conversion of files the following year. No increased cost to the company, just more money to each team member.
Asking a lawyer for money is comparable to slapping them in the face as you know. So the short answer was hell  no. The long answer no because you would make more than the secretaries and then they would want more money and blah blah.
Within 1 year all but one older lady, that was too tired to restart, went elsewhere. The manager was let go. They were left with a whole new team, and the office manager now running the file room. 90 days of experience in hard copy files was the most seasoned person they now had to lean on during a digital conversion.

So I really wanna leave the equipment there as a personal fuck you without saying it

When we got emergency time off, we all got 45 hours of it. Which was a shit ton! They told us that sick time was now being called ETO but didn’t mention the actual policy changing.

Unexpectedly, my wisdom teeth have become infected (2 lower ones) and the earliest my oral surgeon could get me in is a week from the day I’m posting this. I went in to put two days off for the day of the surgery and the day after, AND MY MANAGER CAN’T APPROVE IT. 

Why? Because it’s “too soon of notice”. She explained I absolutely cannot use ETO unless it’s a true medical emergency, or I wake up sick. 

We also have 16 hours of “float time”, which I asked if I’m able to put towards the surgery. Nope, apparently it’s exclusively to be used on MY birthday or a holiday. They won’t approve it otherwise.

I’ve decided to just eat the 16 hours instead of putting PTO towards it. Told my manager I’m getting surgery and I refuse to waste my PTO on it.

Is this bullshit? Or is this normal in corporate? Or am I going crazy? "
452,2024-03-01,Capitalism is inherently a global crime to humanity just like Feudalism,u/HelloYeahIdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b45wxt/capitalism_is_inherently_a_global_crime_to/,antiwork,"The working class is suffering in modern day for the same reasons we suffered centuries ago: the concentration and exploitation of resources and land privatized by a tiny ruling minority.

Imperialism and colonization are natural byproducts of capitalism, and poverty and slavery (paid or not) are functions to capitalism. 

I'm pasting the info from this article here because it outlined the criminal and unethical nature to capitalism well in its history.

""Capitalism emerged as a modern world economic system in the 1400s with European colonial expansion. The Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, English, and other nations invaded foreign territories and seized their land. They turned the land into a commodity to exploit and generate wealth.

Colonizers relied on the enslavement of Native Americans and Africans because unfree labor guaranteed the highest profits. They also used indentured servitude and contract labor, which forced people to work for years without pay. Women made up a significant part of this workforce.

This violent process allowed colonizers to accumulate immense wealth for their empires. Slavery financed a wide range of economic activity, such as shipbuilding, railroads, banking, insurance, new forms of commerce, the rise of manufacturing and industrialization. 

European colonizers justified conquest and the imposition of capitalism with the claim that they were racially superior and divinely sanctioned to rule. Colonizers divided the world between superior and inferior people — civilized vs savage, Christian vs heathen, male vs female, white vs Black, and rich vs poor, etc. This worldview became entrenched in capitalism. Colonialism imposed this world view around the globe. 

Today capitalism continues to perpetuate white supremacy, patriarchy, colonialism, imperialism, and other forms of oppression. It also perpetuates a global division of labor. For example, the nations from the Global South are rich in resources, but the poor do not control the wealth that is generated from those resources. Instead, they are often forced to migrate to work in wealthier nations. Keeping domestic labor unpaid or very low-wage has been central to this system of capital accumulation.

Domestic workers have been among the most exploited under capitalism. But they and their children have also formed some of the most visionary movements for freedom. Their liberation can challenge the entire system of oppression and exploitation upon which capitalism is based.""

Essentially, we need global liberation from the clutches Capitalism just as we needed to be freed from Feudalism. 

The genocide of Palestinians is for economic and political gain, the enslavement of Congolese people is for economic gain, the impoverished people in America is for economic gain, the destruction for our climate and environment is for economic gain, the invasion of Iraq was for economic and political gain etc etc

It's all connected and we need to contextualize our reality to understand and overcome it.  Do you really think humans would inevitably invent *weapons of mass destruction* like nukes if we had a different economic and political system, one that didn't fixate on hoarding land and resources? Isn't it too obvious at this point why we have more homes than homeless people and why pay is shit and we can't afford rent? It's by design, and it's criminal."

More specifically, I’m a Software Engineer. 2 weeks ago I submitted my 2 weeks notice after being at said company for 5 months and 20 days.

Reason for leaving? My boss/manager is difficult to work with. I don’t really have a problem finding new work because of my tech skills and past experiences so, I had no issue getting a job offer from somewhere else. Pay is the same. Everything is the same. Except it’s at a new company. 

Anyway, today is my very last day of work and I get a call from an auditor at my company asking why my screen time does not match up the amount of time I charged to my timesheet. And that they’re going to check how many times I badged into the office to make sure it all aligns. This is all happening because there are “concerns” that I’m overcharging the client. 

Mind you, I’ve never charged more than 8 hours in a single day on my timesheet. I’m sure other devs can relate when I say that sometimes I can get “8 hours” worth of work done in about 2-3 hours. When I’m not actively staring at my screen coding, I’m working on my cert or reading up on Linux (as recommended by my boss). Or I’ll take a walk or grab coffee or chat with a coworker or go to the bathroom. 

I was going to spend my last day writing documentation for my peers on how to install a specific software I’ve been working on but after that call I said f that and left. They can figure it out themselves. Of all my years in the tech consulting space, this is the first time I’ve ever had to deal with anything like this. Anyone else deal with something like this?

Thankfully I start at a new company on Monday.

tldr: crappy boss is mad that I’m leaving and is having corporate look into my timesheets to make sure my screen time matches my hrs charged to the client."

That's all well and good, but I'd appreciate it if my job did one for every month, and not just those two as well as breast cancer and mental health months.

I work in group homes for people with severe and persistent mental illness as a maintenance worker, ensuring the homes are nice for the clients and keeping them maintained. Every year they make a big deal about our DEI Board and how great they are. But all I ever see from them are those four months. 

I made a comment today, mostly to myself when I saw the emails about Women's History Month saying ""I wish they'd do one for every month."" A Program Director happened to walk in when I said that and he asked what I meant. So I said yknow, we only ever do these four. What about Autism awareness, or Down Syndrome month, or pride month?

He said I wanted to take away from black people, and I need to be careful what I say because that's very racist. An hour later I get a call from my boss, saying I got lucky and his boss went to bat for me and I get a second chance. I've just decided not to talk at work at all anymore, because this isn't the first time one of my bosses have had to go to bat for me for something like this.

Then when I went home and told my wife, who used to work at that company and had issues with that same Program Director, she talked about how when she was on the DEI Board this same person, who is also on the board, openly said he's homophobic and doesn't agree with their lifestyle and thinks it's wrong, and he said this in front of the CEO and CFO who is also the HR head.

After MONTHS of interviewing for a university position, they finally were ready to tell me the salary... Which was essentially 'low income' within my high cost of living city. I have a masters degree, and 10+ years of full time work experience (minus the grad school time, during which I worked as part of my funding, so I wasn't even 'just' a student). The job position skills needed are quite niche, not run-of-the-mill. Their top concern expressed up until today was long-term retention. 

When will employers understand that retention = money. If you lowball the salary, why are you crying when that employee leaves for greener pastures? I truly, truly, do not understand the mindset. 

I wanted to thank you all who post your stories and struggles, from every industry, entry to senior level. It inspired me not to smile and nod today. It inspired me to show my anger and frustration. It inspired me to argue, passionately, that my experiences counted, and I was not backing down, and I wasn't willing to bend to pressure that I should be grateful/sunk cost fallacy about having a job offer when it would be do-able but uncomfortable to try to live on it here. I would rather move away from this city entirely than tie myself to a commute and rent-to-income ratio that will only leave me falling further and further behind. 

For my own amusement, I typed in my very first salary that I got in the middle of the last recession into an inflation calculator. That job would be worth 50k today.

Hello I’m (F26)
I am new in a gaming company and it’s only been a month for me in here.
I made friends are everything was great, I learn and I adapt and I am trying to make myself presentable.

But there’s this woman, F25.
I noticed that every single time I mingled around the friends that I made at work, she would stare at me from distance with that “Why and How” look.
For context, she’s a little fat and my figure is athletic.
So one day she invited me for lunch. Her and M26 together.
We went for lunch and we had nice conversations but between the line she asked me “So what do you think of our colleagues, anyone cute?” so I said “Everyone is good looking” and she said “Welp you’re too nice. I think some are ugly though” and I said “I can’t say that anyone is ugly, that’s not nice for them” and she made this “Alright LOL” kind of smile.

Skip forward, she mentioned that she told me that our cleaning lady was raped and her child is an illegitimate child. I told her that cleaning lady told me is a devoted Catholic that repented from sins like men and alcohol and she brought up about that rape.

Skip forward, she hates me. God knows why.

She complained and lied to my director and told her that I told her that I “left my previous job without notice” (I did not! Never!)

Few days ago there’s a retrenchment and we were supposed to keep it a secret. I assumed the secret was until after it happened. So I casually mentioned that “Ah yes I knew about it yesterday. I couldn’t believe it happened, I thought it was a test” AFTER an hour it happened.
She made another complaint about me because I “said it near to artists” and she even added I asked everyone “did you guys know about this?”
I DID NOT ASKED THAT!

So and so I’m on probation and she always now targeted me.

I am very close with HR, Finance and Operations team. Went lunch with them and they told me that she’s naturally a bitch. She tried on to the same thing to them too but it didn’t work.

They told me that she wanted to be friends with them too but they can’t assert her nitpicking bitchy way of conversations with people. They told me that she’s the type of person who speaks first and think about it later, she’s just jealous that I am able to get what she couldn’t and she’s has no social skills, not me (I told them that she told me earlier that morning that I have no social skills and I can’t read the room) and they said “She forced us to change the AC to below 15celcius but when we explained thats the lowest that we have, she got upset and we had to call technicians to prove her wrong.”

I am so upset.
I didn’t say anything bad against anyone. I just slipped up one sentence and she wrote a complaint against me.
She talked about rape, people in office are being ugly and I didn’t even complained.
If I complained now, it would look like I’m seeking for revenge.

I don’t know what to do :( she can’t influence me , she influenced people around me.

From what I’m reading online about the law this is illegal. He showed her, her time sheets from January and February that showed she wrote down time for two holidays by accident. He does not pay holidays, no pto, no benefits. Pitiful ass $18 an hour. 

Aren’t employers required to fill out a payroll deduction sheet that gets signed by the employee authorizing these payroll deductions? I told her to get this in writing what he wants her to do but she works at a law firm so I assume he would know the law to either bend or abide by. He also wants her time sheets for December and November to check for more unpaid holidays. She cannot afford to work for free 2 days in a row and I also thought it can’t exceed 25% of disposable earnings or 30 times federal minimum wage.

She’s excelled in her position, taken on more than she should without proper compensation, is early to work everyday, and so on and so forth. We believe this is entirely personal from the CEO’s perspective. It’s a total blindside that she is now aware of.


What would you do to get the final “fuck you” in this position? Obviously write the first indeed review coming from the only position they are hiring for will be done..

Part of the promotion was a new title change that better fit my new responsibilities. The issue was that my employer did not have the title my boss came up with to fit my responsibilities now - so on paper, my title stayed the same. 

In the 2 years since, I have been known in my office as this unofficial title I was told we don’t officially have a title for, including it in my email signatures and when formally meeting internal and external departments. 

Fast forward to a few months ago, when I found a job title and salary structure resource at my employer. Here I found a job title almost verbatim to what I’ve been referred to with similar responsibilities. Additionally, according to the salary structure sheet, this title is supposed to be making about 15k more than I currently do.

When I brought this up to my boss he said HR wouldn’t go for the official title change and salary adjustment because I don’t fulfill all of the responsibilities listed in the job description. My counter to this was that I don’t do everything in my current job description, and that my current official job title doesn’t match what I actually do either. When I brought this up, my boss stayed with his point that HR wouldn’t go for it and then added on things that I am not doing well, leading me to feel like I don’t deserve an official title change.

If I’m being 100% honest with myself, he was right in what I could improve on. But I still feel like I deserve to be officially recognized by this title and receive the respective salary bump as the 15k difference is the minimum for the actual title. I want to go to HR but I don’t want to go over my boss’s head as he would have to approve it anyway.

Am I out of line for thinking I deserve this change in title and pay? Additionally, how should I move forward?

14,2024-03-01,10 years of work is worth a 10 dollar voucher.,u/Awolfx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b4csle/10_years_of_work_is_worth_a_10_dollar_voucher/,antiwork,"




Today I received a certificate to mark my 10 years of working at a very successful Thrift Shop chain. I won't mention the company name for obvious reasons but if they figure out who I am and take action then whatever.

Anyway to commemorate being such a hard working employee for 10 years at a job with significantly high turn over rate for both regular employees and managers, I had the honor of getting a whopping 10 dollars in vouchers to shop at the Thrift Shop...even though we get them for the holidays or every few months through other means. 

This feels like such a blatant slap in the face to me. I don't like to talk high and mighty about myself but I've absolutely busted my ass working there all these years. I've worked with few to no co-employees because this job is so demanding and the pay isn't the best for how much work it is. It's a Job way better suited for a large group of people and I've been lucky to work with at least 2 or 3 after all this time.

Is this the policy for rewarding long time employees?? I wasn't expecting the moon but I feel very disrespected and completely demoralized overall. I'd feel better if it never happened to be honest.

Let me tell you a story about how poor leadership kills an organization, through the lens of my journey to today.

I grew up pretty rough. I was homeless as a teenager, dropped out of school, became a drug dealer, and eventually earned myself a felony and jail time.

While I was in jail, I got my GED. When I got out, I had a new lease on life. I knew I was smart enough to do more, and I was in a very tough financial spot and wanted to avoid going back to dealing. I decided to enroll in my local community college.

At the beginning, I mostly just wanted the free grant money. Tuition was free, and the grants helped me pay my rent while I dealt with healing and growing into a new person. But eventually, I really found myself to be passionate about my education. In fact, I discovered that I was incredibly passionate about education in general, specifically interdisciplinary humanities. I went on to graduate from community College with four associates degrees, transfered and finished my BA, and then later went on to complete my MA as well. 

After earning my graduate degree, over a decade had passed since my conviction and my felony had been ""expunged."" I started applying for professor/instructor positions at community colleges. I got an instructor internship and all seemed well until they ran my background check. Little did I know that expungement means nothing on a federal fingerprint background check. My felony popped up and I was not hired on after the internship period. 

I had to start checking the little box next to the felony question on every application, and the calls for interviews stopped completely. 

So I pivoted. All my hard work wouldn't be for nothing. I leaned into my own experience and started looking for roles at the intersection of education and social services for people with whom I have shared expereince.

The calls started up again and to my great joy, nearly a year and a half after I completed my MA, I finally had an offer for a career position with a living wage at an amazing organization. 

""And I get to teach!"" 

Of course I said yes. My first week was a whirlwind of joy and disbelief. I couldn't believe how wonderful the team was, how innovative and empowering the work I got to do, how compassionate and caring my bosses were. 

At one point, one of my coworkers and I mentioned in conversation that it all seemed too good to be true. That things were so good, and we were so used to crummy jobs, that we were just waiting for the other shoes to drop.

The job was everything I wanted and more. I had the opportunity to hone so many abilities and talents, to exercises creativity and compassion on a daily basis. No one enjoyed coming to work as much as me. I was always there early and often stayed late. I went above and beyond at every turn because I genuinely and truly enjoyed every day. 

Then things started to fray around the edges. People got overworked, overlooked, under appreciated. Leadership began to talk about money and budget with a bleaker tone. People were let go, there was some quiet quitting, and those at the top were very obviously frazzled. And, like they say, shit rolls downhill.

Despite the shit storm, I continued to see the silver lining. I loved the work more than anyone. That made it all worth it in the end.

For months, staff pleaded with leadership to listen to feedback, to make adjustments that would save jobs and stress and time and energy. It all fell on deaf ears. The ears of those who think they know better, think they are better. 

Today, the other shoe finally dropped. 

My role has been eliminated.

I've created entire learning systems, created curriculum and program alignment, developed pur assessments and tracking methodologies! The organization would have already failed without my skills and talents, and I know that's true. They were lost without what I brought in. 

I've been offered another role under an incredibly problematic manager with no experience and no people skills. It's a non-teaching role, zero space for creativity or client-facing relationship-building. It's not for me. It's non-educational completely and totally. It's a nightmare job for me. 

I feel grief. I feel anger. I feel disappointment and disbelief. 

The leadership team failed, and the organization will fail because of that. They can't meet the numbers and they won't retain enough staff to stay afloat. If they could look at someone like me, someone who does so much for them and enjoys doing it, and then do *this* in return... It's over.


Edit: Apologies for the typos. I wrote this up on my phone while feeling very emotional about all of this. I'm sure I'll correct them later, but I'm still just feeling so sad.

Isn't this how it's supposed to work though? if they go on vacation I would cover for them too sigh). But many people just don't even take vacations at all or just ash them out. Most just distribute those 5 days throughout the year. 

I've asked ""you go on a lot of trips right?"" and I just wonder in bewilderment how they can assume that from getting 5 PTO a year. And even then, I can do what I want with my PTO. I stopped saying I'm going on (godforbid) vacation. I just say ""I'm going to visit my brother"" or invent something, and even then my coworkers feel contempt for me ""taking time off.""

**I just hate this work culture where vacations are looked down upon in the US.** 

I know it's job dependent. I don't really have a stable career like my friends who are nurses, teachers, or accountants who actually get 3-6+ weeks. I just wished there was a law that would mandate obligatory PTO on a federal level.

I did the closing shift and stayed up late when I got home and when checking something on the company laptop and I saw them stripping people out of the system. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. They then sent out mass texts at 5am for no one to come in. Naturally I couldn't sleep after that and just waited for the call trying not to have an anxiety attack.

A equivalent to a District Manager called everyone individually early in the morning with the HR in the call to ""thank"" everyone for their contributions and the company (DoorDash/DashMart) had to make some ""hard decisions"" and the one that killed me, they are ""so thankful for the trust"" put in them. You could hear this higher up was reading from a script. 

They offered us a severance ( a 4 week pittance that will get taxed to hell) tied to an NDA and insist on us signing soon, but looking in the document we have 7 to days to sign. 

My boss was just transferred to our team a month ago after they randomly promoted our old boss only to now let her go. We all just met her daughter and we were in the process of working on a number of projects. I know this was devastating knowing they moved her there with the intention of firing her along with everyone.

I've seen DoorDash sweep these ""smaller"" layoffs under the rug (I don't know how many other teams were cut with no access to the system now). This won't get any articles and they want it that way because they are doing barely anything to support us.  When they let go like 1.2k corporate employees last year they knew it would be written about so they pulled out so many assistances for those employees to look good. They're now treating us like we should be lucky to get anything. The irony of it being Worker's Appreciation Day actually had me laughing at how sick it is.

We all have to exist in this system and I just wanted to make a drop in the bucket post to remind everyone that these companies DO NOT actually appreciate you or the work you do. I also wanted to shame Doordash for how horrible they've been after all the work myself, my team and my boss have done. If you work or plan to work for them in any capacity just know they will drop like you're nothing, especially if they don't have to worry about public backlash. Lastly I wanted to in some capacity detail the process and how quick and sterile it can be.

I don't plan sulk for too long and I know I'll figure out a new path soon, but playing through Cyberpunk 2077 really should have prepared me for this. Fuck Corpos.

I am an assistant. My boss and I have been friends since high school.

 She got this high paying job because of her dad and she hired me to be her assistant 2 years ago, mostly because of my background on graphic design and marketing.

It’s been a bumpy ride, she is quite an attention seeker,  huge ego, and she wants to do so many things at the same time, which of course she just commands me to arrange while not moving a finger to do it herself. Kinda like a Miranda. 

 Anyway, my whole week I spent doing stuff for her, and today she told me to just enjoy my weekend. 

Tonight She went to a concert carrying her 2 phones, and she lost one of them. She called me at 11:43, drunk, telling me she needs to me “cancel” her stolen phone. I take melatonin to sleep because otherwise it takes me hours, and by the time she called I was already sleeping and under the effects, so it took me a minute to understand what she was saying. I asked her if she meant she needed my help to *block* her phone, but she kept saying she needed to cancel it. I couldn’t understand exactly what she wanted, so she got frustrated and hung up. She then texted me she was going to call me *later*. 

I know it doesn’t sound that bad , but this is pretty upsetting for me. I don’t find it fair that it’s up to me to fix her problem. She has another phone where she can google how to do whatever it is she’s trying to do. It just infuriating. 

This isn’t the first time she’s done something like this, either. I feel like a babysitter more than her assistant. She has told me last year, when she yelled at me so bad that I told her I wanted to quit, that she would be shooting herself in the foot if she loses me. She is highly dependent on me. I’m just staying for the money. 

I have a masters degree, but this is the best job I could find after a long time looking. I have lots of friends, family, who have been looking for jobs for ages and they get nothing. So I can’t just quit, but ffs, this woman is driving me insane. 

Anyway, I’m gonna try to get back to sleep, I put my phone on airplane mode for the night, hoping it doesn’t make her mad. Thanks for reading til here if you did, I just needed to rant. "

She's been a W2 employee up until 3 months ago when they forced them all over to being 1099 contractor. The employer also took her off their liability insurance. She typically uses their vehicles for deliveries when they are available, but sometimes one may be in for maintenance etc and she's forced to use her own vehicle. She has her own auto insurance. 

Employer is now saying it's on her insurance not theirs. Generally speaking I do know as a w2 employee in California, if you're driving for work, the liability for an accident would fall to the employer. But I'm curious in this situation. As she's been a long term employee I don't see how they can even legally change over the over to a 1099. But I do believe they started a new business under a different name to avoid legal issues shifting from w2 to a 1099.

I feel the abrupt switch to 1099 status may raise legal questions, especially if it involves creating a new business entity. For anyone who may be in the know, Is there legal recourse to address this situation? "
7,2024-03-02,Am I being too negative or am I in a terrible workplace?,u/bxxxyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b4h4fy/am_i_being_too_negative_or_am_i_in_a_terrible/,antiwork,"I started a new job in January, a few months after I was laid off.

At first few weeks it was fine and my coworkers are nice as well. But within the 2nd month, I realized my team is severely understaffed and overload... recently my team have been working more than 45 hours a week. It's not rare that between those week we had to stay working until 12AM and even my coworker to 2AM to meet tight deadlines. Mind you we aren't being paid for overtime.

I work in Marketing and management want to hold a big campaign but gave notice only 3 weeks prior to the deadline. So much was expected, but so little time was given. 

On top that of we are still in the middle of campaign to launch a new product, and there is also this 'internal project's which they said is a part of continuous improvement but it's even harder than our main job, too little training and takes so much of our time... 

And if little mistakes are made, we were met with yelling and harsh reprimands and that was all done in front of your coworkers

It doesn't help that my manager, who's not located in the same office as mine is very hard to communicate with. Often disregard my question or things I need her approval from and came up with completely different things. I don't have any experience with this role before and need some guidance as there is no training so I feel very stressed. 

She also didn't care when I called in sick with a doctor's note because of gastritis and continue to make me work. That happen to my coworkers too. This is the first time I work with managers who seemingly have no empathy but maybe it's because she got pushed around a lot too. Ultimately I can't help but feel guilty for taking a sick day too because there is so much needs to get done. Tbh I feel very anxious to get back to the office because of this too

Now I have asked for advices here whether it's better to look for another job or not but people have been saying I'm being too negative and I should cope.

 I'm still taking my time to rest from being sick but I cannot stop thinking and wondering if I'm the one who see all this too negatively and that it's not as terrible."

Minimum wage got bumped up to 16.28 this year. The store manager is cutting employees’ hours, presumably so that the money that would go to us goes to him instead. (When we get a raise, I think the money comes out of his paycheck. Not sure on the details of this, but I’ve heard it from several coworkers who have worked here for a long time. He does not give raises, often not even when employees get promoted to positions that require more work, because of how this system of payment is set up.)

I’m quite young and this is only my second real job, so forgive me if I’m overreacting or way off the mark here, but this feels like something he really shouldn’t be able to do. It completely negates the raise altogether, and depending on how many hours he cuts, I imagine some people will be making less money overall than they were before. 

The company is unionized, but I really have no idea what I would even say if I contacted them. If anyone has any advice regarding how, if at all, I should take action over this, I would really appreciate it. "

I don't think I have to explain, but for those who won't understand it, I will.

Been working this job for over a year, they offered me a position that's lower than what I initially applied for, but promised after training and all that, I can work my way to the senior role I applied for. 

I agreed.

Now, they decided to also cut the pay in half, and claimed I would be paid more once I've worked my way to the senior role. Which they predicted would take a few months.

I had my doubts, but agreed because it was the only opportunity, the job market is a mess, and I am broke.

My first concern was that I wouldn't be able to ask for a raise or they would deny the request once I started working with them and made my way to the senior role. But I gave them the benefits of the doubt.

Fast forward to today, a year and a few days later, I'm doing even more work than what was in the senior role job description, and still no raise. Nothing. Just me, slaving away, doing boring and hectic work, and not having a choice because there’s no good job and I don't have the financial freedom to quit. 

I spoke with one of the HR members in January, and she told me they were working on reviewing some employee's roles and increasing their salaries.

It's February now…still nothing. 

As for the anxiety, yeah, I get anxious every time I get a Slack notification because it's never a message to “thank you for your hard work” or praise you for all your great contributions. It's always to point out your mistakes, that they obviously will notice and complain about, but God forbid they notice all the good things you do and praise you for it.

You’d do ninety-nine great things but get nothing like “thank you” or “well done” but that day you make one mistake, they are so quick to call you out like you have never done anything right. 

For the tears, do I still have to explain? 

And I don't even want to hear any “quit and go do what you love, find a new job” or even any advice at all. If it were that easy, I would have done it. Let's stop pretending like the job market is all rainbows and unicorns. Even if I quit this one, how am I to know the new one I'll find will be way better?? It’s not about the job, it's just the workforce in general.

I know people who have it worse than I do, but that will not stop me from complaining about my struggle too.

If you're here to advise me to “find a good job” “be grateful for what I have” or “stop complaining because some people have it worse” just don't bother because I refuse to have any of that.

If you relate to this post on an I-also-hate-my-job level, then comment, cos I'm here for the company misery loves, not advice tbh.

In the short time I've been here, I've only ever received positive and encouraging feedback from the people I assist and various supervisors, so I'm at least fairly confident that I know how to do my job and do it well. 

However, at the end of a large meeting, our current project director asks to pull me, my freelancer, and my project manager aside, and he takes that moment to berate and humiliate me because he believes that I'm trying to attack him when I bring up concerns and issues from my supervisors. I was told that I know nothing about the process and thought behind this project because of an incident where I tried to advocate for my freelancer and find a compromise between the two. Throughout his speech, he continued to belittle me, my role, and the work I do. 

After he finishes, I do my best to apologize for any miscommunication on my end and remind him that I am only acting as middle management. All I can do is relay information and carry out the plans of my supervisors. Once he finally realized that his grievance isn't with me as much as my supervisors, he thankfully calmed down and made plans to address those issues with them. 

But that entire interaction has left me shaken and upset. He still hasn't apologized for the way he spoke to me that day or for humiliating me in front of my coworkers.

1,2024-03-02,Can I land a decent corporate career in the US with a political science degree from a TOP Latin American university (I'M A DUAL CITIZEN WITH AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP)?,u/iuseredditnowandthen,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b4nb28/can_i_land_a_decent_corporate_career_in_the_us/,antiwork,"I'm an american citizen that just now got a degree in one of the best universities of Latin America. I speak Spanish and English, have no debt, and I'm moving to the US now. I won't be working/living  in Latin America. I'm a US citizen so I can work there with no problem.

The obstacles are as follows: I have no work experience, a political science bachelors isn't very useful for landing jobs in the general corporate careers I'm interested in (Sales, HR, Marketing, etc.), but I know that many Americans that work in those fields have unrelated degrees. My university probably wouldn't be known by employers and they might not consider me or hesitate more in comparison to when they see a typical american college on other resumes. That's the real problem I fear the most.

I don't want anything to do with politics, government, academia, teaching, etc. Just want to get my foot in the door in a corporate job like Sales, Marketing, HR or anything really,  and climb up from there to a normal and decent job. But obviously my background isn't the best to start with and I think employers could just ignore or toss my resume forever given my unheard of university, and Latin American degree in an unrelated subject.

I've thought of getting a masters in Latin America because it's cheap, but I doubt it would add extra value and might end up being a waste of time if I'm going to apply to US jobs (?). The pro of this would be that it's free for me, and I would then have a more specific, specialized and related degree to the business world, compared to just a political science degree.

Getting a masters in the US is my last option but I want to avoid it for now because I don't want any debt.

I'm open to any advice, experiences, etc."

Been working at goodwill for about 3½ years. I started out as a manager, then after about a year and some change, moved to sales lead, which just meant I manage the sales floor mainly.

My boss has always told me she wants my word and feedback on things, since I am essentially a representative as well. I take pride in it, and I always want the best for my coworkers, as they're genuinely respectable people who deserve the best in life. However, everytime I try to let our store manager of a change that could be made or a suggestion of any kind, I am immediately shot down. 

Essentially with our store manager, it's her way or the highway.

She has let other managers abuse their power over other employees (for example, I am a transgender female, and when I kindly told people to use my preferred name and pronouns, managers would still deadname me, making a point to be openly transphobic), as well as let multiple things slide with zero action being taken (like a customer who had not only threatened to hurt me, but also s*xually assaulted another coworker of mine.) I honestly don't know what else to do, considering how she literally will not care in some situations about issues. I'm trying to find another job, which ive applied to 20 or 25 different places, but its taking longer than expected to hear back.

I have been calling out every week or so for a while, and I just can't find the motivation to go in, because whose to say one of us wont get threatened or SA'd or both? I'm sick and tired of this job, and the things that have happened to my coworkers that my boss has let slide multiple times."

If everyone is getting poorer as each new generation comes of age. This model of government cannot survive without great violence against the oppressed class. We know that Boomers have the lions share of all the wealth, genx is in double digits and millennials are in single digits, good luck to genz. The social contract for a democratic republic to survive is based on participation from the oppressed classes in the political system and that political system is only being maintained by State Forces (police/ABCs). If the State is not maintaining their end of the social contract whereby we pay taxes and they provide the climate to engage in the free market; the whole system will collapse. People who are perpetually indebted and have no hopes of a wage increase to climb up out of that debt will become completely disenfranchised from the State. Our participation is voluntary based on the material things we get in return to allowing the State to dictate the rules of society. If the State continues to fail the oppressed class with the very basic ability to have bread & circuses- they’re in for a rude awakening when more people stop following the rules we all voluntarily comply with.

Prior to my current part time position with the company,  I had worked full time for the company for eight years and have had a lot of positive accolades. I, generally, feel like the guy coworkers and management go to when things go tits up.

Usually during the tale end of January and the month of February, the company cuts hours to save on overhead before the big spring ramp up. It sucks but is kinda expected. It is usually handled with some measure respectfulness to the needs of part timers.  Let's fast forward to this week. When I checked my schedule on Thursday, for the next two week pay period, I was scheduled 36 hours/18 hours per week. Which was a minor reduction of hours, no big deal. A day later I casually checked my schedule, and I now have a whole whopping 11 hours over two weeks.  The week starting with today went from 18 hours, down to 2 hours( a mandatory all store meeting.) Next week being two 4.5 hour shifts.  After conversing with other part timers, they also got dramatic cuts, so its not just me. 

But I feel particularly disrespected by getting an involuntary  unpaid vacation this week. Which by the way I would have showed up for my shift today, if I hadnt checked my schedule last night. No heads up, no call, no email, my own department head didnt even know till I texted him(he's pissed too) I would have wasted my gas.

Sorry I just needed to vent."

However, I believe a vote for Biden is just as bad for the working class. 

This does not mean I want Trump. I am in complete agreement that we can't have Trump in office. We all agree that Fascism is bad. However, I think it's important to emphasize that it's already too late to avoid a abti-union, pro-fascist state. The far Right has won, and they did a while ago. 

They completely eradicated workers rights through the Taft-Hartly Act, dismantled unions through globalization, destroyed every worker movement abroad, bombed millions of people, killed hundreds of thousands of people, created a militarized surveillance police state, destabilized the global south and then refuses to take their migrants unless they do slave labor, created the #1 incarcerated population in the world, and said population is forced to do slave labor. 

These are things that by and large both parties agree with. Because both of these parties are bought by the exact same people. These parties are for Billionaires to fight over their wants and needs. And these mother fuckers are hell bent on controlling the world abroad enslaving Congolese people, and perpetuating endless wars for profit. 

Bro we have been Fascists for a long time, now it's just finally turning inward and we're starting to feel it ourselves. It's too late to fix it from within. The politicians are already bought and paid. The only way to save Democracy is by taking it back. Organize. Mutual Aid. Strike. 

One may be inclined to argue that we can buy time by electing a slightly left leaning fascist that doesn't prioritize the increasing of Fascism growing from within the imperial core of the American Empire. But this line of reasoning fails to see the scope of the far-right and the many battles they have already won. Fascism has been here for a long time for the marginalized groups in our society. Many groups of people, who White Americans conveniently choose to ignore, have been dealing with Fascist policies for decades.

 We see this through the genocide we have committed on these lands, through the continuing systemic problems of racism and police brutality. We see this for the inhumane treatment of undocumented immigrants, and the continued use of slave labor through the prison system. 

I cannot vote for Biden in good coincidence. The American government has complete and total hegemonic power. This means Biden has the political, economic, legal, and physical power to stop the Israeli government from continuing their genocide. This means Biden is directly responsible for these actions, and it should anger you that such an evil man could even exist. How could someone with all the power of the world, who sees the same fucking images we see. Allow for this to go on. 

 He sees the children's limbs cut from their body with no pain medication. He sees the women and children slowly dying under the rubble from the bombs his country supplies to Israel. He sees a grandfather weep over the death of his granddaughter who he calls, ""The soul of my soul."" He sees servicemen so horrified by our government's actions, and feeling so voiceless, that the only thing they could do was to light themselves on fire, screaming for someone to finally free Palestine. Biden saw that and he still refuses to do anything. 

Not to mention the countless other war crimes and racist laws Biden has openly and willfully supported. Dude wrote the crime bill, and bragged about creating Israel for the purpose of perpetuating America's interests in the Middle East. He openly supports Zionism. Zionism, a political ideology built on the premise of European Colonialism. An ideology that could be described as the bedrock institution for obliterating our class. 

The working class at one time had real, legitimized political power. Globally these were realized through socialist revolutions across the globe. Here in the United States, through decades of militant union organizing, the working class became a force. The economic dreams that our elders talk about were all won by these decades of union organizing and sacrifice.

 When the American working class first organized, they were able to gain some influence over the American political process. They bought themselves an FDR and a few governors. Maybe a supreme Court guy here and there. But as soon as we started to win, it was pulled away through actions like globalization. As the United States destabilized the global south, they also turned those counties worker's workers into wage slaves. What we call ""globalization"" in the United States, is just a propagandized way of saying you conquered the world politically and economically through decades of war, bombing, etc. 

Unions believe that an injury to one worker is an injury to all workers. That is because our class only has power when we stand in solidarity which then gives us the power to influence the political and economic aspects of our government. So we cannot and will not stand by while our President murders our brothers and sisters in Palestine. We will not vote for a man who allows his corporations to enslave workers around the world. We will not cooperate with a man who is bought and paid for by billionaires. 

I don't know how my vote is going to shape out. I will utilize my vote in some way, but it will not ever be a vote for either major party. However, I will continue to work towards things I believe will actually help improve the material conditions of our class. Organizing in the community and work place. Growing the unionization of all workers in every sector of the economy. Building mutual aid groups, and continuing to protest and disrupt the government from continuing its Fascists endeavors abroad. 

In the end it doesn't matter if it's right or left. Because the real conflict isn't between ideologies or political philosophies. Ideas don't change and move the world. Money does. So in reality the conflict is the Ruling Class Vs. the Working Class. Vote for the interests of your class, not the interests of competing ruling class ideologies."

Because of this whenever we get a day off to hang out together we have a rule that we aren't allowed to answer any emails, calls or text messages and that we're essentially only allowed to spend our attention one another, right? 

And I don't think there's anything wrong with that cause when I'm hanging out with my partner I don't want to do or think about anything but him, especially after a stressful week of work. 

But during that day together I was getting a shitload of calls, all of which I dismissed before putting my phone on do not disturb and shutting it off cause I got annoyed. 

Well, when I come back to work today I realize that I was apparently getting so many calls because there was a software bug that needed to be fixed. I ended up fixing it but I ended up getting called into my boss's office. 

And then she spends maybe a little less than half an hour scolding me for not picking up my phone, telling me about how much progress and work was lost and what not. Basically just telling me that I HAVE to pick up my phone, irregardless of whether it's an off day or not. 

But it's upsetting because it's like... What's the point of an off day if I have to still work? Because if I picked up the phone anyways they would have asked me to come into the office to fix the bug in question. 

But in the end it's not like I could say anything. She wasn't being necessarily rude. Her demeanor was professional as it always is so I could only apologize and promise to do better. But it's annoying to know I can't even just hang out with my boyfriend in peace. Even on my off day I have to think about work, worry about work. I can't stand it. "

1,2024-03-02,Should I send this resignation note to the entire team?,u/Kitty7Hell,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b4t2ob/should_i_send_this_resignation_note_to_the_entire/,antiwork,"So I was working two jobs for a while because the job I'm trying to quit was only giving me a maximum of 18 hours a week even after they told me upon hire that they would try to get me full time hours. My other job offered full time hours if I open up my availability, so naturally I accepted. We have a message board for scheduling, and I was wondering if sending this message to all staff would be appropriate, or if I should just send a more professional-sounding one to management. 

Here is the one I was going to send to everyone:

>Title: Releasing all my shifts

>Hey all. As much as I enjoyed being a member of the ___ team, I've decided to just stick to my other job because they are offering me to work full time, and they can only get me those hours if I open up my availability--which means I had to make a big decision. 
You guys are awesome, and I'll really miss working with you all. I've been considering this for a while and kept putting it off because it was really hard to make this decision, but since I was scheduled 0 hours this week, I felt it was the right time. 
Love you guys. ""Change da world, my final message. Goodbye.""

I'm not sure if everyone will even get the meme at the end, or if this is appropriate to do, so that's why I thought I should get a second opinion. Thanks!"

2,2024-03-02,Considering a job change and I need the advice of my fellow anti-workers,u/caskaylicious,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b4t5qb/considering_a_job_change_and_i_need_the_advice_of/,antiwork,"I have been on and off working for the same company since I was 23 years old (34 now).
By 'on and off' I mean, went to work there for 3 years, went to work for an account of my prior employer for about a year, then came back to work for the same company,  still there present day.

To give you an idea of what I do, I'm an account manager for a small family owned company in the electrical sales industry.
I'm the only person in my company who travels to physically shake hands with the people who we do business, but the territory I cover is state wide, and my state happens to be in the Southeast region and is a LONG peninsula.

Throughout my employment I've gone through alot of life changes (moving further away from work, a ruined engagement, etc) and dealing with those factors, I've still managed to stay employed at that same place, helping that business grow by gathering more accounts and properly servicing our current accounts.

About a year ago I moved the furthest away from my job that I've ever moved in my life (I did it for love) and what used to be a 20 minute to 45 minute transit at max to get to the office now became a 1 hr trip in the morning and fighting traffic back home in the afternoon a 1hr 45 mins max tip. Keep in mind this is only to get to the office, which I'm normally at 3-4 days a week when I'm not doing account work doing site visits in places sometimes on the other side of the state.

So far I've had a good relationship with my boss and my pay isn't the greatest for the kind of work that I do compared to other sales reps in my industry but I've stuck around believing that I can help this small company grow and get rewarded for it. I was recently just given a small raise because I started using my new vehicle for sales trips, gas paid for by the company, the raise being for 'wear and tear' on my vehicle $3000 more annually.

Now, I'm overloaded with work on a daily basis and and being the longest standing employee, there's an unspoken expectation for me to be on point and never make mistakes. I take on quote requests, order fulfillment, finding solutions to mishipments that occur and mistakes that happen with our accounts(and there are ALOT of mistakes), and traveling to these accounts to show face and make sure that we're able to continue business.
Other than myself and my boss, there's one other person in the office who does only sales work on the inside and doesn't travel to see accounts and we have about 7-8 guys working the warehouse handling product assembly and shipping/ receiving.
I'll leave on a sales trip one day and the next day I  come back to the office and there will be an overwhelming amount of work because of my absence.
2 days ago, I find myself at the office catching up on work while my boss is at a doctor's appt and his wife, who handles all of the company's accounting decides to call my personal extension to tell me that I make the most mistakes in the organization and threatens to fire me over the phone because I had texted my boss about an emergency situation involving an important account (I was instructed to do this by my boss) and threatened to fire me again if I were to 'go crying' to my boss because of the converstaion we had.
After he got back, (of course I told him his wife threatened to fire me over the phone) we had a closed door meeting and tried to reassure me to take what his wife said with a grain of salt (yes, I told him her exact words to me).
He offered me the rest of the day off which I took and not even 3 hours passed when I got a job offer cleaning carpets locally (no long, bonkers drives). This is not work I'm used to doing, and the pay is really up to how much I want to work in a day since it's a subcontracting job.
Is this a sign that I need to leave my current job and do something ppssibly less paying but closer to home?

TLDR; moved the furthest away from my current job that I ever have in my life, got yelled at by my boss' wife over the phone for trying to conduct business per my boss's instructions, and got a job offer for something possibly lower paying. Should I leave my current job for the sake of my mental health?

I have such strong, mixed feelings about it. Almost every one of my coworkers has become a close friend, I have such a solid routine, I'm great at what I did (waitress at a 55+ community), most of our residents loved me, and my bosses considered me one of the most reliable employees they had. I was there for a year and 7 months.

But I realized that my compassion for the residents has burnt out completely-- they love me and always tell me I'm great, but they're still picky, rich old people that complain about everything and get mad at me for the smallest things. It wore me down. My managers are on some bullshit lately too and I got tired of it all. 

I was coming home nauseous, crying, and exhausted after 6 hour shifts. Weed and alcohol were the only things that could relax me. My skin was breaking out, I was gaining weight, I couldn't sleep, I neglected all of my hobbies and passions, I was miserable. I know quitting is the right thing to do, but I'm just grieving for what was once actually a good place to work-- so much has changed and I hated it. 

Here's to hoping for better health and a new beginning. I can't wait to pick up my hobbies again. I don't have a job lined up but one of my coworkers who quit just a couple weeks ago is trying to get me in to her new job. I'm just gonna relax and enjoy being free for a little bit.

I don't know what the point of this post is, there's just so much emotion wrapped up in this decision and I wanted to thought-dump."

3. Sales guy was caught in his work uniform taking pictures of customers on and off the premise as well as having child porn in his possession.  Currently facing multiple felonies.

4. Having a relationship with the COO and right before he announced it the employee handbook changed so now we are allowed to have relationships with our superiors. 
 
5. 4 very competent and educated employees leave all giving same reasons of toxic work environment and pay and no change.

6. 3 sales guys caught in a triangle of taking money from the company and an office employee also was part of it. All under his nose. He had to approve the inner office sales due to discounts applied.

7. Will not in any way stand up for his employees in front of customers. Will always take the customer side even if they are 100% wrong. Not to mention we can never find him if we do need him. Send him an email or a call won't respond for two or three days

This is more ranting and a bit of need t for input. 

these are the tasks I do currently ror $17 an hour , I work on avg 15-20 hours a week:
-manage email calendar for 3 brands
-manage and design all email campaigns for 3 separate brands
-create graphics for website and emails or flyers—for all 3 brands
-some light social media content creation and scheduling
-review website reviews and approve/hide them
-find newsletter topics for emails and blogs, and post them on the website. 
-create landing pages and sign up forms for various things and connecting them to Klaviyo email and creating flows for them.
-upload brand new products to amazon seller central and shopify.
-and many other random little tasks sprinkled in between that I’m able to do remotely 
-weekly meetings

Mind you I started out doing just a few of these and he has over time added more and more to my plate. 

started out at $15, asked him about discussing increase in hourly rate last year, he offered me $17. Said he knew it wasn’t much but would give me more hours??? ok. 😂

fast forward to 2024, he wants to give me another brand email to manage making it 4 brands email marketing. I tell him I need $25 an hour. He offers me $20 but give him a week to speak to whomever he needs to, he doesn’t think he can go that high tho. he has “a lot of employees to take care of”

I feel like for the all the tasks I do, $25 is not unreasonable but I get if he can’t, he can’t. Would you stay for the $20 or walk away knowing you’re not paid your worth. 

He even suggested maybe I can find another part time job and still work for him too, and that blew my mind.  Sir I am just asking you for more money—not to have to work more? I’m a homeschooling mom and don’t have time for full time work at this time. 

I literally do things (usually last minute things) right when asked, he always says how valuable I am, etc. I am in WA state but they’re located in FL. This man is a millionaire. I’ve seen the shopify revenue for all brands. 

I will also add my family doesn’t rely on this money really- I just enjoy the job and like having extra money to take some pressure off my husband /bills and it’s just nice to have if we need it, put into savings etc. 

I have thought about quitting so many times. Am I asking too much at $25/hour (which really isn’t bc self employment taxes)??

They're taking the National Labor Relations Board to court.

When asked about labor unions back in November, Elon said, *""I just don’t like anything which creates a lords and peasants sort of thing.""* ya mean like being a CEO to 5 companies buddy? Ya mean like firing your entire team for shits and giggles? 

The NRLB protects us from unfair labor practices. The more we unionize, this system of government would hopefully be more effective in ensuring our well being and compensation while working, no matter who the employer.

But because of our current economy and government, the NRLB is restricted, as shown -
 
""A few months earlier, an NLRB administrative law judge ruled that former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz had also violated labor law by telling a worker who had raised union-related issues to him that “if you’re not happy at Starbucks, you can go work for another company,” which was interpreted as a threat of dismissal.""

And *yet*

""Schultz returned to serve a third stint as the company’s CEO because he wanted to stop the unionization drive and preserve the company’s image as a “model employer."" ""

So there you have it.

""Unions create peasants and lords"" - a billionaire 

""If you don't like working here, work somewhere else"" - a billionaire

""Model employers oppress and exploit their workers to preserve the company image"" - a billionaire

Capitalism is *inherently* unethical and inhumane. The more policies, protections and legislation that are put in place to benefit and secure the working class/everyone, the more we'll move away from this system into a more socialist one. "

The back pain I'm in makes any physical activity longer than a half hour impossible to do. Sometimes I barely can tolerate the pain enough to cook food to eat. So as a result of all this, I've been on an LOA from my job for last 6 months as well.

Ever since I got sick I haven't gotten a shred of empathy from my 'family', they all think I'm faking my sickness in order to not work so other than receiving EBT Food Stamps (that my mom steals) I don't have any other real support. To make things worse I got some mail saying I might lose my benefits if I don't start working at least 20 hours per week in order to stay eligible since I'm technically not disabled. 

It seems like 90 percent of the jobs avaible to me all either require a ton of manual labor or require you to be standing for a ridiculous amount of time. I'm on LOA from my security job right now where you're require to stand still for 8 to 12 hours on end with no sitting allowed, I probably won't be returning to that job even when the UTI eventually passes.

I have a disability that requires me to need access to frequent and sometimes prolonged bathroom breaks. (The longest I’ve ever had to be in the bathroom is roughly 20 minutes) I have gastrointestinal distress that seems to be triggered by high stress and anxiety at times and some days I am going to the restroom a lot and other days I’m not at all. I also have autism and ADHD. But regardless I need to be able to have the choice to.

I have supplied him with a doctors note recently, after he bothered me endlessly for months about it, and finally I sat down with my doctor and explained things to here and she thinks I have IBS. She got me a note explaining I need to have access to sometimes frequent bathroom breaks.

This was weeks ago and it actually wasn’t enough for my boss. He’ll say things like “you took 5 different bathroom breaks today which add up to a total hour of bathroom time.”
He’s saying that even though I technically have a note it doesn’t matter because it’s verging on “time fraud” and he’s going to speak with his superior and discuss the possibility of me CLOCKING OUT when I have to go to the restroom from now on.

I am paid hourly. I would be losing pay over a disability that I can’t help. He says my frequent breaks “aren’t fair” to other employees that don’t get to take them , but that’s how disability accommodations work. It’s not supposed to be fair, it’s supposed to accommodate my disability.

This feels like it’s verging on an ADA violation.

What is your take on this and how should I proceed to protect myself and my pay? Am I in the wrong for feeling this way?"
61,2024-03-02,"[Update] So, I Quit My Job",u/CrazieIrish,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b50x64/update_so_i_quit_my_job/,antiwork,"For the original post with my infamous quitting email see:

https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/s/TYZcJN5X3D

As for any updates, nothing has come my way.

I returned the new company equipment that evening after quitting to the same person who dropped it off to me two days before. I was told that the owner was swearing up and down that he never told me to fuck off in the context I took it.

As for the email I sent, to my understanding the entire staff saw it. Many employees were new, so they didn't know who I was, which was fine. I didn't know them either. One person I did know responded asking, what happened. I lost access to my work email before I could respond.

For some information background:

- I was with this company for 13 years.
- In Novemeber 2022, I went to part time working weekends only as I had taken on a full time job elsewhere to pay the bills.
- I had been checked out of this job since October 2020 when I returned from parental leave after my daughter was born

Some aspects over the years:

- I was a supervisor from 2012 until I stepped down, in April 2021, to part time supervisor reducing my hourly pay from $18 to $17 after burnout from constant verbal abuse from customers and drivers
- Completely stopped supervising in April 2023 and took a further reduction of pay. When I argued being reduced twice for the same job, I was told by the GM that I had never seen a reduction previously. Despite showing proof of my original pay, I was ignored by the GM. He was also the one who signed off o  that same reduction.
- Was asked to resume supervising duties a number of time. I continually refused unless I was going back to $18 an hour or more due to inflation. Continually told I never made such an amount and would only see a $1 increase for shifts where I supervised. At this point I had been reduced to ten cents above minimum wage, $16.60.
- Off and on verbal abuse from the owner over the years.
-Threats to my life by customers over the years. One such person was a teenager who threatened to co e slit our throats because we could not find his lost item. He had his mommy call in asking us to help. We refused and told her he should be happy we were not reporting his dumbass to police.

What led to email:

The week before the event, I was working when my daughter decided to go pure WWE and try a diving headbutt off our couch into our coffee table. I jumped up an stopped her, but in doing so, my work laptop went flying and the screen was destroyed. I reported the damage to the GM and asked for a new laptop. I took responsibility for the damage, offered to pay for it as well.

I recieved a response from the GM on the Wednesday after thanking me for taking responsibility, but then I was chastised for destroying company property and that I had been irresponsible.

Arrangements for a new laptop was made and delivered Thursday, two days before the event. I was assured it was set up and ready to work. I confirmed via email that evening I had recieved the new laptop.

The following morning, I again received another email from the GM, still chastising me for the damage and whatnot. I, being fed up, decided to quit the following week.

The morning of the event, I went to login and the computer is not setup for use at all. I can't access the files whatsoever. I was told to either call the GM or the owner for assistance. I opted to call the owner despite already getting into it with him earlier that morning when I notified I was logging in late.

Suffice to say, he was not happy when I told him it wasn't set up. He expected me to have already had it ready. I told him I wasn't going to do that on my own unpaid time. That's when he scoffed told me to fuck off. I cut him off midsentence, told him I quit. I hanged up, sent the email, and the rest was history."

Both recruiters told me that my salary expectations were outside their budget and their finance teams were aiming for 15%-20% lower than their posted salary ceiling.

To give a better understanding. Pretend the job posted a salary range of $70k-$100k. I asked for $95k, but finance only budgeted for someone in the $70-$80k range.

When I asked why they posted the range, one recruiter said the range encompassed the total salary and not just the base salary. The other didn't have an answer.

Suffering. While I make good money (around 110K in a LCOL area in the midwest), I work for a Fortune 500 company that recently laid off 20% of its workforce. I’ve been handed more work because of the layoffs and there’s a RTO initiative right now (despite many of us being permanently remote for 10+ years and everyone spread out across the US). I’m looking at a commute that could very easily be 1 hour 20 minutes, one way.

I’ve communicated my dissatisfaction, especially with the workload and commute, but I’m not optimistic that help is on the way. We are in a hiring freeze on top of the layoffs. I’m so frustrated and my job is starting to not feel worth the sacrifice to my mental health. On paper I’m a good employee—I just had a positive performance review and got an exceeds expectations, so I don’t think a layoff is in my immediate future.

Which brings me to my next point: I never expected to be in corporate America for this long (an entire decade). I expected to pay off grad school loans, build up a nest egg, and move onto a passion project. In the past year, my fiancé and I have paid off EVERTHING (student loans, cars, etc) and we both have zero debt. We have enough savings that we could both quit our jobs and live comfortably for two-ish years. He’s not expecting to quit his and he’s supportive of me leaving mine.

I feel guilty about potentially walking away from a job during a time when so many are getting laid off, but like I said: this was always a “temporary” thing til I paid off my loans. Still, I can’t help but feel incredibly guilty about the idea of not working (even if I can afford it). I’m also worried that this RTO kick was done fully expecting people to quit, and for my company to “get away” with not paying severance.

What would YOU do in this position? Keep making $$$ and grin and bear the commute plus ever-increasing workload? Quit and tell em to pound sand while you pursue something you actually enjoy? Take a year sabbatical and drink mojitos on the beach? Attempt to do as little as possible and get laid off rather than being squeezed so tightly you quit? All ideas and perspectives welcome!"

Basically i work in retail and my manager is 70
Years old. His son in law is the district manager, and because of this nepotism my manager makes all sorts of exceptions to store policy. These exceptions he makes cause all of the staff great stress because we are all expected by our District manager to follow the book to a t. 

When i spoke to my manager about this he urged me not to contact hr as this would cause our DM unnecessarily stress. He also clarified that at his age he isnt worried about making his own rules and beint reprimanded because he doesnt want to move forward here. 
I spoke to our DM (his son in law) about this and after 5 months of following his direction which was to keep track of my managers misbehaviour, under the pretext that by sharing with him we would deal with it, he has now told me that because my manager is my direct superior that I should listen to him because he is the exception to the rule.

So my question is, why didnt he tell me that to begin instead of sending me, knowingly, down this path of confrontation that ultimately was to go nowhere (as i really deep down had expected).

I really want to contact hr but am worried that these two will spin things and make my life hell if i do.
My manager even said it would be bad for my career here if i did. Which sort of sounds like threat of reprisal for calling him out. Which is illegal if im not mistaken.

Should i call hr? Should i contact the labor board?

After two years I was scheduled on that day for the first time (although I have voluntarily taken a shift on that day in the past when another manager was sick and couldn't make it in). When I told the GM it was outside my availability, he said:

""that isn't how things work in the future. In case of future uncontrolled/unpredicted situations, I can/will use all/any staff if needed/wanted.""

I thought that was pretty odd. I've worked in management for 6 years at different companies and have always had an availability sheet that outlines when I can and can't work, or the company has clearly started the days I must work and I followed their schedule.

So I got chewed out for an hour after this exchange and told that it was a courtesy that I was given that day off the whole time, there actually is no availability sheet, and I'm stupid for assuming there was one. All of this in between my GM's constant boasting of how much smarter he is than me, how fast his brain works (yes he literally said this a dozen times), and how he can do whatever he wants because he's so much more accomplished and talented than me.

The whole time I'm thinking. What a joke dude. I get it, your dad started a business for you when you were 19 and you've been in charge for a decade. Congrats Mr. Man Child. I'll do what you want without complaint just like I always have because I need a job, but you thinking you're smart or special is a laugh.

This is kind of long because a lot has happened. TLDR at the bottom. 

This is my first go as an independent contractor. I respected the client a lot and enjoyed the company a lot. Then 2 months ago his wife came in for me to look over her books. She does not work for his business. She has her own. He asked, I said yes… my first mistake. 

She walked in with an attitude on a Friday. I got up to get ice, and she gave me a dirty look. As I was walking back in, she looked at me in pure disgust. I thought it was weird, but I’ve never talked to her or did anything to her so I chopped it up to a bad day. 

On Monday, client comes in and seems stressed. I ask if he’s okay, I’m an empath, and he says, “just been arguing with my wife and I’m exhausted.” He then says, “she wants me to tell you to dress better.” I say, “is my outfit why she looked at me like she was disgusted?” (If it matters, I wore oversized overalls, a long sleeve shirt, & Prada belt/boots.) He said she said I’m “young and hot” and she doesn’t like that I’m working there. He says not to worry though.

But then he started to treat me like shit. Talking to me like I’m the help. Nitpicking over things that aren’t my duty. Telling racist “jokes.” Yelling, being rude, and shading me in front of his customers. I decided to quit. I was going to resign that Friday, but my “co-worker” committed suicide in one of the offices. 

Everyone was devastated. Client was distraught. I think it was due to guilt, but he was shook to his core. Again, as an empath, I felt bad so I didn’t quit. The memorial was this week though. The following day he was back to being an entitled controlling asshole. Next day he was nice. Next day back on his bs. It’s up and down and I don’t want to deal. 

Honestly if there was no death, i would have left already. Another contractor told me that the lady before me quit because of how he treated her thanks to the wife. She gave notice but he still spread a rumor she stole $10K. So my question is this — do I just resign with no notice? Or do I give a notice? I’m an accountant so I don’t want stains on my reputation. But I also don’t want to be trapped from fear? 

TLDR: “boss” is an asshole due to his insecure wife, he treats his contractors like we are the help. So much one died by self infliction at the office. Had there been no death I would’ve quit that day. I held off due to being soft but now I’m fed up and don’t want to go back. If I don’t he might spread lies that could ruin my reputation.

1,2024-03-02,Seeking Career Advice: Transitioning from Non-Profit Mental Health Work,u/fearlessmurray,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b52uiw/seeking_career_advice_transitioning_from/,antiwork,"Hey Reddit 

I'm currently navigating a significant career transition and could really use some advice and insights from those who may have been in similar situations or have valuable expertise to offer.

Background:
I've spent the past few years working in non-profits, particularly within the mental health and addictions sector as a peer supporter. Recently, I found myself in a challenging situation where workplace dynamics became increasingly difficult to navigate. This included poorly facilitated training, lack of proper training altogether, instances of bullying, passive-aggressive and discriminatory comments, and safety concerns within our program. When I brought forward concerns about workplace dynamics and accommodations for my disabilities to my direct supervisor, an external HR investigation was launched, which I didn't initiate nor desire. Despite my efforts to ensure equitable participation in the process, I was terminated from my position.

Interests and Goals:
In light of these events, I'm now considering a career change or possibly going back to school. While my work in the mental health field has been incredibly rewarding, I'm contemplating leaving the non-profit world due to the challenges I've encountered. I'm interested in exploring new fields or industries where I can continue to make a positive impact while also ensuring a supportive and equitable work environment. Outside of my professional life, I have a deep passion for experimental music and free jazz. I find solace and inspiration in exploring unconventional sounds and musical expressions. Additionally, I've enjoyed working in childcare in the past, finding fulfillment in nurturing and supporting the growth of young minds.

Available Programs:
Currently, there are four potential programs available to me in my current region: an online Medical/Health Office Administration program, an online Early Childhood Education program, an online Rehabilitation Assistant program, or a Mental Health & Addictions diploma. However, outside of my region, degrees in Community Music, Performance/Theatre, Jazz, Electroacoustic Music, and Creative Arts: Health & Wellness are what interest me most.

Challenges and Concerns:
I'm facing several challenges and uncertainties as I contemplate this career transition. I'm particularly interested in hearing from individuals who have left the non-profit sector or frontline work in mental health, addictions, or gender-based violence advocacy. What were your reasons for making the transition? How did you navigate the process of leaving your previous role and exploring new opportunities?

Request for Advice:
I would greatly appreciate any advice, insights, or recommendations from individuals who have experienced similar career transitions or have expertise in relevant fields. Specifically, I'm seeking guidance on:
- Exploring new career paths outside of the non-profit mental health sector
- Strategies for transitioning to a new field or industry
- Resources or networking opportunities for individuals looking to make a career change
- Any personal experiences or lessons learned from leaving Frontline work in mental health, addictions, or gender-based violence advocacy

Thank you in advance for taking the time to read my post and share your valuable insights. Your advice could make a significant difference in shaping my career journey as I navigate this transition. Feel free to comment below or message me directly with any thoughts or suggestions you may have.

Looking forward to hearing from you all!

19,2024-03-02,Yesterday I quit my job as a space engineer ,u/MagnusEffect,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b52upq/yesterday_i_quit_my_job_as_a_space_engineer/,antiwork,"Warning: this will be very long. 
TL;DR is basically “I quit my shit underpaid job, found a better one in literally a day, fuck all these people and their entitlement.”

I’ve been working in this place for about three years as a satellite engineer (not US). Yesterday morning I handed in my resignations. 
I’ll continue to work there for my one month notice period and then say goodbye. My only regret will be not seeing my coworkers everyday because we have a sincere friendship.

For the past year I worked my ass off to keep one particular project afloat when the person who was previously responsible for it ran away for the same reasons I’m about to write down. The schedules of this project were unreasonable when not just ridiculous considering the manpower involved, but I was pressured to keep up to them. Meanwhile, I had NO support whatsoever and had to do my senile project manager’s work on top of my own, but somehow (/s) my paycheck never reflected any of that responsibility. I was never offered a raise or a promotion — while if it wasn’t for me, they could have thrown that project into the trash bin. 
I sincerely love the technical aspect of my work and now know that I’m very good at it — I’ve definitely proven that I’m capable, skilled and dependable. 
Yet, my current salary is probably like the US average minimum wage and I live in one of the countries that has the highest cost of life in Central Europe (but also the shittier pay grades). If I were to live alone, I’d spend all that just on rent, bills, gas to go to the office and maybe groceries. 

In three years I’ve worked there, I never called in sick once nor took any paid time off on top of the mandatory office closure periods, except for one (yes, one) single day. Not because they denied me, but I felt I didn’t need to use my days — or so I thought. Looking back, I wish I had completely drained my paid time off.  

Following this project now also requires very frequent and sometimes extended work trips, and it has been that way in the last 10 months. During this time I already gained a shit ton of weight because I’m stressed as fuck and ate my feelings, and on top of that when away on work trips I’m forced to eat out everyday and can’t go to the gym to keep active and just release all this stress. I had just started to take care of myself again with a balanced diet and daily exercise, when this work trip madness started again and I have to be 1000 km away from my home every other week. Most of the times I’ve got to go alone on these trips, solve all the problems by myself, deal with my stalker project manager who calls me 20 times a day, and it feels so unfair. 
I think that was the last straw that prompted the decision to quit and actively search for a better option.

Like ten days ago I sent a resume for a job application in the same specific sector I have now built an expertise in. Didn’t expect much, but was directly contacted literally an hour after to schedule a technical interview on the following day, and the hiring process started that very same afternoon. I accepted the position. 
Please don’t mistake this as a sort of humblebrag, it’s just to underline that for a while I thought that I had to accept low pay to make up for my lack of experience — but that doesn’t excuse what is borderline wage theft, and that experience bit isn’t even true anymore. I know that many others are in the same mental position. 
The pay at the new job isn’t anything stellar, but at least it’s what I asked for, will allow me to actually make life plans and there’s a good chance to get a significant raise. And last but not least, I’m not expected to do this fucking job alone. 

When I told the CEO (my boss) that I’m leaving, he tried to low key intimidate me and make me question my choice.
I was told that he also threw a rage fit at someone who’s kinda high in the ranks in this new company — a person who wasn’t involved in my hiring process AT ALL. My SO laughed his ass off when I told him this bit of the story and say that if anything the fact that he’s making all this noise over me makes me look a very good asset in front of my new employer. He has a point, but I’m still infuriated and I’ve got the feeling that he’ll try to sabotage me. 

In any case, learned my lesson.
If I find that the new job is shit, I’ll quit that too.
I am and always was very sympathetic to workers’ struggles and try to support any strike, unionization and campaign for workers’ rights. While I realize I’m not in as a dire position as many others, since I’m still fairly young and have skills that are in high demand, and thus quitting a job is somewhat easier, I feel that I’ve done myself and others a disservice by accepting to work for much less than I deserve and than it’s fair.

Not trying to make any particular point with this post, just wanted to share my own experience and honestly also to vent both my frustration and my relief at the same time. 
Thanks for reading all that. "
2,2024-03-02,Advice Needed ,u/StrangeJedi,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b52wy3/advice_needed/,antiwork,"I'm working at a video game company that I won't name as a production assistant. Our pay rate is lower than other production companies I've worked for but the workload is a lot more than the average. Not only are we doing duties that are outside of the normal PA, we are also stage managers. We're essentially doing 2 positions for the price of 1. Last week my manager had a meeting with me, and offered me a lead PA position that would be a ton more responsibility, stress and work for only a few dollars more a day. I honestly didn't want to deal with that level of stress so I politely turned it down. 

My manager got upset and said he'll give me some time to think about it. Since then the manager has been having the other lead PA ""sell"" me on the position, and today he had me do one of the duties that the lead would normally do, in an attempt to slowly groom me for the position? Maybe I'm overthinking things but I feel like he's low key pressuring me into taking this role, even though I don't want it. I should mention that our manager has an old school ""if you're on time you're late"" mentality, and no matter what we do it's never good enough. He said he's going to ask me again in a month or so. I'm really over this job but I literally can't find work anywhere else.

This job is definitely not worth it for what they're paying. I guess I'm looking for advice for what to do if he tries to pressure me or force me to take this role. Thanks. "

I am probably a horrible person for asking, but honestly I just am trying to get a couple days off for my birthday.

Originally my manager told me no, unless I could get coverage and so I did. Unfortunately my coverage backed out today and next week is my birthday. I haven't had time off in awhile and would like just 3 days off for my birthday. 

If I call and just say I am sick, he will just have me come in, but he is horribly scared of COVID, (won't get the vaccine because of Trump). So if anyone has a picture of a positive COVID test they can send me it would make a amazing Birthday gift. "

I had been staying beyond office recently to get a project finished as I really wanted to and it would look good come promotion time.
This was usually a few hours every other night, but sometimes just an hour. 
Still want way over my hours for several weeks, unpaid. 

On one particular evening, we (the team) where supposed to go out with clients for food and drinks (all free too). 
All my team and manager saw me there still when they went out for the food and drinks, which I had to begrudgingly skip on this one occasion. 

About a week after the client drinks I needed to leave 30 minutes early for my medical appointment (he was told months in advance too), which was rejected by my manager when I reminded him on the day of the appointment.

When I asked why I couldn’t leave early that day (despite all the hours I’d put in)  this manager argued with me that I WANTED to stay HOURS later at the Office and (this is a direct quote) “You prefer it in here (the office) than going out for drinks and food, your not very social so you being here was your choice, I never asked you to stay, so no, you can’t leave early”. 
“You’d probably rather be here than at home”.

Fucking amazing that this manager think I’d rather stay in this shithole office instead of free food and drink all night, even if I’m not a social monster with my work colleagues.
Bearing in mind I’m married too, so being at home with my wife is actually something I like to do. 

I’m convinced he just didn’t want to acquiesce to my time off and used this as the worst possible excuse.
Surely nobody could be that fucking stupid, right? 

Anyways, I put my 4 week notice in the next day. 
His face was amazing though when I told him I was leaving. 
He had me offsite and on gardening leave that afternoon, so I think he was a tad embarrassed. 

Anyways I’m a consultant in my field now and make three times as much and don’t have to live in Fucking London anymore. 

Fuck these companies man, more specifically, fuck these incompetent middle managers. 
There was nothing to be achieved by him acting like that, it’s going to cost him at least £100k a year to replace me too.

The club gets 50% of the service charge fee and the rest of 50% is going among the staff. I only get 12% of the service charge fee and if a tip is being given to a server, I don't get anything.

Meanwhile my manager and chef tells me an amazing job I do with an exciting voice. How happy they are for me to be here! Yeah, carrying a heavy tray with plates, not getting tips and the servers disappearing."

Obviously, the five-day isolation period isn’t short enough when your long-term plan for COVID is to reinfect every worker as often as possible.

The CDC’s desire to eliminate isolation is yet one more step toward disappearing the virus from public consciousness, because a government that isn’t fighting COVID-19, isn’t losing to COVID-19. If COVID is everywhere, COVID is nowhere. If the other kids at school all have a permanent cough, maybe my kid’s permanent cough is “normal”. So as hospitals remain overwhelmed, staffing shortages worsen, economies buckle, disability and long-term illness hits new records, kids miss school and workers lose their livelihoods, we’ll continue to do nothing more than turn to each other and wonder why.”

This morning, she received a text saying that she was being suspended for two days because she had left a mess, and for dying her hair at work. 

The mess in question was a towel left folded on the dryer while she put her girls to bed. She has two coworkers as witness that her hair was already dyed when she came into work, because she does that at home.

This feels like a setup, and I'm wondering if they're mad that she's asking to take off a few days so we can spend our 25th anniversary in Hawaii. She just had a day off in August so we could visit Colorado. 

Whatever the reason, she's adamant that if she's written up, she's not signing it, because she didn't do anything wrong. She did her job, her ladies needs come before things like putting away the towels.

Is there anything she can and should do in this situation?"

last week she was over 2 hours late one day and there was other days where she changed my clock out time to 15-30 min shorter. my clock out time was still after 6 but she keeps changing it. my guess is so she doesn’t get in trouble with her boss for being late every single day. is this legal at all? what do i do? a coworker of mine said she did it to him all the time and he called her out on it, that’s why he’s mainly second shift (worst shift).

I came to the US on April 2022, I came here escaping from Bangladesh to pursue gender transition and a future without persecution. if I try to look up my asylum case, I either see it as pending, or if I try and expedite request, I am told that my case does not exist. I am lacking human connection while simultaneously being suffocated by human ignorance.


I have been abused and violated and mistreated and unheard by people, meant to take care of me, including my workplace, medical clinic and insurance despite claiming to treat trans people like humans or to be inclusive. I voiced my frustrations and concerns in any way I could, even while dealing with a septic root canal, getting COVID-19 after 4 years, three ER visits, and my grandfather being in an ICU 8000 miles away from me and crumbling my family even more, all while calling my workplace and keeping them updated and requesting sick leave when applicable. The response? 

Suppression through ignorance, my workplace cut everyone’s hours and also did not follow up or raise any issues with me not getting my sickleave pay despite requesting it, eventually leading to two managers cornering me with a pink post-it note with the shifts I missed.


I spent my whole life witnessing and surviving integrated transphobia. I am silent because I am traumatized, and I am resilient because I recognize warning signs and my own strength. I escaped my country, my school, my chance at education. And what is there to show for it aside from working at Nike or renting my own room, or having occasional night outs? A new life littered with neglect in the most unspoken way. I read signs about people standing for me but this is a testament to how alone I am. I have died, at the hands of oppression and I do not know how I am alive again, but I will spend the rest of it screaming at the people who had a hand in this. I will pursue the work that I want to do while realizing that there is truly no one who would die for me, but there are so many causes I would die for. My transgender identity is one of them.


So I’m wondering what i can do… my bills are here, my paycheck is nowhere , and it’s ok, it’s manageable because I have another interview probably or my new business kicks up or i just work other gigs, I can somewhat manage

A few weeks ago she told me I have to stay away from my work friends, because they're guys. According to her, I'm not allowed to have male friends, because I'm a woman. My phone was all I had left to keep me sane at work, but now she took that away too.

The problem is, every couple of weeks I use my phone to vent about my boss. It's the only thing that stops me from crying at work or quitting on the spot. (Well, okay, sometimes I still cry in the bathroom at work.)

We have a weight loss program at work, so I bought a clip on pedometer for my belt the other week. Within a few days, it fell in the toilet at work, and I had to fish it out with a plunger. It broke. That's when my coworkers started trying to convince me to get a smartwatch like they have to count my steps. I was going to just buy an $18 non-Bluetooth, non-smart pedometer watch on Amazon.

I don’t care about this job as much as i care about helping my manager so he can spend time with his kids. i could get a new one and might have to if i fight this old man on a power trip lol"

Advice needed!",u/happycowsmmmcheese,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b5m58h/update_when_you_think_its_too_good_to_be_true_it/,antiwork,"My original post is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/s/tTqdG88YuM

Tldr for original post: My org eliminated my role despite nothing but passion for the work from me during my time there, they offered me a completely different role that I will hate.

Now for the update. 

I was not the only fucked over in this move. My manager, the best manager I have ever worked with, was demoted. Additionally, the other manager on our team (for our southern California office) was also demoted. The entire team for both offices consists of six people. Me, both managers, and three other people who shared my same position. Though myself and the three in the same position had the same title, we all know and agree that my role was a much heavier lift as the only member of the team with academic training and teaching experience. I led the charge completely within all things educational, and trained my fellow team members on facilitating academic learnings. The three others were not demoted or moved to new departments, only me, leaving them with no one to support the academic side of the work, which is a HUGE portion of what we do. They are also left with no managers to speak of. Needless to say, all six of us are pissed.

Socal manager called me last night. She wants to take a stand. My norcal manager is heartbroken and has been struggling to decide if he will take the severance or the demotion. Personally, I wrote up a list or requests, including a negotiation of pay in my ""new role"". 

My family needs me to take the new role. I can't turn it down. I am not as good with money as I'd like to be and I have no savings. I can't afford to refuse it. 

But socal manager really wants us to band together. If the six of us all refused to work until this was fixed, the org will fail immediately. We do have quite a bit of power here. 

But it's so scary to risk everything. 

I need advice. What should I do? "

So there you are just grinning like a fool and talking to the screen without any interaction with a human being. This is an impersonal BS way of filtering out candidates and we all have read about how much bias AI is susceptible to. 

What happens if candidate has thick accent? What happens if the question poses a scenario that you may not have encountered? Where is the personal connection with the hiring manager in the interview? Can their AI really accurately translate voice-to-text? So many questions and issues with using this to filter out good candidates.

The problem is they haven’t been scheduling me for about two months. I’ve been working for a year as a part time, I asked my store manager for available shifts even closings which I don’t like because we close at 10:30 or 11:30 but no calls. They usually call me when nobody can come in which is unreliable for me, the last time they called me in was during a snowstorm which obviously nobody wants to drive in they call me in when they should’ve been closed. When I asked my manager who by the way never explained why I haven’t been scheduled only when I bought it up to my MOD (manger on duty) or supervisor. 

Store managers and assistant managers handle the scheduling, when I spoke to her about having more hours she at first told me she can give me hours in the back or receiving which one I hate it gets chaotic for me even had a panic attack once and two I am not even hired or trained to go in the back in the first place, I am sales floor and cashier mostly sales floor but explained there isn’t any hours which is strange because it was after Christmas and usually with returns it gets pretty busy after the holidays. She offered me the back of the house hours like throwing scraps to a dog. Then when I asked again towards end of February she didn’t even respond. Couple days go by now today when I got an email for an exit survey and this being my first job I looked it up and usually is given when an employee is leaving which I never said I was quitting nor was ask of me that I was considering quitting I mention it to my MOD that I was looking for other jobs and ranting to him. We’re friends outside of work and I trust him but I wonder if he mentioned that I was looking for something other jobs maybe to my store manger that meant I was quitting. I should mention that I did take the survey and it may be a bad idea but I just wanted to express honesty about that I wasn’t quitting unless it’s another way of saying you’re fired.

I don’t know, I guess what does it mean? Am I fired? Nothing to worry about? I just need some clarification."

I plan on leaving my current employer within the next year and want to take my work with me. My work products are on GoogleDrive. Recently my job has stepped up employee surveillance capabilities and I’m trying to figure out how to download my stuff onto a drive without being too obvious about it. I have a work computer that I leave at work.

It’s a long story, but the IT guy at my workplace has an infatuation with me and I’m aware that he monitors my account use both in his free time (lunch break/late at night) and during work hours. He asks co-workers about my personal life and always wants to know where I am when I’m not at work or when I decline to get drinks after hours.

Therefore, I have to be extremely careful about what I do and say at work at all times. For my safety, I have to plan my exit carefully as he doesn’t want me to leave. I feel trapped and I don’t want him to know I’m taking my stuff and making my way out the door.

I could:
1) Download my content on my work computer and put it on a USB. (Can they see if I insert a USB into my work computer?)

2) Download my stuff on a coworker’s computer (they see this stalking behavior and support me leaving/are helping me)

3) Download all at once 

4) Download slowly over time

I'd love your advice please. Below I'll go over a few of the options I've been thinking of. 


A little about me... 34 (f), I have a BFA in visual arts, and $40k in student loans. I have worked in childcare, retail, physical labour, food production and in other fields... I've tried a lot, but nothing really sticks, and I feel like a disappointment to my partner who wants to get ahead in life. He doesn't pressure me about working, but he often asks what I'm going to do, which I simply don't have an answer for. I recently had to leave my job due to stress. I had a management role in a small business and it eventually sucked my soul out. There wasn't enough room to grow and too much micromanaging/control from the owner. I'm on illness EI currently, so I do have some money coming in, thankfully, but good God, what the hell am I going to do. 

 

OPTIONS: 
I have thought of going back to school. There are some Art Therapy Diplomas which I've been looking into. As an Art Therapist I'd likely have to run my own business, and not having my Masters would effect how much I can charge. This would cost me another $30k in student loans just for the 2 year diploma. And it's school, it's just hard. 

I love food production, I've been plantbased for 8 years and that's definitely my niche. I've considered starting a small business where I sell a variety of food items at farmers markets. The start up costs would be low, and I'd just need to figure out the logistics. 

I also thought of doing cleaning under the table. I could charge $30 an hour easily, and build my own schedule. I could also turn this into a legit business as well. My mom had a cleaning business growing up, and I worked for her often. I'm a really good cleaner, but somehow this just feel like the bottom of the barrel. I wish I didn't feel this way about it since it's probably the fastest way to make money on my own. 

Then lastly, I just start looking for work... which makes me feel sick to my stomach since I felt very emotionally hurt by my last job, and I've struggling with trusting anyone with my effort and time. I don't not want to be taken advantage of again. 

Are there other options out there? I'm a smart and driven person. I'm very passionate and caring towards others. I just don't know the direction to put my energy, and I'm just so tired. "

So I just started a new job and have been there over a month. I was asked to write a few draft paragraphs by my boss for a section in an upcoming report. 

After finishing these paragraphs, I was on a call with my coworker and shared my screen to show her my little section and asked if it looked good since shes been at the company for longer.  She said everything looked good and wrote a 4-5 word annotations like ""move this here"" ""the date was x"".

Before sending it to our boss, I edited/rewrote some sections so while I didn't known it at the time, 2-3 of her annotations got deleted since when you delete a word or sentence the annotations is attached too, it deletes it.

2 weeks later she messages me asking where all her comments are. I say some should still be there but I might have accidently gotten rid of some when editing cleaning up the document. 

She goes on to say that I deleted her contribution and I'm trying to undercut all her hard work. I found this silly as 1. I didn't ask her to write comments in my document just glance it over briefly, and 2. it was clearly by accident. 

She went on to say she wants me to send an email to our boss talking about her substantial contribution to the report. I said no problem but felt pretty upset since I felt this was a big understanding and didn't see why she wanted credit for something that took her 5 minutes. 

Since then, she has basically refused to chat about work saying she's ""busy"". Our day when we go into the office together to discuss work things, she completely missed. I asked her a question over email the other say and she replied by also attaching our boss as the recipient which was weird since it was over something so trivial. 

Now I don't know what to do. I feel like she's overreacted and is stonewalling me for a clear misunderstanding. 

TLDR: Accidently deleted a few of my colleagues Word annotations in a document. She has accused me of deleting her contribution and now is being passive aggressive."

I am all for self reflection and striving to be a better self, but in that context, it just feels like minimising the issue employees raised and trying to deflect. "

This last Friday the back of the building caught on fire from the smoker room and come to find out apparently the place didn’t have a fire alert system, so when we showed up to load meats (5am) we saw it AND we had a 10k catering to do. DM and GM decided we had to stay open for the catering and for the entire day, so after the fire department came and wrote a report I was stuck on cleaning out the 2-3 inches of standing water in BOH. 

This water was also just disgusting because I don’t think we’ve ever cycled the sprinklers and the water got into the smokers and in the room where we keep the ash and grease. The water was pitch black and I don’t honestly get how that isn’t a food safety AND STAFF SAFTEY issue but I digress. The water ended up even getting into our walk in which is the main reason I’m confused we were open for the first place. Eventually, I get it all cleaned up (as best as I could) though I found out that there is also cracks in the sealant on the floor and wall in some areas so water was leaking through cracks in the floor and walls throughout the back and specifically into dry storage. We did end up getting the catering out and we had to use our ovens to cook the meat which made it dry asf but we sent it out anyway. 

During all of this (about 11am atp) we are open to customers in general and we get fucking slammed so I’m not allowed to leave and I’m absolutely covered with the water, ash, and grease. I was actually mortified that they kept having me serve customers like that and I couldn’t help but think that their food was just contaminated. Eventually, a dude comes in to reset the sprinklers but he did not check in between each smoker so when he went to turn it back on water just came gushing out again and since that was the only opening, the pipes somehow burst too.  

Once again, I was told to go clean it up and WE STILL DIDNT CLOSE. Water is literally pouring from the smokers atp and BOH floods again and I’m the only one hauling ass trying to keep the water out of dry storage and it ended up completely flooding. I tried my absolute best to get all of the water out and they forced me to stay until it was deemed okay which then made me late for my second job. 0/10 don’t recommend at all. 

I was technically scheduled for two doubles this weekend but I dropped both shifts and handed in my notice today (which was effective immediately because I am not staying another two weeks in this hell). I feel so free now lol.

For context, I’m 26 years old and trying to finish up my bachelors degree, but I need a job. My options are either a gov customer service role with the county tax collector or a service/sales representative for a top 20 bank. They would both be full time, 9-5. I have OCD, general anxiety, and health anxiety. My concerns are getting yelled at, covid exposure, car accident, being overwhelmed etc. 

For the gov, I think I’d be doing things like renewing registration, driver license, tag transfers etc. They are offering $17.50/HR and includes health insurance options, retirement vested after 5 years, PTO, paid holidays etc. the usual local government package. My commute is about 5 minutes, no tolls. 

The bank role would have me doing bank teller duties and more. This branch mainly focuses on businesses and less personal banking. They are offering $21.50/HR, paid holidays, 401k matching, health insurance options, PTO etc. My commute would be about 30 minutes (longer with traffic) and $2 in tolls each day. The thing is sometimes I go on drives anyway for my anxiety. 

Health insurance costs like $90 per check from bank and like $7 from county/DMV so that’s something to take in consideration too. Gov insurance is obviously better overall. My family is telling me that government role is the way to go but I’m looking for some other insights and opinions. Thanks! "

I’m a public worker, so I get a pension when it’s time to retire. I started working for a municipality at 20 years old, was there for 10 years, job got farmed out. Found another gig in a school district doing similar work, was able to roll the pension time over and add on to it. Was there for 9 years, got pushed out by the athletic director after the baseball team lost a home playoff game 11-1. They blamed the loss on home plate being “wet” and since I prepared the field, she got me fired. Long story short, I made a stink about it, got a settlement. I was still in contact with people I worked with at my 1st job, I reached out to them, and they couldn’t wait to hire me back. Now I’m back with municipality that I originally started working for, but this time I’m on the roads/sanitation side of it. Pretty damn stable gig. Got 4 years to go to get the 25 years service time for the pension, after that it’s just trying to pad the value of until 55-60 years old ( when I can retire)

I’ve wanted to quit for a while now; hadn’t worked up the courage to do so yet. Thought that maybe I should still give it a chance, since my managers and coworkers seemed “nice”. 


That was a lie.


Truth is, there’s no difference between this place and any one of the other shitty retail/food service jobs. There’s the same sense of indifference, of being treated like an interchangeable cog in a machine. Doesn’t matter if they act nice or rude or somewhere in between; it’s a façade. Ultimately, none of these people genuinely care about me. And why should they? I’m just a pizza delivery driver, easily replaceable, out of sight and mind. The only real difference that matters is I’m getting paid less here than I would be at McDonalds. I just fooled myself into thinking that this place was somehow “better” than those other places. 


I guess the real issue is that I’m far too open with my thoughts and feelings to other people. If I hadn’t been, then I wouldn’t be as emotionally invested, and thus would’ve been able to leave way sooner, when I should have. I knew the pay wasn’t enough to sustain me, and yet I kept on doing it anyway. 


Well, at least that’s done with now. I don’t have to act like I have an excuse to not start looking for a new place to work. Not that I’m expecting to find anything decent where I’m valued, but at least I’ll be making a few bucks an hour more."

I can't find anything else other than low end starter jobs that a 16 year old can do, and I've been working for nearly 5 years now.

Even when I tried to change jobs I literally ended up in the same position and took a pay cut as well.

Not even a bad worker. I don't go the extra mile but I never had any writeups or even many talks with my boss.

I hear of these stories of people getting raises and offers for better job opportunities but I never had that. I've asked if I could get training move up within my workplace whenever there's an opening and I get told no, or some vague answer, followed by them hiring someone else to do it and going through all the training and costs of intake with them.

I'm starting college this fall and I'll have to go job hunting again because they won't even let me work reduced hours to fit with my school schedule. my wage is so low (just barely above minimum wage) that I don't even know how I'll pay for college except for taking out a loan.

I work in one of the largest hospitals in my state and been here 2 weeks now. Before starting my shift I’d got a small cut on my thumb. Nothing bad but I wanted a Band-Aid just so it wouldn’t open and start bleeding while I’m working. Normally they’d be kept in a First Aid kit, so I asked a coworker where we kept ours. We didn’t have one. Seemed strange so I asked around more and got the same answer. No First Aid. This is in Pathology which has multiple laboratories, offices and machinery for testing. Much of which can be harmful without P.P.E.  

Supposedly the reason for not having any First Aid is that we are in a hospital. If there is a problem you can walk over to the right areas and ask for help there. I just wanted a goddamn Band-Aid! So I left the lab and went over into the next block to see if anyone could help. This was mostly more offices for specialists and doctors who focused on specific areas of health. They didn’t have anything on hand either. So to the next block over I went, and still nothing. Even the nurses wondering around couldn’t help since all their equipment was in different parts of the hospital and was reserved for patients, not staff. 

I had to resort to going to the public pharmacy and buying my own. 

I got back to the lab after 45 minutes and my manager was wondering where I was. I told him the situation and he didn’t understand. He said we at least had some Band-Aids in a back cabinet. He walked me over, it was padlocked off for some reason. Inside was a mess of stationary and nothing else.

You provide them with work, and they pay you for your time. That is all.

Yes, they have a lot of say about that you need to do as part of your work. You don't follow their instructions because they are your betters, you follow them because they pay you. Once they don't pay you, or their crap isn't worth the money, you don't need to do a thing for them. You are EQUALS.

You are not a slave. You can refuse illegal instructions, work outside of your key areas, and anything while you're off the clock. If they start shouting at you or abusing you, you can tell them to keep their voice down. You have the backing of employment laws.

Sure, going against those instructions might result in the loss of a job and thus income, but that's all. They also have to get that through their own management, and if they're asking for something illegal, they won't always get the backing. Many awful managers bluster and threaten, but they can't back it up.

If you decide to resign, *you* are ending the arrangement. They can't make you stay longer because it is inconvenient or you to leave. They can't stop you walking out right away. Are their things the business can do? Yes. If you've broken the law they might do something, or might not. Can they try to bully/persuade you? Yes. Do you have to listen at all? No. NO. Get that resignation is writing though. When the date is up, leave. If they abuse you, leave earlier.

I see this a bit on the sub- someone is trying to leave and is fearful of the response, and wondering if they can be made to stay. They cannot make you. Be confident in your decision.

They will survive. Or they won't, it's literally not your problem any more. Their job is to make sure everything runs smoothly, key employees stay, and they can handle loss of an employee to resignation and sickness. It's their JOB, and their problem, not yours.

They can't blacklist you from the industry- they are not that influential, no matter what they claim. Someone, somewhere needs the work, and doesn't give a damn about them. Maybe they even compete directly.

They can talk crap to prospective new jobs- but there are legal actions you can take, and everyone has had a bad manager once, many HR people will ignore this.

Be confident in your decision. Once you've decided to move on, then move on. You're moving on to somewhere better, and their situation is no longer your problem."

I’ve applied to dozens of entry level jobs and yet somehow I’m never enough. Applying for disability was never a consideration of mine, but it may very well be my only option in the near future. my parents don’t deserve to look after a useless child for the rest of their lives.

No one can earn enough to make it work.,u/Balgrin,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b633gj/being_a_working_parent_makes_absolutely_no_sense/,antiwork,"I'm a new dad in the USA, and in the first year of my child's life I went through 3 jobs. Before my child I had ambitions and ideas for my career, but once they were here all that went away. I don't care about *anything* other than being a parent now, and I can't hold down a job as a result.

But it is **work**. It's phyiscal and emotional work being a parent. I am exhausted at the end of the day. And yet I **love** it. It's the only rewarding job I've had. I honestly think I'm **good** at it. It might be the only thing I'm good at. I put a lot of effort into my parenting and it shows. 

But I cannot continue to avoid work forever even though I'm *busy*. 

Like just think through the economics of daycare: for every hour I work, I have to pay someone else to be looking after my child. So I am paying for the priviledge of working in order to take-home considerably less money. But not only that - that means the daycare themselves cannot charge more than the median hourly rate in their area, or parents would *lose* money working. **And that** means everyone in daycare has to pay less than the going rate for their employees. [This is a real problem](https://www.npr.org/2023/02/02/1153931108/day-care-market-expensive-child-care-waitlists) Daycares can't charge what they need to stay open and pay their staff fairly, so they're going out of business which means there is a shortage of daycare, and therefore fewer working parents.

I was rejected for unemployment benefits. Not sure how I am suppose to be **more** unemployed, but the money would have been enough for me right now. I want UBI *so badly* because I don't need much, I'm just *busy* raising a whole new human being. 

Why can't that be enough? Capitalism needs new workers right? Politicians needs new voters right? Someone has to be replenishing the population. This makes absolutely no sense. You have to make a ridiculous amount of money to be a working parent, but you're too busy parenting to do that. The system is literally falling apart."

So I’m looking for a bit of advice/just need to rant. I’ve struggled with mental health issues my entire life (ADHD, depression, PTSD, OCD) and I’ve always worked with people who have been really understanding of my limitations. I just started a new job with an NGO and so far it’s not been great.  My supervisor had not been accommodating or understanding at all, it doesn’t help that they are never physically in our office and that while my coworkers are great, they aren’t very understanding either. My MH is debilitating to the point where there are days I can’t go into work and I have tried explaining this to my supervisor but he basically was just like lol contact HR but you need to come in. I’m working with my therapist for accommodation requests so im hopeful. All of this to say I found out I was pregnant on Friday and I can’t take any time off and I don’t have any sick days available yet so I really don’t know what im going to do when I need time to rest after the abortion. I’ve never been in a position (luckily) where my work environment has cared so little about my wellbeing. "

They are for the most part extremely racist. If not outwardly, then inwardly. Usually when a patient has dementia it seems to be more apparent.

I work at an Assisted Living Facility in Washington State where there are a decent amount of residents with dementia. It’s not  unheard of for a resident to accuse a staff member of abusing them.

Anyway, my co worker, who is a black male, was accused by one of the residents of rape. This was in the memory care ward, where residents typically have severe dementia. My co worker went to management immediately to report it.

Management then decided to take him off the schedule (not sure how long, a week at least) to conduct an investigation, I’m assuming. Co worker said “This is okay, as long as I will be paid during this time.” Management then swiftly added him back on to the schedule after that, which obviously suggests they had no intention of paying him.

Fast forward two weeks, we had an Agency worker come in and fill a gap. Young black male, was accused by a dementia patient of punching. He was escorted off the property by management, was what I heard. I don’t know the details.

Considering what happened with the first co worker I mentioned, I’d be shocked if the second one was compensated. Clearly my company was not planning on paying the first one I told you about.

I don’t know what to do about this, it’s obviously wrong but I don’t know if it’s illegal. Suggestions would be great. "

I have been working at my firm without issues between me and my coworkers for half a year now, but I have noticed that my depressive symptoms have started to worsen during my time there.

Most of the time I would rather be sleeping. Even on the weekends, I feel especially drained from the work week and often I am not productive enough to even spend energy on my hobbies. 

Anyways, my job hasn't been stressful at all in the past few weeks, yet I still feel like I could use another vacation from all of it. Am I just bored of walking into the office?

Then it clicked.  I really just want to wfh.  If I could just log in, do my job, and log out?  FUCK I'd freakin love my job, and I wouldn't ever care about missing out on promotions.

Things like not valuing applications staff because you're an ""infrastructure person"".  I write reports, make application upgrades, and make peoples jobs easier.  I work with department heads around the organization.   Everybody appreciates me EXCEPT my upper leadership.

Things like my CIO telling our Canadian vendors how all BLM protesters are violent and order bricks to their protest sites to initiate violence and looting.

Or the fucking endless long ass stories that he wants to tell everyone to show how incredible he is.  Meanwhile he bullies and belittle others.

Or my last job where the director would cuss out people for the smallest of mistakes.

About 8 years ago now, I started a job that I really enjoyed. After nearly 3 years of standard 3% raises and glowing reviews, I had a talk with my boss and boss's boss at the same time.

I provided 4 options, 3 of which would result in retaining me as an employee:

1) Give me a 30% raise, based on the fact that my job used to be the job of 2 people before I automated over 1 full job away and took on additional responsibilities without an increase in pay,

2) Promote me to manager of a department I was more than qualified to run (whose manager had recently retired) and then backfill me with someone junior, 

3) Allow me to work at the company doing a split of my normal duties and do company-owned research to support me getting my PhD,

4) I would seek work elsewhere.

I was told that no one working ""only"" 45-50 hours per week deserved the amount of money I was looking for (my boss loved to refer to the ""Invisible Hand of Mr. Market"") and was rejected for both the promotion and the PhD research funding.

One month later, I asked for another meeting and included HR. At that meeting, I reviewed the notes our last meeting, and for everyone to agree that's what had been discussed. I then handed them the offer letter showing that I had been offered the 30% raise and was capped at 40 hours per week without prior authorization because the position I moved into had a mandatory overtime stipulation even for exempt employees (we called it ""time and fries"" because it wasn't time and a half, but it was time + an hourly premium). 

I told them I would not be entertaining any counteroffers, as their opportunity to retain me expired when they rejected me. The HR person asked me to reconsider, and I said ""I shouldn't have to go out and get a competing offer letter every time I want a decent raise. I should be compensated based on contribution and given raises based on merit. If I have to threaten to quit every time I want to be fairly compensated, I may as well just take the competitive offer and save myself the stress."".

Then I looked at my boss and said ""I guess you were wrong about what Mr. Market thought about the value of my time"" and asked if there were any questions before we concluded the meeting. After about 15 seconds of stunned silence, I left the room.

My boss made no attempt to speak to me again until 2.5 weeks later when he asked me what my transition plan was for my work. I told him I had been awaiting his transition plan for my work, and had no intention of cramming weeks of work into my final 3 days. I sent an email to HR saying I wasn't feeling well, and was ""sick"" my final 3 working days, then cashed out my vacation. Oh, and my final day was the first of the month so hooray for a free month of insurance benefits.

Bad managers really end up going full on sour grapes when their best employees leave."

Filling out job applications that's available. I hear it all the time…you can make more by switching jobs because of previous experience. But at times I think about it. Any job I might get may not help me when it comes to living expenses (obviously).

But when it comes to temp for hire jobs. They're not worth the uncertainty. And I despise temp services. I know one coworker who is younger than me who hasn't been hired yet. And worked jn the warehouse for a year. 

I don't trust the supervisor. He literally hired on someone who came after me. Not mad at the person who got hired on. It's the blatant work that I am doing that makes me realize that I'm just being a cog for this route running.  

I'm not a robot. But the company itself is a drag when you can't even make small talk while working. But in hindsight. The main assembly line gets to talk and be on their phones when things get slow. But as for us in the back department where the work gets prepared for the main assembly. We get harsh lectures. And probable termination. It's not we are walking and looking at our phones. When things get slow. We would already clean up and throw away the trash and so forth. But when we're down it's the whole ""stay productive."" Even though the floor was already cleaned, twice. Equipment placed back to where they came. And main line doesn't have any material to repack.

I was told this company wasn't like this way back before I ever got here. But I'm making my exit like I always do. Just to see what happens up until April."

People shouldn't be feeling guilty or afraid if they need a sick day or mental health day (both of which are valid, we aren't machines who never need a break or rest). Employers can fire people because they ""don't fit"" into the team and socialize enough. They can fire people for having disabilities or mental struggles, they can just deny that's the reason. 

However, employees must give at least two weeks' notice before quitting and adhere to certain protocols or else they might get a bad reference for future jobs. 

Isn't that just ruling with fear, bias, and no accountability? Sounds like tyrant rules to me. Step out of line or just breathe funny and they can end you whenever they want. "

I already know I'm underpaid based on what some of my colleagues make and based on what another pharma manufacturer in the area is offering at the low end of their range for almost exactly the same role.

My manager knows I am deeply unhappy with this, but she doesn't control our pay - corporate does. Who do I complain to? What do I bring to them? I'm not worried that if I complain they will let me go because we are already down one person in our 6-person department, and we're about to lose one more.

Big fan here tbh and been everything from a sandwich artist to an investment banker.

I now run a large company (more than just all 50 states and Europe).

Okay, so let me start with some basics. I only pay livable wages. Everyone gets insurance any a bonus. There is no PTO to accrue, you also are paid it if you depart. Simple point: the law makes you all fired “at will” and PTO can be kept and it’s wrong.

Wages are 60-200k with a roughly 10-30% bonus 2 days before Christmas. Part time I do the equal amount for their time spent. If you can propose something more fair, I’m open. 

My point now about the government. I want to buy something in the EU and pay these people better (EU nations make very little and taxed heavy) and literally have to hire elite law firms and restructure a waterfall (fancy term) to do this.

Why? Why can’t I just pay them more? Why should America tax their labor too or even attempt it.

Next I wanted to implement more contractors to w2 in my early days because health insurance is important and we (your company) pay part of your tax through withholdings. It’s the best that can be done. Sadly, this was my 50th hire and the law requires HR and a form 1095. They were sick and it took me months to help them and they probably hate me for it. I spent my weekends learning how to do this.


Now I send pretty high bonus this Christmas for FY2023  and people end up with like 12k…. Why take the other half from them? Their labor hours are taxed and the spending is healthy for the economy.



I can use a million examples. I care for all my people and respect everyone. Most have remained since day one, but it seems many of you have bad bosses and I don’t know how to fix that. 

Equally, I think that the government takes so much from you all and doesn’t even give health or solid public travel. 


I also submit estimated tax payments quarterly. Property taxes to county assessor.
Consultants. 


I’ve flown 3 time zones in a row to make sure everyone was paid when our system went down. Hand written checks and asking them what they need. 


Please provide input of what more I can do? 
I strive to be a good and equal leader. 

FYI: it cost millions to pay people, literally. It’s the largest expense of SG&A "

How do I respond?,u/lawfullytired,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b6ei05/i_got_a_complaint_at_work_for_working_too_much/,antiwork,"I am a pharmacy tech working part time while in college. The pay is decent, the people are fine, and it's really close to campus so for someone like me with no car it's ideal. I am disabled, something I marked down when I first applied. I need a bit more assistance with things than others since I am autistic, and as of late it's been a huge struggle in the workplace. My friend applied at the start of this semester (I worked the semester before that) also due to the proximity, and it's been a big comfort having him there. I had started to learn new things that required less social interaction such as filling prescriptions or typing out the scripts, which was great. But after like a day or two of learning, I was all of a sudden CONSTANTLY put on the front register. Even though people who got hired after me were filling and typing consistently. It was just me.

&#x200B;

It was so overwhelming with my autism that every time I walked into work (I work every day on top of my academic work, which I am falling behind in as I'm a CS major and it takes a lot of time) I would just start crying. As soon as I saw my name was written next to register, I started crying instantly. My best friend urged me to tell SOMEONE because this was unsustainable, which I did. My boss said she can't explicitly make it so I don't work register but can reduce it, which was fine. Here's where the issues come up.

&#x200B;

My best friend and I are roommates. We coordinate our schedules around each other for a bunch of reasons I won't get into, but a big reason is because he is one of a few people that is able to help me out if I were to have a meltdown or another issue in public. He's like a neutralizing force if you will. But aside from that, we are on the boards of the same clubs and stuff, so our schedules just kind of naturally synced up. The way I have been working was Monday PM (without my friend), Tuesday AM (without friend), Wednesday PM (with friend), Thursday am (without), Friday PM (with), Sat/Sun AM (with). I worked three days without him and 4 with him.

As of late, our schedules have gotten more inconvenient. Our ""PM"" shifts are really afternoon shifts, right after class, and it sucks because we (especially me since I am falling behind in class) should be going to our professor's office hours but since we work until 5pm we can't. I asked my boss recently if we could shift our shifts together to 5-10pm instead, and she seemed down with it. The only other change was that I asked if I could be off one day a week to meet with my advisor and make sure I am on track. Because working every day is really taking a toll on me. She said that's fine and to just write it down.

&#x200B;

I reached back out this week because I wasn't sure if we were supposed to come in at the times we usually did or later in the evenings, and her response was a lot different. She said she couldn't exclusively schedule us both together (which was weird because we wouldn't be- I still work Tuesday and Thursday alone and he works later than me on weekends). She also said she had received complaints that we weren't as efficient when we work together and that it would help better to separate us so we can learn more. 

&#x200B;

I'm not sure what to say to this. Our schedules are so lined up that now I am worried that I (or him) are scheduled shifts that doesn't work with our class stuff. I already work too much as is to the point I don't have enough time to do my homework but I worry this will just make it worse. And the fact that I am getting complaints about this stresses me out because I have done nothing but tried to be a nice and helpful person. Also the fact that without him there I am more prone to having a panic attack from getting yelled at by customers all day. I'm just tired. I don't know what to respond to this text message with. Does anyone have any idea?"

I like my job, but it feels like every month my bosses give me a new “rule” and they just keep getting crazier. 

**1. “You can’t have your phone at work.”** 

Okay, I understand. Easy fix. I can be a bit of a phone addict anyway. I need some discipline. The phone can stay in my locker when I am on the sales floor. Plus, I don’t want someone to steal it.

No problem, boss.

**2. “You can’t take time to check your schedule at work, that has to be done at home.”**

This followed the phone rule as we see our schedule on our phones

Sure, it’s a little weird, but fine. I know my schedule anyway. I don’t need to use my phone at work to check it. 

**3. “No personal items at work.”**

I understand the philosophy when it came to a smart-phone, but it’s not like I am bringing an X-Box gaming system into the office every day. 

Sir, this my water bottle, and my emergency inhaler! Can we calm down please!?

**3. “You can’t clock in until your name tag and apron are on.”**

Really? My nametag and apron are in my work locker which is at work!

It takes me less than ten minutes to toss on the apron and nametag. If I can’t bring personal items to work, then why should I be forced to bring work items home? 

**4. “You can’t use the bathroom at work, unless its during your break.”**

This is pushing my limits. Sometimes a lady needs to pee. I’m not going to get a kidney stone for a multi-billion-dollar company!

**5. “You can’t be talking with your co-workers; you have to be helping customers.”**

Jesus Christ. No customers need help right now. The store is empty!

Also, did it ever occur to the boss that we might be helping customers by talking to *each other!?* 

**6. “We can’t have you sitting down.”**

Dear Ebenezer Scrooge, I just dragged in twenty shopping carts in two feet of deep snow. Let me rest my aching legs for a moment.

**7. “You must work weekends.”** 

Just because I said that I *can* work weekends does not mean I can work *every* weekend. 

**8. “You work when we say you work!”**

Sir, my brother’s wedding has been planned for two years, my Sunday shift at Home-depot has been planned for two weeks.

I asked for this day off months ago.  I’m sure that the company will survive one day without me.  

**9. “That haircut is not professional, change it.”**

It’s *my* hair. It’s going to look like this some days. Unless I cut off my head, it’s not going to change.

10. “**Water is for customers only.”** 

Well, how about the air? Is that free? Or do I need to get my purse? 

**11. “No heart attacks at work.”**

Would it be more convenient if I died off the clock "
94,2024-03-04,Told that free labor was the only way to score high on my review. ,u/blandmayo,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b6ibux/told_that_free_labor_was_the_only_way_to_score/,antiwork,"Yearly review season is upon us. I had mine last week. In general I like my job, work from home, it’s flexible and I’m not micro managed. 

But this years review cycle is a mess. My boss and I discussed what my strong points and successes were before the review cycle began so I was more or less coached on getting a good review. However, my job doesn’t really have trackable metrics. So that leaves review competencies and goals lacking. I took on more work this year to help the team and gain some visibility from higher ups. But I’m also a work your wage mindset person. It’s a fun combination I know. 

Back to the review. The competencies are graded on a scale 1-5. The competency in question was simply listed as “integrity”. My boss was told that she could only rate employees as a 3 or below for this section. Which keeps everyone’s overall average lower, thus less raises. My boss was told by the VP that the only way that someone could get a 5 under the integrity competency was to volunteer hours to help under served  local communities. That’s the example he gave. So the only way to be exceptional is to work for free. I told my boss to relay back to him that that was bullshit and an unacceptable expectation. I also told her that this does not incentivize works in the least. 

Not looking for advice. Just a rant. "

Here’s the kicker, I decided to relocate to a different state, and I didn’t tell anyone as I didn’t want anything to jeopardize the move. Fast forward to today, I told my boss that I moved. He’s a super cool guy and I felt bad that I dropped this bomb on him, but at the end of the day I have to do what’s best for me (at least that’s what I’m telling myself). My boss didn’t seem mad, just disappointed and I feel really bad about that. 

Did I handle this the right way by not saying anything until after I was done with the move? I really wanted to just say nothing, but with buying a house I had to change the address with my company for the purpose of taxes.

Our role is very routine we do the same thing every week and it's really easy to plan months in advance, but she doesn't. We are constantly chasing her to sign things off at the end of the week that can take until 9pm to get a hold of her and the entire time she chats about her days out at the beach etc.

Now things weren't too bad before because largely we had a lot of autonomy, but recently when she does show up she's been very critical of the decision I take, and she has started going to meeting to discuss why they're wrong, I believe the meeting are a way for her to avoid work.

I could go to senior management, but they all think she's a maverick and an outside the box thinker. I love my job and I love where I work but this woman makes me want to scream."

It’s a little tough to unlearn this personally as my mom was an immigrant single mother that pretty much only survived through her workaholic nature. I used to view this as a great strength that I wanted to emulate especially bc it’s made me hardworking and focused on solving problems - something I know employers love. 

However I’ve struggled w my mental health due to a lack of mental barriers surrounding work-related issues. I take on responsibility too intensely out of fear that I’m letting down my family and co-workers and I’ll never be able to escape poverty.  There are a lot of layers I won’t go into but I had to go on medical leave and I found a simple clerical job to focus on recovery. I’m seeking treatment and working on building self care routines to address my health. 

I’m a bit of an over thinker so I feel the need to address the things that ideologically led me to burnout. I want to explore other passions but I don’t know how to be chill and healthy about it I guess lol. 

If you’ve abandoned careerism, what drives you forward instead? 

I’m sure most people would say family but I don’t have children and my siblings are heavily focused on their careers. I care about local community as well but I’m burnt out from an education career so I need a little break from service-oriented passions."

Things like ""sick-outs,"" mass anonymous emails, etc. 

Longer story:

I work at a nonprofit based out of a US university. This nonprofit is run by a megalomaniac who is surrounded by yes men. The nonprofit is primarily funded by the state (we're talking millions of dollars.) It also has the same issues as every other place on this sub: employees are dramatically overworked, we're chronically understaffed, falling short of every equity/equality standard, cruel/out-of-touch leadership, etc. 

In January, they fired a beloved director (director of my dept) for pushing DEI and pay equity. Today, they fired our beloved senior managers for protesting that director firing and reaffirming the need for DEI initiatives. The given reason was ""organizational restructuring.""

Our department has maybe 15 permanent workers. We secure and are responsible for the majority of the nonprofit's funding. We are all PISSED and have been for a while. A solid 80% of our department has met several times outside of work to discuss these problems and our desire for change. The university has a union, but the nonprofit in question does not. The university union would represent us in theory, but has not replied to any emails we've sent asking for aid (and we've sent a lot). Around 10 of us are meeting after work to discuss this.

Do folks have any ideas for collective dissent, smaller-scale unionization, and plausibly deniable actions we can take to protest this? I floated the idea of a mass sick-out (where everyone calls in sick on the same day), but I would greatly appreciate some additional ideas for protest/action here."

I was promised reprieve from a very demanding job I had prior to accepting this position, and was assured that my work life balance would improve.

Now, I feel like I am being punished for my competence- my workload is nearly three times as much as my coworkers’.

I inherited a massive disaster of a project that has been botched and neglected over several years (was not even listed in the job description) and my manager has insinuated that if it is not totally finished by a certain time which is approaching soon, that it will be on my shoulders. Everyone my manager has hired that has been responsible for this project has quit within literally 6 months. I’m still a new employee and this feels incredibly unfair. I am doing my absolute best with this project and will continue to do so but to say I inherited a nightmare is an understatement. This on top of the time wasting red-tape involved with working for the government is making this goal pretty unrealistic.

I know my manager will take the credit if I succeed, but will place the blame on me if I fall short. I am taking on duties that are far beyond my current skill level considering I am still new. This has been communicated to my manager and the response has mainly been “I wouldn’t ask you to do it if I didn’t think you could get it done.” My manager is pretty absent/lazy and I am effectively the proxy manager at only five months tenure due to their lack of attendance remotely or otherwise.

This brings me to the decision I might have to make if I face blowback when the time comes. If I am chastised for not meeting expectations on this, my brain is telling me that I should part ways. I’m not married to this job by any means, it’s about as disorganized as anyone can expect from a government office.

Food security: gardens, neighborhood bulk food buy, and worker cooperatives.

One of the managers stole from me, got reported, nothing happened, and now she retaliation against me through the schedules and never helping me when I need swipes to help customers. Today, my bad manager shut the office door in my face quick, so she can tell the new GM to help me. She had a surprise party in my section and when the host asked “what about op,” she said she didn’t give a fuck. She got a customer more angry at me. Then when I quit and finish my tables and went to do my checkout, the safe wasn’t working again. She tried to say while I gave it to the GM to count, “We can’t take that, let me fix the safe and check it”. I said “no, I quit I’m not waiting anymore for you to fix a problem that’s on your time”. I told the GM please count the money because I’m leaving NOW. My bad manager said to the GM, “she’s not the boss of you, you can reject the money.” The hell??? This woman is twice my age acting like this. All the good workers are quitting or quit already. My final straw today was the kitchen cook talking shit to me for no reason and without a manager intervening.

In my employment contract, we agreed I would get “four half sick days” meaning 16 hours. Well recently I asked to have my hours reduced to 20h a week. We came to an agreement on what hours I would work and what days. That was done in text and in person. I started this new schedule at the end of January.

Well last week I got COVID, so I didn’t go in. This was fine, until I emailed my boss regarded using my sick days. Here is her response: “For the sick days, I need to figure out how to handle this as I haven't updated your contract to reflect your change to part-time and if I did pay it out you would have already used almost all of your sick days for 2024 by March 1st.  Let me get back to you shortly, we will of course pay out some in sick days, I just don't know that it will be 16 hours worth. “

So she gets to update the contract without consulting me? I didn’t agree to a reduction in sick days, I don’t have many as it is. How is that fair or legal? What should I do or say?

For some backstory, I have POTS & CFS, informally diagnosed in October last year, when I started struggling at work I talked to the GM about it, nothing important just respected her and wanted her to be informed. 
In December I asked my team lead about WFH, he talked to the GM who denied without talking to me. In early Jan, I again brought it up, and my other manager unprompted tried to convince the GM again, who again denied.

At this point I figured I'd stick it out until I could get my actual diagnosis and get a doctor's note to hopefully use ADA. So Tuesday I had my TTT, and got my diagnosis. I took vacation day for the test, and had to take another sick day on Wed. 

I came in Thursday and got sent home suspension for absences. I wrote in the comments of my write up that this is wrong, and I consider it medical discrimination. So HR calls me and basically tells me to get FMLA. So today I got my FMLA papers and told the HR mgr ""it shouldn't have gotten to this point, I talked to the GM and both my managers about this multiple times. I should've gotten FMLA sooner."" 

I also asked again about WFH and she said they won't budge for that, even if I have a doctor's note. 
If I get a doctor's note they will more than likely violate ADA. Ireally want to get that in writing. This company has the ability to WFH, people have in the past and currently do on rare occasions, they are more than 50 employees. I believe this falls in reasonable accommodations.

Now idk how worth it this would be to fight for, that's why for now I'm planning on only FMLA. 

TLDR; my chronic illness got me written up, the GM never told HR about my illness. and they blatantly refuse WFH."
13,2024-03-04,My dumb mistake on an exit interview,u/HighSpur,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b6onrx/my_dumb_mistake_on_an_exit_interview/,antiwork,"Was assuming it was confidential. 

I now know that this is more or less common knowledge that you should assume it will be shared with everyone in the company, but it was my first ever exit interview. 

At my most recent position, (from which I was laid off due to a reduction in force) I had the most poorly behaved manager I’ve ever had. He would have temper tantrums for no reason, would degrade me over nothing, and he called me the “weirdest person he’d ever met” in a very angry yell because I accidentally showed up an hour early to an event.

He also fired someone within a week of hiring them because they tidied up their newly assigned messy office without being asked, and he went into a yelling fit heard ‘round the whole building. 

During my exit interview, the HR manager repeatedly asked me if I felt I was mistreated by him. I tried to deflect the question and focus on the positive. Then she said there of reports of him having a temper and had I experienced anything like that. So I told her yes, I have experienced his temper but I assume he’s working on it. Then the interview ended.

15 minutes after hanging up the phone I received a hateful and very whiny text from him telling me I have ruined his life and career by “telling on him” in the exit interview. But he’s still there, 4 months later, because he goes to the same church as the CEO.

I suspect he is sabotaging my job interviews by saying made up bad things about me to potential employers who call to confirm my employment there.

So moral of the story, keep your mouth shut during exit interviews."

542,2024-03-04,My supervisor got fired today and they were a CRUCIAL part of our team.,u/PlatnissEverdeen,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b6p28f/my_supervisor_got_fired_today_and_they_were_a/,antiwork,"My supervisor was LOVED by EVERYONE in our department. She showed me proof that she took 2 DAYS off because she went to the doctor to get seen and brought back a doctors note. She took those 2 days off over 1 year ago. Yet, as of TODAY, the GM is complaining that her attendance is really bad???? Bro I can't anymore. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For reference, we are very understaffed. We should have at LEAST 14 people in our area, and tomorrow when I go in, there will only be 5 of us. And our GM says ""we are overstaffed"" EXCUSE ME??? She is corrupt.

This is the absolute worst company i've ever worked for period. I am almost convinced that nowhere I go is as bad as this place. It's literally a sweatshop, except it's all adults and no children or anyone under 21. We are so understaffed I we couldn't even finish all of our work yesterday, and now we just lost our supervisor (for NO REASON) , and we're about to possibly lose ANOTHER co-worker. And, our lead, once he finds out that our supervisor got laid off, may very well quit. So that's 3 people gone. We have been on a hiring freeze and none of us know why. Minus the freeze, the conditions have been like this since I started 6 months ago in August. And it's only been getting increasingly worse. Long hours, overtime, not that great of pay, etc. There hasn't been any heat or air conditioning in 5 years, and in the back of the building for 7 years. 5 YEARS? 7 YEARS?? You're telling me it takes someone half a DECADE to fix some air conditioning? I literally am speechless at this point. I don't even know what to say anymore.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The type of work I do...... I can't ""slack off"" or ""quiet quit"" in any capacity. I can't ""half-do"" my work. I either HAVE to get the work done, like fully, or work overtime, however long it takes, until the work is done. If that means I have to work a 14-16 hour work day every single day, then that's what they expect. But at the same time, they've started telling us ""you can't work past your schedule, so no overtime"" Okay. FINE. Please explain to me how I am supposed to get all my work done in 8 hours when it's taking me upwards of 12+ because we are so shorthanded??? Without going into much detail, I deal with flights and airport stuff. I make sure people on planes have their drinks, liqour, snacks, etc. So people depend on it. Which means if I don't do my work for 1 DAY, then the entire company will start complaining, and then probably end up shutting down. Each task takes around 1 hour to complete. I typically have 6-8 tasks each day. But since I have no help in other areas, I have to step in and do all the ""extra"" work that I wouldn't have to do if we had more people. So that adds at least 2:30 hours more to my 8 hour shift. But, they don't want us working past 2:30? I start work at 6:00. We have a couple breaks, and lunch. So by 2:30 is around 8 hours give or take of ""working"". I've literally left at 6pm before because of this stuff. WHO wants to work from 6-6?????? NOBODY. I am so tired of this. I might just quit soon honestly.

TLDR: Supervisor gets fired for no reason, (budget cuts they said)

whole team is suffering because of it, as we are ALREADY shortstaffed

long hours, little pay, overtime, 14+ hour days. ""Sweatshop."" Basically a work rant"

When I approached the managers to talk about this, they were not kind to say the least, saying things like “Well, you’re only available 4 days out of the week, so…” and changing the subject “well we tried to call you all of last week.” No. I received one phone call and I returned it and was told to wait for a follow up call to schedule my orientation. I don’t get it. I literally emphasized the fact that I’m in school and am choosing not to work as much as the other students in my classes so that I can do as well as I possibly can in the program.

Here's what I mean...  
Personally I use [Skool](https://www.skool.com/refer?ref=7459ca5b676745829b8f31f84f352d3c) as my go to community platform. For example if you run a Done With You social media marketing agency for real estate agents, you could create a community for real estate marketing for $99/month  
Here you can give your community full of warm leads, useful content, weekly group calls and they also get access to each other / networking opportunities.  
Here's where you upsell them into your service after building trust, the cool thing is when you take sales calls if your higher ticket service doesn't convert you can likely lock in $99/month for the DIY community.  
The content inside is basically a way for them to learn to do it themself instead of paying more to do it with you, very scalable as theres little service delivery!  
A personal trainer could use this to give all there training guides and tips for eg $49/month, they can now upsell members into 1 on 1 or down-sell 1 on 1 members into a $49/month100 members at $49/month would bring in an extra 4.9k MRR (Monthly Reoccurring Revenue) which is on semi autopilot too.  
Skool is the best all in one platform on the market right now in my opinion. I made my Info Product community in November 2023 and in the last few months have scaled to 900+ members, the bulk of it has been organic on Skool, I don't have a big personal brand or big social medias!  
Community discussion, content, live group calls, & a gamification system all in one for $99/month is a super reasonable set up I've found  
If you want to become a community leader, i've got you with a 14 day free Skool trial link here: [https://www.skool.com/refer?ref=7459ca5b676745829b8f31f84f352d3c](https://www.skool.com/refer?ref=7459ca5b676745829b8f31f84f352d3c)

- how do I avoid my boss being a jerk? Is there a trick to getting them to stop being asinine I don't know about?

- how do unions work, and is it worth joining one? Am I hurting my coworkers if I don't? 

- if the union wants me to strike, can they legally send me to if I have school/homework because I'm under 18?

- how much are union dues? In the case of BicScronalds, is it worth bothering given fees? 

- What happens if you don't/cant show up to a strike/meeting? I see this being possibly problematic, given the wonky way my schedule works. 

- What benefits does a union have *actually*. Like no legalese, try to explain it in a way a 5 year old could grasp.

- Do unions impact taxes?

The last couple have been pretty decent and I got promoted to years ago. With my degree, I knew I was underpaid, but I managed to rack up a good amount of OT and had some decent work friends, so all was well. 

There’s an understanding that after your first year and a half you’d get a seniority promotion from Tech 1 to Tech 2. I didn’t get one and I kept getting pushback that I had room to grow in certain areas despite being in the top five people for efficiency and chair of an employee committee. 

We got a new regional manager and a few time tracking system. With so many of us remote, senior management naturally felt the need to micromanage everyone. So now, when we go to bathroom or get coffee, we have to be in a certain workflow or get a “coaching” for having not enough time in workflow. 

After this new regional manager and rollout, I got my annual review. I was expecting Exceeds Expectations in one or two areas, but got Meets in everything and only narrowly hit the deadline for a bonus. When I asked my boss what happened, they responded that because I was not working “typical tasks” (I had been singled out with a few others to work a selected number of recurring errors that were costing us a lot of money) that the regional manager felt it wouldn’t be fair to give me and my coworkers high grades because we were doing different work. 

I was seething. At that moment, I knew it was time to find a different job. Fuck that. 

Since my meeting, we had a regional meeting with the regional director leading. This is what they said: 

“Nearly everybody here has said they feel underpaid and overworked but that’s no excuse to not go above and beyond every day.”

Fuck that. I have two interviews currently lined up and I’m going to act my wage all the way to the end. Congratulations on killing the drive of half a dozen high performers with a combined 80 years experience, dipshits"

I work at a big box store as a stocker. A coworker and I were stocking items and struggling to find locations of a couple of items. Our store’s manager (so my boss’ boss’ boss) took a picture of us from behind and sent it in a group chat with a bunch of managers asking what we were doing. My boss’ boss messaged my boss with the photo and asked what we were doing.

My boss showed me the messages and asked what we were up to. I told him and also let him know I found it really strange that he would take a picture of me rather than just come talk to us. I asked if I could get a screenshot of the message because I plan on talking with HR if not the store manager and asking if this is really how they treat employees here. I know it’s not illegal but it feels so fucking demoralizing.

I feel like a good employee, especially compared to a lot of others I work with. I feel like this job continually makes me feel less than and every manager acts like it’s their personal job to let you know how shitty and replaceable you are.

Anyone have a similar experience? What did you do? I want to quit this job so bad but I need money and every application I’ve been putting out has resulted in zero responses. I only got this job through a friend. I hate it here."

Original post is linked at top of first update.

So, I've decided to take the severance and leave. My job that I loved is already gone anyway. 

I went to the office today and spent the whole day waiting for them to call me upstairs to hear their response to my very very simple requests for the new role. Requests that were not just for my falufillment, but for the sake of the organization and the people we serve. 

They said no. To everything. Couldn't even meet me in the middle on any of it, not even the parts that were strictly and only to benefit the org.

They don't respect me. They don't respect any of us there. 

All three of us who have been ""reshuffled"" (aka demoted), the three most hardworking and dedicated people at that entire organization, are all leaving.

And I hope they feel it. I hope they know, when they fail, that they could have listened. They could have made better choices. 

Good riddance. The sadness will fade, the grief will part, and I'll be better off not going down with the ship. 

I just hope they don't ruin too many lives on the way down."

My new job called me in because it’s a 8-5 and I came in around 8:30, did a short lunch and left at 5. That’s usually what I do. But they have a huge issue with it. I asked, “how do you feel my work is doing?” And they said “great, no issues” and I said “so why does it matter? I am adjusting to having to get up early and commute.

It's not as impactful to me as it is some. Mostly I just kind of keep to myself more than my coworkers.   


Well, last week we had a team meeting and they asked if we had any good news. I informed them that I'd caught up on a project that we've had lagging since November and that I was feeling more put together without the weight of this hellish, poorly project-managed job on my shoulders. Her response? ""Oh, did they finally refill your ADHD meds or is it the autism thing?""  


I think she realized what she said immediately after because she tried walking it back because she was like, ""Oh, I didn't mean anything by that. I have ADHD too."" (A claim that she likely would have made before were it true, perhaps when I told them of my focus concerns.   


It didn't change the fact that my whole team learned something that no one should have any right to know without my consent.   


I feel like an alien in my own office now and like I'm being either coddled or looked at funny because of my mental state. It has definitely led to a very uncomfortable work environment.

I apologize if this isn't the right sub to post this in but I really wanted to get this off my chest in a place where others might be able to empathize. I have a coworker (we'll call him John) who started about a year and a half before me and has onboarded pretty much everyone on our team. Despite onboarding everyone, it wasn't until last year that he received a promotion as team coordinator (our boss is one step above him as team lead), a role he carved out for himself after making the case that he plays a leadership role in our team to a certain extent and should rightfully be compensated as such.

I'm a pretty closed off guy. When I first started, I was pretty standoffish to the people in my team. I would always eat lunch by myself and keep to myself from 9-5. As I was being onboarded by John, however, I began to open up more. He was a pretty funny guy who loved to tell ridiculous stories, but he was really down to earth. Imagine someone with a fratty demeanor minus all the negatives of a frat boy. That's how he was. He was a facilitator of conversations among our team and is a core reason why we all get along so well, I'm almost certain that John would say outlandish/dumb things on purpose just so everyone would laugh with/at him together. We often called him the glue or the pulse of the team.

When times were rough for our team, (for example, when we had a payroll issue and didn't receive the proper compensation for our commission), he was quick to try to calm all of us down without trying to devalue our feelings about the situation and provided his full support. He would take time every once in a while to really check in on each individual person on a professional and sometimes even personal level if they were open to indulging. Him and I grew closer to an extent that we considered each other friends rather than coworkers and would hang out outside of work every once in a while. We'd talk about personal issues during lunch and would give some words of motivation to each other, tell the most ridiculous and funny stories, etc.

Unfortunately, his personal numbers have been on a bit of a decline, I'm assuming because he's had his hands full with helping out other members of our team as our team numbers as a whole have declined steadily, but the effort is at an all time high (many factors caused this, such as industry layoffs and budget cuts, our tools not working properly these past few weeks, etc.). We're all fully aware that the higher ups unfortunately only see our numbers and not the effort we put in. However, you could argue that the effort he put in as team coordinator contributed to our overall numbers as a team, even if it took away from his numbers as an individual.

At the end of the day today, John was terminated, and no one had the slightest inkling that he was on the chopping block in the first place. This also makes no sense to me because he wasn't given the opportunity to be put on probation or a PIP despite one of our other team members given that opportunity literally last week. I never thought I'd feel so upset about losing a coworker, especially like this, but seeing him walk out the door gave me such a heavy pit in my stomach.

Moral of the story? If you have a coworker you get along with, cherish that. I'm typically an advocate of keeping your social and work life separate, but don't hesitate to take the opportunity to make a genuine bond if it presents itself. Finding someone who can give you a reason not to groan when you get up for work in the morning is so rare. 

I feel kinda silly having typed this all out now but I stand by it. I hope John finds a company that sees the value in the effort he puts in, and not just a number."

So this man has been my (30F) GP for my entire life. Has also been my brothers (35M) and has been at the same clinic the whole time. Same office. He is literally a legend. Saved mine, my mom and my brothers lives by catching the contagious deadly disease my dad died of. Not kidding. He went to court and fought the coroner.

Now my doc, he loves a holiday. We’re in Australia. Holidays are normal. He has an extremely loyal patient list (hasn’t taken on new patients for decades and is always booked out 2-3 weeks in advance)

Anyway, he goes on his most recent holiday, and tells them when he’ll be back. 

While he’s away, they PACK UP HIS OFFICE that he has been in for over 35 years and put it in boxes. I’m not even kidding. He got back and was like “uhh? Where’s my stuff?” And their response was “oh, we thought you weren’t coming back and were going to retire”

Now, he’d already told them he was retiring in June 2024, so they just decided to pack his shit up 6 months early and ruin a 35+ year relationship, for what?

Anyway. Once he retires in June I’m never going back to the clinic and I’m gonna leave them some very choice feedback. Don’t want to cause him any trouble while he’s still there.

I still can’t believe they did that to him after he dedicated his whole life to that clinic.

I hope their bowel movements are forever loose and uncontrollable.

Was applying for this company and they sent me a mail asking for more documents. I wanted to hand it in today after work and got a call from the company. They asked if it's me who applied and I said yeah. There was silence on the other side. The person didn't say anything else. I was confused by this because there was no reason to call in my opinion. So I asked ""What do you want...?"" because I was waiting for a response. 
They just asked when I will hand in my documents. And then in the end the person straight up scolded me for ""my way with words"" and how they might not even consider my application anymore.

I just said okay and hanged up, yeah guess nobody wants to hire me after all and I probably dodged a bullet here."

I need a bit of advice, I want more freedom and I have been offered a job working from home which is a self employed/contractor role for property lettings/airbnb, the pay is a basic pay of £13.50 per hour but it’s part time hours (30 hours a week with commission on top) every deal I secure and rental I get on I get an extra £300 on top but if I get 3 deals I get £1,000 in commission, I’m not sure if I get holiday/additional leave pay so I have asked and waiting to hear. I like my full time permanent employed role atm I do, however I only get £23k a year before tax and it is in a different sector to what I love and know which is property. What do I do?

What do you think would keep happening with the massive layoffs continuation? Some people would starve, others will embrace AI. It is a resource that cannot be capitalized on, and it's becomes more accessible everyday with less resources required, especially with the current direction of researcy towards small language models.

Not talking about the massive enterprise AI that does everything. You don't need that. Open-source AI is constantly catching up, with available code for experts and cheap user-friendly subscriptions by the never-ending raise of small research-based startups. Where do you think the bright minds that get laid off do? Eventually, the monkeys in suits will self-destruct, and in the near future I hope. 

AI is actually the secret recipe. The point where the enterprise reaches a level where the majority are laid off, is the same moment enterprise itself dies, and one-person-company becomes a normal concept. It already exist as of this moment.

If AI becomes the new ""power"", then it is, by default, stripped away from all the idiots in suits with golden spoons in their mouths. As a technical user myself, I don't even need my technical skills to accomplish tons of tasks. I am still not a one-man-company, yet, but the amount of non-technical work I can finish is insane within very small teams thanks to AI. You can take lots of shortcuts in both finishing tasks and learning new stuff, and I am not talking about the trivial email-writing thing. You can use AI in almost all kinds of real heavy tasks now.

I really think this is how we win. Invest in yourself, for your own future (not for your job's if it's shitty). I know that some jobs cannot be automated by AI as of now, like working as a chef for example, but it's all a connected echosystem. If people with any profession can easily find an alternative to their shitty jobs (in terms of compensation), many people could easily quit whenever it's not financially convenient for them. That creates workforce supply shortage, the kryptonite of capitalist scums, forcing them to raise wages. 

They only get you because they know you have no alternative. We need to support and embrace open-source AI to create a world where the average person has the luxury of safely quitting any job. AI is a virtual resource that cannot be controlled like all the previous ones, so let's not waste this chance while we have it before they find a way to control it..

It seems it unfair to participate in a system, benefit from it, but not contribute to it. 

This from a company does everything it can to dodge taxes while reaping all the benefits of operating in countries that provide infrastructure it can use, social services for its employees, and often bend over backwards to aid its corporate goals. 

Seems it's not OK for another company to do to it, what it does to society.

The two hosts were talking about Free Will. In part of it, they mentioned Free Will 1 (the choices we make about our actions) and Free Will 2 (what will happen if we make a choice).

Here's an excerpt from it - 

""*MAUGHAN: . . . I had, you know, a different situation, a different time in my life as well, where you have this toxicity to the workplace, or a culture that doesn’t reward effort, and I think people stop trying in that environment. They stop trying to be their best.*

*DUCKWORTH: So that’s like free will two, right? That’s like, “I did everything. I wrote the memo that you wanted, you know, I showed up five minutes early, da da da,” and then, there’s no return.*

*MAUGHAN: And I wish I had just had an older me to go grab a younger me by the lapels and slam me against the wall a little bit and say, “Hey, your choice isn’t to just experience learned helplessness in free will two, but use free will one to leave. Find a new job, find a new situation. Just get out of there.” I think sometimes when you feel like you’re so trapped in free will two, you forget that you can use free will one to just completely choose a new situation.*

(full episode here - [https://freakonomics.com/podcast/does-free-will-exist-and-does-it-matter/](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/does-free-will-exist-and-does-it-matter/))

Completely eye opening to me. This is my job currently. I have busted my a$$ for 30 years here. For what??? 

Remember - you have free will - choose a new situation."

For background context I started at this small company back in June. Apparently riddled with issues but they were offering more money than any of my union gigs, and a company truck to take home with fuel card and company credit card for expenses. Benefits are super basic but all the OT I could really want I make up for it almost fiscally. And an incredible amount of freedom and autonomy to do my job of which I’m pretty good at. They didn’t really provide any training so I’ve figured out a lot of the fly on my own. 
A coworker who I’ll call Dan has been at this for 22 years. He worked with the previous owner who passed away from cancer and had his brother take over the company. 
Well Dan had beat cancer and had come back to the company a bit before I started. I guess there was some bad blood between the guy I replaced and the new owner. Which I can see as the new owner is not a calm and collected kind of person. I find out a few months into this job that the new owner is being sued by another previous employee. 
Like I said, riddled with problems. 

Anyway to my issue, I was working out of town and I got a phone call from Dan, typical how’s everything going and so on as I’m driving back to my hotel. I finish up my phone call and go to my room for the evening. I come out in the morning to get ready for work and actually drive to site only to discover someone(I found out it was Dan later) had put a bunch of gay pride stickers and flags on my work truck. Which is kind of funny I think. What bothers me is that Dan followed me to my hotel and waited for me to go inside to do this. That’s what bothers me. He then took photos and posted on his Facebook which I then screen shotted in case he deleted it. Which later on he did. I still have it. We ended up going for beers and I said it was funny but maybe you should find out the kind of person you do things like that too becuase you never know if they’ll burn down your house with your family inside while your out of town.   Initially I was pretty pissed becuase I didn’t know who did it. 
I texted my boss the owner after I found out and apparently everyone was in on it. Let’s humiliate the new guy kind of thing. I texted him back that payback would be ruthless and left it at that. I’ve since bought an apartment and had to go sign paperwork for the lawyer and told them I need the day off to go talk to my lawyer. Which caused some concern for them Becuase I wasn’t clear about what kind of lawyer lol. So I did make them sweat which made me feel better. But now I think about it in the mornings and it annoys me. 
So you think I should find a lawyer and persue something or get back at Dan in someway. Keep in mind I don’t want to think about this stuff. I got other things to deal with. Or should I just leave it alone? "

I responded and asked for more details on the job offer (benefits, time off, etc.) and they responded forcefully as follows (paraphrasing).

>  ""_this is not a job offer, just a salary screen to see if you are still interested prior to a offer we are considering, the items you requested would be included in a job offer if we chose you as the final candidate. The final pay rate is not negotiable_"" 

It ended up being a good rate and I said yes. With hindsight I realized this feels like a shady new HR tactic that maybe is already common although I've never seen it before. Given how effective it was in me, it could become common because it seems to give them stronger negotiating power.

I have since considered some alternative responses. I'll categorize below.

1) Negotiate immediately, say it isn't enough and tell them you aren't interested at the quoted rate.

2) Tell them that you aren't able to discuss salary until you have a final offer with all other financials and job information as a complete offer.

What do you think the best response for this kind of salary-negotiation-end-run tactic?"

This job entails finishing the same day regardless of circumstances.  A typical work day can begin at 6:00 am and end at 10:00pm - I am not exaggerating.  A year and a half later our employer decided to put us on “salary” while still giving us the same workload.  This basically resulted in our compensation being cut in half.  Anything after 8 hours is slave time.  This is what happens when companies decide to over-leverage and expand too quick at the expense of employees.  Oh and get this.  Before this transition happened we also received an annual bonus.  Now our “bonus” is split into quarterly instalments the following year for the work we completed the previous year and it doesn’t even cover a quarter of the overtime pay we were entitled to before.  So our bonus is literally a pittance of the money we worked for under the guise of something extra.  Truth be told the entire situation is disgusting and I have had a bad taste in my mouth for awhile.  FYI we work average 55 hours a week.

During opening statement/speach, CEO made the comment that the theme was selected as Noodles with the purpose to pretty much warn them that if they didn't do a good job this year, they wouldn't get commissions and they'd have to get used to eat pot noodles cause that's all they will be able to afford. 
Talk about a pep talk... 

---

Sorry, long rant ahead. 

Some context first:
My husband just went to a 3days work event (kick off, for those in sales), where basically all the sales & marketing employees from all the different offices are meeting and attending work conferences / talks during the day, and then having drinks / dinners and other activities at lunch and in the evenings, all to favorise team cohesion ahead of the new financial year, and to reward the teams for their efforts and good work the previous one.
Starts off ok.  

Most of the events and talks are a bit meh, but it's a free 3 days in a nice enough hotel. 

He came back today, and showed me his 'goodies bag' and explained the theme of the event, and I was just flabbergasted. 
Basically the 'theme' the company chose for this event was 'Noodles' (weird but ok). 
And the he shows me the goodie bag which has basically 1 notebook and 3 pots of instant noodles. 
Still weird but it's free shit so whatever. 

However, what really pissed me off was the CEO's explanation of the theme on the opening night to the teams. 
Basically the idea was to say that if they don't do a great job this year they'll all only be able to afford noodles, so to get used to them. 
What the heck?? 

For extra context, last month the company introduced a new targets and kpi system that basically makes it almost impossible for everyone to achieve their full targets, and so removing commissions from most of the sales employees. 
It's been very very tense since then to say the least and loads of sales people have started to look at other jobs cause some are worried about their mortgages etc. So to just bring this up so casually and making fun of people not being able to earn commissions and a living was just mind fucking blowing to me. 
For ref, we're in Europe, so being treated like this by employers is very rare, but still, happened. 

My husband sees how wrong it is but he actually likes his work and his colleagues so he plans on seeing how the next 2-3 months go before doing anything. 
And I think the rest of them have all drank the coolaid and are grateful to even still have a job following all the tech layoffs. 
But I'm just absolutely disgusted by what they said. 

Anyways, that's it for the rant.

5,2024-03-05,My Boss Made Us Soup,u/throwawayrxworker,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b7feff/my_boss_made_us_soup/,antiwork,"TL;DR: I had a boss that was so worried about the team's productivity that she held team meetings during lunch and fed us homemade soup.

The dot com boom ended about two months before I graduated college and all of the tech jobs seemingly disappeared overnight.  As a student, I was working for an instructional design team in one of the other colleges of my university and, as I was nearing graduation, my boss asked me if I had a job lined up yet.  When I told him i didn't he offered me a job working on a grant that he had won and said he could probably pay me for six months.  Shortly after I accepted that offer, a position opened up on my boss' team.  My boss' boss was able to use the open salary line to extend my contract until the position was filled. Finally, after over a year of red tape, mandatory public postings, and a university-wide hiring freeze, I was offered and accepted a full-time position. 

A couple years into that job, the college administration decided that they were going to do a reorg.  As part of it, my team got merged with another team that did similar work to us and with it I started reporting to the other team's manager.  I knew my new boss already, but not well, but I did work with a number of her employees regularly. They had often shared their frustrations with her leadership style, so I was not looking forward to reporting to her.  Let me tell you, she lived up to her reputation.

I'm not even sure where to start with how bad things were working for my new boss.

\* First, there was her insistence that everyone be in the office from 9-5 every day, even when my job often required me to work later into the evenings.  One day, I was 10-15 minutes late because I got stuck in a line at the post office trying to ship out a gift before work.  I walked in to a wonderfully passive aggressive note on my chair about how our day starts at 9:00.  Never mind the fact that I had worked a full 12 hours without a break for dinner the day before.

\* The college I worked for served students with particular needs, so the main focus of what we did was to design instruction that was accessible to them.  There was another team that assisted with instructional development for the rest of the university, but at a much smaller scope.  My boss was always paranoid that the administration would outsource our work to that team (which they were not equipped to handle, but in terms of resources and specialization, and they would openly tell us ""we don't want to do what you do""), so she refused to tell anyone ""no,"" for fear that they'd complain to the hire-ups.  On one project, this lead to a client dictating how I did my job, insisting that the tool I wanted to use (and the best one for what I was doing) was ""old technology"" and that I should use ""shiny new buzzword,"" even though I knew it wouldn't work for what the client wanted.  So, at new boss's insistence, I spent a month learning that new tool and developing a prototype with it only to hit the wall I knew was there and then go back to the old tool.  Then, when the project was late, it was suddenly my fault.   

\* Then there were the office supply debacles.  As soon as she started, a sign-out sheet went up on the supply cabinet.  She told us that it was to help the admin assistant better keep track of what needed to be ordered and not to track what anyone was taking...because it's clearly easier for the assistant to compile an order from a random, unordered list than to open the cabinet and say ""oh, that box of pens is almost empty, I think I need to order more.""  Then one time a project manager asked to order \*one box\* of a specific size of binder clips with his project budget because they were the perfect size to bundle the deliverables he was producing.  He was denied, being told ""we have a size larger and a size smaller, we don't need that size too.""

\* One-on-ones were always fun because she'd spend them trying to get you to give up ""dirt"" on other employees.

\* And for performance appraisals, she seemed to believe that she had to grade us on a bell curve, so every year someone would get ""exceeds expectations"" at the expense of someone else getting ""fails to meet expectations.""  She got away with this because she'd subtly give you ""advice"" in the appraisal in the form of ""you did great at A, B, and C, but you need to work on D.""  Then the next year it would be ""You did great on B, C , and D, but you need to focus more on A,"" so by the time it was ""your turn"" to get the bad review she could say you consistently had problems with everything for several years.

The kicker, though, were her team meetings.  She decided that, with such a large team it was ""too hard to find a time that worked for everyone,"" so we would have our team meetings from 12:00-1:00 and lunch would be provided (this was obviously code for ""I don't want you not being productive for an hour every two weeks, so I'm taking your lunch instead"").  Every department at the university gets a hospitality budget that's used for things like taking job candidates out to lunch, social events, and--in my current role--buying the team food when they get stuck working late because some old system decides to crash at 4:30 on a Friday.  It's not that big, though, so we weren't sure how she was going to sustain buying food for bi-weekly meetings with it.  We found out when we had our first one: she made us soup.  Like in a Crock Pot in her own kitchen soup.  It was the most watery, most bland thing I've ever tasted.  There was a rumor that she was paying $15/meeting to feed about 18 people. And judging by the condition of her office, I can only imagine what her kitchen must have looked like, and that skeeves me out to this day.

At some point they did a 360 review with us and my boss said that the feedback we provided was ""very surprising"" to her.  She and the AVP she reported to met with us to discuss the results of the review and what they would be doing to make improvements.  At the next team meeting we had pizza from an actual pizzeria and then, as I recall, team meetings got moved so they weren't during lunch anymore.  A short time later, an instructional developer position opened up and my boss decided she wanted to go back to her original job as an ID for the few years she had before she retired.  A new manager, one with real leadership experience, was hired from outside.

By that point, I had drawn the straw to be the bad review recipient of the year and I decided I was done.  I actually had to reschedule my meet-and-greet with the new manager because I had a job interview.  When I did meet with her, I was excited about her vision and what she was bringing to the team, but another opportunity came up in another part of the university that I couldn't pass up.  I'm still there today."

16,2024-03-05,Putting my company on CIP,u/PipePistoleer,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b7fqft/putting_my_company_on_cip/,antiwork,"I'm tired of companies having all the power when it comes to these performance improvement plans (PIP) and using an arbitrary integer scale to grade us as employees. It's an exchange of goods and services where I'm working my tail off for money and that's it. Not recognition, not slaps on my back, not smiles from the executive team, not my name on a powerpoint slide in the ""credits"" section. Compensation.

I'm not on a PIP by the way, but I see employees get put on them and many times the company is flat out wrong. Where's the recourse?

I'm putting my company on a Company Improvement Plan (CIP). Here it is in raw rant format.

1. No more last minute projects for a thing you knew about 2 months ago and you need me to ""rush it"" pulling overnighters, weekenders, and excessive hours that take time away from my family for NO EXTRA MONEY. While SIMULTANEOUSLY EXPECTED TO KEEP DOING MY NORMAL JOB and then some. Dayum, they've got me in all caps like my granpa.
2. Compensate me fairly. Forget all your stupid salary band, wage scale nonsense. I don't fit in your bucket. I'm your ringer. You call me in to grind on a problem and I get it done. Why are you trying to stick me in this package with a label and a ""set scale"" of pay that I find out is BS later anyways?
3. Really a 3rd manager this year? You want me to move teams and have a 3rd manager in one year?
4. Stop using 1-5 rating scales to gauge performance and call it ""fair"". It's not - it's how you prevent people from getting salaries. The first time you ran this review process you told us flat-out the maximum of 5 is unattainable. Your executives who had direct reports gave everyone 3s with zero actual feedback. We all know 5 is what it takes for a raise. We all know the more naive ones of us are getting 4s to keep us bending over backwards for nothing extra. 3s ""status quo"" are the smart ones - they're given enough to stay sane. Heck maybe 2s are the true geniuses, they get to keep their job. HELL 1s get to keep their job, but it's a given maybe not for long.
5. Your culture building events are weird. Everyone feels weird when we attend them. You pick the most random things that only like 10% of the company attends because it's always during work hours. That should say something - PEOPLE WOULD RATHER WORK THAN ATTEND THE CULTURE/TEAM BUILDING EVENTS. And you suck at supporting employee led groups - there I said it. I'm not the only one.

Someone correct me I suck at words - but I think there's a recourse section or our parents would have called it ""consequences"" - I'll call it a 3 tier escalation where 3 is the ESCALATIEST OF ESCALATIONS

1. Do better or I'm working less hours. Prove I'm not.
2. Do better or the next time a ""rush"" comes up I will be sick, in court, parasailing for charity, cleaning up the highway, or literally anything but be there for that \*\*\*\*.
3. Shape up or I'm shipping out."

Or who will and won't win the election, or never vote third party blah blah blah

I am curious what people here think of implementing real changes like the proposals below so we can have a less ""anti work"" world. They are very vocal about dismantling capitalism and uplifting the working class. 

Claudia & Karina's 2024 full program can be found [here](https://votesocialist2024.com/our-program), I'm just pasting these 3 parts because they are of the most notable suggestions. 

⚒️ ""The United States needs a new system of government to replace the current one designed to maintain the dictatorship of the billionaires over everyone else. The main tools the ultra-rich use to enforce this dictatorship would be abolished. This includes the Supreme Court, the Senate, and the banker-controlled Federal Reserve. Behind the fig leaf of democracy in America, there is an enormous apparatus of violence and surveillance aimed at repressing the people. The FBI and NSA would be disbanded, and mass incarceration would be replaced by a justice system aimed at rehabilitation and reintegration into the community.""

⚒️ ""The new, socialist system of government would be based on the direct exercise of power by workers. A true democracy encourages the proliferation of many types of organizations -- youth climate corps, neighborhood associations, student groups, unions, civic organizations -- and views organizations as instruments for people to identify problems and take action together""

⚒️ ""Bribery in America is a legal, recognized industry called corporate lobbying. This practice must be outlawed, and all politicians should be subject to a ban on serving on any corporate board or holding an executive position of any type at a private company after leaving office. All Wall Street bailouts would end immediately. Similarly, millionaires and billionaires should no longer be allowed to buy elections through lavish donations. All campaigning should be publicly financed, and the different loopholes like Super PACs that billionaires use to get around donation limits should be immediately closed. 

Under a democracy by the workers, war criminals and Wall Street con men would be locked up – finally brought to justice for their monstrous crimes against the people. Corruption is a bipartisan issue for the U.S. ruling class. People like Hunter Biden and Jared Kushner alike abuse their positions of power to secure lucrative sources of income and flout the law. Some members of the ultra-rich grow even wealthier by facilitating the crimes of others, like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, whose bank counted Jeffrey Epstein among its clients. The wrong people are in jail. Instead of incarcerating millions of poor people caught in desperate situations, the ones who should be held to account are the corrupt capitalists."""

It happens sometimes with some supervisors/managers as well. They bitch about what someone might be doing but never confront them and it’s like well it can’t be that big of a deal if you’re not willing to tell them about it and change it? And I mean you’re the boss lol

My thing is I understand no one likes confrontation but you really don’t have to make things awkward or hostile. You can simply pull them aside and say “hey listen I’m not mad and we’re good but I just wanted to tell you something you have been doing that has been bothering me and I think if you try doing it this way it might be better, I want to know what you think.” 

Not that hard? But they will let months go by complaining rather than fix it. Half the time it’s an issue that really isn’t that big of deal and it will inevitably become a much bigger problem since you keep letting the person do the thing that bothers you. It’s so dumb 😂😂😂

Edit: I should mention it doesn’t have to be personal either. It’s also things like they notice you’re doing a certain job the wrong way and want to correct you. "

We had to interview for the role but it’s essentially a guarantee we will be successful. I did not ask about wages as the information had already been provided in the introduction meeting.

I found out yesterday after my interview, that we will not be paid at the rates offered by Company B, we will instead be paid the same as what was currently offered at Company A. The difference is roughly 15k AUD for the role offered. Keeping in mind they are still 2 completely seperate companies.

We have also been told to speak Company A’s HR department to discuss our pay once we move to work for Company B, again, they are not in collaboration with each other for payment agreements.

The work itself is okay and my coworkers are nice. But the policies are asinine. A 30-minute lunch and a face scanner that everyone has to use to clock in and out. A parking lot that's about a 10-minute walk from the building. But the mayor (this job is tangentially related to city government) and all his cronies get to park right next to their building.

Last month I applied for a part-time evening job, to help supplement the crappy pay I get at the full-time job. When I asked my boss about time off (I didn't say the reason) she said I was too new to have earned PTO. I asked if I could take unpaid time and she hemmed and hawed, and said maybe. She gave me a form to fill out and said that the Big Boss would have to approve it, and no guarantee that she would. I eventually was able to schedule my interview for evening, so I told my boss I wouldn't need the time off after all.

I've been looking for a different full-time job so I can quit this one. I had a Zoom interview at another place, which I did during my lunch break. Then they invited me for an in-person interview which would be about 3 hours. There isn't an option here to do it in the evening, so I asked my HR department about PTO. I've been there for 2 months so I asked when I start accumulating PTO. They said not until 6 months.

So, can anyone suggest a good excuse for why I need to take off 3 hours during the day? From what my boss said, the Big Boss isn't going to approve an unpaid time off request unless I have a really good reason. And knowing what this place is like, they are going to ask for proof/receipts if I say I have a doctor's appointment or had car trouble. Can anyone suggest a plausible reason why I'd need to take time off during the day, but wouldn't be expected to provide proof?"

For example: 

* If on multiple projects, look busy on one of them so the other people on the other project think you are busy on theirs and vice versa...etc
* Lots of documentation and notes for work

I find the above typically works well in slow big bureaucratic environments but in more entrepreneurial settings, it's harder to hide because people keep inviting you to random meetings and expect you to ""contribute"" to ""everything"" Even a manager would ask you to step and ""get your hands dirty"" which is so subjective because they are just basically asking you to work overtime for no pay increase"

My work has a scan card system, where you can’t access the building without a scan card. This was no issue when I was full time and had a scan card.  I switched jobs and stayed on part time thus losing scan card access as part timers do not have scan cards. We drive vehicles into the locked parking lot and have to exit at the end of the day through the building to exit to the front of the building where public and staff parking is.

I was locked out of entering the building, to exit to go home.  I banged on the door, no one came. I waited approximately 10 minutes until another employee pulled into the parking lot and was able to let me in for me to go home.

I work upwards of 13hour shifts as a part time employee and as I said before have a full time job already, so having working 20 straight hours and having to wait for another employee to come and let me leave really peed me off.

Don’t know what could be done about this besides bringing bolt cutters with me and cutting through their fucking fence so I can leave on time lol. Thoughts?"

Those two levels were still higher than normal so I have another appointment scheduled to see the nephrologist again next month. 

I’ve been keeping my boss updated on the entire situation. At one point, she told me that it’s just my nerves and not to worry about it. When I told her about my appointment next month, she told me that there’s nothing wrong with me and that I should ignore my doctors and pray to God. 

I’m a bit offended by that because I’m not at all religious. I also know that kidney problems run in my family so it’s definitely something I need to stay on top of. 

What’s more is that she seems more concerned about that fact that I might have to be out of work for a little while, depending on what’s going on, rather than whether or not it’ll be okay.

As you're all aware, you've been bought out by spx technologies, they've promised to stay out of your business for a year and delegate while you play out your typical day at work. 

You might be thinking since this is a billion dollar company they might have better benefits and pay rates, that maybe waiting around will be worthwhile because you might be better off in the long run? 

You would be wrong. 

This company is a bunch of penny pinchers, they will do the bare minimum with the labour laws required in order to run their business. They are monopolizing and screwing over everyday workers any chance they can get in order to maximize shareholder value.

I'm here to tell you, you're screwed. It's in your best interests to find more meaningful and lucrative work, as this company will have you bend at the knee in order to fill their insatiable quota. 

We went from a millionaire family to a billionaire company, the first thing they did was take our paid Christmas shutdown away, then they took our overtime benefits so we'd have to work 44 hours before making that rate. 

We are on the clock 24/7 now, they micromanage us through the cameras and increased our responsibilities while cheaping out on our pay.

This is sort of my troll/throwaway account so if you look at my comment history -- well, just dont take it into account when replying here. I have a very good work ethic **despite** some outside issues I have mentioned in previous comments. On that same note, I have not had a bad attitude about any of this until today. I chose this job over another one that paid **significantly** more (30K more actually) because I thought I would like it better. But instead, all I feel is job insecurity. 

I thought the TPS report gag in the movie Office Space was and absurd parody. For anyone who has never seen the movie, they guy has like 6 different bosses that he reports to. I do not remember the EXACT dialogue but...

The first boss goes to his cubicle and asks something (almost passive aggressively) like, did you know that you need a **cover** sheet on your TPS reports? 

Then later another one of his bosses (that seems to be higher up the chain), comes up and says something like ""I heard you were having trouble with your TPS reports. Is everything okay""

That has basically been what has been happening to me the whole time I have worked for this company. Then I rocked the boat with a third ""boss"" by asking too many questions he was unable to answer. (I was trying to help the team, then he said I was wrong, but could not back his argument for why I was wrong -- I dropped the conversation when his last answer was objectively, verifiably wrong. I was professional the entire time).

... this was a little while ago but ever since it has been a shitstorm of all of them putting pressure on me and trying to get me to fire myself. I guess kudos to them on that. I have had CYAs and screenshots from pretty early because of this. My days are all documented, timestamped, etc -- Every single significant email goes into OneNote, every Teams conversation, EVERYTHING. I can always back up everything I say at work and have done so repeatedly so far. In my entire career, I do not remember ONE TIME I have had to pull out a CYA to my boss. Seems like a daily thing now.

I will admit this job is a bit different than what I am used to and there is a learning curve, but I have AT THE VERY LEAST met every expectation they relayed to me verbally. Funny there is not a document that truly lays out any expectations for the role, though. It is an ""evolving role""."

They require us to reference a website to get answers to our form which will crash if you try to navigate out of the app while mid entry. 

So I’m just kinda at a loss. During Q1 I’m making like $150 a week. How does this company expect me to just come up with a second device? I have an SE 2 that I use for work. I’ve already been told that I would be better for the company if I upgraded my phone to the latest flagship model and some stores would require I fill out my audits from my car so their customers don’t see my old phone. 

It’s just ridiculous to me that my company has the audacity to recommend a latest gen iPad Pro with cellular enabled for a job that is going to last a week. Like I’m getting paid for 18 hours of work on this one call form and they expect me to buy a new iPad that I won’t use again after this job is over???

I also should point out: WE WORK FOR APPLE! I just shipped back dozens of old iPads that we took off display.

After all the parties they threw for us talking about ""You guys really pulled through for our end of year projects,"" ""We had tough goals this month, but the team knocked it out of the park!"" ""We really want this place be somewhere you want to stay, and not just use as a stepping stone."" Eat a fat load. Literally last week they did performance reviews, and almost every single team member was told they are doing a stellar job.

They don't care about us. We're just numbers on a god damn page.

I’ll admit, in the past I’ve been a bit of a pushover. From 18-24 I worked at a Starbucks cafe inside of an establishment. I ended up getting a position of “Cafe Lead”. I noticed that regardless of working there for 6 years and being reliable, regardless of my seniority…everyone else had a better schedule. So, eventually I brought up how I wanted to start working during the days on Saturday rather than the closing shift I’ve done every weekend since I started. Well, that just wouldn’t work because so-and-so can’t close and this one can’t work weekends. So…I realized…I’ll never move up or get anything I want. So I found a new job. I decided to go back to school before this and when I got my new job, I told them. They didn’t seem to understand that. I would be put on the most insane hours and although I would be ‘part time’, I would be the only part time worker working 37.5 hours a week. I would open my mouth and would basically be told they couldn’t accommodate me. Every. Single. Job. 

Now…I work at a retail job. The medical office I worked at closed out of nowhere after not paying me for months & I graduate school this spring so I figured this would be an easy job. During my interview, I told them I’m looking for a super part time job as I am working on my senior capstone and need time to work on it. I was told I would be working 3 days during the week which worked great for me as I would have my weekends to work on my project. Well, since I’ve started…I’ve worked every weekend. Every time I’m told “I know you’re not supposed to work weekends, it’s just the ones who are keep requesting off so we have nobody.” The latest schedule that was released, I am on 5 days a week, the 3 days during the week I’m supposed to be on and the two weekend days. I texted my manager stating we’ve had multiple conversations that I’m not supposed to be working weekends/so many days…why does this keep happening. She basically told me people keep requesting off and I need to find someone to switch with. Now…I’m working Saturday because this one manager can’t be alone…meanwhile tomorrow the girl I’m supposed to work with requested off so I’m alone the entire day. I’m the only person to work alone. I’m new to all of this. I go above and beyond….this other girl goes on vacation…somehow I’m being questioned on things she forgot on days I wasn’t working. This is why I feel like I’m always screwed over. 

I’m just tired of it. Everyone else gets away with taking time off and changing their schedules, but because I’m a reliable worker, I’m supposed to deal with it? My fiancé and my mom always tell me to stand up for myself and I feel like even when I do, I’m basically told “too bad”. Being a good worker and dealing with this throughout the years has truly made me bitter and has made me hate working. "

1,2024-03-05,Our IT department accidentally factory reset my work computer,u/omfgMURPHINATOR,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b7qkzx/our_it_department_accidentally_factory_reset_my/,antiwork,"For context, I currently work in a Help Desk role.

Earlier today I had an hour of my day scheduled out for my company's IT department to remote into my work laptop and fix a device syncing issue with Microsoft InTune. This was only supposed to take an hour or so, however something somehow went incredibly awry and it ended up with this IT guy accidentally factory resetting my entire work computer.

Since this was being done remotely by our IT team, I took my laptop into our office conference room and let them do their thing while scrolled on my phone and waited for them to finish. Firstly, they had to update Windows with a newer version which took a bit of time but updated just fine. Then they had to create a new User Profile on my laptop, and merge my existing profile with the new one. This went smoothly as well. However, while I was sitting there watching them do their thing I saw that InTune  was still not syncing and could tell they would need to keep troubleshooting it.

At this point the remote session was coming close to two hours long which went well  over into my lunch hour. Fine, I'll just swap lunch times with a colleague and go a little bit later. I was admittedly getting annoyed at this point that things were taking so long, but I just continued scrolling on my phone to help the time pass while not really paying much attention to what the IT guy was doing on my laptop.

He had rebooted my laptop multiple times at this point, so I was just letting him do his thing. This time however, my laptop shuts down but was taking a bit longer to turn on than it had previously. After a few minutes it powers back on I see the dreaded ""Resetting this PC.."" text. I am pretty tech savvy, and I immediately knew that this wasn't just a regular power cycle. I messaged the IT guy on Slack and told him what I was seeing and I jokingly said ""I really hope this isn't a factory reset"" to which he replied ""I hope so too"".

Great.

Sure enough, the IT guy somehow managed to accidentally factory reset my entire work laptop. All of my work related apps, 3 entire years of notes and different files I had saved, all of my bookmarked login pages for all of the different tools I use daily.. Gone. All of it was wiped. He called to apologize to me and tell me how embarrassed he was that he somehow managed to do this. He knew he fucked up and quickly got off the phone. I was contacted by another one of our higher up IT guys who had to spend the entire rest of the day running scripts and re-downloading all the numerous apps I had on my laptop in an attempt to get it back to a somewhat functioning state. This took the entire rest of my work day and it still wasn't even close to being back to normal went I left to go home. I would've just left and gone home as soon as it happened if it wasn't for the fact that they needed me to be at my computer to continually punch in my credentials for the rest of the day while IT attempted to fix things, and they needed to stay connected to my laptop so I couldn't just take it with me.

So now I get to go into the office again tomorrow with a completely wiped computer to sit there and let our IT department remote in and continue to try and get things back to a functional state again. At the very least I am hoping all of my local files and notes are saved on One Drive and I am able to get them back. If not, I will have lost 3 years worth of work related notes and important files I need to be able to properly do my job. And no, I did not have any of this backed up on a local hard drive or thumbnail before this happened.

Anyways, I just wanted to vent about this. I'm in disbelief that this even happened, and of course my job is expecting me to come into the office tomorrow and work like nothing happened, even if it means sitting at my desk waiting for our IT guys to finish attempting to fix my computer for an entire day again.

Thanks for reading."

Our manager, who is a cool dude and I believe has also been screwed out of this raise, told us that he was assured the raises were just delayed. We've asked every month since then, asking at nearly every meeting. We last asked two weeks ago, and his answer had changed to ""They're still working on finalizing this year's budget before they can give out raises."" He sounded very annoyed with his higher-ups.

They made sure to remind me at my termination that I signed a confidentiality agreement (to destroy any and all company conversations and communications)   
Quite honestly, I've seen a few similar videos of recordings with former bosses blow up and go viral. Part of me is like, there's no point.

Today, my boss called me into his office to rail on me about a mistake I made yesterday that delayed patient (non critical) care by a whopping ten minutes and mildly inconvenienced our anesthesia department.

Boss still railed on me for ten solid minutes trying to guilt trip me into taking more blame for the mix up than was my due, but I told him flat out that wasn't gonna happen. (He's passed about high turnover, but refuses to see he's a major part of the problem and toxic as fuck besides.)

They set a whole bunch of crazy goals and deadlines so to meet them the company had everyone work manual overtime, 6 days a week for multiple weeks on end.

This left everyone extremely mentally drained with no time to do anything besides work and playing catch up with errands on Sunday, the only day off they were given. Needless to say, they did meet their quota so the higher ups came down to personally congratulate the team for bringing in record breaking profits, and what did they get in return?

Was it a much deserved raise? No. A bonus maybe? No. (Mind you this company was only paying everyone 15 dollars) Instead they gave everyone a singular cupcake. That's it, all that work, all that overtime spent away from family, all those record breaking profits rewarded with a single fucking cupcake, all while the higher ups smiled and laughed as they probably got huge bonuses themselves off the work of everyone. Cupcake in hand, not one employee was laughing or smiling like they were.

It's absolutely disgusting. At one point everyone was told that they should pretty much marry their job, and to focus more on meeting the quotas than spending time with your own family. I hate how much workers are exploited and not rewarded for their work while the ones above get rich off you. Luckily my friend quit that place not long after. "

It felt like an intimidation tactic, as I am rarely ever asked to go in his office. He then said I'd be involved with a project including ONLY us two, and that I could not discuss it with anyone—not my team, not my department head, not my supervisor, nobody.

He told me the project was something I HAD to do for my job. If I had a problem with it or said I couldn't do it, he said there'd be a big problem. No creeper vibes. Just the air of a weird power trip.

I suggested a project in my department I thought this might be regarding. He refused to answer, saying only that he'd tell me eventually. Maybe this week, maybe next. I asked a couple more questions and he took extra care to make me feel stupid enough to stop asking questions and just let him ramble.

Eventually I got enough clues to confirm that he is indeed talking about the project I suspected. Still, he refused to tell me straight up, and emphasized that I was FORBIDDEN to talk to anyone about this. Tbh it made me pretty uncomfortable. He's known to put ridiculous projects on people until the more reasonable directors catch wind and intervene.

I am 99% sure what project this is about, and it's not a project I can take on. I've made it clear that I cannot take on this additional workload, and that I do not have the skills to do such a thing. There IS a staff member who does have the capacity and skills, and they are willing to help with that project.

This boss is EXTREMELY difficult to work with and I avoid crossing his path at all costs. We rarely work together and operate in different departments. I want to avoid getting roped into his shit but today's ""secret"" meeting was so uncomfortable and intense, I was caught off guard and did not know how to respond.

Should I call him tomorrow and say something? Should I talk to my direct supervisor, even though he intimidated me into thinking i am alone in this psychological chaos? We don't really have an HR person. The accountant says she's kinda like HR but it doesn't seem official.

I'm hesitant to wait because he's the type with zero regard for someone's work day. I can see him barging into my office one day and demanding I help with a physical errand that takes up my entire day and puts me behind on my responsibilities.

He made me really uncomfortable today I wanted to quit. My dept's team is extremely cool, efficient, fair, and insightful. We typically handle everything as a team. I just feel so confused and anxious about this situation. I don't know what to do. Any advice greatly appreciated!!"

I do 2 to 3 projects that each take around 8 weeks to complete, but it will be going up to 6 soon. Along with that, I have to get a cloud certification, do a excel like 10 hour course by the end of the year.

Recently, my manager added that I have to do a mock migration where I setup the domains and everything, and it has to be due by April. Along with that I have to take a Zendesk customer service course, through LinkedIn that is a 6 hours long and has a 60 question test.

Along with that my manager doesn't want to help much when I ask questions. And will oftentimes say review prior calls or make me do this training course or something when I ask questions. Which makes me feel it's punishment and extra work for me anytime I ask a question.

It's also weird that it's happening the week before I took vacation. I mentioned that to the manager and she just said oh I forgot that you had vacation this month, when its literally on my calendar, and I first brought it up to her in January. Along with that, we had a business trip this month also. So, idk how they expect me to do all this in 8 working days. She offered to move it back to mid April, even then that doesn't seem like enough with all these projects.

A lot of the meetings are also weird and we just talk about the weather. It feels more like I'm a number and its impersonal. They also didn't say anything on my birthday when it passed. Idk if its just cause I didn't notify them, but I think the manager had to have seen it in her system.

So do you all think this sounds like too much or is it just me? And would it be worth leaving jobs even if for a lesser role with lesser pay, or am I just overreacting?"

Why do people continue to hurt themself this way? Because they have to? I hate being a part of a society that people must suffer to live. 

I just want to feel happiness. I don’t want a big house, or a fancy car, to travel, or raise a family. I just want a cat and dog, Wendys, and some spare money to buy Etsy stuff as I please. That is enough for me to be happy.

I refuse to die a person who believed hard work ever benefit me. "

The response? Literally Stockholm syndrome.

- “Oh I don’t know what I’d do with myself after that 2 week mark.”

- “A newborn doesn’t require that much oversight” 

- “My job would realize that I am not needed, so I can’t be away for that long”

- “I would get bored to tears”

- “Companies here would not function if that were the case”

- “Companies here would not be able to afford that”

You have got to be shitting me. This level of cope is off the charts. I just don’t get it. Most people complain so much about how exhausting it is to have a kid (I don’t because most people have scared me out of doing so).

They are relatively fair with their staff (work from home is the standard but office space is available if required, decent pay and vacation, pretty hands off in general.) I've never worked at a company like this before and it's kind of been a shock to the system. Honestly my last job made me hate my life so much, I'd work from 9 in the morning until 10 or 11 at night everyday for only slightly better pay than I make now and I'd usually have to give up at least 1 of my weekend days if not both for work too just to get everything done. 

I can't help but feel... guilty though? Like it feels like I'm taking advantage here, maybe it's just I've been conditioned to believe that I have to work 25/8 but I can't help but feel like I'm taking the piss here. My boss sat me down in a meeting the other day and just geeked out about a new show he'd been watching for an hour and then just said at the end ""we should probably get back to work though"" before sending me other similar bull shit on teams an hour later. 

Even though this laid back culture is pretty top down here, I can't help but feel like I'm the only one doing it? Like I can't help but feel like when I complete my small collection of tasks for the day and do my best to keep things going that everyone else must talk about me and call me things like ""the layabout"" or something like that idk. I feel like anyday now my boss is going to call and say ""this isn't working out"" and move me on despite him saying nothing but positive things up until now and even said to my face that he's happy with my progress. I'm at work in 8 hours and in my head I keep saying tomorrow I'm going to be really productive but every time I just still do a few jobs and then bullshit the rest of the day.

Today my friend is back in the same studio as that team and said that the guy who hired her had to get special approval, because the production lead said she wasn't going to hire her anymore because she didn't like how my friend emailed her asking to clarify the rate issue (the photographer calling her a bitch was just a cherry on top).

I took the first job that would hire me in 2022.

The starting salary was $38,000 which is not a lot, but when the most you've made is $13.25 and hour, it seems like a lot.

After two years, my net income is only $2,300 while monthly rent in my area runs anywhere from $800 to $2000. I still have to pay for utilities, gas, car, car insurance, student loans, and food.

To add insult to injury, they have me doing stuff that this high school graduate was doing when I first got hired here.

I've posted about my shitty boss (who also runs the company) many times, but in short, he is a scumbag and everyone in the office is a dick rider for him. Luckily, there are a few warehouse workers that seem to hate him too.

He lives in a mansion in the rich part of town and likes to make fun of me for living at home with my parents among many other things....

quiet quitting seems more fun.. If I can get away with as much ""goofing off"" as possible, then getting paid peanuts will be justified.

Not to get too “woe is me” but I come from a very poor background. My parents could only get us “nice” things for Christmas and birthdays with 100% financial backing from my grandparents’ credit cards. Not even cash. (My grandparents didn’t have money either). I’ve struggled with mental health issues to a crippling degree, hence me not building a career in my 20s in favor of, well, fighting to stay alive daily. I’ve only just recently curbed my desire to end it all. 

For transparency, I am also in school. I work from 8:30am to 3pm and then go to class from 4:30 to 10pm. Hopefully by this time next year I’ll be a licensed cosmetologist, but I’ll still have to fight my way to financial independence. I still live at home. I couldn’t afford an apartment or a home even if I wanted one. And at that I would need like 3-4 roommates probably. 

No offense but anyone making $80k+ a year with just their income alone isn’t going to get a lot of sympathy from me when complaining about how much work sucks or how they wish they made more money. Unless you live in a major city or a very expensive state, that’s some good money to a poor like me. I would kill to be making even twice what I make right now. "

I commute from Missouri to Kansas to go to work everyday and I have been employed with this company for about 7 months.

Thursday, the President and CFO of the company called me into the office and told me that they had been planning to let me go for some time, but recently I had finally begun working to the standards they required. This in itself is frustrating because I only had one check-in 3 months in and other than that I have had no direction from them whatsoever so I thought everything was fine, I have also mentioned that their training is sub-par for what they’re asking of me but they just ask that I make suggestions on what to change. I, as a new hire and new to the field, was not aware I needed to revamp their training policies, but I digress.

The main problem is that in between that time they were going to let me go and deciding to keep me on, my employers also switched health insurance companies and did not include me on the census form to provide me with coverage because they thought they were going to let me go. They apparently tried to add me back on but the only way they could accomplish that was to tell the insurance company I was fired and rehired. So now I have to wait the new hire waiting period of 90 days (May 11th) before I have health insurance again. I was on the company’s previous health insurance plan before it was switched over.

I am being told about this incident about 3 weeks after it happened so I was already not covered without my knowledge or consent at the time of finding this out. There is no paper trail of this conversation because I was spoken to in person so I don’t have any concrete evidence.

Do I have any recourse? I’m already looking for another job because I absolutely don’t trust these people now but the amount of stress not having health insurance is causing me it quite a bit and I just want to be able to protect myself in some capacity.

They explained I would have my health provider fill out a form they’ll give me if I decided to do that. But first they encouraged me to talk to my manager and see if they would agree to my accommodations unofficially without needing the medical form. 

The specific accommodation I’m requesting is a reduced in-office schedule. I currently go in-office one day every week. The rest are virtual. I’m asking to go in one day a month instead, while being on standby for two other partial days in case their are time-sensitive tasks that need done before my in-person day. Most of my work is done from a laptop so can be done virtually. I also want the option to attend a monthly meeting virtually if I need to through Zoom. This is already set up for those who can’t make it in-person.

My concern is that if my manager agrees to my accommodations, I won’t be protected under the ADA for being fired for my accommodations down the line. I planned on outlining my accommodations in a word document and having my manager sign it because I definitely want a paper trail and proof. As well as specifying it is long-term (indefinitely or reapplied yearly) so she can’t just change her mind and reverse them. 

Is it recommended to go the unofficial route or should I still officially file under the ADA after talking to my manager? "

My one year old had a small fever last night, I'm exhausted and only vaguely pissed, and I think I just gotta vent.

I was floating around the /r/GenZ sub today (I'm a millennial but still, the kids are alright) and I saw one post about workers' rights, another post about what communism is, another one about voting and political parties...

Y'all, why haven't we told the zoomers where we fucked up in the last ten/fifteen years? Or what mistakes we've made? Or what genuinely stupid shit we paid attention to instead of the super important shit we didn't? It drives me crazy that boomers (if I'm not talking about you, then I'm not) insist they did everything correctly when shit is so clearly fucking terrible right now.

The conversation between capitalism vs. socialism vs. communism vs. anarchism is *a hundred years old.* It's not relevant, it's not meaningful, and it's a dead fucking horse that's just better off left alone. At best, each is just a collection of various people's ideas on how things work or how they *should* work, and folks should just learn about them, steal whatever ideas inspire their creativity/dignity, and then just leave the rest in the trash. At worst, they're ideologically-driven systems that millions of people have died and killed each other over.

I spent a huge part of my twenties hopping, in the order above, from one ideology to the next. I was 100% convinced each one was right, I would sermonize about each one of them to family and friends, and I would judge them for just ""not understanding"" why they were ""right"". I isolated myself from my family, I forced myself to socialize with people I barely had anything in common with or never felt comfortable around because we subscribed to the same political view. I got arrested and nearly had my life ruined through state repression over symbolic forms of protest that didn't mean shit and had no material effect on people's lives, all because I thought it would take me closer to a utopia that doesn't exist, and that I ultimately don't want. 

You know what I want?

I want food growing over every green patch of lawn in my HOA, so that when my daughter is hungry she can walk outside and grab a banana. I want rain barrels in each building corner catching the unholy shit ton of water that comes down here. I want to build a playground for the kids so they stop playing basketball in the street. I want to know the name of every single neighbor I have. I want to setup a mesh network of Raspberry Pi nodes so they neighborhood has its own communication infrastructure. I want a community food pantry, and a book/seed/tool/everything share. I want spaces for us to cook/eat/party together when it's time for us to celebrate something. I want to build gardens and pallet houses and all kinds of shit in all the empty lots around my neighborhood. I want folks to stop getting shot and evicted by the cops, I want folks to stop being murdered so their land can be stolen, and I want people to be able to live life on their own terms so long as they're not *hurting anyone*.

That's not utopia y'all (well, maybe that last one...) All of that is very specific, concrete shit that I can make happen all on my own (or with a little help from my friends). Voting is just a way folks make decisions sometimes. It can sometimes be useful, occasionally necessary, but 9/10 times it has nothing to do with changing things or making shit happen. An in *this* political system, I'd say it's genuinely worthless. It's just what I think, and I can be wrong. But these people do not deserve your consent to govern over you or me. I just don't think so...

I don't know. I'm babbling. But this spring I've grown tomatoes, peppers, a whole bunch of herbs, and the cucumbers are flowering. I've got sweet potato slips growing along with some beans, and the ginger just started shooting out. I've given plants away to neighbors for free, and I've got more to share this week. I know at least six or seven of my neighbors by name. So that's a few steps closer.

What are y'all ""gardening""? What are you organizing in your neighborhoods to make them *yours*? What do you actually want, and how are you moving it?"

The story - I worked at an incredibly toxic company for 4 years and was basically brainwashed. There were so many ebbs and flows of trying to find new work but I always stayed. I don’t know why. I’ve always compared them to an abusive partner. I just couldn’t leave 

My last year there, depression made its way into my life and I could only attribute it to my job. The company was creating fraudulent work, hiring only friends and family members to work there, and werent paying anyone adequately. I was so depressed and felt trapped. 

They demanded a return to office but only for one office location (my location). Everyone else was still free to work from home. This made me so upset because i found such a good routine while working from home. I was exercising, cooking my own meals and wasn’t feeling as bad about my high rent (this was in a large city).  When we started going back into office, i had a 2 hour commute. It was brutal and slowly ate away at my soul. 

My depression was getting worse. I began self harming after working 18+ hour days. Then the suicidal thoughts came and I didnt think I would make it through the year.

Then I started calling out their bullshit. I called out their data is fraudulent. I called out that they need to pay their workers more (I was rooting especially for the team I managed which was severely underpaid). I called them out on their bullshit return to office policy. 

Then they fired me. And after about a day of anxiety and stress, I realized that I needed them to fire me cause I didn’t have the willpower to leave on my own. 

It’ll be a year next week and my life has done a complete 180. I left the city I was living in for 7 years and now I travel full time. I work for myself making a fraction of what I made when in corporate but I’m getting there. I met the love of my life. I could not be happier and am looking forward to my future. 

I’m really glad I didn’t go through with my plans to not exist anymore. 

Moral of the story - getting fired can sometimes be the life turnaround you need

TDLR: was at toxic job, caused depression and suicidal thoughts, got fired and now I travel full time, met the love of my life, and work for myself. It gets better.

I’ve made a post on the cscareersquestions about it and pretty much everyone said it was because of startups. 

I was told I was going to have a 1:1 meeting with the manager but when I joined I was greeted by 2 HR people who told me I was getting fired. The manager said the reason was because of my “continued poor performance”. They have only given me one week of training and was expected to know how to do all parts of the job instantly as a graduate. I was working on a project a few months ago but they took the project off me and never told me why until a few months later, and said that my work was “no good”.

They then put me on another project which I conveniently finished today before they fired me. I’ve never been given any thorough feedback except to “just focus more” and that I ask for help too often. 

I don’t know if I’m cut out for the tech jobs anymore, and with all the recent mass layoffs I feel like I haven’t got a chance! 

Not really sure what to do but I just needed to vent, thanks."

now our work has 3 days per week allowance. last week i did 4 days as the day i went in, i was tired and obv productivity was low so next day (fri) i decided to sleep in and marked myself as wfh early morning.

the manager got angry and said i taking the piss despite acknowldging my issues (& the fact my house got broken in and as i live alone thats causing anxiety as well as if i am at work miles away anythinh can happen).. but still he has sent me an email and cc in HR.

the wfh arrangement is a new one and i inital meeting he did say if we do 4 days wfh for any reason to make it up in future.. 

anyways i am not sure if i am in the wrong? from my pov if i was the employer i would want employee to be alert rather than be tired.

also mentioning this fact in my reply, have i shot myself in the foot because they might say if i m having sleep issues might as well sack me.."

I literally make no money here, not even enough for moving out from my parents (I'm 27 now). I also can't learn anything new here or grow and literally no opportunity to move forward inside the company. 

I'm actively trying to get a new job since I'm working here but simply no one wants me. I think I applied for about less than 1000 positions, but I rarely even got a respond. 

I'm just fucking burnt out. I have to wake up really early (with sleeping problems) to commute 80 minutes to do work that means literally nothing (and I could do it at home but no home office) for minimum wage (about 636 usd/month here). And then my boss keeps asking for things that makes 0 sense and he ""throws grit in the bearings"" on purpose and I'm the one that everyone blames even tho I do everything I can to meet deadlines. I literally wake up at night feel like crying that I can't escape, and then I wake up at the morning feeling angry that I have to go there. 

Thinking of resigning even tho there's no other job lined up. In the last few weeks this feeling got really really strong and it keeps getting stronger and I really want to resign asap. What stops me is that I'm 100% sure I won't be able to find a better job and this makes me really anxious. 

What would you do? What should I do?"

I don’t wanna talk about it right now. 

What I do wanna talk about is how angry I am over the job hunting process. I’ve been applying and interviewing for about 2-3 months. Everywhere is rejecting me. They’re grilling me in interviews and asking so many (sometimes literally irrelevant) questions. Everyone wants something else even though the jobs I’m applying for have the same title. What is this? Am I supposed to know everything or what? 

Some of these companies feel like cults. Like a secret clique not many are allowed to enter. They scoff at any indication of a gap in knowledge (even though you’ve demonstrated that you’re a fast learner before). It’s like they don’t want to take you on. Is literally anything less than perfection not accepted? 

Don’t even get me started on how most of them ghost you or don’t even give you reasons for rejecting you. It’s awful out here. I know there must be a lot of applicants for each role, but this makes the process so difficult. Doesn’t help that companies make you feel incompetent and less than in so many ways. 

I hate this. I hate that they have the power to literally make you unable to pay for necessities and be financially stable. Ugh. Why do I have to do this, I don’t wanna. "

Constant stupid arbitrary deadlines to make some rich prick even richer while barely getting jackshit in return, constantly being expected to have this 'owner mindset' while NOT being compensated for it as if I was an owner, constantly getting rushed and being expected to wear many hats for the pay of 1, even when I'm a customer (say sth dead-average like at Burger King or really any business establishment) I face a skeleton crew of maybe 3 employees trying to serve 10's of people at once so in this case fast food isn't even fast any more, constant stress, constant stress-related health issues that we know make you much more prone to developing stuff like autoimmune issues and cancer etc, the list goes on and on

If I was NOT working-class, my life would be 200% better EASILY because I would have all the money to BUY time and KILL stress for good. I would have a 'house crew' preparing my meals, I would have a chauffeur (ok maybe that's unnecessary) driving me around, I would NOT have to work a job essentially killing stress for good, and I could afford an incredibly low stress lifestyle that science says is THE key to long-term great health.

Seriously when rich pricks say money doesn't buy happiness I get furious. Money kills stress, thus buys you great health, money buys you TIME and the chance to LIVE life... No wonder so many people are drawn to videos of off-grid living, camping in the mountains, or going to the 3rd world as a 'rich' foreigner etc. People are fed up with all this nonsense for good reason."

(M32) I have made mistakes in the past- mostly having to do with my struggles with anxiety, depression, OCD, and ADHD. As a result, I was a chronic job hopper in my twenties. I have had 75 jobs since I turned 18. That number is no exaggeration. I have worked in a variety of industries including janitorial, healthcare, retail, factory, warehouse, customer service, tech, food service, hospitality, transportation, gig work (uber, lyft, doordash), and finance. Out of the 75 employers I have worked for I can confidently say that 3 of them were actually good places to work and the reason I left was regrettably because of poor life decisions. I have been through countless interviews of all types, (bullshitting my way through each of them), corporate indoctrination sessions (aka new hire orientations), and ridiculous onboarding processes. I’ve seen some employers offer me a job in the spot, some that hired me for a position without an interview, and some that put me through grueling multi-panel interviews as if I was being put through a senate confirmation hearing- all for petty wages and either no benefits or benefits that I could not afford. I have gone through enough training periods to predict and peg every type of person I encounter from the overly self-satisfied and always annoyingly happy HR people to the cynical veteran employee training me who contradicts everything I learned in orientation. I have gone through enough employers to know that pay sucks everywhere, health benefits are typically inadequate and costly, and corporate greed is ABSOLUTELY RAMPANT (even in so-called nonprofits).   

Needless to say, my resume is, of course a total lie. It has to be. Who would hire someone with a job history like mine?  Granted, I have never committed any crimes or done drugs, but if employers knew my past, it would be just as bad as being a felon. 

I do not deny that I have my flaws. I went a decade of my life leaving my mental health untreated and I allowed that to adversely impact my life. But, I don’t fully regret it because I have learned quite a few things about corporations and the workforce- albeit with added cynicism- and I have learned how to be a damn good interviewer. 

The last few years have slowed down for me since getting proper treatment for my mental health issues. Since last year, I went from being a gig worker to working at a union auto factory. Of course, as luck would have it, I got laid off a month ago and have been looking for a new job since, which leads me to my current predicament…

My lie of a resume is catching up with me.  Because of the mistakes of my past, I have burned too many bridges to have any references outside of my most recent employer and it seems I have been getting offers from employers who insist on doing employment history checks which came as a surprise given how few of my 75 former employers did that. 3 times now, I have had to turn down job offers from companies wanting references and numbers of my former employers. If they called the 3 former employers I have listed in my resume, they would know I was lying about the dates since I fudged it to eliminate gaps. God forbid we have gaps!!  And also, those employers would likely say I left on bad terms. 

I know this all sounds bad, but I have decided to get a fresh start by moving to a new state. I have also decided to ERASE every former employers from my resume except my most recent one that I got laid off from and pretend that THAT is the only place I ever worked. I am giving myself a fresh start and a clean slate and I absolutely do not feel guilty about it in this greedy, toxic, late-stage capitalist corporatocracy. "

WFH drastically improved my productivity (and therefore life in general), so I went through the process of requesting ADA accommodation to continue working from home.  I work for a huge global company that uses a 3rd party company for this sort request (The Hartford), and I submitted my paperwork requesting accommodation in early December.  My doctor specified WFH as being the accommodation he recommends that would enable me to perform my job functions.  

Aside from my boss having me fill out a shorter form similar to what my doctor already submitted (i.e. nature of disability & what accommodations should be considered), **no one reached out to me about this even once.**  My boss finally told me today that 'my request was denied' and 'they can offer me an office as opposed to a cubicle' but he did not give any information beyond that.  I asked if I could talk to someone from HR and he said ""he'd try, but he thinks they've already made the decision"".  He also mentioned he knew a lot of these requests were submitted recently, so I think HR sat on these requests for months while they figured out how to deny everyone's request.  

No one from HR worked on this with me like the interactive process I know this is supposed to be, and I have no idea what they think the 'undue burden' is.  They are so adamant about getting everyone back in-office at all costs I don't think this was treated as an ADA request.  

I'm not going back - but I don't want to lost my  job - so does anyone here have advice on what I could do next?  Any advice would be **very** **much** appreciated.  "

Also note that I am assistant manager of the store, been here the longest, and generally have always been regarded as a solid employee. Just this morning I had my job publicly threatened for something that everyone does. Just the other night, the closers left everything undone, absolutely nothing done, and I did it all the next morning and never said anything to nobody. The next night I closed, did everything I was supposed to (including finishing the openers jobs they left undone)  except one little end of the night task that couldn’t get done due to how busy it was. The task was put the batteries from the cart onto the table, which mind you, the cart was right next to the table and this task is frequently not done, it’s not a thing that gets in the way of any task, just a nice thing to to do for the next crew. Next morning im being threatened. This happens frequently. I am absolutely being harassed.

*FAST FORWARD*   


My boss knows that I have a plethora of experience and keeps trying to throw the kitchen sink at me. They are constantly asking me to do things outside of my role and have proceeded to give me a full time work load when I said I could only work part time. 

I was asked why it was taking longer than expected to complete my tasks. I mentioned the whole full time work load / part time hours thing and said maybe it would be helpful if they brought me on as a full time employee. (They still haven't, but have proceeded to add more projects to my plate with no pay raise.)  


The thing is, I like having a flexible schedule, I like what I do and I like the company. But now in order to complete my tasks, I'm working full time hours at much lower pay and with no benefits. The thing is, I'm terrified to stick up for myself and I don't want to jeapordize my job. Where do I go from here? "

If delays happen it could potentially take months. The amount of screwed I am depends entirely on the speediness of the DMV. It’s already been 2 weeks, and the ID still hasn’t been shipped according to their website.

TIFU by making the mistake of relying on stupid gig work as my main source of income, and well here I am- unable to work ANY of my of the following jobs that I am actively hired on:

Instacart Shopper (diamond cart, 5000+ deliveries, 5.0 star rating), Amazon Flex, Dumpling, Shipt. I also have very good stats on Doordash, Uber Driver, Uber Eats, Grub Hub, Post Mates, and a few other I can’t think of at the top of my head.

I don’t actively work at ALL of those jobs- I usually only do one at a time. However I did make sure to at least get hired at ALL of the gig jobs during the pandemic because here I thought that having like 20+ online job options line up would be enough security to get me through ANY problem. Oh how wrong I was. I figured that even if like 8/10 of my gig apps went out of business or offline at once, that I would still be able to work at any one of the other options that I am actively signed up for. I never anticipated that letting my effing driver’s license lapse would LOCK ME OUT OF EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY JOBS. WTF MAN

Well here’s what happened: my ID just expired during my birthday, and I am officially locked out of 100% of my apps until I am able to take a picture of the real physical ID using the app. After that, it may take multiple days to get manually reviewed.

NONE OF THESE GIG APPS ACCEPT ANYTHING OTHER THAN REAL PHYSICAL IDS. I HAVE SPENT MANY HOURS ON PHONE AND CHAT AND EMAIL AND NONE OF THESE COMPANIES ACCEPT TEMPORARY PAPER IDS OR ELECTRONIC IDS, BOTH OF WHICH I HAVE.

I renewed my ID 1 week ago, but it won’t be until 3-4 weeks from now that I will see my physical ID in the mail. And no they don’t do actual physical instant IDs here in my state (California, bay area.)

I know what you’re all saying- just get a real job! Well, I have been trying EVERY DAY since my ID expired, and I have yet to receive a single reply. Even if I were to get hired today, there’s no way that I’ll be able to get 40 hours right away, nor will the pay be very good, AND I’ll have to wait at least 2 weeks to even see the first check! There’s a chance that I’m probably going to get my ID in the mail long before I even see a paycheck from a job, if I even get hired anywhere.

So yes, until then I am absolutely screwed."

2,2024-03-06,STOP complaining about capitalism: most of what we are angry about is corporate neo-feudalism,u/L-Rockatansky,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b8hnz9/stop_complaining_about_capitalism_most_of_what_we/,antiwork,"Don't get me wrong - capitalism *also* has myriad problems, but the modern economic system we live under, particularly in the United States, is not capitalism as Adam Smith or Karl Marx would recognize it. Read ""Bullshit Jobs"" by Davis Graeber and get radicalized.

The fact that we cannot survive in society without having a Lord (aka employer) to whom we must pledge our allegiance, combined with the invasive control that landlords, banks, and the corporate ruling class all collectively exercise over every facet of our lives, means that our circumstances have much more in common with those of serfs than of the salaried workers of the 60s and 70s who could buy multiple homes with a 50th-percentile net worth. Under constant threat of poverty and violence, we dedicate ourselves to work for the betterment of a very narrow subset of the population. 

Complaining about all of these things using the language of capitalism is dangerous because

a. it fails to hold corporations and the super-wealthy accountable for hijacking and transforming our economic system into something which overwhelmingly and exclusively benefits them at the barbaric expense of everyone else, and
b.  it inherits the misleading language given to us by the false dichotomy of ""communism vs capitalism"", something manufactured by the ruling class to divide us and trick us into fighting against our own interests

Corporations took a capitalist system which actually had some semblance of basic worker protections (at least for workers located in wealthy countries, globally is another story) and turned it into a hellish feudal system where we, the peasants, labor for and defend their estates. Some of us are given more comfortable accommodations if we are particularly dedicated and have niche skills, but we are all existing for their benefit. And unlike medieval feudalism, nearly every single aspect of our lives are routinely invaded and controlled, and we are expected to work year-round for the majority of our waking hours - not simply when the crops must be planted and harvested.

And then they jump topics with Guy A asking Guy B if he's hired a private chef for his vacation property yet, and how impossible it is to find someone who isn't some culinary school know-it-all, especially up north.  And Guy B suggests maybe his son who is touring cathedrals in Europe can find someone in one of those smaller countries he can bring over on a work visa deal instead of paying what these people think they're worth here. 

Which leads into how The Zoomers are ruining everything for everyone because now suddenly ""everyone"" is important and ""nobody is better than anyone"" and that's just not sustainable because no one is willing to work these cheap labor jobs anymore and how dishonest and shameless they are for demanding more than minimum wage.   

It's wild... And also kinda creepy how they all have the same brand of slip-on shoes, the same arctic-white veneers, the same massive eyebrows timepiece on the left and silver chain on the right, golf shirts, and khakis.  Like to be in this club you need to wear the required uniform.  

Oh god, now they're talking about how one way to get them back for having to pay such ridiculous $15/hr wages is to push up the property values buying the houses and increasing the rents to recoup the wages, and how it's a good investment anyway because if they can't buy the property they'll be forced to keep renting.

I got my onboarding paperwork and see in the contract the rate is $16/hr. I asked what’s up about that bc I apparently had misunderstood.

He's real taskmaster and a perfectionist.  Generally speaking, I think I'm a good at my job. I'm never late. I've never called in sick. I come in early when asked and I stay later if necessary and have come in on days off to help out, sometimes with my child in tow. He's cool but when he's not he's awful. The way he talks to me sometime you would think I had committed some heinous crime but I let it roll off my back because I needed the job and since I'm getting older (and thus unhirable according to him), I was in it for the long haul.
Sigh.
Late last year I finally went to the dentist. I hadn't been taking care of myself and I needed to go. I was told I needed much done (root canals, crowns, cavities filled) and I would need to come more than once to have it all done. Fine. I figured going to the dentist would not be a problem. Wrong. 
The dentist that does these procedures is not available on Friday, my day off or weekends. I would need to miss work to make these appointments. 

Every step of the way, my boss has expressed anger and has made it very clear that my appointments are an inconvenience for him and suggested I switch dentists.

It came to a head last week. I had made an appointment two weeks ahead of time for a Thursday morning, at his request because in the afternoon doesn't work for him. On Wednesday, he's making plans for the Thursday workload and asks me to come in Thursday morning. I say ""I can't. I have that dentist appointment. Remember?""
I could see immediately on his face that he was pissed off.
The next day I go to dentist and then straight to work right after to work the rest of shift. He said nothing to me on the matter. Great. He asks me to come on Friday(my day off) to do what we couldn't do on Thursday. Fine.
I get up early on Friday and head off to work and do a couple of hours. He volunteers me to come to his house on Saturday (I would have to take my kid), he doesn't ask he just tells me. I say fine. I figured it was make-good for the appointment. At this point I think everything is gravy.
I clock out and start walking to the bus stop when he calls to ""speak candidly"" with me for a minute and launches into telling me that these ""supposed"" dentist appointments are rubbing him the wrong way and calls me a ""piece of shit"" for missing work to go the dentist. He just cuts me down and calls me disloyal and questions whether I want to be there at all.

""Do you even want this job? Do you want to be here?""

I couldn't believe it. I saw white. It was like getting slapped. The way he was chastising me for going to the denist. The anger and the tone he spoke to me in seems so disproportionate to what I done, going to the dentist. And that he would call them ""supposed"" just ran up my spine. After all the time and effort I had put in, I hadn't even earned a drop of good faith from this guy. He doesn't even believe me. I just felt shattered.

But he wasn't done.

When I started my employment there I told him that I was going on a 10-day trip at the end of March. I must've told him this 6-7 months in advance, maybe more. I told/reminded periodically leading up to it. He had no problem with it.

After I've picked up my son from school and I'm at home he calls me to berate me about the length of my trip. He's says that my trip is longer than I said it would be. It isn't. He counts days on the calendar that I wouldn't even ordinarily work and inflates 10 days to 14. He's says that I'm leaving him high and dry and that I should have come up for a plan and trained someone to do my job in my advance. He tells that I'm blind-siding him with this trip and that I'm ""shady"" for doing this to him. That it's a ""dagger in my eye"" and that I am effectively burning the bridge by going on this trip. 
And I mean he's just yelling at me over the phone. He won't let me talk. Just keeps cutting me. And I just feel so helpless being cut down for no reason. I did nothing wrong and I'm getting screamed on the phone. On my day off. For the umpteenth time.

He dismissively tells me to enjoy my trip and maybe he doesn't need me to come back at all after or even leading up the trip. He hangs up and then texts me not to come in on Monday.

Then he calls me again the yell at me again. For ten more minutes this guy screams at me and I take it.
""What was the plan, supremestamos""
""Tell me. What was your big fucking plan? You were just going to leave me here to deal with all this?
Just hammering away. Over and over getting louder to the point where I just break down crying and my mother took the phone from to hang up.

On Monday, at his request, I didn't go in. 
I went to Urgent Care and got a doctor's note for two weeks sick leave.

He texted and called me incessantly(during my leave, asking me work-related questions). I didn't answer any calls or respond to any texts. He tells me that I'm ""still his dude"" and that he wants to apologize and explain his words.

But I am not interested. I have no intention to hear him out or work for him again. There's nothing he can say that would justify calling me a ""piece of shit"". A piece of shit. For going to the dentist. After I came in on my day off and agreed(reluctantly) to help him at his house I just can't believe he had the nerve to call and cut me down.

I was already fed up and stressed and always tense. My heart would pound in my chest whenever he would call or text. I would fear that he was calling my to chew me out.

He's called before I've left the house to berate me about my appearance. Before I've even left the house I'm standing on my porch and this guy is just cutting me down about how I dress and that I stink. (I don't). He's legit called me to scream at me for not stapling papers. And I put up with it and kept moving forward but when he called me, after I had come in to help, a piece of shit, it was like a moment of clarity. It was like I was standing outside myself. I couldn't believe it. How could it be that this where I am? Am I expected to just take it? To keep taking it? 

I didn't deserve that. The worst employee doesn't deserve. I made that appointment at a time that was best for him. I consulted with him and picked the morning and still it was the wrong move. Still I had to take the brunt of it.

My sister thinks I should consult a lawyer but I'm not sure.
I don't know.
I just wanted to vent. I feel like it was all a waste of time. I can't now put this guy on my resume. Piece of shit."

But what's bizarre here is these two complain they ""don't get a dedicated hour in which they can sit down and be left alone"". An entire hour is deducted from my clock in time everyday, even if I come back early to finish something. The full hour is gone. 

After work he was telling me about the new place he's going to work at. He told me how much he makes. He talked as if this is a small amount, but he's being paid as much as the master tech, he's getting 50% more than everyone else weekly, and his bonuses are 6x more than everyone else's. But he was telling me this as if it's really shitty. But he's telling me he'll be paid more.

I’m a clinical laboratory scientist at a small rural hospital in WNY and I’ve been made aware recently that there will be a change for those of us working solo weekend day shifts. 

Such change is that the tech working has to take their lunch prior to 11am while there is a second tech there until 11:30am. If you are unable to take your lunch at that time you are meant to stay an extra 30 minutes, to make up for that. As management won’t be approving the “cancel lunch break” change in the time sheets for such shifts even if you did not have time for a lunch break. 

So essentially if you didn’t get a lunch break and worked through it, they will still say you did on your time sheet. What this culminates in is .5 hrs worked with no pay and .5 hrs as regular when it should count as .5 hrs OT if I understand this change correctly.

To make matters even more concerning after talking with several of the inpatient nurses they are already subject to this policy and have been for at least the last 7 years according to one of the longest tenured charge nurse. 

Am I wrong in thinking that this policy is blatantly illegal and the DOL be contacted over this? Any advice on how to navigate this situation would be appreciated as well as what I should be prepared for if I do submit a complaint to the DOL?"

I often describe as both a crucial benefit and a ""red flag"" of my job as I get to be, both autonomous and fully anonymous even in my own team, as being the cog that does all the jobs, no one else wants to do.

I am 38m Autistic, and I need routine/structure/consistency basically same shit different day, I am a member of my team, I know I am, but every time our team gets a phone call, it theoretically should be going to all of us, but it doesn't, my phone number isn't even listed in my team, it goes to my boss, and others in my team can answer, if it is a job that only I can take care of, suited for me, then they let me know via email or text message, but otherwise my phone never rings, not even my personal phone. Now granted this protects me from late night phone calls, allows work life balance, and preventing me trying to fix jobs that are not/and have nothing to do with me.

Recently I have been getting random phone calls. I often get unwanted, unknown numbers often being in the end scam calls (who doesn't) and my routine for scam calls, is answer, let them go on, say I'm not interested, and hang up, and that's if they even talk or if it's random breathing. I then call the number back, and have usually gotten people answering, so I can tell them their number has been piggy backed off of (my good deed).

The phone calls I have got recently have been from my works switchboard, someone is clearly trying to get in touch with me, but I can't work out who it is, and when I call the number, I get my works switchboard, and since I am no one special and not the name people think of when they think of my team (I may be putting myself down, but I am just stating facts) they are not screening my calls, and don't have the ability to find out who tried to call me.

Now my number is listed on my work profile, all my details, as well as email and various other info, if people (god forbid) need me they can, but why they would use this method of calling our works switchboard and asking for me is confusing to me, when they can look me up, and call me directly, who else, other than something work related, would try to contact me?

Would I be in the right to avoid this happening again, or at least at all, or potentially get in trouble, if I simply just blocked it altogether, thus never receiving a call from my work ever again, unless the person in question looks me up first and calls me directly?

I work in phone sales. I know that this job can be stressful but I am getting too old for this. I service all 3 major carriers. I don’t always hit my goal but I’m usually only one or two off. I am just an M.E. Which just translates to the lowest man on the totem pole. Above me is my TL and they make the schedule and do everything a “boss” does and is over 4 other locations. Above the TL is the DM who oversees three different states. 

My wife worked for the company for all of a month before she left. She is an amazing saleswoman. She was beating company records at the locations she was in (two different locations). 

After my wife quit, my TL put me in the absolute worst location possible. Wouldn’t come to my location for a month. Wouldn’t help me out with anything. It wasn’t until I called my DM about it, he started letting me move around to get more sales. 

Fast forward to Christmas, I called out Christmas Eve because I am sick with influenza A. He took me off of the schedule and I only worked two days. 

Fast forward to last month and I have my nephews coming out to visit me on my usual days off. He changes my days off. As soon as I saw it (not even 12 hours after it was posted). I called to inform him and he got mad because I didn’t tell him. I still didn’t get to spend a lot of time with my nephews. He admitted “well you called out on Friday (I broke my ankle and I had a last minute appointment) so I gave you Thursday/Friday off. When I first broke my foot back in January he took me off of the schedule for the week of my wife’s birthday and started me back up to 40 hour work weeks after telling me he would have to put me down to 25 hours for breaking my ankle. 

Two weeks after breaking my ankle he asked me “why did the TL of this location tell me you were limping?” I said “I told you I broke my ankle.” 

Next week, I have three days I need off. I gave plenty of notice. (Schedules are made one week in advance). He asked me if I really needed Tuesday off. I said yes. I no longer get notifications on my platform we use and I can’t fix it. He knows this. I got chewed out because I’m not responding to anyone in said chat. I’m just, I’m working, I’m not looking at my phone. He changed my location last minute for Friday and took me off of the schedule for Saturday. When quested he said it was due to “needs”. 

I hate my job. What can I do besides look for a new job? This isn’t even the half of it. "

It's like he thinks I'm being defensive but I'm not?

XXXXXXXXXXXX

So my boss needed a spreadsheet. I did it my way (due to new processes) which helped traceability (basically leaving formulas in cell and details in memo column). 

My God he flipped. Not angrily, just a string of ""No way, this is so confusing, it is too hard to follow, it's horrible, you're wrong"" and I was all hands up, ""okay! Okay! Nooo worries at all! Old way (simplicity, clean, simple memo, no formulas) it is! I'm totally chill with that! Let me scrub it down and all I need to do is basically hard-code everything, reword the memo, it's tooootally okay""

He apparently took this as me being defensive and then lectured me about how confusing this paperwork is and therefore it must be his way. Went on for maybe 6 or 7 minutes. 

Once again, I said that its O.K. Totally fine. I will work on it, spreadsheet back to him in less than half an hour.

Still thought I was being defensive and angry (I wasn't?? I was literally chipper???) and circled back to the top, reexplained why I was wrong and why it must be his way for another 4 or 5 minutes. I agreed with him. I told him, ""Yeah I liked the old way better anyway (his boss was the one who had me change it in the first place). I totally agree. Will scrub for you. Will revise. No sweat. I'm glad you even mention that. I was hoping to go back to the old method anyway, etc.""

He then explains for another 5 minutes (the same speech) until I'm just totally lost. My head is spinning at this point like are we stuck in a time loop or something? I just gave him a shorter, ""OK. Okay got it."" And he finally stopped.

He has had multiple instances where he takes my work from me due to ""not meeting deadlines"" but we are horribly shortstaffed and we're ALL missing deadlines. I'm newish (7 months) but the only one he takes the work away from. This happens even if the deadline is a week away (context, tasks takes only hours to do, but I'm flooded and am massively behind due to the workload, not the work duration). My annual review came back all unsatisfied and complaints that he is having to do all my work for me (the work he basically took from my files on his own). That he has been so kind to me by helping me but I'm taking advantage of him by now dumping the work on his lap. The work. That he. Took.

He also enters conversations already assuming I'm wrong. Once I asked him, ""hey I know you said use code ABC but the software is only showing the code XYZ, can you help take a look at this and we can work out if it's some sort of technical glitch?"" 

His response, ""I already told you to use ABC. Why are you using code XYZ???""

I feel like I'm in a fever dream every time I talk to him. I want to say he's a narcissist or something, but I'm not a psychologist. He's a shy and soft spoken guy (except for that one time he blamed me for something that wasn't actually my fault, raised his voice, slammed his fist, etc.) And kinda hermitty. Doesn't really seem to fit a narc profile? Or maybe I'm just in denial lol "

1,2024-03-07,"I still know it's my fault, but....",u/Sturdybody,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b8nfre/i_still_know_its_my_fault_but/,antiwork,"So someone said I should give an update on what happened. And I needed to take some time to process and just figure out what my plan is going to be after the conversation I had with the owner and the manager. 

The long and short of it is that I was suspended for 2 weeks instead of being fired. The manager talked the owner out of firing me. We had a conversation about it that Tuesday night. They started with saying that this is unusual and that anyone else in this position would have been fired. The owner said he's never done this before, and the manager said that as much as they say I don't get special treatment it's very obvious that I do. Which of course, I agree. Their main points were that I was making mistakes that were directly costing the company money, or mistakes that were indirectly costing the company money. In their words I went from the most reliable employee bar none, to the most unreliable employee bar none in just a few months. 

There was a lot of talk about my personal life, which I put a hard stop to immediately every time it came up. That I was looking for another job, which I explained that of course I am because they weren't paying me enough to pay all my bills and live afterwards. And the owner specifically tried to call me a hypocrite for asking for Mondays off and looking for another job, and the manager called me a hypocrite for asking for Mondays off and then showing up to the store on Monday to play games. Which again I had to put a stop to because what I do on my days off is not related to work, and frankly none of their business. If they're offended or bothered by it, that's their problem to figure out. The owner got really mad about ""being thrown under the bus in front of another employee"" instead of me ""taking blame when I made a mistake"". He thinks it is really disrespectful to use ""I was told this."" or ""This is how I was directed/ this is how it was explained"" as a defense when I am at fault for a problem instead of taking the fault and apologizing. And I guess I can kind of understand that. What they want from me going forward is to call one of them if there is ever a conflict between how I was trained and what is expected of me or what I need to do. One of the things that actually got to me the most and really bothered me, was that the owner talked about how anything I say on social media gets to him very quickly because our community is so tight nit. Which honestly kind of creeped me out and made me uncomfortable. I want my private life to be private. They even looked me up on LinkedIn and tried to use that against me. 

Ultimately they asked me to make a case for my job, and to take the two weeks suspension to think about if I even want it. Because they ""care about me"" and they ""hate seeing me shoot myself in the foot"". I've been friends with the manager for 20 years, and it's been very hard to keep that separate the last year or so. So I am trying to take the care at face value, but I know and have always known that the business comes first to him, and obviously the owner. There was some talk about wanting me to be the Inventory Manager like they wanted before but I'd have to prove I could be that guy again. The day before I'm supposed to come back they want me to put in writing my thoughts on the matter, make a case for my job, and explain my feelings about the job moving forward.

I decided that I'm going to keep working there, and address them in writing like they asked. I'll tell them that I'll do better to take more accountability for things I do wrong and not just ""blame it on training"". I'll tell them that I am interested in a manager position in the future. And I'll be telling them that I will continue to spend my private time as I choose and it has nothing to do with them. Obviously in a more fluffy polite way. I know I need to be firm, and direct as well. 

But as far as things go on my end that they don't need to know about, I will be continuing my job search, even if it is just a part time job to supplement my income. I tried the uber eats thing, and it's not easy to make as much as I was hoping to make. That said I'll probably still do it to supplement my income until a part time or full time gig presents itself. 

I need a job, this is a job, but if it ever gets to this point again, I'll just take being fired over anything else. This was a terrible two weeks(that I still have more of before it's over), and I'm in a financial downturn that will take selling half my stuff to get out of. But at least I still have a roof over my head, and my mental health isn't too much worse than it was 12 days ago. 

**TL;DR** I got suspended for two weeks, they know everything I've said about the job on any of my socials and even some of the stuff I said in private. They want me to prove I can be reliable again, and are using the management position as a carrot again as well. So we'll see how it goes after I come off break. Still looking for a job ~~if you've got something in inventory management that's remote hit me up~~"

4,2024-03-07,The checks are all bum and management is being super crappy and vague about it. What do we do?,u/Luigis_pizza_toilet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b8o21n/the_checks_are_all_bum_and_management_is_being/,antiwork,"For context, I left my last job at a pizza place. They owed me one more check for 250 bucks. We all received our checks and ohhhh no. Literally all of them are bum. I try my banks ATM, no good, spits it out as defective, I try another ATM, again, defective, and I eventually try 4 ATMs just so I can get my money. None of them accept it. 

I call up my old coworkers and tell them to drop what they're doing and deposit their checks. They have the exact same issue. Literally *all* of them are bouncing. So in short, I have them call management, because they work there and I don't, and the answer boiled down to ""check machine broke"". Effectively the bank can't cash any of the checks and we just have to wait. All they said was ""you have 90 days, it should be able to fix itself by then"". 

All of the check details line up and are right, so there should be 0 reason it bounces. What does that even mean? Did the bank get robbed, or did checks printed with green designs become illegal, or is it just you have no money? 

Now I'm short 250 and some of my coworkers are short a ton more. Some of them have families. But as far as anyone knows, checks are busted and they can't say a word about it. What does this mean? Did they just write a bunch of bum checks to pretend like every bank that has an ATM in miles is malfunctioning? How do me and my former coworkers get our money?"
818,2024-03-07,I was hit at work (opinions needed) then asked to resign or face termination,u/donutdong,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b8o9x0/i_was_hit_at_work_opinions_needed_then_asked_to/,antiwork,"As an ABA specialist, I worked with autistic children at a school. However, due to staffing issues, I also had to perform the duties of a paraprofessional, while still providing ABA therapy.

One day, a teacher in charge of the classroom wanted to let a child leave the lunchroom because he was throwing things. I knew this would reinforce his disruptive behavior, so I advised the teacher not to do that. She reacted by hitting me on my face and neck, making me step back. It was more disrespectful than painful. She apologized later and we moved on.

The incident was witnessed by coworkers, so I was called to the principal's office. They said this was unacceptable they would address the issue with the teacher and asked me to report any retaliation. They also asked me if there was anything else they needed to know. I shared my daily log with them, which showed my work and observations. I also pointed out the signs of potential neglect I noticed when I was absent, such as unchanged diapers and unattended therapy programs.

Two days later, they talked to the teacher and she came back annoyed. At the end of the day, I was summoned to the principal's office again, where they told me that the teacher had accused me of sexual harassment. They showed me a group text from nine months ago, where the teacher was discouraged and I had said ""youre not mean, youre sweet like candy"" and sent the gif from MadTV's ""where your boyfriend at"" where he is licking his lips"". There was no indication that she was offended by it at the time. She even sent memes back. They said they would put me on unpaid leave and likely terminate me based on the allegation. They offered me the option to resign and get a positive reference.

I felt that this was a desperate attempt by the teacher to save her own job by making a false accusation. I also wondered why they did not discipline her for hitting me, which was clearly unacceptable. I was confused and frustrated by the whole situation.

I want to learn from this experience and avoid any future trouble. Was what I did sexual harassment? I admit it was probably inappropriate but given the fact that everyone in this group text was doing the same i thought it acceptable? Also, do you think they had other reasons to get rid of me, such as covering up negligence I reported or am I digging too deep into conspiracy?

Tl;Dr i work with autistic children at a school as an ABA specialist, but I also had to do other tasks. A teacher hit me when I tried to correct her mistake, but she was not punished. She later accused me of sexual harassment based on an old text message. I was offered to resign or face termination. I want to know if I was wrong and if they had other motives."

The last time he was laid off was in 2007/2008 during the financial crisis. I remember going to pick up his things from his office with him, and I was young at the time, so I was very confused what was happening.

I just found out today that he has been laid off from the new company that he has worked for, for over 7 years. He was one of the top directors, and he was forced to resign because his department is shutting down operations in Toronto, Ontario and is transferring over the the U.S somewhere. Apparently they cannot accommodate for his transfer, and they are giving him no option to join any other department that’s staying here in Toronto. They said he’s no longer needed. :(

He was one of the top 5% of income earners in the country, and now he has to find a new job. The job market is so competitive right now, hopefully he can get a decent position for another place with his experience. The only BIG issue is that he is 60 years old… "

I personally like having those few extra minutes to take inventory and get ahead for the day. I guess I’m an idiot for not noticing sooner but I glanced at my time card as I was leaving today and noticed that for yesterday my card said 4:16-2:00 9.00 hours. I thought that’s obviously not right, the math doesn’t math. I asked my supervisor about it and he said that we do not start getting paid until 4:30. This was apparently implemented in October when they changed the rule from us being allowed to clock in at 4:15 to 4:16. There was no announcement, meeting or email where we were told that this would mean we would not be paid for this time.  Fourteen minutes five (sometimes six) days a week for possibly twenty weeks, is me out of hundreds of dollars. I don’t see how this could be legal, I am an hourly employee, is it not a law that they have to pay me from the time I clock in to the time I clock out. I’m such an idiot for not questioning the change or noticing the lost time sooner. What would you do? "

Prolonged unsticking of these totes, you're prone to damage. Eventually you have to take sometime to unstick the really bad ones

There are two ends. One feeds the tote, other receives it. My manager is swapping me around to the receiving end of the totes after lunch. It's telling me that it basically has to get to a point of someone saying they're in pain from unsticking these totes to be swapped around.

This wasn’t totally unexpected as the company has been laying off a lot of employees that they hired during the pandemic while simultaneously touting its high stock price and how it’s providing investor value. 

But what infuriated me the most was how they communicated the decision. 

As they told me that there was no place for me in the company and that they are unlikely to consider me for other positions, they repeatedly claimed that the severance package was generous, and that they make this process smooth because they care about its employees. 

I would’ve liked if they just told me that they’re firing me without the sugar coating BS.

Luckily I have another job lined up. But it’s infuriating that these companies bullshit how they care about their employees and then have the audacity to give themselves credit while they’re firing its employees.

Just needed to get off my chest but the entire system is broken and I am becoming more and more radicalized."

I've recently got a new manager. I have worked in this company for over three years and while everything (through company) was terrible at least the team was pretty great for most of my time there (i am currently working my notice). I had an extremely toxic boss in my previous job and it took me years of working on myself and therapy to get over all the shit I had to deal with. 
Anyway, this new boss I have doesn't have a lot of management experience as I was told by my previous boss who I am good friends with and who hired him. This new one is obviously trying to play the big boss but at least to me it's obvious that he is extremely insecure and also seems very workshy. Avoiding being in the office when there is a huge deadline etc.
He just seems to be demanding all the respect without earning it. He is just tryunf to micromanage everything, demaning everyhing gets done perfectly the first time around (even though getting feedback and adjusting work is an entegral part of the worklow). He has a terrible style of communication and he had already complained to me about ""not doing my work right"" when I had been off sick for two days and he ""had to""  take over my taks which somehow took him 4 days to complete when it should have only been an afternoon issue at most.
I am the only woman in my team and he doesn't take any feedback or comments from me serious. He doesn't include me in conversations that are literally about my work and these are ""meetings"" that are happening right next to my desk that I am not invited to or have to just butt in. Instead of including me he will only speak to the senior person I am working with who has to then give me the information... all while sitting right next to me. When I try to explain stuff, he doesn't look me in the eye. I have been doing my job for 10 years and I feel like he treats me like a junior and it's infuriating. I never had any issues with my work since working in this company but this guy keeps telling me that I have to ""keep asking questions when I dont understand something"" because... he thinks I am dumb and don't talk to people? Anytime i didnt understand something it had to do with him telling me what to do in the most convoluted way. 
Anyway I am just not able to deal with crap like this anymore but at the same time i know its normal to just suck it up and be respectful and just shut up and get on with it... but I am just sick of it. I only have three months to go but I just cannot be the yes-man he wants and needs. This is more of a rant but if anyone has any suggestions on how to best deal with it... I guess if anything major comes up with him I will be talking to HR about it in my exit interview.
People like him are one of the main reasons I hate corporate life so much. "

It was a pretty small company that did a majority of their business with other companies. Relevant info, back then phone service for a large company would require equipment installed on site. 

I worked the evening shift every other week and it was pretty dead after 6pm since most the customer service calls were from other businesses. It would get pretty boring, there was no internet to keep me busy so I would try to find random things to pass the time. One such thing was looking through accounts to find typos or errors.  

So one evening while doing this, I noticed an account that still showed as active but with a zero balance going back a few months. Logical conclusion is that they switched to another phone service but never called to let us know. Not a big deal normally but it also showed we had installed a bunch of equipment at their location that was never returned since they didn't officially cancel. I did a bit of digging and found a quite a few other accounts with the same situation, about 15 of them.

I noted all the accounts and presented it to my manager the next day. Basically me telling him I found a bunch of accounts that probably are using another service and they still had our gear. Now to go get the equipment it required an account deactivation form sent to the tech dept so they schedule their guys to go get the equipment. My manager instructs me to contact the accounts to see if they did in fact switch, try to get them back and if not to fill out the disconnect forms so the techs could go out to get the equipment. I was thrilled because it gave me something to do between calls. I worked through it all over the next week or so, did all the proper forms and passed them on to the tech manager. A few weeks later the tech dept contacts my manager to let him know they recovered about $150k worth of equipment. My manager was thrilled and passed that info on to the CEO. Couple days later I'm led out to the front desk by my manager and the CEO presents me with a little plaque that acknowledges me for saving the company $150k and it's hung on the wall with like a little ceremony. I was overjoyed. 

That is until I get called into my manager's office a few days later. He hands me a written reprimand that was going to be added to my personnel file. The reason? I wrote up too many disconnects and it made the numbers of active accounts for the month look bad. The disconnect forms I was told to fill out by my manager so that the techs could go out and get the equipment. He had been told to write me up by the CEO so there was no one higher I could complain to and HR wasn't an option, the company was family run and HR was the CEO's brother. 

I didn't quit right then and there, I should have but I stayed just long enough to find another job first and put my notice in about a month later. That was the last time though that I put in extra effort to help out a company."

Because of this, she wants someone to replace her or at least to help her with the workload. I agreed to come in to the office to help wherever possible but the more time I spend there, the more obvious their internal problems are. The first issue is ironically, nepotism. There are over 100 employees and the management positions are filled by family. This causes a management mess. There is no HR person, no Pay Roll person, no Purchasing person.  Everyone is doing everything. Pay roll is done manually on excel, which I am stuck doing. There are arguments everyday about someone “not doing their job”. Which annoys me because it creates a toxic environment and no one has clear responsibilities.

I’ve taken it upon myself to assist with the warehousing/storage problem, their purchasing issues. On top of that I do payroll now and their month to month bill entries. Which is a lot. Too much. 

Two days ago there was an argument with their son (the Director), a cousin of theirs (Warehouse Manager) and I. The son got irrationally mad and flung some papers through the room. I said I was not going to put up with that and walked away. 

I have never been so miserable in my life and I want to quit. It’s complicated to do so because of the pay and also because they’re now family.

Today I decided to stay home because I am mentally exhausted. I told my mother in law I’d work from home today because I’m very exhausted. She said something along the lines of “Aw, I should be the one staying home. That’s the whole point of why we brought you in” UGH. "

At first job (16) the manager, leaned on my thigh, touch my hand while I had it laying on the counter, brushed my butt when he walked behind me, and always asked me if I need a ride home at night.

At another job (16) the male manager verbally assaulted me and didn't give me last two paychecks.

At my great uncle's ice cream shop and diner (17), my great uncle asked me to sit on his lap and he rubbed my bare back under my shirt and told me that I don't shave like his girlfriend does. He also told me you don't know what I'd do to you if you weren't my great niece :(. He also verbally assaulted me and didn't pay me and fired me when I talked back to him.

At another job (18), my male coworker (not a manager this time but still) pushed me against the wall in the break room while we were alone and kissed me (like wtf?????).

At a nannying job (19-25), the grandfather, after his wife died, once rubbed my arm hair and apologized, then he started telling me stories about a chubby girl he had a crush on when he was my age and that she would dance for him and he loved it (I am chubby), and commented on my hair saying it made me look like a bad woman, and he eventually tried to ask me to stop by his house once in a while.

At a personal care assistant job (24), the husband of the women I cared for poked my poked my boob! 

I also work at place with almost all women cosmetics sales person and freelance artist) for 10 years (19-29) and I experienced no harassment from coworkers and managers. Just a little drama lol

At another job (28-29), the male manager would brush my butt when he walked behind me.

At my current job, on my first week an upper management male, happily married, told me he wanted to date a little 30 year old and then laughed and called himself a nasty old man and asked me if he still looks good for his age. Then in the same day my direct male manager made a joke about that sexual harassment training is not on how to do sexual harassment. I reported the only the nasty old man incident and my direct manager started to treat me in a retalitory manner afterwards (and treated me this way for years. And I know this because a year after the incident he made a mocking comment at a volunteer event ""why can't some 40 year olds hit on me"" and took a zoomed in picture of my feet in bright pink sandals and uploaded it to the work server under event pictures and even told everyone to check out my shoes at a meeting the next day). Then another guy from upper management walked out of his office with nothing but his underwear. Then a business partner cupped/patted my butt. Another business partner leaned on me and when pretended I didnt notice to be polite, leaned on me more!!! Another business partner brushed up against my back when I tried to give as much room as possible in a already wide hallway. And after I got a promotion, my new boss verbally harasses me when I try to ask questions or talk to him.

What I've learned from all of this is when I show men respect and trust, they think it's a pass to throw away their inhibitions.

I got a whopping 3% pay raise. I'm fortunate to have gotten a promotion and make significantly more than when I was hired but times have changed. Fast forward to this Monday my whole team of 30 operators were called in for a mandatory meeting with no idea what was going to be said. We received news that our $1 an hour skilled differential pay will be taken away by the time our raises kick in. Well in my case and most of my team I assume, taking a dollar an hour away after raises equals a pay cut! The reasoning we were given was that our differential pay is very uncommon and hard for payroll to manage. This has affected around 300 hourly employees in my facility. Rant over"
1,2024-03-07,Some fun math I did with Walmart executive's pay,u/Cymiril,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b8vv21/some_fun_math_i_did_with_walmart_executives_pay/,antiwork,"In 2021, Walmart's top six executives were paid, in total, nearly $80 million that year. That was down from 2020, when they were paid nearly $88 milion, including a sign on bonus of $44 million to one person, ""Global Chief Technology Officer"", Suresh Komar. (I found info for 2021 with mentions of 2020 very easily, I didn't search harder for 2022/23, I would assume it's likely similar or higher for those years.)


https://talkbusiness.net/2021/04/pay-for-top-six-walmart-execs-reaches-almost-80-million/


Walmart has approximately 1.6 million hourly associates in the United States.


https://corporate.walmart.com/askwalmart/how-many-people-work-at-walmart


If you make $30/hour for 40 hours a week, 52 weeks per year, that $62,400 gross pay.

If Walmart paid their 1.6 million associates $62,400 per year that would amount to $99.84 million dollars. 

A figure only slightly higher than the total pay for six people, and a little more than double what they gave one person as a sign on bonus.

1,600,000 people in the US could be paid a livable wage for slightly more than six people's pay, and all 1,600,006 of them work for the same company.

Don't let them lie to you. Nearly every company in the US is structured in a similar fashion, where the top ~10 people get 90% of the pay. Their greed is ruining the economy, not avacado toast."

1,2024-03-07,Question about Attendance Policies,u/best_egirl,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b8zcjx/question_about_attendance_policies/,antiwork,"So, I’ve been trying to wrap my head around the concept of this one attendance policy that I’ve been seeing lately across two of my most recent employments: 

Since when are companies allowed to disregard doctors notes stating the need for time off from work/excusing work absences? 

Just recently, I had gotten written up for attendance issues (3 days in 1 month, spaced throughout the month) without given a verbal warning first (whole other can of worms). I expressed that I had documentation for all of my absences and per the employee handbook they should have been excused absences. However, there was a line of text that said (not verbatim) employers could basically write you up for an absence despite having proper documentation. 

My documentation isn’t even something like convenient care either, it’s from my actual doctor and a hospital where I was in the ER. I’ve also been vocal about my condition since I started in December of last year, so it’s not anything new or surprising. I just haven’t been there long enough to qualify for medical coverage. (Minimum 6 months) 

When did companies start enforcing this bullshit policy into their attendance code? I only feel like this manager took their frustrations out on me bcus we had several other call-offs the week I got written up for from employees who arguably get away with worse at our job (ie, no call/no show to shifts, rude with customers, hours late everyday, yet somehow still employed). I have no idea if I should even go to the HR department about this either bcus I felt intimidated to sign my write-up slip. I really need this job to pay for my student loans but the whole fiasco has me unbelievably angry. "

In my mind, if I ease up on the caring, then the work won’t get done correctly and when an audit or inspection comes, we’ll be screwed and may lose some funding. I should mention I also have some OCD when it comes to paperwork. 

We just got our first bonus in two years today and it’s almost 1/3 of what it was two years ago. I am grateful for what I got, but for the work I do, might as well have given me $1.00.

From data entry to delegating tasks to talking to customers to talking to suppliers to making a quota of three hundred calls a day, anything and everything in between.

So yesterday we get to the job site and I go around the back side of my truck to get my tools and I'm standing there for what seems like a full minute waiting for him to join me to grab his tools. Well I peaked over around the passenger door and see he's downing a mini bottle of liquor, shakes his head really hard and then turns around to see if anyone saw him. He noticed I saw him and shoved the bottle in his backpack and then chugged his coffee to wash it down. I immediately texted my manager who has smelled liquor on this guy mid day many times (the morning is a different story. I've been in the trades my entire life, we're filled with heavy drinkers who go a little too hard each night. But we shouldn't be smelling it at noon). So after that we start working in the customers house and I smell it heavy on this guy. He's bumping our material into the customers walls and doors and furniture, not stacking things like he usually does, it's all in different places all over the work area. 

So I get back to the office later in the day and my manager promises me that this will be dealt with because this has been a perceived problem for a while now but this is the first confirmation he has of someone actually seeing him drinking on the job. I felt hopeful that he would be let go as I am very safety oriented and having someone drink on the job is not only dangerous for that person it's dangerous for me and for the homeowner. 

So I came in today and found out that he essentially got a slap on the wrist. I was livid, I had a very heated discussion with my manager, we were both frustrated at the situation and yelling at each other. Apparently the reasoning was that my manager doesn't have the authority to fire his employees somehow, and the only way for him to back up my claims is to drug test the guy (which it's obvious why that's not even an option now) or to have seen it himself which makes no sense since he stays in office and my position is out at job sites so he would never ever have a chance to see it. So I walked off. I told him this is absolutely unacceptable professionally and morally. 

This nonsense is what's really turning the workforce to shit right now. Instead of getting this guy some help that he needs or terminating him on the spot we just let him keep the job and put him in a position where it's safer for him to drink at work. What a joke. "

A month ago,  requested March 5th to be off, no problem. Last week, I looked at what I assume was the next week's schedule and saw that I was off both March 5th and the 6th. No big deal, just an extra day off for me.  Last night, my boss tries to call me, but I didn't have my phone with me and just noticed the call this morning that I was supposed to work last night. I text my boss back saying I made the mistake of assuming I had both days off and thought it was covered.   


So, I got terminated because my boss doesn't tolerate no call, no shows, and needs to rely on the employees to show up to their shifts.  

I've never called in these past 3 months, always done a good job, and this one time mistake on my part, a no call, no show because apparently I mis-read the schedule, I get terminated. Can't even give me a chance to rectify this or anything. 

I'm just feeling kind of bummed because I was hoping to keep this part time job to get ahead on a few bills and have my boss give me another chance. Oh well.

1,2024-03-07,From Zero to $200 in 2 weeks: My Micro SaaS Pre-sale Secret,u/rmanoj_11,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b91w61/from_zero_to_200_in_2_weeks_my_micro_saas_presale/,antiwork,"Hey Redditors,

&#x200B;

I bootstrapped my micro SaaS from zero traffic to $200 in pre-sales within 2 weeks. Here's how I did it during the idea stage, even without a massive following or SEO expertise.

&#x200B;

The Idea Stage:

&#x200B;

When I was building my first product, I didn't have much marketing knowledge. I focused primarily on development, which led to zero traffic on my site. I soon realized I needed to market effectively to generate leads and sales. So, I hired an SEO/SMO analyst to promote my product on social media and search engines. However, the analyst didn't have extensive knowledge about my SaaS product or the niche.

With limited followers on Twitter and LinkedIn, I realized promoting my product solely on social media wouldn't drive significant traffic. Since I lacked SEO knowledge, I thought writing blogs and sharing links across social channels would bring massive traffic. I created high-quality blogs and shared them, but only saw 1-10 visitors.

This led me to share the core points in the form of infographics. Here's where things changed: my existing followers paid attention, liked the posts, and I gained new followers while engaging with the existing ones. This experience sparked an idea, and I discovered that this might be a new marketing strategy many businesses could benefit from.

&#x200B;

How I Validated My Idea?

&#x200B;

To validate my idea, I used both free and paid tools (which I'll detail in a future article). Building a landing page felt outdated; a waitlist page could be more effective for capturing leads. I created my waitlist page using a no-code tool called [momentum.page](https://momentum.page). The landing page had a catchy tagline in the hero section, an option to join the waitlist, and clear use cases.

I then shared the landing page on subreddits, requesting feedback on the idea. This generated significant traffic – around 1.4k page views within 24 hours – and over 150 users joined the waitlist, a first for me. Most of them provided valuable feedback, helping me understand what features to prioritize in development.

&#x200B;

How I Started Generating Revenue?

&#x200B;

Before building, I wanted to ensure user willingness to pay. During interactions on the subreddits, I directly asked if they'd pay for such a tool. Some responded with ""maybe, if it meets our expectations."" This gave me hope that I could build a valuable tool and generate revenue.

However, I craved more convincing data before diving into development. I added a pre-order option to my waitlist page, offering discounts to early supporters. I then informed a select group of waitlisted users about the pre-order option – and some started buying!

Here's the landing page that worked for me: [https://infography.in](https://infography.in)

Surprise HR meeting at 7am, only confirmed few concerns but didn’t feel comfortable voicing them all because supervisor was in the room. Supervisor accused me of not doing actual work after sudden work change after I voiced racism concerns in the work place, personally dealing with racism. Now being accused of stealing company time and punished.


Now I’m contemplating on quitting outright because of the attitude and way I’m being treated. I really put my time into this place even when my work went unnoticed. I understand things can happen that we can’t control but why do I have to deal with the repercussions when I’m just trying to do my actual job? I’ve bent over backwards and done everything ever asked of me. 

I don’t want to deal with unemployment again but I feel so used and neglected. The anxiety has me feeling rough. I don’t want to put my family through this. I feel crazy for saying anything. I should have never said how I felt.

HELP ME PLEASE,u/Hot-Scar-3440,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b94kd7/insanely_terrible_management_help_me_please/,antiwork,"I work at a farm that houses now 28 horses (she lost business and maybe 4 or 5 boarders left that were very huge in her barn) , small town, terrible leader and has no understanding of how to fire people. I quit last year for the same issue. My boss making my work environment a miserable place to be so I would leave because she does not ""fire"" people. This I've also heard her say is her tactic so she will get people to leave so she does not have to fire them. Why I don't know....just terrible person over all.  Came back to pursue a career in horses and there are very few barns around me. 

She talks about her failing marriage to me personally, I've had her husband touch up on me and say very inappropriate sexual things, there was also a case where a girl came out about it and he played the sad guy part and of course she believed it and said terrible things about her then talking to me telling me she knows her husband would ""never cheat on her"" which is a lie. Makes it a friendship and not a professional work setting which I'm sick of.

The past 2 months I've worked my ass off to pick up shifts during the week every time my coworker calls off, practically being on call whenever she wants even on days off, working in snow storms we've had, lunging her horses and saying ""it would be good training for you"" when she was taking advantage of the fact I wanted to go somewhere career wise with horses, asked to walk someone else's horse because she ""can't"" or the owner is too lazy to because this horse was on stall rest for an injury. Which then I'm shoved into over drive mentally emotionally and badly physically from working as much as I was and with a boss that rushes EVERYTHING to save on money. She does 4 stalls in 10 mins when she rushes, does not clean waters correctly everything smells bad in our automatic waters slime and algae built up behind the lip of the waters, I'm nit picked at for how I've been doing things and now nothing is good enough once yet again just like the year before. 

It's a pretty simple job with simple tasks I've been doing for almost 3 years. I feed, give horses medications from a syringe and reset it, Hay horses inside in the hay loft and restacking bales at the holes when needed and (out side during winter months with hay in the back of a 4 wheeler there are 7 fields 28 horses to throw hay to), do stalls which are pretty large in the area I live in maybe 8ft by 9ft and 2 stalls 12ft by 14ft, have to spread with a spreader which is maybe 50 lbs max with weight taken off of with two tires and attached to a 4 wheeler (this will come into play later), heavy bed stalls which can be hard to sift through, and refill bucked 10 at a time with sawdust bedding. My hours are now being cut by my boss, she comes in and refuses to allow us to turn horses out, she will say she's saving money when she's just cutting all her workers hours, telling us to just do stalls and hay and leave. My pay was raised to 13 an hour this past February without me asking because of the work I was doing. Now most of my hours are being cut because I'm the one making the most money. Not being asked to lunge, turn horses out, she's allowing amateur people who have only started to work there try and do that and the one girl got hit in the nose from a unruly horse which has always given issues because she's refusing to ask me out of spite when I know how to handle every horse in that barn.

I have an EXTREAMLY unstable coworker that will SCEAM and yell at my boss, won't communicate and argues to my boss about how we do things after my boss shows her how. Then my coworker expects me to go along with it when I'm fairly someone who just stays quiet in those situations, I would get calls from my boss asking why her pay roll is going up......What do I say? I bust my ass and try to get done, I have to modify her stalls and not clean it thoroughly, I have a coworker hitting horses, Shanking, hitting and yelling at them down an isle when they take 1 step in front of her, I've seen her hit them in the face, most horses are now becoming head shy. She's lunged a horse that was a boarders because it was upset for being left alone in the field and was anxious to come in when she was never asked to do so, lunged my bosses horse that hasn't been in work for 3 years and has dead bone in his leg when he was ""unruly"" walking into his field, she took a horse that was completely shaved took his blanket off and shoved him in the cross ties and left it there for who knows how long with 2 huge bay doors open on a 35 degree day for my boss to walk in and see, for this grown ass woman to argue and yell at my boss because she was pissed to see that while 2 lessoners were there listening to the whole thing. All these horses are very very well mannered and do not cause issues.

 I'm a very well respected worker from horse owners, people who lesson and other co workers, everyone enjoys seeing me and strikes up a conversation , thanking me for all the work I do. I had one boarder that left tell me she hopes they treat me right because I'm such a diligent worker and care for these animals from heart and I do. I treat every one of these horses as if I had my own, Treating them with care and respect, always trying  to understand their actions whether it be dangerous or not. Looking over them every day to see if I have to communicate a pulled shoe or a sore horse or any other injury for that matter to my boss with pictures, notes or taking a temperature. Helping boarders with any concerns or anxieties they may have. Always smiling and keeping a positive attitude even when I just want to leave the place. 

There was an incident that happened recently, I came up to my unruly coworker and kindly asked if I could show her a better way of raking outside the stalls, she was taking her time and raking 3 or 4 times before moving on (a way people space out time to get more hours which = better pay, which then I get calls about why payroll is up and IM LOOKED AT) So I asked if I could show her, also my boss showed me last week when this woman in her 30's that is always calling off  so I'm always working with my boss so I offered her some help. 

She starts flipping out at me, screaming and yelling how she doesn't need me to tell her how to do her job. Screaming that I have an  issue with her, I calmly said ""This is why I get frustrated because this is how you communicate"" and I walked away and went to go sign out on our shit piece of paper that logs our hours. I ask my boss may I leave and she asks me to rake behind my coworker, I informed her I was just yelled at for offering help. She pulls me back to my coworker and asked what the problem was. I stood there watching my boss lay into her about how she is not receptive and things always change (something I know and always ask questions about) She continues screaming at me and my boss about how we both have an issue with her, how she's doing her job and need no one else to tell her how to do so (great coworker right) there was more to it but I genuinely cant remember everything she was saying I was in shock a 34 year old woman was acting this way because I asked to show her how to do something more efficiently as I've been told from my boss. 

My boss asks if we were okay to finish up, I said yes she said yes and she finished chucking her stall and I raked, as she pulled it up to the next stall I stopped to wait for her to get on pressing my body up against a wall to let her have some room to get on the 4 wheeler, she turn around after my boss walked away and points her finger in my face and screams ""IDK WHAT THE FUCK YOU PROBLEM IS WITH ME..."" and I stopped it there. I put my hand up and said in a calm voice do not point at me and do not yell at me, move along and I made a traffic motion with my hands, at this point I'm really not having it.

 I just want to be done with work so I can go home and be out if this situation I'm not someone who confronts or likes confrontation.  She walks away and starts yelling at my boss again, I make a double take behind me and she was out of the way, I hop on the 4 wheeler and drive it forward to hear my boss yell ""WOAH"" I stop look back and THEN she fall down making it the most cartoon looney toons fall I've ever fucking seen in my life, I've seen children with better acting than this woman. Apparently I ran over her foot with the spreader tire, could I have miss judged possibly but I know what I saw and she was out of the way. Also what dumb ass stands directly next to a running piece of equipment. 

My boss and I hop up to help her, she's just fine gets up and starts yelling again about the same dumb shit from before, how idk what I'm doing (been there for 3 years she's been there for not even a year)  How everyone is against her, how she doesn't like her work environment. She goes to sign out and walk away stomping down the isle like a child in a fit of rage yelling the whole way down, coming back yelling more. We then get to the point where she asks us to finish again.  Coworker stays, finishes and leaves. 

My boss said I ran over her foot and she should be okay. 20 mins later my boss gets a text saying her foot is bruised, the next day this woman called the cops and is filing for workers comp. Its been about a week, my boss is blaming me and saying I was negligent and I was in the wrong. Not her shit fucking management, not her refusing to fire people who create this type of environment, not the shit worker she hired but me....I bring drama she says, I bring issues without resolving them she said to me....so now I'm stuck working with a boss that hates being around me for her way of communication with people and her shit management. 

This woman has no money to be running a farm, she is cutting hours for her own money reasons when just 2 weeks ago I was seen as her best employee and I'm now getting ignored, cut back hours and a shit attitude from her. I'm supposed to have a interview March 21st for a new horse job and she's my main reference, It's either find another job now and go with that (grocery store, retail, ect.) or quit all hope in pursuing a passion in horses....Idk what to do the situation she's put me in is insane. 

I cant eat, sleep, I cant even go to the bathroom correctly my GI tract is fucked up from the stress of this. I've been throwing up from migraines. I'm terrified my boss with throw me under the bus to save her ass and this coworker will come after me with legal reparations. I've spent countless hours this past week researching workers comp, can I get sued by a coworker for an accident? I'm so stressed over everything, I feel hopeless, I feel like I'm back at square 1 after working so hard to be on her good side and I can't cope with stress of it. "

At the end of the meeting I asked my director if we could look into upping my hours or possibly expediting a raise I’m scheduled to get at the end of the month. My boyfriend’s job is having some instability and almost couldn’t make payroll last week, so I wanted to see what I could do on my end to increase our financial stability. 

This morning I got pulled into a meeting with my director where she told me that not only is it impossible to up my hours, but I didn’t deserve it because I wasn’t meeting expectations. This was such a huge slap in the face because less than 48 hours earlier she was singing my praise and telling everyone how impressed she was with me. When I asked for examples, she vaugly mentioned the phones ringing too much and one time she came to me with an unexpected task while I was in the middle of a rush and I apparently didn’t agree to take it on with enough enthusiasm. 

I. Am. Livid.

 I took this job, which is technically beneath me in both pay and skill level, because the organization is a nonprofit for a cause I believe in. I have done nothing but go above and beyond since day one, which was clearly a mistake on my part. I can make more money doing instacart/doordash than I make here. It’s honestly taking every ounce of self-control to not walk out the door immediately. I’m taking this as a lesson learned, never expect compassion and understanding from any boss ever, and never accept work that’s beneath me, even for a cause I believe in.

I worked for health tech company for about 6 months and went on leave at that point (December) for long-standing medical issues that have recently gotten to a point where I really can't sit down and do a job for 9+ hours a day. My short-term disability (STD) and medical insurance were offered directly from my employer as they're self-insured (this is a really terrible thing that I think should be illegal).

They wanted a form filled out attesting to my disability. I said, fine, and I got that done and sent that in and figured everything would be good for a while. After about 4 or 5 weeks, I start getting emails from HR saying, hey we need you to have that form filled out again because we need to know a more definitive date of when you're coming back to work. I've been quite clear and open with them that my issues did not leave me in a place where I would probably be able to come back to work at any point soon but they want it from a doctor. 

Eventually they start sending me emails saying, hey if you don't get this form redone and sent into us by a certain date, we're going to cancel your benefits immediately. I spent a few weeks going to my doctors all of them pointing fingers at each other saying, go to one of your other doctors, before finally getting my PCP to fill the form out. That was late February. Employer let me know I have till March 4th and then I'd be terminated since the form from my provider was stating my leave would need to be indefinite. I believe they kept me on until March 4th because of the fact that my STD did not run out until then (again, offered directly for my employer as they're self-insured). It sucks but I was expecting that. What I wasn't expecting was that they would terminate all of my benefits on the same day. Well, March 6th comes and they email me and let me know medical is canceled immediately as of that date (not sure why two days later than expected) and everything else should be good to the end of the month. 

Today, March 7th, I go to the dentist and find out, well, nope, they've canceled everything effective March 6th and I no longer have any insurance at all. I just feel like it's kind of crappy that they're not going to give me coverage through to the end of the month but this is a pretty bad company so I guess I shouldn't be too surprised. So now I'm just uninsured which will make treating my conditions next to impossible. With any luck I'll get Medicaid at some point, but I'm not holding my breath for a decision to happen anytime soon.

TL;DR 
I'm disabled and have been struggling to work for a while. Employer is self-insured and was offering medical and STD directly but terminated my benefits on the same day they terminated me (around the time my STD ran out), even though they told me non-medical covearges would be good to the end of the month, which is a normal thing that most employers do. I'm now uninsured and really need healthcare."

The incomprehensible horror show that is this evil idiotic country just keeps getting clusterfuckier.

To save lives in our un/dysregulated shit system: turn off AI; turn off plastic, PFAS, petrochemicals, pesticides, and all other poisons; turn off tax evasion to channel that revenue toward fixing shit (except our current tax scheme generally takes from the poor to make the rich richer while spending trillions on horrors, so maybe let's model Scandinavia and ignore overly patriotic bootlickers who fear the word SOCIALISM). Actually, forget my trite demands. A better deterrent to the creation of sociopathic ultrarich supervillains would be mansion-seeking drones with friendly care packages on them. We live in a country where, because of profit-above-all incentive structures and regulatory capture, we breathe increasingly poisoned air, drink increasingly poisoned water, eat increasingly poisoned food, wear poisoned clothes often made out of petrochemicals, and wash ourselves with soapy poison that we squeeze out of toxin-leeching plastic containers while flowers spread in melting Antarctica. 24 states are currently suing the EPA for trying to get poison out of the air. Ill-gotten money has exponentially outsized power owing to Citizens United and filthy lucre being classified as speech, so we can only elect elites who represent the ultra-elite. Our exhausted doctors' main priorities are making money and avoiding liability in a hellscape where the attack vector of toxic substance exposure is endless yet expanding. Some of cancer's profiteers: Chemours; DuPont; 3M; Syngenta; Archer Daniels Midlands; General Mills; Altria; Bayer; GlaxoSmithKline; Pfizer; ExxonMobil; Shell; Chevron; hospitals that are increasingly owned by private equity and make money by treating the sicknesses created by the aforementioned corporations; politicians who are elected and fed money by these corporations, and so on. Most of us resignedly acknowledge the well-oiled revolving door between industry and government regulators, meaning, our institutions and health are so intertwinably fucked that sometimes, when I get overwhelmed by the fuckedness, I start feeling sympathy for people with a tear-it-all-down & dare I say right-wing mindset. Certain corporations are legally sickening/encancering just about every living thing on earth, yet part of the reason we can't comprehend let alone address this is because of its unprecedented scale, which brings to mind the awful Stalinist truism that one death is a tragedy, one million is a statistic. Does that make billions an abstraction? I'm obviously waiting for the cannibalistic justice chefs who will turn villains into villainburgers, but it's a long wait, so maybe I calm down and imagine that current bald poster child for American business dynamism, Scott Galloway, who loves saying that there's nothing wrong with America that can't be fixed by what's right with America. Galloway's notion is overly optimistic. According to a recent headline, American homelessness can be solved with something like 20 billion, which Fuckzos, Fuckerberg, Fffusk, Gatefucks, or the fucking disgusting government could easily take care of. But aspirant trillionaires would rather hoard & swim in their money like Scrooge McDuck than ensure their survival via saintly beneficence. See Abigail Disney or MacKenzie Scott or Dolly Parton for the possibility of relatively good rich people. To paraphrase Sam Harris, a smart wealthy intellectual who is chummy with the ultrawealthy: at some point you have to see the pitchforks coming. Maybe Sora can help us visualize certain guilty rich folx being pitchfork-prodded onto a gangplank over a huge stainless steel industrial vat of boiling plastic as another recent headline from The Guardian is decreed via megaphone: ""Microplastics found in every human placenta tested in study.""

Oh, since this is antiwork I should mention work: there was a move in the right direction during covid when a financial floor was put under a lot of us (don't you dare call expanded unemployment benefits an experiment in UBI) and companies got desperate for employees and thus provided remote work and better pay and other incentives that should be typical instead of our federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Here's a pessimistic outlook: this AI bullshit could be interpreted as a way to intentionally rescind that sliver of leverage from millions of expendable workers, thus giving power back to companies who can then flaunt earnings growth and laugh at our quaint preference for STAYING ALIVE, let alone being happy once in a while. Even Trader Joe's has caught the Killer Capitalist bug and is now attacking the National Labor Relations Board for protecting employees. Fuck you workers, you can croak after the machines replace you, and those of you who beg hard enough for menial jobs can go back to in-office, low pay, dead ends, independent contractor status, no/shit healthcare, pointless if not socially harmful work, et cetera. We will not manage this AI devolution gracefully, and we would be incredibly lucky to live up to Churchill's quip (paraphrased) that Americans can be counted on to do the right thing after all other options have been exhausted. We are criminalizing homelessness while we create homelessness, and it seems like our de facto method for addressing homelessness is to encourage self-extermination via opiates > Purdue Pharma > the Sacklers and other ultrafucks like the Sacklers who reward doctors for selling drugs. We could be housing the homeless in the offices that nobody wants to work in. What we need: turn off AI, sufficiently guardrail and tax it so that its bounty funds universal health care and free education and compensates the populace that created its training data, then turn it back on. What we get: Nvidia go brrr. Have you seen Sam Altfuck's face? That guy is clearly EVIL, his old board of directors knew it, and he doesn't even smirk about it like Fuckzos.

I can imagine certain comfy libertarian-minded careerists (tech workers in particular) who might accuse me of whining, which leads into the free will discussion. The thriving well-compensated workers I know were born into privilege, middle class or higher. They also generally avoided life-derailing setbacks and traumas. In other words, they were nurtured into becoming who they are, and they had no say in being born into those fortuitous conditions. Hell, if you're decently moneyed and networked you can still serially fail upward like Hunter Biden. Privileged people don't like thinking of themselves as undeserving, as not being the authors of their thriving fates, and classist condescension toward struggling people who weren't born with sufficient tools to thrive is ignorant and cruel and is rooted in disgust, which is a survival instinct. The idealist in me knows that 99 percent of us would live vastly better lives under a Rawlsian veil of ignorance, whereby a just society gets built by not knowing in advance our positions within it. If I had merely been born in Canada or Denmark I would've had a fighting chance at counteracting disadvantages that my ""peers"" can't relate to, and let me preempt you right there if you feel an urge to say You're whining, just figure it out, with a No, fuck you, give me every structural/social/monetary/health/educational/familial/stabilizing advantage you didn't earn yet built your life on you lucky American pig and instead try to make gold out of lead when you can't even borrow an alchemy set in this rapacious country that enshittified the world and in which young moneyless me just so happened to develop cancer twice.

The Agent Smith in all of us embraces the cliche of humanity being a virus. This infectious country thinks it can solve the life extinction problem caused by its own capitalistic, non-symbiotic, host-consuming excess by stoking, you guessed it, capitalistic, non-symbiotic, host-consuming excess. The radio show Marketplace pays endless uncritical tribute to the American Consumer. But the American Consumer is the problem. We aren't born with a desire to buy washing machines and sofas and cars and flights, but we are born with a general preference for fairness, so when the person next to you has more than you your striving/jealousy gets activated and you feel a need to keep up with the Joneses (or if you're a monkey or crow you might physically rectify the unfairness, probably via equalizing attack). Fauna also have a drive to demonstrate fitness as mates, and performative consumption easily serves this role for humans. These and other base instincts are exploited by canny advertisers at the behest of corporations for the sake of incepting demand into our brains which drives stock prices and GDP up and helps us inflate our way out of 34 trillion dollars of national debt. Accepting our world as finite might mean normalizing flat or declining revenue and embracing an economy that needs to go doughnut, to borrow Kate Raworth's rebranding of full sustainability. Of course, we aren't even doing half of a half-assed attempt at circular economics and preventing climate disaster, let alone shifting our focus from Gross Domestic Product to Gross National Happiness, as practiced in Bhutan. The big US banks recently abandoned the Equator Principles, aka unenforceable climate commitments. Onshoring means we are mining more poisonous raw materials in America instead of importing them from China and other countries that were cheaply bearing our environmental brunt. We are creating factory jobs at home, but a free market prefers to automate before treating human workers well. We are drilling so much more that we have become the world's largest exporter of liquified natural gas, which means increased fracking, which has these pesky negative externalities of poisoning our groundwater and creating fun little earthquakes and slowing the adoption of sustainable energy. We are plundering the seafloor by chasing precious-metal nodules to make, among other landfill-destined things, planned obsolescence electronics that make us idiots, and we intend to mine in space which is harder to get to because of the growing shell of orbital junk that we have encased ourselves in. Bidenomics seeks to recreate the postwar boom, but a lot of non-fringe economists now view that boom as an anomaly, which means we are now reverting to the mean of scarcity. Tipping points are being breached faster than anticipated. Trying to grow our way out of depletion is insane and is accelerating collapse. In a world where most economic activity is in some way harmful, antiwork is prosurvival."

I could go on but I think you can see my point. Our ancestors died for us to have better working conditions, but modern “poor people” can’t go without a couple of paychecks?

In August, I got a promotion but in the same meeting they told me new people didn’t like my jokes. I was furious and upset as I didn’t think I was that bad, people make way worse jokes than me (mine aren’t dirty, just dad jokes), and I work damn hard, about three people’s jobs, and go above and beyond 

So, I shut up. I now only make maybe 2 jokes if that a day. Other people in the office objectify drivers, make …sexual jokes, racist, etc. loudly, most of the time. Some people Take long breaks and fill up their water 5 times a day, then make tea, then chat in the kitchen for 20 minutes a few times a day. 

I used to report these things, but I realised I don’t want to be that person. So I don’t. But it’s clear to see. I’m not their manager, it’s not up to me.

Today I had my performance review and got told my communication with colleagues is the main negative point. That’s “we’ve” mentioned it a few times before to me???

Apart from this I am an “asset” to my manager. 

Even suggested that I look at the “communications in the workplace” course. 

What. 

I’m at a loss because I thought I had greatly improved on this?? The only thing I can do is just shut up totally unless asked about a work question?

Or leave. 

So I can only think of this woman. She started 4 months ago. I’ve been there 2 years. When my manager isn’t around she makes sexual/inappropriate jokes.

Tl:dr - review today, I need to shut up "

People in the past and now all decided “yep I’m gonna work 8-9 hours a day and then sit an hour in traffic on the way home for everyday of my life”? Like they didn’t know they had the power to dictate what companies could do or not? If they all said “nah we’re gonna work 20 hours and you’ll be happy” the companies would have no choice but to follow their demands. 

But of course most humans are pretty dumb and can’t think long term and only think in immediate terms. Even in the early days of the Industrial Revolution where the men would work even longer and risk their bodies for a few coins, which imo was idiotic because back to my earlier point, they could’ve legit just said “nah you’re not subjecting us to these conditions”. But the majority of society just agreed indirectly with giving companies power over them so they could obtain some worthless materialistic items and b*tch about their jobs. 

People would rather hate their life and jobs than actually do something about it, which shows how weak we’ve become as a species. So instead they’re all just drones wasting their precious 1 life away doing something they hate and having no time for actual meaningful things, family. Ok that’s all."

I work with almost all women who are VERY different than me, which is totally fine with me but they are always talking out loud about politics and religion. Well one day the conversation of religion came up and my coworkers and my boss all said that they would never want to hire someone who did not believe in god. Meanwhile, i am agnostic and have been for almost a decade. They do not know this but the look on my face when they said this very well could have given it away. They have also made comments stating “anyone who voted for Joe biden is an idiot” and how they agree with the ruling in Alabama about IVF and they all have Jesus paraphernalia plastered all over their cubicles. This is hard for me because I feel like I have to pretend that I go to church and what not just so I’ll get a good reference when I leave this job considering my own boss claimed she would never hire a nonbeliever. 

There is also an insane amount of cliquey, mean behavior including being “nice” to people in front of their faces and the moment they leave the room ridiculing their outfits, how they breathe, etc. Some women will go out of their way to exclude others from conversations or even saying hi to them and talk shit about them within earshot of them. Some will even hide in their cubicles to avoid conversations with some people.  I have worked in offices before and this behavior has never been an issue. I need advice on how to handle this because I need to at least stay at this job for a year but the behaviors are so baffling to me that I’m finding my mental health suffering having to be in the office everyday. Any advice on getting through this year is helpful because this is a new job and quitting is not an option. It also goes without saying that I live in one of the Bible Belt states lol. "

I started with a plumbing company 4 months ago, really small outfit, like 3 trucks small. I've been demolishing it since I started, sold $70,000 my first month in my truck. The owner is hard as hell to work with, we've been through 2 marketing companies since I started, this is apparently just how he is. The counter associates at the supply houses have all warned me about his inconsistency. Since he fired the ""best marketing company in the plumbing industry"" over a disagreement, we've hardly had enough calls to flush out a full day every day, my sales have taken the hit and I've barely cleared $30k sold. (I'm paid hybrid hourly/commission, so this effects me directly.) Not only that but since I couldn't find my hiring paperwork, they screwed me over on my commission so now I make less than anyone else local in the industry. (went from 8% from $25k-$39,999 and 13% from $40k or more to at most 8.5% for $60k or more.)

Now, where my real frustration has begun, is my wife, my kids, and I are all sick. Like haven't kept food down in a week sick. This upstanding example of an owner has failed to get me the insurance coverage that was apart of my job offer. I'm missing work and I can't go see a doctor. How does he handle this? By telling me I ""need to be healthier"" and that I'm at fault because I haven't gotten insurance yet. (It's a different story every time I talk to him, one day I buy marketplace insurance and he comps the cost on my paycheck, next day it's a plan he sets up and he has a phone number he'll send me to finish the paperwork, number never comes.) At this point, I think he's blowing smoke up my ass and I'm about done.

Rent's paid for 2 months (Thank you, IRS!) and I need to get my butt somewhere with health insurance, or get my recently graduated college wife into a good position so I can take care of the homestead, since my back's screwed to all hell anyways. "

One of the main issues we face with this boss is their passion for unnecessary business trips, despite not being physically fit for them.

Just a few days ago, we had a meeting to plan a business trip, and someone actually suggested extending the trip by a day to allow the boss to rest due to their age and mobility limitations. Although this may seem unusual in countries like the US, it is unfortunately common in my country. The fact that someone expects special treatment simply because of their age and not due to a legitimate need or inability to fulfill their job responsibilities is frustrating. This extended trip duration not only increases costs for the team in terms of hotels and allowances, but it also disrupts our schedules and makes it challenging for us to return home earlier.

Furthermore, this older boss takes advantage of the office facilities by not only using them to generate income but also for personal reasons. For example, they have used human resources to become some sort of caregiver for themselves, which is not within our job descriptions. This not only creates additional burden for us but also infringes upon our personal time and affects our ability to spend time with our own families and take holidays.

In conclusion, working with older workers can sometimes feel like being forced into a caregiver role for someone who is unable to take care of themselves but insists on remaining in their job. This can be demanding and impact our work-life balance, particularly when their demands are not within the scope of our responsibilities and come at the expense of our personal time."

My employers at this long term job have offered me the position of manager more than once but I turn it down because it’s a salary job that demands your availability to be 7 days a week and the pay is only $4 an hour more than what I was getting. I enjoyed choosing my schedule, it was worth the small pay differential.

In my 4 years, I have had 4 managers  quit/fired/walked out, and more coworkers quit/fired/walked out than I can count. My entire department had a new manager and new team members every single year. I was the only one who stayed through all of them. Has anyone else worked at a place like that?

They recently hired yet another outside hire to be manager. While we’ve had some questionable ones in the past (most quit after a few months), this new guy was one of the most insufferable people I have met in my life who clearly only took the job because he enjoys positions of power. The other day I hit my limit. I told him that his behavior is horrible and that I quit. 

I don’t wanna rant too much so I’ll get to my main question for y’all in a bit, just a little more pretense. 

My folks have high expectations of me to have a professional job and make good money, that’s why I stayed there for so long. I can’t shake this overwhelming sense of guilt and inadequacy because I could have just grit my teeth and continued to put up with it.

My question for everyone is: Was my job’s turnover rate a clear indicator that I was in an objectively bad work environment? I don’t have any other experiences to compare it to. Is it normal for people to constantly get new coworkers and bosses who only stay for a few months and then leave after some dramatic walk out or firing?

I sent a second follow up text to show I was still interested and available and it never delivered.

I went to the doctors today and told her everything I'm going through she told me that if I don't have a diagnosis then she can't fill out the forms which is fair enough, I guess. Anyways, she didn't suggest anywhere for me to go to to get a diagnosis and all she said was she would write a note for my work to give me some lenience for calling off (which I can't see them doing that since they are very strict about absences). Do I need to find a psychologist to give me a diagnosis for anxiety or depression for me to be able to take time off work? Will they be able to give me a note for time off too? I'm very confused how this works and nobody is being much help. I don't think I can force myself to go to work and suffer much longer, which is unfortunate because it's a decent paying job. I also talked to other people who had stress leave approved who work at the same place and they said they had no issues with work or their doctor.

Now we do get to listen to music on a portable speaker when we're on the floor, so when I'm processing FedEx or inspecting the outgoing product I will blast my speaker. Usually, I'll put on my main playlist [Wage Slave Simulator - Sound Track](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2DgHBmsksie6J5DB5PYIVq?si=5e56068fddc041b6) or a new album that just came out. 

A lot of the guys don't mind what I play or will Jam to the kind of music I'm playing. My real problem is this old head who's so obnoxious, he keeps demanding that I play ""The Who"" and that my music makes him want to cut his wrists. And I feel really bad for the guy because he's smoked most of his brain cells away, has more kids than teeth in his head, and has no impulse control where he punched a guy at the park because their 10-year-old daughters were in an argument. But every time I bring up his behavior to my supervisor he feels like I'm snitching on him, TBH I don't give a fuck anymore and will play whatever I want."

My student loan debt payment is 157 dollars a month and that is without any special things like deferment or income based.  I think paying 157 dollars is worth a 70,000 year income.  The great thing about being a nurse is you never have to put up with any crap from bosses or jobs.  It is so easy to find a job as a nurse.  If i work at a place and a boss wants to talk shit to me i just say fuck it and quit.  I can literally walk into a place and get hired on the spot.  I have actually quit a job because they pissed me off and on my way home stopped at a facility and been hired on the spot.  The great thing about nursing is instead of just getting a diploma you get a license which is far more valuable.  i always say, I dont work for a company i work for me and my license.  There is such a need for nurses and the pay is great.  Stop being abused and take control of your life.  "

I have hated the place since the second I set foot in the door, but it paid decently and I needed a job after being laid off during covid. Nearly four years later and things have been building up for a while, but circumstances didn't allow me to quit without disrupting several aspects of my life.

For some background, my ex-boss is notoriously hard to get along with. He has some redeeming qualities, but they don't excuse his rage problems. I want to preface this by saying I have no problem with anyone being religious nor what religion you are, if any. He is a hyper-religious Evangelical Christian from the bible belt with a huge ego and narcissistic tendencies. Micromanager to the fullest. The turnover at my former company is insanely high.

He is openly racist, bigoted, homophobic, transphobic, misogynistic and talks shit about literally everyone he knows behind their back. We have had several conversations about how many of the things he says are inappropriate and make me uncomfortable. He pretends to listen and then immediately go back to making jokes and making fun at me being offended. Normally, I just don't engage or I'll just leave the room.

He hired someone to be my assistant a year ago because the work load got heavy and I had been having health problems that led me to have to take time off for doctors appointment and such. Prior to the hire of my assistant, I was solely responsible for running my department. At first I was grateful to have help, but quickly learned that I was now having to babysit this guy in addition to getting both our workloads done because he is completely incompetent and refuses to be taught. He is also openly racist, homophobic, transphobic, and misogynistic. If weaponized incompetence had a poster child, it would be my assistant. 

Long story long, my boss, a grown man, decides to insult and berate me, screaming and yelling and cussing at me because of a mistake that my assistant made. Literally opened and slammed the door repeatedly while screaming at the top of his lungs at me, like a toddler.

I have spent the last two weeks busting my ass to get multiple emergency jobs completed while he was on vacation. I truly care about my work and have a strong work ethic. I way too much guilt for asking for my needs to be met. No more. I'm done.

This behavior was not his first outburst, but the door slamming over and over was a new addition. I have PTSD, anxiety and auADHD/autism. I don't handle this kind of thing well.

This was my last staw. I blew the fuck up. This is the last time he speaks to me like that. I refuse to do this anymore. I probably shouldn't have, but I screamed right back at him, grabbed my things and left. He will probably be too proud anyway, but I don't plan on responding to any texts, calls, emails. I expect they will find out how much I really do around there and its going to be glorious. I only wish I was a fly on the wall to see the chaos. They will recover, but I hope they get a little taste of their own medicine in the meantime.

Sorry for the long rant. This all just happened a few hours ago and I'm still processing. I don't have anything else lined up and money is tight. I'll be updating the ol resume tomorrow and start applying for something more meaningful. I got my degree less than a year ago, so really I'm looking at it as the push I needed to get out of there. It literally feel like I'm getting out of an abusive relationship of sorts, no disrespect intended. I'm just going to trust that things are going to work out and at least I'll never have to deal with that place ever again."

From the get go the manager is a bit of an oddball, but not a complete piece of shit, so I think I’m okay.

I think wrong. Guy proceeds to get up on me and another young woman’s case of occasional tardiness (once or twice a month) due to our long commutes (45+ min w traffic, have to pass through downtown). And you know what? It’s fine. It’s valid. I might’ve been slightly miffed, but sure, he has a point.

Male coworker B who lives 5 blocks down starts calling off every week. Like clockwork. What the hell does he get? Passes, slaps on the wrist, and this goes on for months. Me and my female coworker A are baffled. In fact, he even gets complimented for doing the bare minimum, whereas we’re nitpicked on little things—and I’ll admit, I’m no overachiever, but coworker A is, much moreso than B—and yet she receives no credit.

I start to notice more little things. How said manager got upset at Coworker A for taking a 15 minute bathroom break once when she was ill but let a male coworker regularly take 20 min worth of one. How he made a female retail banker cry. His tone of voice with males vs females. Nail on the coffin? Female coworker A was getting sexually explicit messages sent by another senior male coworker and confided in the manager, only for him to basically say, “contact HR if you want”.

???

Manager refused to call for action or protect his female employee. I’m actually disgusted. A is an immigrant with a slight language barrier and he just didn’t offer any help at all; I’m guessing he’s trying to bury it. Maybe I’m being dramatic or bitter, but god, the reality of corporate America is disgusting and I can’t believe these men with 0 respect or consideration for women are allowed into power in this day and age."

My contract states I will receive pay 'On or before the 10th of each month.' Basically the 10th is payday but I have also been told by my manager that they do not pay on a weekend. So if the 10th falls on a Saturday or Sunday it will be paid on the Friday.


Today I have received no money even though this is the day I should be paid. This has happened once before and when I brought it up with them they said it would come through on the following Monday, which it did. They were generally very dismissive of it and even said some people are paid the Friday and some the Monday... which was strange to me.


I assume it will be the same this Monday but my concern is this is technically a breach of contract that has now happened twice. I wouldn't mind just accounting for the Monday but 90% of the time when the 10th is on a weekend it DOES come on the Friday.


Do you think this is worth kicking a fuss about? The first time this happened I had payments due on that Friday and it was a huge mess to reschedule. I since learned from that and scheduled everything for the 12th but its really a pain to not know exactly if I will have money for things or not, it seems very inconsistent.

So I just got this job at this plant Kimberly-Clark. I got on with this janitor crew out there that’s a contractor for this plant, so I work for an actual janitorial service. I’ve only been here for a week. First day, I went on a tour of the plant to see what all I’d be doing. I’m in the role of a janitor. There are 4 of us in this great big half a mile long, brand newly remodeled hallway that stretches the length of the plant and is break rooms, cafeterias, offices, and bathrooms, and other such places. While on the tour, I was realizing that a lot of stuff was covered in a thin white dust from the plant. There’s fuzzballs from the toilet paper that they make in the plant. So, I was walking through a break room, and these people that are working with the plant are looking at me and my crew that’s getting down around like we’re the scum of the earth, and I was like, sheezzz, why are they looking at us like that, in my head? So, I have a supervisor that is assigned to my section of the hall that I’m going to do. There’s a guy that headed up the tour that was supposed to meet me at the gate that day, but I actually had to go and find him. He never answered his phone. While I’m on tour, this guy gets a call from Lynn. I think she’s maybe the general manager around here or the owner of this janitor outfit. He’s talking to her as if she’s giving him an earful because he’s coming up with excuses galore. He doesn’t even tell me to go and wait somewhere while he’s talking to her. He puts her on speaker for some of the conversation. He’s taking pictures of random stuff, and then he said, alright guys, I have to leave, and left us there, walked out still on the phone. So, I toured a bit more with my supervisor, which he’s only a week older than me here. We went and talked to two more supervisors that run other buildings out there, and they said, you’ll need to get a real badge this week sometime. I said, alright. So, the next day and the day after, I work with these people showing me what to do. I’m on the night shift, 7 pm to 3 am. There’s 3 other people that work on my assigned half a mile hallway. 2 people work one half, and me and this older gentleman work the main side and the most important side because the offices here are the ones paying my outfit for janitorial services. And I find out that we are their janitorial service. No one else does it there. Anyway, I notice that this older gentleman Robert is skipping a lot of things. He’s taking bogus shortcuts and telling me that I should too. The next couple of nights he wasn’t working, so I thought I had my whole half of the hallway to do by myself. But the guy that works with this woman Lynn and Terry, Terry is maybe 2 weeks old here. He was caught wandering around some other facility one night before the two days I was on my own. He told me and the supervisor that’s a week old, his name's AJ, that yeah, I couldn’t find anyone, so I didn’t know what to do, so I just started wandering around, which was ridiculous. I’ve never heard anything like it. You’ve been here for 1 day; you should know what to do. Terry here for a week still not doing anything. He also said something along the lines of, I’m used to teamwork, and I don’t really know how to work on my own. This guy is at least my age. I’m 33. Wow, I couldn’t believe he said that either. So anyway, I come in on the two days Robert is gone. The first day I come in, Lynn and Terry are in my section collecting all the trash. I’m realizing that that must be the only thing these people are doing this night. We had a meeting with Max, us 3 people, and the big honcho out there with my company over Max, named Billy. Billy tells us all the things we need to be hitting and cleaning on a daily basis. Max is barely paying attention to any of this. He’s got two phones in his hands, messing with them. So after that, I help Lynn and Terry go through my section and get all the trash loaded up into this cart. They are almost at their section and say, we’re going to take a break. Well, they got there at 6; I got there at 7. So, I said, it’s only been an hour; I’ll just go start sweeping my offices. An hour passed, maybe two. Terry comes in and says, I’m throwing up, and Lynn needs help. I’m going home. So, I said, alright, I’ll be there soon after I finish sweeping. I go and help her with one of the four bathrooms that I’m supposed to do on my end of the hallway. She’s cleaning half-assed, so we cleaned them fast. I think each bathroom should at least take about 45 min to effectively clean it. She probably took about that long, but she’s not mopping, cleaning the sink, or really scrubbing the toilet. It takes her long because she doesn’t have all of the supplies she needs right there. She’s walking back and forth to random spots because everything is not put away properly. We finish, and I said, I’m going to take a lunch before the food truck leaves. I come back in an hour or so, she’s nowhere to be found, only the little dump truck wagon is in the hallway. So, I just went back down to my end of the hallway and started sweeping again. The offices didn’t see her until about 220 am or so when I’m pretty much wrapping up everything on my end. She emerges, and I told her when I came back from lunch I couldn’t find you, so I just started doing my end again. She said, that’s fine, that she went “shopping” at the janitor's fence on the other side of the plant. I said, yeah, I went out there to find some windex, none out there. She said, you won’t find it out there, you have to know the bosses at Kimberly Clark to get some, which set me back. I said, really, you’re kidding? So the next day, Terry isn’t there. It’s just Lynn and me and my hallway supervisor, AJ. Lynn says she’s going to do her side of the hallway, and I can do hers. The only reason we teamed up was because Terry wanted to try teamwork because he doesn’t know how to work. Lol, but I said that makes it easy. So, I start at my end, so on my end, the cooperate offices have countertops and refrigerators that are stainless steel. All these individual little Rubbermaid trash cans, all this stuff was disgusting. So, I started wiping certain common areas down. I started seeing all these dusty areas that weren’t getting dusted, the office chairs have white dust all over the back of them, I mean nasty things are happening because no one is taking their jobs seriously here. I work until 4:30 that day since I did so much extra things. I still had to get the regular things done too. Next day, Robert is supposed to be back, and he’s supposed to be there at 6 pm before me for an hour. I get in about 7:05 pm or so and go get the dump wagon and get things set up to start more deep cleaning of chairs, trash cans, common areas, all these things. I start doing these things while getting the trash collected and I’m all over the place. So, he comes in at like 8:20 pm, asks me where I’m at. I told him, well, really I’m kinda floating everywhere. He’s like, well, where can I get in at? What have you done? What haven’t you done? I said, man, to be honest, you can go towards the entrance and the cafeteria and come up towards me; we’ll meet in the middle. Because I’ve been talking to AJ here and there the last couple of days, and we think Robert is riding the clock. So, both of us decided it would be better if everyone had their assigned section so we could tell who’s working and who’s not. Robert then argues with me for about an hour about all kinds of things, telling me I’m wasting my time deep cleaning, that day shift doesn’t work so why should he, all these crazy excuses of why he’s not doing his job. I finally told him, look man, if you want to just collect the trash for 8 hours, that’s fine. This is what I’m going to be doing for my 8 hours, or however long it takes to get the job done right. I don’t work day shift. I am here to shine tonight. He walked off mad; I didn’t see him the rest of the night. He was hanging out in this meeting room putting the chairs on the desks, making it look like he’s vacuumed the entire floor, which I don’t think he did. I feel like he was watching YouTube in there. So anyway, this was the last day of my temporary badge. I never saw Max, my manager, or got a call or text from him at all. I had texted him the night before about a payroll app I needed a code to log in, not text, no call, nothing. So, I got off early that night so I could wake up before 3 pm so I could get my badge before the guy goes home. He’s only in the office Tuesday through Thursday, 7 am to 3 pm, as stated by these supervisors I met on my first day. I never got any information from Max, my manager. I go up there on my own accord; there’s no one in the office to get my new badge. So, I start walking around HR department looking for someone to help; this is the section I’ve been cleaning, and it’s the people that pay my outfit. So, I’m walking around searching for someone to help me. I am walking down the hallway, run into this woman, a Russian woman, her name’s Marie. She is very nice, kinda poor English, but a very nice woman. Sometimes it might be hard to understand what she’s saying. She might seem a little commanding in texts and stuff. Anyway, we go to her office, and she takes my badge, sends an email to the guy that’s supposed to take my picture, calls him, which I had none of that information since she has my badge in her hands. She sees I’m with the Janitorial department, so we just start talking nonchalantly about her office, which is one I do. She’s showing me pictures on her phone that she took and sent to Max. Max didn’t look like he ever replied to her. I’m saying things like I just would like to find out if there’s a written contract of what all we are supposed to be cleaning, so she is happy to help. I also told her I want to start deep cleaning so this place gets clean. She said it used to be immaculate; she was so happy that I wanted to put in the work that no one has been doing. She emailed the woman that pays my outfit so she could try and get some type of paperwork for me. I get out of there; Max calls me 30 min later. First thing he says, why are you talking to my clientele? I said, what are you talking about? He just repeated the question and said, you can’t go talk to those people at Kimberly Clark. I said, I went in to get my real badge, and the guy wasn’t in his office, so I just met this lady in the hallway and asked if she could help me. He said, why did you do that? Why didn’t you just call me? I didn’t say this part, but I was thinking, aren’t you my manager? Aren’t you supposed to tell me, call me up, say yo bro, this is the last day to get your badge, meet me at the hair shack at such and such time? Because he is my manager. He said, but you don’t know these people; that woman is a nasty woman, she is always sending me problems. I then kinda went out and said, Max all I want to do is come to work and clean. But I walk into the janitor’s closet; it’s a complete mess. There’s signs on the inside of the door to keep tidy and organized; it’s disgusting, hasn’t been cleaned out in months, there’s no order to anything. I said, Max, I’m worried that our outfit is going to lose the contract with Kimberly Clark. He sucked his lips, said, man, the contract is for me to know, not you, just don’t come in tonight, I’ll have Billy call you in the morning. So now I’m waiting for Billy to call, and if he doesn’t, I was going to just go there during the morning and see if I can talk with him in person. After all this information what do you guys think of this situation? And what would be the best direction to take? Thanks all in advance! "

3,2024-03-08,Growing dislike for boss - rant,u/expectothedoctor,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b9n07v/growing_dislike_for_boss_rant/,antiwork,"I've (F34) worked at my position for a little over a year. Lately I have been struggling with a growing dislike for my boss (F61). It's gotten so bad I find difficult to even look at her these days. 

To preface, I must say she's not a bad person. Not at all. I even think she's good at her core job. I just find her an unprofessional and bad boss. I also struggle to keep my boundaries with her, because she's retiring in a few months, and so I'm very aware that the situation is temporary and it's not ""worth it"" to take the issues up with her. But as a result I've started to dislike my job. 

Reasons for my dislike of her:
1. She tells other employees and even outsiders why someone is off sick. When my coworker missed a meeting due to getting sick, she told all attendants that he had COVID. This made me so uncomfortable, especially as I have a history of breast cancer that has required surgery even during my job here. I am also very aware it's illegal for employers to disclose medical information about their employees.

2. She wants me to forward all e-mails that I send outside of our organization to her as cc. I told her this makes me uncomfortable but she brushed it off and said she also forwards her important e-mails to us employees (this is because we're a very small team). I feel like I'm not trusted and I also feel violated by this practice. It also wastes everyone's time to read through a bunch of e-mails, most of which have to do with things you have no clue about. 

3. She wants everything done together as a team, instead of making people responsible for projects. This wastes so much time and makes me less invested in my work.

4. Last week I sent her a report for comments. She told me in front of a colleague thst it needs a lot of work. She then proceeded to nit-pick its issues while laughing in amusement. For instance, she said I write too long sentences. When I asked her to elaborate, she read out loud one single sentence that was less than two lines (and which I had copied from another source), losing it and laughing how she ""doesn't understand anything"". This occurred less than a week after my grandfather died (which I had informed her about).

5. Today I sent her a survey I had created (I had offered to do it). I had used a survey from another organization as a base, having sent it to her before hand, asking for comments. She said it was a very good survey and suggested I add one question to it. Today when I sent my finished survey to her for feedback she revealed that several of the questions actually didn't fit our needs and the target audience was wrong too. She also said we should finish the survey together, apparently not thinking I could finish it myself. I would have appreciated getting reliable feedback on my plans BEFORE finishing the survey. 

Anyway, thanks for reading this far, I am just frustrated and feeling powerless. I used to work as a project manager in multi million euro projects so I have some idea about good leadership and serious projects, which probably makes me even more frustrated with my current situation. Here's to waiting for her retirement !

Don't tell them that you couldn't imagine doing anything else. Don't tell them that you're loyal to him/her or the company. Don't give them the impression that you're attached to what you're working on. If you do that they will believe that they never have to give you a raise or promote you.

Give them the impression that you're considering leaving but haven't made up your mind. Make sure that they know that you're dissatisfied - if they dismiss your concerns, that's fine, don't get angry with them. As long as they know.

Start looking for jobs, even if you're happy. Tell them you need the afternoon off for an interview. Make them panic. Make them imagine what it would be like to lose you without forcing them into a corner. You want them to believe (whether its true or not) that you have one foot out the door and you're indifferent about staying or leaving. Bonus points if you're actually indifferent and find a job that pays more. Take it. 

This is how you make sure that you get a proper raise without asking, threatening or begging. You have to make them afraid to lowball you. Don't argue with them. Either they pay you what you deserve or you find someone who will. ""Job hopping"" works."

I asked what I felt like were the basic questions. You know the usual; pay, benefits hours, etc. The guy then went on this pseudo rant about “oh yeah we work LOTS of hours, we usually work tens all year but sometimes I work more” and like barely touched on the other two things I asked about and seemed genuinely proud of the amount of overtime he’s forced to work. As if he didn’t care about getting paid or having proper safety nets for going to the doctor or dentist or god forbid having a motherfucking day off. He seemed genuinely satisfied with constant overtime being exploited and worked to the bone. I understand loving your job to an extent but it just seemed so odd to be as excited for what I’d consider to be pretty shitty hours.

Idk if it’s just a fundamental difference in what I look for in a job or just the really shitty labor culture we are currently experiencing or what. It seems that anytime I get into a conversation with someone about a potential job I want to apply for and I ask about hours or pay or weekend work, I always get these guys that are SUPER happy to be working fucktons of overtime all the time and never see their friends or family. I ask about hours in order to gauge how the work/life balance is at any given place. I don’t ask about hours because I want to make sure that my next job is going to rob me of just as much time as the fucking current one does lol. 

Additionally I feel like I almost have to probe and pry to get information about pay, benefits, or vacation time, as if it’s somehow less important. like what the fuck information do people honestly think I’m looking for when inquiring about a new position? Why do we live like we need to be grateful for being fucked over and taken advantage of?"

Picture a 25 yo guy working away as a graphic designer 6 months deep into his ""new"" company with little to no problems. My department was pretty small: my boss/manager (however you wish to call her), one fellow designer and myself, but even then we were EFFICIENT; any project that came in walked out the door that same day or the next one. Futhermore, there were days we had nothing to do.

Last week I said to myself: ""Hey, I am liking this new place, I enjoy the company of my coworker and the hours are pretty good. The 400$ a month are enough to help around the house but some more would be awesome for my savings"" (I am not in the US, so 400$ is ""good"").

I have never asked for a rise before so I buildt enough courage to ask, not demand or something, ASK for a rise because we are adults after all and with a simple ""No"" would have been enough. ""Sure, I'll look into it"" says my boss since she alone can't make that decision, she has to go ask up the ladder.

Fast foward to today and I am summoned to the office for a meeting, alone. Yep, alarms go off everywhere; I have no clue what could be wrong. Guess what? I am being let go because ""We feel some goals are not being met""....

So yeah, noted, never ask for a rise again I suppose.

Sorry for any spelling mistake or whatever, as I write this I feel so angry and betrayed my chest feels tight; I have never been fired before but the very first time I ask for a rise I am let go. I suppose a lowly graphic designer is more than replaceable; we only do some doodles after all, right?"

So this monday we all got pulled into a meeting over metrics, and my manager mentions that if were are even gonna be 1-2 mins late call our attendance line ""So we dont walk by your desk at 9:00 and mark you as late cause you are just parking. dont worry it won't count against you its to protect you from us markinng you as late cause we dont see you."" come tuesday i hit some traffic and make that call in as ill be roughly 3 mins late. Walk in clock in 3 mins past my start time, and i get pulled by another manager well call Mr Power trip, to be told that the 1-2 mins late has happened too much and ill be terminated next time it happens. I geuinely was like ""yeah i get it, ill make sure to leave 15 mins earlier to make sure it doesnt happen again. No big deal""

Now as told by managment when i started there is a 7 mion rule where you can clock in/out 7 min early. now you can only clock out early if you clock in early is the agreement with that. So yesterday i ended up clocking in 15 mins early not paying attention trying to make sure i didnt clock in late, so come 6 mins before my shift end i clock out and am immediatelty stopped by [Mr.PT](https://Mr.PT) who asked where am i going? i mention this rule i was advised of, and instead of correcting me thats not how it works, he turns to a group sitting next to the punch clock and says ""dont you just love when people just make shit up?"" and starts up a tirade about your shift is 9-6 yopu need to be here 9-6. dont bullshit me about something you heard. 

Thinking i was crazy i called my Coworker and even he was flabbergasted as he was talking about this same rule with the higher paid team who regularly clock out 5 mins early cause they are also under the understanding that that is the rule. so we have a half of our floor operating as thios is the standard but im the one who gets to catch the heat for this. 

Now i get to go in today and try and save my job with my manager, as there are a ton of people doing exactly what i did. 

&#x200B;

TLDR; management advised us of a rule about clocking in and out, and when attempting to utilize this rule, a manager who i dont report too started talking shit about me to a group of coworkers while i was standing right there.

Yesterday he called me out and said since I like supporting black people (I'm white,) how about the fact that he's mad at a black man in town and if the n word was acceptable to use that's what word would describe this person. He of course said the hard R and when I walked away he started yelling and getting in my face. Saying it was disrespectful to walk away from him. I'm white and in an interracial relationship. He fake apologized, said he was only being hypothetical, that my generation is overly sensitive and the Bible says you shouldn't be mad about a word and that if black people can say it then white people can too... and I need the money so I'm still here. 

Writing this because I'm sure I'm not the only one who has to put up with this type of behavior because of financial need. I imagine there are so many people on here who are or aren't white who've had to keep silent because they can't afford to lose their job. I was lucky this time but it's really got me motivated to save as much money as I can and work on an exit strategy. 

We as workers put up with so much shit and especially in right to work states have no recourse when it comes to standing up for what is right. 

Anyone else have stories like this? Did you quit? Were you forced to stay because you needed the money? I know as a white person I can't begin to know what it would be like if I was black and in the same position but I owe it to my family to call  out the BS.

My boss emailed me a summary of our meeting notes. How do I respond to create a paper trail? It seems I’m being singled out at work by coworkers. They claim I create an awkwardness in the office. They’re all good friends. I’m not that chatty & apparently hard to read. They’ve been nitpicking & digging for small mistakes to get me fired. So I was written up for performance issue due to accidentally using the wrong job title in one email (I copied a coworker’s email signature & didn’t change the job title by accident), nominated a student for a scholarship (email for nominations stated any member of faculty, staff or student body could nominate a candidate) & being away from desk for prolonged periods (I didn’t communicate with coworkers that I needed to do a job related task away from my desk & sometimes go to the bathroom to cry or get myself together b/c coworkers are rude or snippy with me).

I plan to seek accommodations with HR. But wanted advice on how to respond to the email. My boss only hears what she wants to hear. I can’t openly share that my coworkers mistreat me b/c it will just backfire & my complaints will be another reason for them to fire me. I need to keep this job to finish my degree for free. Advice?

Here is the email regarding nominations for the scholarship…based on the email I don’t see why it was a performance issue to nominate a student. I didn’t personally know them - but they had a financial need b/c of their situation & were a good student. So I was only trying to help.

Email: “ Please nominate a deserving member of the Class of 2025 (a rising senior) to receive a full tuition scholarship for their senior year. Any faculty, student, staff, or administrator can nominate a rising senior for the Thomas Merton Award. Students from the class of 2025 cannot nominate themselves, but they can ask someone from the Mount community to complete a nomination form on their behalf.

It’s not just someone being awful to you at work. It’s more specific than that. 

Here’s a quote from “ask a manager” 



To be illegal, jerky conduct must be based on race, religion, sex, national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic information.

Moreover, to violate the law, the EEOC says that this conduct — which, again, must be based on race, religion, sex, or other protected characteristics — “must be severe or pervasive enough to create a work environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive.” They also explain, “Petty slights, annoyances, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not rise to the level of illegality.”

In other words, if your boss or your coworkers are just jerks but it’s not based on your race, religion, sex, or other protected characteristic, that’s not illegal. Unwise and unkind, but not illegal.

I am so conflicted because I want to leave so much, but I also know the job market is horrible. I dread this work, and a lot of my friends tell me I should try to stick to it for to truly see if I like it once I get through the program.

I have not liked this for more than half of the months I have been working here. I hate to say it but I will say it: I am not good at this work, and I don't enjoy it. I want to try something else before it is too late to change and I get stuck.

I have an issue of not wanting to disappoint my boss and fellow teammates for leaving as soon as I hit 12 months because then it will feel like all the work was for nothing, and they are short-staffed in this industry since it is so specialized. Also, they are nice people too but because I am not good at this work imo, I often get stressed because my boss is sometimes hard to work with. They are a nice person, but when working it is difficult to not feel stupid around them, and I get intimidated all the time.

I just started at my new job about 4 months ago and have been enjoying working here generally speaking. I’m learning a lot, have a lot of flexibility, and the work I’ve been doing so far felt meaningful and aligned with my values. It wasn’t until Tuesday where I was invited to attend a training with Eleos Health, an Israeli tech startup company that uses AI to assist therapists in writing documentation, that I began to waver in my feelings. I have my own negative feelings/opinions about the use of AI and tech especially in healthcare settings, but I am mostly perturbed by my company deciding to partner with an Israeli tech startup due to the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict and current genocide of Palestinians.

I brought this up at our company gathering this Wednesday, and the ED was pretty transparent in saying the contract was established before the events in October and that she had brought up the idea of making a public statement about the genocide but the company’s board vetoed that idea (for an unknown reason).

I feel so strongly about Palestine for many reasons, but I am hesitant to quit for two main reasons: (1) my wife is pregnant and my ability to provide for our family would be in jeopardy if I quit work, and (2) this company is one of the few companies in my state that can help get me professionally licensed to practice therapy. There are times when I think I’m blowing this issue out of proportion, but I just am so upset that I work for a company that empowers genocide even if it’s just marginally.

Am I overreacting?"
8,2024-03-08,Rant- Toxic workplace that does not stop giving. ,u/rainingfoxes,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b9v7mw/rant_toxic_workplace_that_does_not_stop_giving/,antiwork,"I left my workplace about 6 months ago when things were getting too toxic. One year into the position, I realised that my teammates were just too comfortable in their own clique and were having fun bullying me. 

My direct supervisor was too neurotic and I felt unsafe being with her. I tendered directly to the director of our department citing that I was very uncomfortable with her and ask for a presence of a third person if there is any conversation involving us. 

I came to understand that she was extremely upset about it and one day, while I was alone at my desk, she confronted me. I had a panic attack and asked her to leave but she insisted on staying and talking. I started crying but she instead pulled a chair, sat, and continued. She finally left when I just ignored her altogether. I related the matter to my HR who told me to “have positive thoughts”. HR supervisor eventually came in and helped mitigate the situation. I wrote in a formal complaint and included a liner saying that what she did is consider harassment ( my therapist confirmed that) and if she came at me again, I will make a police report. 

Fast forward, 6 months later I thought I was doing okay. But yesterday I heard from an ex colleague that people in my ex-company felt that I was over-reacting in my claim of making a report. This thing just kind of got stuck in my head and I felt so indignant. 

I am having issues mentally and today when my cab passed by my old workplace ( first time in 6 months), I had an onset of breathing issue. Who are these people disregarding my feelings? When i was being bullied, no one came to my aid and now that I am not around, they continue to ridicule me. Of course, I wish the people will be punished but this is not a perfect world. 

Sorry for the long read. Just a rant. "

Don't you know, having a literal doctors note that I had this illness, is just ""excuses."" And every time I tried to explain that I didn't even know I was sick, and I just thought I was burnt out and really tired, that was either excuses or I was lying. It depended on what she felt like saying.

Never mind that we were told to limit our days off, as much as possible, because the owners were moving house and would be out of the office for ovet a month. Never mind that I received passive aggressive criticism, for using both of my sick days, and less than 2 days' worth of half days, to see the doctor. Never mind that we were all told to schedule any appointments as much out of the way as possible, and I did that. Nope, the well known symptoms of mono that came and went with the actual illness, were really a problem with me.

I pay slightly above market rate for my area (we are in Portugal).

It is hybrid work. We meet at a coworking space 2-3x/week while I look for an office space that works for us.

There are 3 of them now, but I would like to hire more once we have more clients to justify expansion. (In the next 3-6 months will be doing another hire I think)

I want to be fair to them, and also create an environment where we can all be productive but without stress.

Recently the owner of the restaurant who’s very involved and manages full time at the restaurant made me and two other coworkers pay for a cup of tea. For context, there was a woman who sat at a table and ordered a cup of tea, and then moved tables when she realized the people she was meeting were already seated. The people she was meeting were in another servers section, and the cup of tea she got forgot to get transferred before they left. This happened during a morning shift, and all the servers split tips during the morning (a total of three servers). When it came time for us to do the checkout, we explained what happened and he said “well you’re just gonna have to eat the cost”. Tea at this restaurant costs nearly four dollars. I understand that’s not a lot of money to split between three people, but the guy who owns this restaurant seriously could not bite the likely five cents it cost for a single tea bag, and made the people he pays $2.13 an hour pay for it. I think it’s utterly ridiculous for such a small fucking thing. And just a reminder your employers do not give a fuck about you and only care about profit. 

Edit: For some additional fun context, a month or two ago we had a FOH meeting where he said that any server errors will have to be paid for by the servers. That being said, a week or two later the kitchen fucked up six steaks by overcooking them twice, and didn’t have to pay shit. <3 "

I have been living in a new city for 7 months and was a teacher. Left mid year with a medical leave of absence (please do not shit on teachers. We work our asses off. Thank you). 

Although I could say that I’m one of the lucky few who has only filled out 50 applications and received 4 interviews, it sure still feels demoralizing and self esteem crushing to not get a job outside of teaching. For the record, I have a bachelors in health admin, trying to get a claims license in Florida, no claims experience and I have job hopped 5 jobs - 2 were the result of fried out grants and lay offs, 2 were me quitting and 1 was getting fired for refusing to work during COVID when there was no PPE 2020. 

So now I just went through 4 rounds of an interview that pays $25/hour and on the 5th round, I was grilled by the director that my jobs were a problem, and questioned whether I would commit to this company. 

At the end of the interview, I was sick of it and just bluntly asked when are they going to make a decision. 

I just need others who can relate… I know what my solution is: upskill, network, take a week off from spraying applications and apply later when I get my claims license.

I applied through a temp service and did my orientation today. And other than what I found online about them laying off 8,000 and site closing, I believe I may have found out today one of the more ""secret"" reasons people are stricking. 

They have a ZERO attendance policy at the building I'll be working at. (My fil and bil work at a different facility in a different town so this may not apply to them)
Their words exactly ""Autoliv does not excuse any absence even with a doctors note or court orders, they don't care if your car catches on fire or your baby dies. You miss one day and your terminated and your last check will be $7.25/hr"" How in the fuck is that legal?
And second biggest thing is they have a ""Check processing fee"" a fee that comes out of your paycheck to get deposited into your bank. What in the fuck is wrong with these people. 
I need the money real bad so I'm gonna go in, hopefully it's not AS bad as the staffing agency said it is. I'll see and keep my options open.

I am the rare, and maybe even mythical, right-wing anti-work advocate.  My reasons can be a bit different than many of yours.  Mine have more to do with money and monetary theory.  I just think there is some absolute bullshit in people exchanging their whole lives away chasing a token that someone else can print.  I actually consider the net effect of the arrangement to be a form of slavery.  I want to wake up more people to that.  So I am conditionally anti-work.  I think that until the market uses mostly real money in exchange for work that everyone right and left should be anti-work.  Basically I don't want to use my physical effort and lost focus on giving more authority to bullshit.  It's a waste of a human life.

Beyond that I'm also aware of the other bullshit aspects of work.  Did you know that in the 1950s over half of the working population was self-employed.  It should be realistic and common for people to own themselves without jumping through absurd loops to only be most likely to fail.  I know people can always say that failing to make self-employment viable is a skill issue.  But so too is writing a modern operating system in pure assembly.  If almost no one does it successfully there is probably more depth to the problem than it being a skill issue.  And if at one time over half the population was able to make it work and have enough to take home to support a family on a single income maybe it's not the general premise of self-employement / self-ownership that is broken but difficulties we've added since.

So for now while we have this system I am anti-work and pro-productivity.  There is more than one way to seek value in your life and until we depart from this subtle slave system I think people should maximize the amount of time they spend pursuing that kind of value and minimize their hours at work to just what is necessary for survival.

So back to my question rather than explaining why I, a unicorn, exist.  I want to redpill other rightoids.  I need a large volume of memes to do it because I have to be selective for that audience.  It's not enough that I've taken on the bravery of reducing my own hours at work.  Anyone working for this system feeds it.  I also own a forum (thanks to my fewer hours at work I have time to build those kinds of things) and while it currently leans a little right I'd like it to be a little center and at the very least shape it toward my anti-work-rightism.  But of course lead by example.  So the more content I can find the more selective and high quality I can be the better I can sell it.  Basically I can sell it.  When I make my points to other rightoids they always agree with me.  The point is selling it hard enough that it actually becomes an area of focus for them.

So if you can point me in the right directions that would be super fine.  Also if you have questions for me I'm OK with that.  I apologize that I haven't used reddit very heavily in years so I really don't know the lay of the land so directions would be appreciated.  Much thanks."

I think we should work together.  It's rare that you get a conduit to the other side of the isle who is empathetic to your position.  It's an opportunity to influence the other side.  And if you want to actually change the system you need more than half the population to be on the same side because this system can survive on only half the population being agreeable to it. (Even less than that because its a system of slavery that can extract energy even from those who disagree with it).  So we need at minimum 50% to change this system.  And the directly middle doesn't really have an ideology beside agreement with the norm so to be successfully you are actually going to need all of the left and actually a good chunk of the right.  It's just the facts.

basically my ceo/business owner is making us track our 2 10 min breaks by pressing ‘break’ on our clock in/out system and once it goes over 20 minutes in total for the day it automatically clocks us out as to stop paying us. so essentially if i take a 10 in the AM and a 12 min break in the PM it’ll clock me out to not pay me for 2 minutes. 

now obviously we could just not use the feature (however we are extremely micromanaged so might be hard). but what’s y’all’s opinion on this?? i’m actually going to lose like $5 for taking an extra 5 min logged in my break time Lmao. "

Like I literally considered hospitalization but my husband told me not to. I tried one of those online therapy things and they told me they couldn't help me and I needed a psychiatrist. The nuke plant gave me a severance package so that was good. But we needed that money to live on and without insurance I didn't think it would be a good idea to spend money on the psychiatrist. Also, after leaving the nuke plant but before getting a new job someone blew a stop sign and t boned my car, totalling it. Their insurance paid but I am still out a car. My husband needs his car to get to his job. So I found a remote healthcare job.

This job is absolute bullshit. I was hired for full time but have yet to work even 30 hours a week. The pay is horrible especially in comparison to what I was making. Because my husband has benefits, I'm not alowed to sign up for any through this company. I had great insurance at the nuke plant, which my husband was on. But when I left he got on his own insurance because he has some chronic conditions. I had planned on getting on insurance at whatever new job I had but like I said, I'm not allowed to.

There are three different sets of trainings. The first set had an enormous amount of material to get through and if it didn't get finished in the 8 hours, you are expected to complete it on your own time. They threaten termination repeatedly.  Like if this deadline isn't met your employment will be ended that type of thing. They condescendingly shame you for even taking the 8 hours to complete the tasks. ""If you're clocked in for 8 hours you better do 8 hours of work. None of the tasks you're assigned take 8 hours. You have to do more than the bare minimum"".  That's just a full on lie. No one on earth can finish that amount of material in the given time.

You have to clock on and out on this software that requires you to use a code and type an explanation as to why you were clocked in. You get a corrective action if you use the wrong code. They consider 30 hours to be full time and say you can just pick up other people's call offs if you ""feel the need"" to have 40 hours. If you call off more than 3 times you are fired because ""working remotely eliminates the need to call off"". If you miss a day for ANY reason, call off or PTO, you are required to notify management, the doctor you are partnered with, and are expected to find your own replacement. For PTO you have to also fill out a form and have the person who will cover fill it out too. You can only change your availability every six months, no exceptions.

The training was done on my own laptop but because of HIPAA they have to ship you a computer to do the actual job. Because FedEx is garbage I missed an entire week of pay waiting on that computer. I think this job is designed for people that just graduated with associates degrees. I have a bachelor degree and 5 years of lab experience, both as a chemist and as a molecular tech. But I don't have a car to drive to a lab job. The town I'm in is so small it doesn't even have mail delivery. The only businesses are a gas station and a Dollar General. So I just feel really trapped in a super shitty situation. And this is after I just left a place that about mentally broke me. FUCK CORPORATIONS"

They promised commission, broken down into minimum wage + gas reimbursement but no guaranteed gas-reimbursement-rate, just whatever was leftover after minimum wage was deducted. Was supposed to be enough to live on. Weird, but might work.

Was going okay-ish this first week but I was spending a lot on gas and wasn't sure what my pay was up to. The app didn't tell me how much each stop was worth and my manager didn't know either. His wife did payroll so I was told to ask tomorrow (today). I asked several times and wasn't getting any answers. Middle of the day I was getting upset, had a phone call or two demanding the numbers (I got a little heated), and drove to the office with the intent of quitting if they didn't look good.

The owner is a chill, soft-spoken guy, very useful for diffusing situations. Though I calmed down a bit, I still am not 100% convinced of his sincerity. ""Yes, that's frustrating"" ""I'm on your side"" ""this makes sense, yes?"" ""I employ 40 people, if I go what would happen to them? (I'm doing them a favor)"" He seems like a nice guy. Seems.

It took a few minutes for them to run the numbers for me and they were basically the minimum I would expect for this kinda job but why did I have to wait so long? Why don't I know at all times the value of my work? Maybe you need to fix the way you run your company if you want to employ someone in my position. At any rate, the uncertainty here and the bare minimum pay expected lead me to quit.

Am I being unreasonable here? If you're working commission do you know how much you're making? I'm not going to mention which company until I get paid."

They are training me in person for a few months. It’s an hour drive from my home. After this it will go to 2 days a week for idk how long, then remote only. I want to get to remote asap so I can stop putting miles in my car and filling my tank every two days. It’s basically a pay cut. I’m happy to have my own office here, although they are slow to get it set up for me. I’m sharing an office with my trainer. She’s nice but I like my space a certain way, and I’d like to have that soon. 

It’s a newsletter office job. I copy and paste things, minor reformatting, emails, etc. it’s straightforward but there is a lot to do. It’s mindless and monotonous. 

When I go home I feel an overwhelming sense of dread that I have to wake up and do this tomorrow. It makes me want to scream and cry. I’m wasting 10 hours of my day in this fucking place. I work 15 days in a row. I don’t have a life. What the fuck…. God. I fucking hate capitalism and this whole system. They made me sign an NDA saying I won’t discuss my wages with coworkers. Which is illegal in my state. I wonder how bad I get paid compared to them. I know I’m new, but I have a degree, and I have bills to pay. 

I want to live in my van and travel from state to state with my cat. Work from coffee shops, anywhere with wifi connection. That’s why I’m sticking it out. So I can have my laptop on the beach and do my silly button pushing. 

Having to work for the rest of my life is such an awful thing. I wish nobody had to do this shit. Maybe in a few years I’ll get out of this… maybe I’ll like the job after I get the hang of it. I just feel like a shell of myself. I don’t have a question, just getting some feelings out. Any advice?

47,2024-03-08,PSA: Don't do invisible work,u/PipePistoleer,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ba1n6i/psa_dont_do_invisible_work/,antiwork,"Someone out there needs to hear this. I need to hear it from myself. Here it be.

I've worked in a few startups and large corporations, and did my dues in retail & hospitality at the lowest level (cleanin' terlets) and even as far into my career as I am, I'm still just now learning this rule - 'don't do invisible work'. My definition is pretty similar to the commonly accepted one which is basically:  ""***work that you do, whether of your own volition or that is assigned to you, that goes unacknowledged***"".

This ""invisible work"" plagues hourly and salaried workers alike. Even though hourly employees are 'technically' compensated for any work they do on the clock, it still happens - you obviously can be overworked for an unfair wage as many are (I'm sorry sisters and brothers). Overwork is usually unnoticed except by the worker and thus a subset of 'invisible work' in my book.

The indicators for invisible work for me typically is:

1. It's outside the scope of my job but I'm expected to do it
2. It's reactive in nature - so typically unexpected or unpredictable - but I'm expected to do it
3. It's rushed (usually goes hand in hand with #2) - meaning poor planning up the ladder - but I'm expected to drop everything and do it

The problems that arise for us workers of the invisible (and our employers) in almost any mature or maturing organization are as follows:

* Human Resources, People Department, whatever they call themselves cannot comprehend what you do because it's ""invisible"", undocumented, etc which leads to:
   * HR/People don't understand why you should be rewarded or provided advancement opportunities or even highly rated on performance reviews and vote against it
   * Leadership, even in your own business unit have zero visibility into what you do - but even if they saw it they'd forget; so they vote against compensation, advancement
* As far as your capabilities and bandwidth go, no one truly knows what they are. This leads to:
   * 60 hour work weeks
   * late night work
   * weekend work
   * personal/family time-theft; when an employer steals YOUR time
   * burn out

My solutions might seem naive, but they work. If you're doing invisible work and have any clout at all where you work try this:

* first and most obvious; don't do it. Get out of it. If you're an exempt salary employee and can afford it, can call in sick. If you work from home maybe the power or internet goes out and your phone network isn't fast enough to tether - and shoot your car battery died so you can't go to a coffee shop. Or if you've got the clout just be plain - ""No thank you."" My 1st grade teacher said, ""a failure to plan on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part.""
* when invisible work comes down the pipe your response to your boss could be: ""I'm having to do this reactionary work and I'm worried it won't be recorded or acknowledged can you help? I'd like my amount of work to decrease to compensate for this extra work I'm being asked to do. I've had great bosses that will help you (it's their job!).
* Instead of going for 'employee of the year', go for 'employee who works just hard enough to keep their job'. I'm not saying bare minimum, I'm saying be realistic.
* If you can get away with it - take the invisible work but half ass it. They won't ask again after enough half ass jobs.
* Get a new job

Disclaimer: My solutions are not comprehensive, may be terrible, and may result in involuntary termination from your place of employment."
7,2024-03-08,"Apparently our store firing few of management teams back to back, ever since our old ASM gone. Why don't they hire competent managers at first place?",u/Super-Dealer1816,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ba1qbi/apparently_our_store_firing_few_of_management/,antiwork,"I can't believe they fired like three managers in a week. One of them was a strict departmental manager. After discovering she committed multiple policy violations, they didn't fire her because she was strict, but rather because she was unable to handle certain employees and customers well. One time, she literally wrote up everyone in front of customers at sales for not wearing their uniforms properly, which was against both the mall's and the company's policies. Another day, she harassed a gay male employee for wearing makeup and female attire (i.e., piercings and lipstick) while on duty, even though he wasn't violating the dress code. When he went to HR to file a report against her, she instantly fired him on grounds of a dress code violation. Moreover, she tried to intimidate several part-timers, and when they didn't succumb to her attitude, she found reasons to write them up. It's funny because many employees would walk away or hide when they saw her on the floor. She even asked me once, 'Why are you scared? You can go to a different department to help your colleague.' She said the same thing to a few of my friends as well.

This attitude ultimately caught up with her when she clashed with a supervisor and customers during the closing shift. I'm talking about the same lady supervisor whom our former ASM made overwork while she was pregnant with her baby. She gave birth during maternity leave and returned to the store a couple of months later. This incident occurred when a customer made an unauthorized entrance to our clothing store during closing. The customer arrived at the gate at 6:59 PM, just a minute before closing time. Although the store closes at 7 PM, the security still refused to let him in, explaining that it's company policy not to allow customers to enter, even one minute early, and advising customers to come at least 15 minutes before closing. The customer didn't care and entered the store anyway. When the full-time employees tried to stop him and explain the policy, he didn't listen. As per policy, the store employees tried to call the management team hoping the supervisor would come to speak to the defiant customer on their behalf. However, the departmental manager ended up taking the call, intervened, and things escalated from there. When the strict manager confronted the customer and asked him to leave, he didn't comply and was concealing a weapon (a pocket knife). Unable to handle the situation, she started swearing at the customer, using multiple racial slurs, before mall security escorted him out of the store.

Unbeknownst to her, the same store supervisor had been promoted to team manager that day. She confronted the departmental manager and reminded her that her behavior towards customers was unacceptable. The departmental manager didn't listen to her advice and ended up using a racial slur against her as well, while also mentioning her family and children. The next day, the store manager didn't schedule her for a shift and had her meet with HR and the store manager in a conference room. Based on the incident with the customer and the team manager, they recommended a month-long suspension. But they didn't stop there; they further investigated the two other incidents I mentioned above and ultimately decided to fire her.

Sadly, a few days later, they fired two supervisors as well. One of the supervisors was fired for leaving the store while on duty after having an argument with his fiancée (now his ex). He discovered that she was cheating on him, and the argument got heated. He indirectly sent a threatening email to her new fiancé, stating that he wanted to meet him one-on-one in the field close to the mall. After the management team found out about this, they instantly fired him and had the police escort him out of the store. He reacted angrily, showing his middle fingers and shouting derogatory terms at all the employees. The next day after that incident, he unfollowed all of his colleagues and friends (whom he knew from the store) on Instagram. When asked why, his reasoning was that he was minimizing his followers to mostly close friends. However, his account had thousands of following and hundreds of followers. I understand why he was upset about the firings. The second supervisor was fired as well, but for clocking out of work early a few times, although he had perfect attendance. He was visibly upset and muttered, ""It's unfair,"" while walking out of the store after hearing the news, but he didn't react as drastically as the other supervisor did.

Question: **Don't you think that it is crazy to fire the management team back to back?**

Note :

1. Managers are not allowed to write-up employees in front of customers. Moreover, the firing is not supposed to be done at the sales floor. This rather supposed to be done in private space within the breakroom (i.e. conference room, HR office).
2. We are not allowed to physically stop customers from committing shoplifting as per company policy as this could put employees to danger especially if the customer is stronger, and armed. For this instant, we are required to call either law enforcement or store management teams to address this incident.
3. Firing supervisor for minor incidents was harsh. If supervisor is arguing with employee, and leaves the store, he should just get suspension they may be needs to be coached by employer. Moreover, clocking out early should not be big deal. Our company has 5 minute tolerance policy which allows employee to come up to 5 minute late or allow employee to allow clock in/out 5 minutes early.
4. Firing manager instantly for cussing was kinda crazy. Why didn't they implement this policy when our store first opened? Our previous ASM was even worse, making a pregnant manager overwork, cussing out employees, and constantly calling them idiots for simple mistakes. He even mocked other employees' ethnicity and culture, which was unacceptable. He also laid off the best HR employee just for giving a customer code for the public bathroom. Yes, they fired him for not stopping three employees from scamming and stealing from others. Before that, the district manager and store manager only gave him warnings and wrote him up for mistreating employees and using slurs and derogatory terms.
5. Did I mention customers need a code for the public bathroom? We're supposed to open it for them. However, according to the former assistant manager's policy, employees weren't allowed to have the bathroom code. That policy has changed now; our newly hired manager told us we can give the code to customers. However, it won't help much, as the bathroom code will change twice a week.

This usually gives me about 600 - 700 after taxes. Rent is 1.4k. I usually make about about 2.1k - 2.3k from that job with about 700 left over. That’s another 100 to my phone bill, another 150 - 200 for groceries, etc.

If I didn’t have my weekend job (another 500 a week with everything I just listed…so another 1.7k - 1.9k a month), I’d pretty much have nothing left over.

In total I work about 55 hours a week making between 3.5 - 3.9k a month.

How do people survive, especially in entry level jobs, working for 700 a week?

He started screaming at me over me not working hard enough with no evidence to back I did anything but work all day. He ended up grabbing a two inch folding knife and waving it in my face causing me to have a panic attack. This was all on camera but I quit 10 minutes later when my panic attack subsided and he's definetly going to delete the footage.

MY ex boss is well tied to local politics, police, and media. Nobody had believed me that I've been harassed, and now that my friends do believe me, they're telling me I can't do anything about this.

After the break, I was told multiple conflicting ""rules"" I needed to follow to succeed through the pip. Like only taking notes during meetings and not doing any work during that time.

So last year, I seem to have developed an OAB (Overactive Bladder) and I've been struggling to improve it, because of my HDHP, and also a lot of bad or unhelpful doctors. I also have IBS symptoms. 

Ever since I started working at my company, my symptoms still have not improved. 

I'm worried about getting fired simply because of this. I know this shouldn't be a big deal, but I was placed on a PIP at my previous job one month after my 4 day cancer treatment. My boss was looking over me during that month, because I developed a UTI and kept going to the bathroom, which caught his eye and he inquired me about. Our next conversation, all of a sudden he says I'm failing, even though work was completely slow at that time. Needless to say, I worked my ass off and still got fired two months later before my 26 birthday. 

My HR at my new company wanted to call me all of a sudden while I was working. She wanted to ask me something, but then I told her I'm busy with a deadline, so she pushed it to next Tuesday. I might be overreacting because of my past experience, but an alarm in my head is telling me this might be a slow  setup to get me fired in a few months over nothing. I'm worried she wanted to talk to me because of my health or because of how often I still go to the restroom. 

My work has been fine, and no one has commented on it with me or mentioned issues with how I work. Still, even though I work pretty well, I know that these companies will always make a big deal out of minor infractions to justify firing you. 

Should I consult with an employment lawyer or the DOL before I talk with HR again? I really cannot afford to lose my job again, during this bad economy and poor healthcare infrastructure. But I hate going through the trouble of affording legal help. 

***TL;DR***

I'm still suffering PTSD from my previous company. I'm worried HR is looking at me under a microscope because I have an unresolved medical condition I'm coping with. Do I need to protect myself? Can my company inquire me about potty breaks, and if not what should be my response?

1731,2024-03-08,For Those Following My Post About How My Old Boss Had My Husband and Son as Her Wallpaper. Buckle Up. ,u/Pookinator_2018,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ba48ec/for_those_following_my_post_about_how_my_old_boss/,antiwork,"For some background. I worked here for years bc I was under contract and had no idea what I was in store for. 
I am 31, my husband is 34, she's 54 (maybe 55). We have a child, and no, my husband had never met this crazy person before. 

As you all know, I walked past my old bosses office and her slide show wallpaper was my husband and our child. This went on for days bc she kept saying she didn't have an explanation for it and wouldn't fix it.

Here we go with the items that occurred just off the top of my head. I know there are more, but its been 2 years and I'm trying to recover my mental health and self-esteem so I must have blocked some.

Buckle up. 

1) My first day I was ordered a new chair. I can't build things, I have never had to. She made it and told me to look away bc ""her dress was below her thigh so that means you don't need panties"". 
2)I had set pay dates as everyone in the country does. She would tell me it's her right to pay me anywhere within a 5 day gap (via paper check) I have a child, I can't do that. So, she printed me a work sheet and tried to give me a class on budgeting. 
3)I was literally called fat every day for years for not being under 120 lbs.
4)I am so sorry but this one is gross - Apparently she and her sister has a regular thing of yeast infections so she would tell me all about it and how they were nicknamed the bread sisters. I would literally just be sitting there working and get hit with this.
5) Her ex husband met a prostitute on the highway and moved them into their home and then later left her for the prostitute (yes, all 3 lived together), and she was sending him money when he would call.
6) Any time I would post anything social media I would get comments within seconds. She also friend requested my dad after he visited me for lunch one day and would complain he wouldn't accept. After this she started trying to friend request my step mom.
7) My husband brought me lunch one day to the office from his restaurant and didn't want to make it weird so brought enough for everyone. She texted him later that night saying thank you for lunch because I'm sure your wife didn't tell you I said that. It was about 10 pm. She also told someone else who had worked there that she was texting her husband all night and she was like yeah no. She would also text him photos of her strange self out late at night while she was drunk out with her *friends*. He hands me the phone every time bc everyone is uncomfortable. 
8) She called our toddlers preschool to volunteer as the Easter Bunny. Also offered to PAY THEM TO LET HER. 
9) Her new husband (her second, his third) has a daughter she would bring to the office to be watched. After her mom would leave she would talk badly about her the entire time and she would be my responsibility. The child was 3 when I started. 
10) She would use the bathroom and keep the door open.
11) All offices had glass walls so she could watch. 
12) After I left, she fedexed me a hate letter saying that she questions my mental health bc who would ever leave. She also said she was concerned about my husband and my comments about ""needing a medication that was so important"". The medication was the Renewal of my son's epipen JR for prek bc his peanut allergy. 
13) She used to constantly talk about her sex life and I'm gonna leave it at that bc trust me she got graphic and y'all don't need the trauma. 
14) While I was pregnant my husband and I were going out of state for my brother's wedding. My spouse went to get me food then come pick me up. Before I could even stand up she ran out the door to the car to speak to him. I climbed in after I grabbed my stuff and was like what was that. She told him I was inside basically raging and shit talking about him. This never nor would ever happen. I called her out after I got back and she said she never said that. 
15) OH GOD this one is nasty so tread lightly. Every single effing month she would tell me how she didn't believe in tampons, etc and her husband was annoyed bc he would wake up to blood drips on the floor and on THEIR DOGS. Why in the living F would you tell me this???
16) While I was pregnant I had a lot of complications. I was actually even told I wasn't going to make it and to make a choice. I chose my son and by the grace of God I made it. My Dr. requested I had been hospitalized weeks before birth. She made me work up until 3 days before until I couldn't stand anymore AND any time I was out sick the next day she made me vacuume office doors as punishment. 
17) She used to have this Assistant who I became friends with on his way out (he did try to warn me but I was like hey, who doesn't say that when they leave). Basically picture Woody from Toy Story. He was a really nice guy. Well, he told me that she made him share hotel rooms with her when they would go to conferences. His last day she said ""any girl he dates is lucky bc I thought him everything he knows"" AND after he had been gone for about a year she told me she was attending a parade and drinking and may crash at his new place which she saw on social media. I obviously texted and warned him. 
18) I will literally die if I eat sweet potatoes and shouldn't even be around them bc breathing is hard. She knew this. I literally even have my own epipen, but she brought them almost every day. 
19) On my birthday my husband brought me lunch. I told her i needed a lunch break and was going to take it in the conf room with him. She then freaked TF out requesting he buy / bring her food too.
20) One holiday my gift was like congrats you have the worst skin ever (her words) and she made me a chemical peel appt. I showed up bc, well, she beat me down for a while so i was questioning myself and the Derm was like ?? Yeah you have great skin wtf was she talking about. 
21) If you didn't bring her a gift for Boss Day, Holy Effing Crap, get ready to scrub the floors of the office bc holy shit. 
22) I literally have a family and she would volunteer me for 6/7 hour weekend events. 
23) She hit on every single client, especially in front of their spouse. There was one elderly man that she would ask me to walk down the office for so he can stare at my ""peach"" and she would tell him she wore  her outfit just for him. 
24) She had installed a tracking app on her husband's phone (he didn't know) and daily would try to get me to do the same. Yeah, not my thing. 
25) Came into the break room once out of the restroom to her trying to get into my phone. I asked her what she was doing and she said she thought it was hers. The wallpaper was my son. 
26) I took my husband on a trip for father's day, she saw the photo and called the hotel and sent up cupcakes. May sound sweet, I say creepy. 
27) If you were sick, she needed to know what it was AND you had to send photos of your meds. 
28) After I left, someone tried to sign into my bank account literally like 8x a DAY for weeks. This had never happened and hasn't since. 
29) I had a huge blowout for my son's first birthday (of course, I didn't even think I'd get to see it!) And I didn't want her to invite herself so I said we weren't having one. She told our clients I was a terrible mom. 
30) We had a client whose phobia is rats (elderly gentlemen) and she bought a fake one and hid in under the desk to scare him during a meeting.

These are just the items I could think of within 15 minutes. 
If anyone wants to help me write a book or show lmk bc I have a ton lmao. Seriously though, I pray nobody else ever has to deal with this. 


Bonus: For those of you who want to know about the note, it states that nobody mentally well would ever leave her. If anyone disagrees its bc I have portrayed her wrong. Shes worried about my home life bc I mentioned I needed a certain medication (I was on the phone at lunch renewing my son's epipen Jr bc it was expired), and just basically being an insane person.

119,2024-03-08,I was just voted manager of the year for the 4th year in a row at my org (8k+ employees at the org.) Here is the recipe for fellow managers:,u/ForefathersOneandAll,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ba4rqr/i_was_just_voted_manager_of_the_year_for_the_4th/,antiwork,"1. People>productivity. I hold a strict code for my supervisees: I need your 70% effort 90% of the time. That other 10% is when I’ll need your 100% and I’ll be right beside you in putting in that extra effort. Acting like everyone can go 100% all the time is foolishness. 

2. Do NOT reward extra work with more work. If someone goes above and beyond, recognize them for the work and thank them. It’s not an invitation to dump more work on them. 

3. Be a values driven leader, not a shill for the organization. Even though I’ve won these awards, the org can and will toss me aside any day just like my supervisees. I want my staff to believe in me because they believe in my values, not because I shove company lines down their throat. 

4. Destigmatize the struggle. Work sucks. Sometimes it means we can’t show up as our best selves. Normalize conversations around wellness. Help your staff develop wellness plans so they can prioritize their needs. 

5. You may not like it but DEI competency is critical to being a truly great manager. Cultural proficiency means you can see your employees for who they are, you can hear them for what they need, and you can advocate for them when they aren’t around. 

That’s my top 5 ingredient list folks. Maybe controversial for some but I have low staff turnover (which isn’t easy in EdTech) and have seen some of my team turn into incredibly impress managers in their own right!

I cannot go too much into detail about the company because I don’t want to dox myself. This company hired me and 2 other individuals about April/May 2023. All 3 of us were hired within a month of each other. Similar ages, same exact college degree. Same position. 


So. I recently found out that the other 2 individuals initially got offered more money than I got offered initially. $3k more, to be exactly. I personally negotiated my salary on my job offer day and the company agreed to pay me more than my initial offer. That amount was the same amount that they initially offered the other 2 individuals and those individuals *did not* negotiate at all, they accepted the amount at face value.

My year review is coming up and I wanted to let my boss know that he/they offered those 2 people more money right off the bat than they offered me which is why I want an raise. Is this allowed/a good idea? I know they cant stop us co-workers from talking about our salary but idk if I can tell them “oh i know you offered me less”. If it matters, I am a POC and the other two individuals are both white (1 male, 1 female). I also am the only POC in my entire department.

This is my 3rd time working with this company. 1st time, I was let go because of my health problems (which were directly caused by working 24/7+365); 2nd time I resigned after my boss was knowingly doing things that violated Federal Codes related to Homeland Security & making me “complicit” in the violations and because of my professional licenses, I could have been criminally + civilly prosecuted. So 10 years go by since the last experience & I get blown up by corporate recruiters & job boards about because I was an “ideal fit” for 2 positions at this same old company (with a new name).  So I turned down the recruiters and ignored the job board notifications for a year.  And they were still coming in.. despite my responses of “not a good fit”. So last Sept., I got 4 notifications of excellent fit & 2 recruiters calling me & I decided.. WTH.. let’s have a little fun since this keeps coming at me.  I applied directly on the company website, and immediately got contacted for an interview.. then a second interview and a 3rd interview (all virtual).  Then I got the Live interview invitation.  I was shocked (but highly amused) to get to the 4th interview.  So I was available & I accepted the interview.  It was horrible.  The 2 people that interviewed my had the most boring, standard interview questions that it was clear they had no idea what they were doing.  When I asked them questions directly about the job duties,  dept KPI’s, biggest challenges… their answers were ambiguous at best.  Then I asked the person that was the direct supervisor of the hiring department to describe her management, her response was she really didn’t know. 🤨. So I left the interview thinking this was a complete waste of time.  I did follow up with a perfunctory ‘thanks for the interview’ but I really didn’t convey any excitement about being offered the job.  And I got nothing… crickets.  So I moved on with more of my contract work.  Then 3 months later (Dec) I get an email informing me that they are offering me the position.  I was shocked but amused. Then I got the offer letter… the starting pay was substantially higher than what the position was initially advertised for.  And the benefits package was very attractive.  So after some more research & deeper consideration, I decided to accept their offer.  Well, I have been working there for 49 days.  I found out that 2 other people were hired before me and quit after less than. a month of working.  Now I’m no superstar but I’ve been relatively successful throughout my career 35 yr career in this industry.  I’ve stayed out of management because it just not my lane.  I’m great with projects & process improvement.  I have advanced Microsoft skills & am an excellent problem solver.  So in this new position there are processes that are being run on antiquated software systems and several critical processes that have no automated tracking system AT ALL. The industry that this business is in is highly complex & is very time sensitive.  But we are being forced to use 1970’s systems to do our jobs in the 21st century. It’s blowing my mind.  I’ve made several suggestions on easy inexpensive ways to use current technologies to improve the department efficiency.  But I’m told to just do things the way they being done and don’t rock the boat.  But this department is being flooded with more & more work because we are not meeting customer requirements.  So I’ve been there 49 days (working day) and I get called in for a 90-day review.  I’m given an unsatisfactory review because I am not finishing all of my daily tasks in within the 1st four hours of the day (yep, do 8 hours of work in 4 hours) and the 2 duties they slammed me on a highly complex tasks.. that I only got access to do 12 days ago. No wonder the other 2 hires before me quit!! I’m coming in 1 hr before my official start time +’working thru lunch & taking no breaks until I complete the morning workload (8 hours worth of work in 4 hours).  I’ve automated as much of my work as I can & met with absolute resistance to change in my efforts to automate/ improve productivity with numerous other processes.  It’s feeling  like the same prison camp it was 10 yrs ago.  So, I’m seriously considering going back into being an independent contractor.  Just thought I’d get some other perspectives before submitting my resignation.  Thanks for listening & sharing. "

he told me since it's not really being noted on ADP, I'm being paid ""under the table"" and I don't technically need to file taxes.

but here's my issue with this. my bank will see I'm being paid, and if I don't pay taxes, they could very much prove that I'm not. and I'm 85% sure he's still taking out taxes from my paychecks as the owner. and furthermore, as someome from an immigrant family, I would rather play it safe and do what I need to do legally so my family doesn't get into any trouble.

11,2024-03-08,Manager suggested I had childhood trauma during performance review,u/PlentyAd9803,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ba69zn/manager_suggested_i_had_childhood_trauma_during/,antiwork,"Just had my performance review earlier today and it was a mixed bag as it usually is. However during the section on communication he said I needed to work on regulating my emotions in the workplace (which I don’t disagree with) but then went on to say that emotional disregulation usually stems from CHILDHOOD TRAUMA and that it can be worked through in therapy. Though he didn’t outright tell me to go to therapy, he pretty much insinuated that he thought I had unresolved trauma, right? That’s like extremely inappropriate no?? I work in a startup environment (despite being much bigger than a startup at this point) and I’m hesitant to go to HR due to the gossipy nature of the company. Any advice? Am I overreacting (something I guess I’m prone to because of my ‘childhood trauma’ 😀)?"
1,2024-03-08,Unfair Panel Interview??,u/Goldilocks622,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ba6etp/unfair_panel_interview/,antiwork,"Hi all. I just spent weeks in an interview process for a job I didn't get. During my final panel interview, the person leading the interview began by saying something like, ""I'm sure you've had a chance to review the questions that Panel Member A sent you.."" When I looked confused and shook my head, she asked, ""Did you receive them?""  At the time, because I thought it may have been true and I didn't want to point fingers, I said, ""I must have missed  them."" Not only did this make me look like a disorganized idiot, when I checked after the interview, it wasn't true. Panel Member A had NOT, in fact, sent me the interview questions. 

Obviously, if I had had time to prepare for the interview, my answers would have been more thorough. Is it fair of me to assume that other candidates, including the one they hired, probably did have the opportunity to see the questions in advanced?  If that was the case, I think it sux, and I have the sense it might not be legal. Shouldn't all candidates receive the same information? Would following up with them just make it seem like I have sour grapes? Because honestly, I do.  "

6,2024-03-08,My boss is trying to fire me. What would you do in my situation?,u/squish10,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ba7l0l/my_boss_is_trying_to_fire_me_what_would_you_do_in/,antiwork,"I currently work at a ~250 person tech startup. Recently there’s been a noticeable shift in the vibe at the company, as we’re under a lot of pressure to start hitting our metrics and making $$$. 

I work in a niche non-technical role and am the only person at the company with my job. The CEO announced our company goals for this coming year, and essentially the role that I was hired to do is no longer relevant to our new goals. Since the beginning of the year, I’ve been working on small projects here and there, but it’s clear that my role doesn’t fit into the broader strategy anymore. 

Performance reviews are coming up soon, and my manager has very recently started giving me constructive feedback via email, which is out of the ordinary. Usually he’ll give me feedback in our weekly 1<>1  or send it via a chat DM. He’s also begun checking in on me a few times a day, which is also out of the ordinary. The recent shift in his behavior has been stressing me tf out. 

It feels clear to me that my manager is trying to put me on a performance improvement plan, presumably to fire me. This is the first time in my career that I’ve been in this situation, and I could use some advice. 

The first thing I’ll say is that I’m not sure if the company would proactively lay me off, because I think they’d want to avoid paying a severance package. Ideally, I’d like to not get fired, but if I’m PIP’d then I know there isn’t much of a chance. 

I’ve been actively applying and interviewing for new roles starting last November, but the tech industry is still struggling and it’s been taking much longer to get consistent interviews. I have no intention of resigning from my job voluntarily, unless I end up finding a new job. 

Part of me is contemplating the idea of asking my manager to lay me off with a severance package, but I’m not sure if I have the guts to ask. I also assume he probably would have laid me off already if he had the option to. 

Lastly, I’d like to avoid burning any bridges, if I can help it. I don’t have hard feelings against my manager or the people I work with. So I’m not looking to entirely stop working and screw over my team. 

The stress of my job situation has been taking a toll on me, which is why I’d like to hear what all of you think. 

What would you do in my situation? "

In that time I've pretty much been playing videogames (played 25 videogames all the way through and beat one twice). I am very lucky in that I was living with my parents and have been good with working hard (used to work 60-90 hours a week for a couple years) and saving my money over the years so I am not stressing about that and barely spent any money during this time. I work in civil engineering as a tester / building inspector and during the winter months work slows down a lot because of the weather, so I ended up requesting 2 weeks off. During that vacation in which I mostly played videogames, I found the same job that pays better although it was in another state so I ended up not taking the offer at the time.

At the end of my two week vacation, my current company takes the next 2 weeks to train me for another position although one of the weeks I only work one day because of the weather. I promptly request another 2 weeks off, which they grant me because work is still slow. I pretty much just play videogames and I ask the company if the offer is still open near the end of my second 2 week vacation (there were 5 openings), which they say it is, and I take it. I put my 2 weeks in at my current company because they've been decent to me, and request I start my new job in the new state 5 weeks from then.

I only work about 20 hours a week my last two weeks, then clean up my place and mostly play videogames the rest of the time. I drive several states away, find a cheap room rented out by a nice family, play more videogames, and now I start my new job on Monday.

I've known a lot of people who get back from vacation and say they are glad to get back to work because they were getting bored...fuck that. These last few months make me want to never work again."

And I can't give too much detail, but I need some advice. If this isn't the place, I apologize.

This guy's is about 65-70 years old and the sweetest little guy you could ever meet. He's funny and caring and he'll go out of his way to help you. Even if he can't figure it out, he'll still try. He's reminds me of me sweet little old grandpa. 

There's this lady at work, who I'm not sure if she's a manager or what, but she was supposed to train me. She's snappy and rude at times to me, but she's always come to apologize later. It's....weird. I've been told she does it to everyone, and I don't work with her that much, so it's pretty easy for me to ignore. I think we work like 2 hours a week together? Maybe 3. 

Today, however, I worked and entire shift with her and this little old man for the first time. 7 hours. Usually thats nothing, but today was absolute hell. She screamed at this little guy until she was blue in the face and he cowarded in the corner like an abused dog. It made me sick and I was absolutely shocked and I'm so horribly ashamed to admit that I didn't know what to do....so I didn't do.. anything. Shed micro manage him, not pick. At one point, he got so confused with althe computer, he muttered to me, ""Please help me before she comes back."" And I tried and failed and she came back and I could see him tense up. But I think because I had the paper and I said, ""I can't figure this out."" She didn't scream at him. 

All day, I was trying to help him with his work, or ask him if he's ok, or try to advise him to go to HR. He's scared, like... He's terrified of this woman. And it's just a JOB. 

Anyway, after he left and she left, I was left alone to close with one other person who I asked about contacting HR anonymously and he said they'll only go to our boss and our boss screams at him worse and it'll make it worse for little old guy. She this dude helped me get the phone number to our bosses boss, but after our shift, he told me that when he first started, he made a complaint and now two years later.... Nothing was ever done. 

I don't give a damn about this job. I can always find another, I'll burn that bridge while standing on it.. what I CAN'T do is just ignore what's happening to this little old man. He won't stand up for himself, and I know you can't save people or force someone to help themselves when they don't want to, but there has to be SOMETHING I can do, right?? "

This man would scream over the radio at me if I got in his way for a second or two while turning. He would refuse to help me if I asked for advice and simply snarl over the radio ""what do you think"" and glare at me from his cab and yell if I inevitably started harvesting the wrong row of crops. 

He would get right up behind me when we were roading in the combine harvesters, I would be doing 30mph and he'd be literally 2 feet behind me telling me to speed up. I saw a 17yr old tractor driver get stuck and this man was so enraged he was literally hopping up and down with rage and pushed the kid into the mud when he climbed out of the tractor. He was also incredibly sleazy and would make gross comments about very young teen girls bodies (some were around 13) when driving around with him to get supplies. 

He would drop incredibly mean comments to me such as ""just a few more rows and you'll be a millionaire"" while staring at me from his cab with a shit eating smirk on his face. This man justified it all by acting all buddyish outside work as if it let him act like satan himself once work began. 

He was incredibly rich with over 2000 Acers of prime farmland and a giant fleet of modern tractors, harvesters and sprayers and still found ways to always make the paycheck come up a few dollars short and make a giant show of puling out his wallet and dropping the missing amount on the table when confronted. His usual pay method was to drop a pile of crumpled bills and payslips on the table and make everyone work out what belonged to who.

I quickly learned that while the average customer is not noteworthy, the awesome customer is incredibly rare while the heinous customer is all too common.

You know who I am talking about. The lady who shortchanges you at the till. The massive group that tips less than 2%. The other group that plays the “someone else will get the check” game until none of them are left in the building. The dude who’s steak is never right. The tip that looks amazing until you realize that $50 bill tucked under the coffee mug is actually an evangelical pitch.

That kind of experience teaches you things about people - not all of them good.

After those early days, I worked tech support for years. Helpdesk support for years after that. Production support for years after that. I have been in consulting and development for decades since then.

All this problem solving has tainted my worldview, and these days I absolutely resent any requests upon my time. It has gotten to the point where it is affecting my family life.

Here’s the thing: every single workday, I sit in meetings where people describe their problems in anticipation that one of us poor saps in the rotation will take ownership. This page won’t render. This data looks weird. I don’t have access. This error pops up. Blah blah blah. 

After a whole day of dealing with the problems of people I don’t care about, I come home to the problems of the people I do.

There are squirrels in the attic. This statistics homework is impossible. The car needs an oil change. This bill says it’s late. Blah blah blah.

After 25 years of this, I have fucking had enough. I am fraying at the edges, and it’s coming out in shitty ways. I find myself telling my family that I am in “low maintenance mode,” where unless a bone is sticking out I don’t want to hear it. I cringe when my wife calls my name because I know she is going to “make a request” so I can “provide value.” Rather than teach my kid how to fish, so to speak, I just do the homework for her because it’s faster.

I only get to relax after 10:00 PM, if I am lucky. The joke about getting too little sleep because the wee hours are all that you get to yourself? That’s been my whole adult life.

It’s not my family’s fault. This goddamned system has made other people’s problems my own just so that I can eat. My resentment is palpable.

Right now, I am going through the process of selling my house. The kid has moved on, this place is too big and I am sick of the mortgage. Besides, I get laid off at least once a year now due to factors out of my control, and every job I take afterwords is harder and pays less. Not to mention, age discrimination is absolutely real. 

I was able to afford this place five years ago. Not anymore.

Because I have to work balls to the wall to keep the lights on, my wife is the one who is driving the prep. In these past few months she has become just as angry and fed up as I am. All the stuff in the air and the expectations on her time and the need to keep a game face and what the schedule looks like and how we have no time and even less money. She wants to write, to sew, to make art. Instead she is researching countertops. 

Awfully, horribly, I experience a feeling of schadenfreude that says “Now you know what the last twenty years have felt like for me.”

At this point, the reader might say, “Why do you put yourself through all that?”

I’ll tell you why: college for my daughter.

My wife and I vowed back when our daughter was still in her belly that she wouldn’t be burdened like we were. Rather than work a job to pay someone else to watch our daughter, my wife stayed at home. We pinched and scrimped and saved, shopping at Goodwill and Value Village and Discount Grocery so that we could have a decent life with only one breadwinner.

Still, at the end of the day my daughter’s education has cost us almost $250,000. That’s in-state school, dual enrollment, scholarships and acceptance to a decent-but-cost-effective grad school because yesterday’s high school diploma is today’s master’s degree.

Now here I am, at odds with my wife and distanced from my daughter, selling our family home because I can no longer afford it since the cost of everything except my labor has skyrocketed since 2008.

I have never made more per hour than I did in the leadup to the Great Financial Crisis, even after inflation.

I don’t know if we are going to make it. My wife and I will be moving into an apartment about the same size as hers when she got pregnant with our kid. She calls it “moving backwards,” and I can’t blame her. 

God willing, I will be able to take a three month sabbatical with the equity from the sale and maybe we can remember who we were before American capitalism chewed us up and spit us out. 

Maybe we will realize that we would each be better now each on our own.

It’s sickening . After spending over half my life working for The Man to pay The Man, with a special surcharge so that we got to raise your kid instead of The Man doing it for us, I wonders who we even are without that.

Don’t get me wrong - I recognize GenX had it easier than the generations below us, and that my problems sound like dreams to some. But this is not the world my own parents lived in, and my generation is almost at the end of our line. We’ve paid in, and they are taking it all back from us. Absolutely all of it.

I fucking hate it here.




I fucking hate it here.

I’ve just spent the past half hour scrolling through Indeed job postings and it’s just made me even more depressed.

I come from a poor family. The type of poor that’s too poor to pay for education but makes just enough money to not qualify for student loans (in my province), so I couldn’t attend post-secondary education when graduating highschool. I’ve spent my life working shitty jobs, making $10.25/hr (minimum wage) 10 years ago, to now making $20.50/hr ($4 above current minimum wage). 

I’m a licensed security guard at the most dangerous site in my city and I can’t make more than $4 above minimum wage. Every job posting I’ve seen that doesn’t require post-secondary education pays at most $19/hr. I’m seeing jobs paying $26-30 an hour and excitedly click on them, for them to reveal they “require” a bachelors degree and 5 years experience. Are you kidding me?

I can’t afford rent or food, I can’t afford to live and this shit is almost making me feel like I don’t deserve to. Born poor, doomed to be poor forever."

When I was hired I was asked “what kind of hours are you looking for?” I said full time, minimum 35hrs a week. He said we could make that work. 

For the first month I was only getting 20-25hrs a week and I’m thinking “alright, might as well be training hours. I’ll talk to the boss and see how things change” 

Well they didn’t. In fact I’ve been getting less hours because I’m being sent home early due to business being slow. I make $13/hr and have more experience and qualifications under my belt than half the people there. Meanwhile the manager who’s been there for 12 years and has no certs or education makes $25/hr and works 50+ hours a week. Two minors in the store make $15/hr and all they do is fold pizza boxes and answer phones. 

When I brought this up again last week, I was told to pick up more days (I already work 5 days a week, don’t even get 40hrs in those 5 days) 

So essentially I told my boss I’m gonna be looking for a 2nd job and that my schedule will probably change. 

Little does he know that as soon as I find that job I’m quitting without a 2 weeks notice. 

Don’t promise me 40hrs a week, 5 days, and then give me 20 hours between 5 days. That’s one way to really piss me off. "

This is in insurance if that matters.
I was reading it’s 64 hours for sick days adding up to almost a week for more than 15 employees and 48h if less than 15 employees. PTO aka vacation days I’ll add in later. I don’t want them snooping or somehow finding this post but I don’t think many or any of them use Reddit anyways"

Two years ago, I transitioned from a teaching career into more of a corporate role. I’m still learning the ways a company hierarchy works. 

My boss has been mentoring me for the past year. We would have meetings on how to work with vendors, how to coach others, and other skills. I’ve stepped in to meetings for them when they were dealing with health issues. I have taken on management of projects. I have been working 50 to 60 hour weeks to keep up the work. 

This past year our team did better than it has done in the past 24 years. However, in February we are told that we won’t receive raises. This week, my boss was promoted. They supported not filling their old position. I’m stuck with no raise, no promotion, and most likely more of their tasks. They told me in a meeting that “next year (2025) will be my year”.

I’m tired. I’m frustrated. I don’t want to keep doing all this work for no reward. However, my company is notorious for layoffs. That makes me worry if I ‘work my wage’ that I will be next.

I’ve been extremely overworked and the manager is honestly a bit over the top. She screams a lot which can come off as rude and mean. As a person she’s nice but as a manager she sucks. Her teaching style has been so confusing that one moment she tells you to do one thing and while you’re doing that she moves you to do another task while still not being finished with the one you’re working on. And she does this thing where she talks to you while she’s turned around and it just pisses me off because I can’t hear! And man don’t get me started on all the work I have to do. I have to work register, food, kitchen, and dishes. It’s beyond exhausting and sometimes I get scheduled for long days! I literally just got scheduled from opening to closing shift. And when closing I always have to stay an hour extra and it’s exhausting. I’m a college student so I’m having to juggle that and two other jobs I work. And now the more I think about the place the less worth it, it sounds to me. I work there for long hours without a free meal at least only 50% off which btw is nothing because every food there is expensive. And then for extremely low pay. Last paycheck I only made 48 dollars for 14 hours! Like for me to be working that hard and then only making 48 is so not worth my time. So I’m trying to figure how I can quit but idk how to."

I currently work 4 jobs. One is full-time salaried, one is 1099 12-15 hours a week, one is part-time a few hours a week, and one is PRN when I REALLY need the money. 

I make about $40k at my full-time job BUT I make $50/h as a 1099 employee for a state government program. I provide counseling services as I have a Masters of Social Work. With my current caseload, I invoice for about $2500 extra a month (before tax).

My plan was to drop to part time at the current job I’ve been working since I started my post-grad program (it’s an office job that has nothing to do with social work). Because I could easily add more clients to my caseload, I was hoping to make the “jump” sooner rather than later.

However, getting paid over the last few months has been a nightmare. From September 2023 until January 2024, it was like clockwork. I would submit an invoice every other Thursday, my coordinator would approve it immediately, the check would be processed the following Wednesday, mailed the following Friday, and arrive the next Monday. Basically, I could count on a check 11 days after invoicing unless there was a holiday.

As of today, I’m still waiting on payment for invoices submitted on 1/18, 2/15, and 2/29 totaling almost $4000. The rule is that they cannot resend a check until 30 days has passed, so my 1/18 and 2/29 checks “should” have been mailed yesterday. Because of their track record, I have little hope.

My contract does not specify a net-30/60/90 billing cycle and my supervisor is PISSED. The lady who deals with accounts payable is very communicative but cannot give me a reason for why this is happening. The state will not provide mail tracking nor will they direct deposit.

I have been receiving other mail so I know my address isn’t the issue. I have not seen the checks in Informed Delivery and my mailbox has a lock. I called my local post office and they couldn’t help me.

I’m so tired of working so much for something I enjoy doing and not being able to save up to do more of what I love. I don’t know if someone at the courthouse, bank, or postal service is causing these issues but I’m frustrated and less motivated to work like I do.

TL;DR my checks for the contract work I do for my state are not being mailed to me and nobody in the chain of command can tell me why."

I say hello, put on a smile, offer pleasantries & small talk, and offer help on projects whenever possible. I don’t avoid professional collaboration at all, in our out of my department. Ive helped our sales team win a client, I’ve helped marketing in multiple projects, same with other departments.

But no, you will not be seeing me at the company outing after work unless you’re paying me to go. I’m not sorry that I’d rather go home to my family or hang out with my friends. 

You pay me to do a job and that’s what I do & I do it well. Respectfully, who the f do you think you are that I also owe you my free time and personal life? 

I also find it interesting that my male coworkers do not have the same expectation. I am the only female in my department & It’s totally fine that they put their head down and get to work. But for some reason i’m expected to get the same work done & also be a social butterfly for some reason? 

Don’t get me wrong, I’m grateful to have a job and I like what I do. But they got me f’d up thinking I’m going to give them more than what they pay for. 

Okay thank you for listening to my rant "

It’s actually insane that ive applied to over 300 jobs and not gotten one yet. Im gonna be left with no option but to unalive myself because I genuinely cannot afford to keep living. This isnt a joke or exaggeration. I cannot feed or house myself and have to rely on my bf who can’t afford it, so we’re both gonna end up homeless soon. How can so many places be “urgently hiring” yet none will hire me? I have no criminal record or anything to warrant being refused by SO MANY employers. Havent even been able to go the dentist in years bc i can’t afford my own healthcare. This is so insane. The fact that im left with no option but to unalive myself, just because of money, is absolutely insane. I actually cannot afford to keep myself alive anymore, i dont even WANT to die, i genuinely HAVE TO because im left with no other option.

Its been 2 years of applying at jobs while i rack up debt. My life is over. all im doing is ruining my boyfriend’s life and chance of saving for his future, he’d be better off if he didnt have to pay to keep me alive. He’d be better off saving so maybe he can have kids or travel one day. Im taking his life away by being selfish and letting him pay for me, but theres no way for me to leave, i cant afford to.


If i was in this exact situation 50 years ago it wouldn’t even be a problem, my bf being a welder wouldve been able to pay for us easily while i job search. I wouldn’t have even needed a job back then. 50 years ago finding a job would have NEVER taken over 2 years and 300+ applications anyway.
The world never used to be this way. The world makes no room for unlucky people like me anymore.


We are going to start losing so many people to suicide who would have NEVER given up their life otherwise, just because of this financial/employment crisis.

So, I'm in Massachusetts. My apartment is subsidized by the Department of Mental Health (I have severe PTSD), so I pay a third of my income.

On Wednesday night at 10pm, the power went out. I called maintenance, they said they'd come out in the morning 🙄 The next day, I finally had to call the Board of Health to send out an inspector before they actually gave any evidence whatsoever that they were working on it in earnest. The landlady didn't agree to pay for a hotel until Day 2 at 5:30pm (so almost 24 hours later). By then I was already in a hotel, which she would have known if she'd read the email I sent her at 3:30. Did I mention I'm in Massachusetts? It's freezing over here. Anyway, landlady finally agreed to pay for the additional nights, because apparently we're going to be in this hotel until Tuesday, because she doesn't want to pay an electrician to work the weekend.

Meanwhile, the reason she didn't get the email about the hotel is because she refused to interact with me directly because I have a disability. She wouldn't send me any emails; she just told DMH what she wanted them to tell me. Whenever I emailed her, I had to cc DMH. Finally after two days DMH told her she had to cut the crap basically and actually talk to me because being disabled does not make me a non-human.

Thing is, I really don't have money to be dealing with this, and I need to deduct these expenses from my rent or I won't be able to pay my bills. I want to deduct the hotel stay, spoiled groceries, food/supplies that I have had to buy to survive in the hotel, missed work, and pro-rated rent.

Is there a place somewhere where I can see the laws related to this? I've been googling and googling and I can't find anything about what I can deduct from my rent.

He told me that as long as I made minimum wage in the time that I was tipped, it is not illegal for me to work 30-45 minutes without tips while being payed a tipped wage.

This way they can keep count of our worked hours, so when we have overworked or gone home early they can edit the schedule and keep everything in order. 

So when people forgot or dont bother doing it, they just message their own teamleader and they have to check the security footage to see if they even have worked the hours they were scheduled for, then adjust it on the computer so they can get paid. 

Some of my coworkers from other locations dont even bother doing it or forget it completly. So they had enough and said that if we dont check in or out, or both, they wont pay us for what we worked. 

I talked face to face with my team manager about this and she says she agrees with the region manager bc they already have much administration work on their hands, and this will lighten the load a bit. I argued we are all people and we can forget things, but she said that is impossible. Checking in or out should feel like needing to eat. You should feel that you have to do it. 

Everyone disagrees with this new rule. And one co worker is even taking legal actions against this, because this is just illegal

I work at a high level in a very specialized field (coastal shipping). Last year a group of students from our local maritime training institute came out with us for a day or two of job shadowing, what we call in our industry a ""ridealong"". The students seemed to have a great time. Flash forward to fall 2023, and one of the ridealong students graduated top of her class. She immediately began canvassing the local companies for deckhand work (entry level position on ships) and got absolutely nothing back.

EVERY COMPANY she applied to responded with ""we need X amount of previous experience"" for an entry-level position. A position that requires the training that she had JUST completed. Training for which she had completed top of her class. Nevertheless, they all said ""you need previous experience"". My mind was blown.

Eventually, one of the partners in my firm made a call recommending her to a local operations manager, who in turn immediately hired her. She has since been doing very well, and I'm happy for her. 

But seriously, what the hell. The student graduating top of her class in a very specialized field where companies are CONSTANTLY crying about ""labour shortages"" couldn't be given the time of day, that is until a very senior man in the industry placed some personal calls to vouch for her. 

If you are hiring for a position that is by every definition and sense of the word ""entry-level"", then why in hell do you need to wait for ""previous experience""? ESPECIALLY if the entry-level position involves mandatory training that the candidate has already completed?!! Make it make sense.

But it's not the worst thing yet... I dispise the majority for being stubborn in their replication of ruling class ideology. You can discuss with some folk how the system is immoral and so on...but the majority takes pride in speaking something that isn't in their interest at all.

None of the quality or safety people were extended offers from the new company.  Our last day is in 2 weeks and we've been sabotaging production.  The new company has already started bringing in their own production supervisors and pallet builders.

Every pallet goes through an inspection station where a person examines it before it goes to the stacking machine.  The new builders are at about 60% pass rate when 95% is the goal.  We've been letting the worst defects pass inspection while rejecting every minor defect.  We've also been allowing oddly shaped pallets (parallelograms instead of rectangle) jam the stacking machine which slows the production line down.  It's been great seeing the new supervisors panic over the low production numbers and we just had a customer reject a load yesterday.  Small wins.

Well… they are now hiring for my replacement and oh my, this position sounds like 3 positions in one, and I realize that’s exactly what I was doing! In the job posting, my supervisor has finally been able to succinctly list all of the projects that I’d be expected to do in this role and it is A LOT.  No pay raise mind you.

I honestly feel kind of taken advantage of.  A recruiter friend for a better-run  office in the firm reached out to me shocked because job announcements are heavily vetted and they can’t believe this was approved as it is clearly multiple job roles. Imagine their surprise when I told them that that’s exactly what I had been expected to do. 

 Best of luck to the poor person that actually takes on the role.  At least this time they will know what they are getting themselves into I guess

Hello, so I work in a kitchen, and I've been growing increasingly more frustrated with this job, as every two weeks upper management introduces a new policy or a bigger workload making the job a little more difficult for us without increasing pay at all. We don't even get so much as a thank you from our manager, who recently assigned a list that we have to complete EVERY NIGHT before we close, which is unrealistic considering it is MANDATORY to take a 45 minute break, and they don't allow us overtime anymore, they freak out if we go above the clock. So I simply do the bare minimum and my boss fusses, but I still won't break my neck for it.

So my main point is that, if I ever tell my friends or my cousin (who I live with and pay 700 dollars rent for....I need to move out...) then at some point I'll get told ""Hey! At least you dont live in a third world country! (even though we are a first world country by exploiting those countries) Or Someone else has it worse! Think about the guy who comes in and wipes all the tables after everyone eats!""

And my thought process is...so your basically telling me to stop complaining and to just keep dealing with this shit, because someone has it worse then me. My feelings don't matter.

The thing that really bothers me is that you can apply that logic to any position and keep going down the chain until you reach a literal worm, and even then there are things worse than being a worm.

I'm sure you guys know this, but its just a way to invalid your feelings and make you feel like shit for even thinking there's something wrong with the system. To just be complacent and dont complain.

Fuck man I just want to draw my characters, I am right now, but I have work in a few hours."

Volunteering is bullshit. I don’t mean working as part of a charitable organization, though that has its issues. I mean this person said they volunteer shelving books at a public library. Not for nothing, but there are Masters of Library Science who would love to work at a library, but can’t do it for free, so they flip burgers while Shitty McPrivilege works for free.  The amount of labor required to run the library is more than they are budgeted for. They made a calculation error or the municipality needs to throw more money at them. But allowing people to do the work the library needs doing for free would be like mopping up an abattoir for free. 

(Side note) To address the idea of charitable organizations using free labor we need to look at what these organizations do. Generally they are feeding the hungry, providing social/medical/mental health services, or closing gaps that capitalism has rent open. In essence, doing what community and specifically what government should be doing. I’m OK with the idea that charities do this, but I’d rather mutual aid be on top of what the government does, not in spite of its shortcomings. "

Usually what happens at the end of each day is that they throw away pounds of all the fresh food that they prepare if it’s not sold. And from that pile of food that was being thrown away he had two chicken strips cuz he was really hungry, (he is in foster care for reference, has been working since his mom was sent to drug rehab), and once they found out they fired him from the job. This is the first time he was fired ever and his foster family has been very harsh on him since. He was embarrassed and ashamed for being fired for that reason so he told them he was laid off, which then promoted them  to go to every single manager in the store to figure out what exactly happened and to further humiliate him at home. My friend has been showing signs of being suicidal lately ever since this all happened and it really broke me so I thought and told them I’d go on here and ask all of your opinions on this situation. I’ll be honest , my opinion is that I find it absolutely ridiculous that pounds and pounds of fresh food is thrown away daily at places like this, just think of all the fresh food thrown away at restaurants and grocery store hot bars alike. Sometimes they even throw bleach on the food or tarnish the packaging of packaged food by cutting it all up, is no one else angered by this? So much food is thrown out that could easily be given to homeless shelters. And to fire a hungry kid over eating a chicken strip from the pile of food that was ready to be thrown in the garbage pile regardless just seems ridiculously dystopian and cold hearted to me. What are your thoughts?



Edit: for those of you who are restaurant managers or work at food places, consider asking your management to use the app “TooGoodToGo for all the food wastage. It is an app I just found out that helps restaurants and grocery stores sell the extra food at the end of the day for a cheaper price within a timeframe in “mystery boxes”. And if you are someone who is running low on finances, consider using the app. It is free to use for both users and store owners so there is honestly no reason to not."

Because at the time, like I said it was a 4 hour shit & I only got paid like 10-15 hours a week, I knew he would get on me if I didn’t remember something so I didn’t remind him, but was that a but childish of me? I was 19 at the time if that means anything.

A close friend of mine was a full time employee of a bottle shop, he was offered the manager position and took it, also a full time position. The bottle shop changed ownership, and my friend has only just discovered that after about a year of working for this new owner, his position was changed from full time, to casual, without his consent or knowledge. His salary did not change whatsoever which I believe means he’s been underpaid, and he has also because of this not accrued ANY annual or sick leave in that time completely without his knowledge. 

Can anyone tell me if this is illegal/does he have grounds to take this to fair work and try to correct this robbery? Thankyou."

38,2024-03-10,I Work For An Airline And We Get Fired For Taking Sick Days,u/HarvardHick,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bb4per/i_work_for_an_airline_and_we_get_fired_for_taking/,antiwork,"I desperately want another job, but this is the only one I have been able to land since moving to Boston. I work in airport operations for one of the major airlines. Work in the aviation industry is often glamorized, but I dread going to work everyday and have nightmares about my work when I’m at home. I live in Boston, have an MA in History, an MBA in Marketing, SIDA clearance from the Department of Homeland Security, and a certification in Airport Operations, yet I make less than $40,000 a year working over 40 hours a week. We are only permitted a $0.20 per hour raise a year, which is not even sufficient to counter the average yearly rate of inflation. The value of my salary will actually go down year after year. Once you are with the airline for around five to six years, your raises are more consistent with the rate of inflation, but usually the airline fires or offers buyouts to employees who have been here long enough to receive higher raises in order to replace them with lower paid employees. 

Most people who work this job are here for the flight benefits, but we are only permitted to travel on standby when flights are not full, and lately, almost every single one of our flights has been full due to reductions in our fleet from repairs of manufacturing defects. Traveling on standby means being at high risk of being stranded and unable to return to your home state in time for your next shift. As a consequence, I have yet to use my flight benefits. 

I am on my feet for nine hours a day, and because we are not allowed to wear supportive or comfortable footwear (we must wear dress shoes with thin soles and are encouraged to wear heels), I come home in agony after every shift. I have to spend close to four hours commuting back and forth to the airport everyday in addition to my 9 hour shift because my shift begins before public transport opens for the morning, so I have to leave for work before public transport closes on the night prior to my shift and arrive super early without pay. On the average day, I prepare for work around 10:00 pm at night, arrive at the airport early for my 2:30 am shift, work until past 11:00 am, arrive back home around 1:00 pm, eat, go to sleep, and begin preparing to leave for the next shift at 10:00 pm again. The administration knows that many of their employees do not have a car and are reliant on public transport, yet we were informed that if we wish to keep this job, we must come in when public transport does not operate and stay at work over an hour in advance uncompensated. This is ridiculous, because TSA is not present that early in the morning, and no flights are departing at that hour, so we should not be having to serve customers so early. It takes over an hour on public transport to get there if there are no disruptions or delays anyway. 

We receive a singular fifteen minute break a day and a thirty minute lunch. These are not permitted at even intervals, so some days you may have your break and your lunch period within the last hour of the day and work the other eight hours without relief. 

We do not receive hazard pay even though we are trained by the Department of Homeland Security to contend with significant safety threats. For example, if we identify a possible bomb, we are required to stay with the bomb while we wait for the bomb squad to arrive. We are not allowed to leave and seek safety. 

If I use a sick day and provide a doctor’s note to the administration, I receive a permanent penalty on my record. I currently have two penalties on my record because I developed an upper respiratory infection and laryngitis shortly after beginning work due to the fact that we did not have access to soap or hand sanitizer to wash our hands after handling credit cards and passports and licenses and suitcases all day for a period of time. I became literally incapable of speech for a few days - I could not produce a single word - and therefore had to stay at the house in silence to recover.  After three penalties, I will be terminated from my position. While you are out sick, the company suspends your flight benefits and will not return them to you until a week or two after you’re back to work. This means you cannot fly elsewhere for medical care or to stay with family and cannot have a relative fly out to take care of you. 

It works the same way if you take unpaid leave. If, for example, you were getting married and took unpaid time off for one week or two weeks to go on your honeymoon, the company would suspend your flight benefits so that you cannot use them to travel. This makes it even more difficult to use your international flight benefits, because you cannot travel internationally and make it back in time to work in your weekly two day break. We only get two weeks of vacation time every year, and that has to be budgeted to account for the fact that we don’t receive any sick pay, and we don’t receive 99.9% of conventional holidays off. Between using that paid time off to spend Christmas with your family and to suffer (penalized) with an illness you contracted at the airport because you can’t afford to be vaccinated for the third world diseases you’re exposed to there, you really don’t have any time off to travel. 

I study part-time for my third graduate degree at Harvard University. When I began this position, the administration tried to convince me to drop out of Harvard so that “my only commitment would be to the airline.” I was told that being accepted into a position at this airline was harder than being accepted to Harvard. Trainees are even required to sign a contract that says “I will get rid of every commitment outside of my commitment to this airline.” 

I see so many insane reviews online about how this airline is “so flexible” and fairly treats and pays its employees, and I am so confused because this has not been my experience at all. During training, we literally were not allowed to go to the restroom outside of scheduled break times. I want a better job that doesn’t consume 100% of my day. "

I work(worked) at this small-town bar that can get a little rowdy. There was a guy we had cutoff hours before, I’m not even sure if he was served by my bar’s staff or if he came in drunk already, but he would NOT leave. He groped/harassed a server, tried to start a fight with another patron,  and the manager wouldn’t kick him out. He got more and more people riled up with his behavior and started flashing his gun, which he is not supposed to have in a bar!! A fight eventually broke out between him and MANY of the other patrons. Someone near me said “he’s got a gun” and we all hit the floor.  I wasn’t sure what was going to happen, if he had pulled it or if someone else had one as well. The cops came very quickly and arrested him and one other person, and everything just…slowly went back to business as usual. I feel like I’m the only one who sees the danger here… someone could have been killed. I quit and walked out as soon as I felt safe enough to leave my sheltering spot. My boss told me “things happen” and that I was basically being over dramatic. I don’t feel like I’m being over dramatic. I shouldn’t have to risk my life to serve shitty beer. 

This is also the second time in the last two weeks I have felt unsafe at this bar, but the first time was not AT ALL this level, hence why I’m just now leaving. "

Well he didn't keep things organized and stayed in his car for his shift. His side had 10 carts in the bay and now I'm getting yelled at for being slow on collecting the carts. I got so mad I vented on the walkie talkie and said 'The coworker is stealing time he's not working!'. No response. I did learn something though from today and that is if I'm paired with someone as young ang lazy as him is to keep watched of the whole lot to make it easier for myself in the end.

3,2024-03-10,Am I overreacting?,u/pcxo78,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bb66zq/am_i_overreacting/,antiwork,"I work in a small hotel doing front desk that runs 24/7 (honestly it’s giving motel) and from the day I started the previous staff, which have all been fired now over the past 2 months, were the sloppiest, most unprofessional workers ever. It was common for people to no-call/no-show, be multiple hours late, consume drugs on site, sleep in the rooms or in the lobby when they were supposed to be housekeeping, and the majority of them belonged to a sober living program hence their unpredictable, careless behavior. 

On multiple occasions the previous front desk shift would be stuck doing an entire 16 hr shift from no-shows. Not to mention the hotel is very old so people, who spend hundreds because of the location, are without hot water, working TVs, and we don’t even offer basic amenities like coffee and tea. 

And management at no point had ANY consequences for these employees’ actions nor has had concerns for renovating and fixing building issues and has let it ride over the next 2 months up until last month when everyone got fired. 

I work the shift no one wants: overnight. And I loved it up until this point because I have 8 hours to read, write, and study on my laptop as I am studying several programming languages. I have ADHD so I need to keep my brain stimulated and challenged. So I haven’t had any issues ever falling asleep until now. We now consist of a solid, reliable team who shows up and does their job with minor issues and the best customer service we can offer considering the building issues. 

As of recently management is now enforcing a no electronic devices, drawing/writing, or recreational activity policy to keep “professional guidelines” in place. Where were these rules when you had the previous staff? And how are they worried about professionalism when people are going 3+ days without hot water amongst other building issues and we don’t give refunds? 

This has happened in the past week and I find it to be absolutely ridiculous considering there’s SO much downtime during our 8 hr shifts, we’re all responsible, and most of us are students who have things to work on. I now find myself dozing off by the last few hours working the QUIETEST HOURS OF THE NIGHT of my shift because reading isn’t enough for me to keep my brain busy. 95% of the time I see no one out of their rooms until sunrise. 

I’m trying to find a solution to stick this job out considering the market is absolutely trash and it’s honestly depressing me. Am I overreacting? Do they really expect us to sit here at a desk for 8 hours like a robot? What can I do to turn this around? They’re strict on it and are saying write-ups and consequences will follow. 

TLDR: Hotel management canned the worst employees ever and had no policies or consequences in place during their employment and is now punishing the reliable employees to no recreational activities in the free time of our 8 hr shifts. "
8,2024-03-10,Speakerbox,u/ffarwell83,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bb6uht/speakerbox/,antiwork," 

I had a friend.

We shared stories after work on occasion for a bit. 

He would talk non stop about anything.

He was known as “Speakerbox” at our job.

He would just talk to everyone about anything even if all hell was breaking loose, he’d have time to tell you about his day.

I knew there were traits about him that I saw in myself too. 

We often hate the things in others that we fear for ourselves. 

I would never want to interrupt anyone’s story, but as the months went on at the job we shared, I felt less inclined to stay afterwards and listen to the gripes of the day, and became more focused on myself.

But Speakerbox never left the employee table early.

He was always the one who would want to stay longer to listen to everyone’s stories and add his thoughts to the matter, even after working a full shift. 

He had such a good spirit, it makes me ill to know that he was forced out of our job because the management deemed him to be “too much.” 

Not even a full year later after being fired and our coworkers life comes to an end, because in America, you run out of options when people think “you’re too much to deal with.” 

I want to cry right now but I can’t because I know it’s just a waste of time. 

I have to work in the morning. "

Semi vague for privacy reasons. Sorry about post length, but seriously thank you in advance. 🩷)


Background: I posted previously about my boss giving us the wrong tax forms. That was fixed, and I had been correct about needing W-4s. All is well on that front.


Now I have some other issues that I don’t know if it is worth it to discuss with the president of the org I work for. We are a small team of three people. The boss/president, me, and the other admin assistant. I’m technically slightly above the other assistant but not by much, especially because she is a family friend of the boss’s.


On Friday, she and I were supposed to switch off at a local event, her from 10-12, me from 12-2. I came in Friday morning with an email from the boss of things to work on around the office and the admin telling me she would be there with the boss from 10-2. I was confused because when I left the day prior, that was not the plan. So things are being decided without my awareness or input, and I honestly don’t feel like part of the team. (Doesn’t help that I sometimes feel like I’m babysitting two people in their very early 20s, and I’ll be 30 next month. Age doesn’t always mean you’re immature, but in this case, it does apply.)


I’ve also had red flags pop up constantly over the past few weeks. The boss/president, who is actually interim, has moved our office into a new building and spent over 30k-35k on things online for the office. Furniture, wall stuff (some of which we kinda needed for certain rooms, like brochure holders and displays and maps), etc. Throwing things out or not returning instead of returning said items for money back in our accounts? 


One day, boss said (in effect, I don’t have his precise wording memorized) while working on the budget, “They’re gonna be so pissed at us.” Well, who is they? The board or the county? Or??? Is it because the office is so full of new things, like your $250 desk set and $600 pleather couch for your office, that they won’t want to approve your budget? Your budget that is an estimated 158% higher than the budget from last year? All I picked out for the office is a new rug for my office (old one was dirty and damaged) and a desk set for less than $25. I told him no to some stupid fancy wood filing cabinet for my office.


Part of me is concerned that our payroll is also connected in part to the budget— because I don’t know how payroll is processed for us, and that’s partly on me for not knowing to ask how it is funded.


On Friday, I had one of our contractors come in, while I was the only one in the office, upset because they had a supplier who was waiting on a check from us to be in the mail. (As of Friday, it likely should have been in the mail a week or two prior.) I explained to them that I didn’t know anything about the checks or if they had been done, and if they hadn’t maybe it was because the board requested a more specifically itemized invoice or the board needed to approve the checks (which they always do) (aka bs to placate them at the time but assure them I would actually seriously look into it)— basically, idk but I can ask if you want me to or you can reach out to the boss yourself. They left and did reach out to him. Came back like 15 mins later to say he seemed like he wanted to throw me under the bus and they were concerned for me. It’s a small town, and people talk. He didn’t bring anything up the rest of the day about, but I don’t know if that’ll come back to haunt me despite doing the right thing and not blowing them off.


I honestly feel like I’m overreacting to all of this, but like many of you, I’ve been taught to trust my gut instincts because they’re likely partly correct. I suffer from anxiety and depression, and this is taking a toll on me despite being only a few weeks into this role. Bare minimum, I want better communication between the three of us. At best, I want to be able to help put out whatever dumpster fire is starting behind the scenes before it blows up in our faces. I do like my job, but I’m not going to let my neck get put on the chopping block because of things I didn’t approve of or didn’t know about."
57,2024-03-10,90% of my life is work,u/zingingcutie35,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bbc0py/90_of_my_life_is_work/,antiwork,"I usually have only 2 or 3 days off each month if I’m lucky. I’m working two jobs right now just to try to stay afloat. These are usually 17-hour days. I am chronically ill but the doctors can’t figure out exactly what’s wrong or how to help me with the pain and fatigue, so I’m doing all of this while sick with no treatment or medical accommodations. My days off are consumed by chores, errands, grocery shopping, meal prepping, doctor’s appointments, etc. I’m drowning in medical debt. I literally don’t have any free time to do my hobbies because I need every second to try to catch up on rest or my muscle weakness / dysfunction will be worse. I am so burnt out, but I spend every night terrified of not being able to pay my bills and losing my apartment. I’ve been selling off my possessions but nothing I do is ever enough.

I am almost 39, and I had to give up on having children because my company’s health insurance doesn’t cover fertility treatments for lesbian couples. I will never be able to own a house (median price in my area for listings is currently $1.1 million). I dream of moving out of the south (it’s scary here for LGBTQ folks) but have never been able to afford it. I have nothing saved for retirement because my illness wiped everything out. I went through a medical bankruptcy in 2016. But I still have mountains of student loan debt from law school, which I had to drop out of because of my medical issues getting worse. Working myself like this while sick probably means I won’t survive until retirement, anyway, though.

I got married 7 years ago, but my wife has gone through several layoffs, and she is often paid as 1099 even when acting as a full-time employee. So our two incomes still aren’t ever enough. The layoffs add so much extra stress to our lives.

Btw, we couldn’t even afford a wedding. No guests, cake, dancing, photos, not even a white dress. I know that stuff doesn’t matter, but it’s hard to see everyone else’s photos and hear their memories while knowing I stood in the mud in a junior’s prom dress to take my vows while my dad refused to come out of the bar to see like we had planned because he’s an alcoholic and got there early, so he was already drunk. Having a honeymoon would have been nice, too. Oh well, I guess.

I have had some amazing things happen in my life. My wife was able to take me on a business trip to Paris two years ago—my dream city. It was the highlight of my entire life, and it didn’t cost us very much since the company paid for everything except my flight. But that was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing! Am I supposed to be satisfied with one glorious week while working like a slave for the rest of my entire life?!

And that trip gave me a taste of the world. I want to explore and see what life has to offer. I want to try new foods and learn new languages. I want to write a novel and start a blog. But I can’t do any of these things. I have a master’s degree with honors, have always worked hard, and I feel like the dreams that were sold to me were a lie. Is this just our system? That sick people have to work their lives away to still not be able to afford their bills? Is there anything we can do to break out of it on our own?

TLDR: Our system sucks, especially for the chronically ill, and I’m working my life away like a slave while missing out on experiencing anything other than sitting in a cubicle or stocking shelves. I’m so tired, and really sad. The financial stress that I’ve endured since I was 10 years old just never seems to end."

I had a job doing data entry for an insurance company for less than a month. It was awful, spent most of the day being ignored, barely trained, had remote work dangled as some kind of unattainable reward even though the position offered was hybrid…. Anyway, it was not for me. I was lucky to find something else and left after about a month.
This was back just after Thanksgiving last year. In the office on my second day (first day I was ignored except for about 30 minutes talking to a “supervisor”) they gave me a laptop and keycard in a branded backpack. I quit without two weeks, sent an email to the supervisor, and was given all the termination paperwork and whatnot in that email thread. About a week later someone else reached out asking me to send the stuff back “in the packaging it came in.” It didn’t come in packaging, I told her, as I got it in person, and she said she would send a box to send it back in, but there may be a couple weeks delay due to the holidays. This email thread was started December 15th, and… that’s the last I’ve heard.
Now this is a very long winded way of asking….. when can I jailbreak this laptop and use it as my own? I personally am afraid to do it, maybe I’m being a coward, my partner and friend (who also worked their and quit shortly after me) and several others have told me to just do it. But I’m nervous! It’s not worth it to me if they can threaten me with repercussions if they EVER get back to me.

TLDR: big insurance company never gave my the resources to return work provided laptop, and I wanna know if/when I can…. Have it."

I want to write a piece about how I challenged the systems of power that perpetuate inequality, poverty, marginalization and injustice. Given my history as a corporate whistleblower, I was intentionally targeted to silence my voice and undermine my credibility. 

Can you tell me your thoughts? List ideas, comments, and feedback. Tks

Powerful institutions involved, Nonprofit Industrial Complex NPIC, saw me as a threat to their interests and worked to isolate and marginalize me. 

Here is how it starts. If a person enrolls in SNAP (food stamps), it allows the State to track where the person goes in the United States. Individuals who are needy, enroll in assistance programs like SNAP to help them buy food. This allows the government to track their personal information and location. One way to keep a person down, is when they do get work, whatever State that is, that job could be rescinded (if its offered) before or after starting, which can be influenced by a person's participation in assistance programs, or other systemic biases (poverty, homelessness via ""PO Box address"" on file, which you don't want to have). With the challenges in getting a job and being retained (I become a work opportunity tax credit WOTC hire once its is discovered the person has been on public assistance), then the person has trouble improving their financial situation, thus trapping them in a cycle of poverty. This is what happened to me. I had a hard time getting professional work after I reported corporate fraud. 

I worked in insurance, mortgage, human resources to name a few. I have strong industry knowledge and when I helped the clients I was hired to help, that wasn't exactly what my employer intended me to do. Can you imagine if I worked in nonprofit? I would actually want people to find jobs and not exist on perpetual handouts and establish ""repeat customers.""

The lack of upward mobility once you become a WOTC work opportunity tax credit hire is exacerbated by being on public assistance, particularly with me. ""Why would a middle aged woman with a Masters degree end up on public assistance?""

That is rare and causes a RED flag. nonprofit industrial complex, benefits from this by perpetuating the cycle of poverty because people on SNAP are tracked when they make their food purchases with their card. That is how it was discovered I was in State #1, then moved to State #2, then moved to State #3. Each job knew my SNAP history because the state govt agency that issued the card uses The Work Number. And once I worked, my SNAP stopped, then the agency sends a WOTC form to that employer to get a tax subsidy for hiring me from a ""targeted group.""

Data sharing is never explained to anyone on SNAP or HMIS (homeless management information system) or in an ER at a hospital if you apply for Medicaid or charity care. You get screwed and labeled as indigent. 

The state agencies have to track the person once they get a job, because they stop the benefits once you begin work. But as soon as that job ends, you can contact them again to get reenrolled, which is what they hope you do. Each individual on SNAP generates federal funding to the State.

If you find work again, you will eventually lose that job, because that employer that hires gets a letter that states, ""You are eligible for a work opportunity tax credit WOTC, because your employee is on public assistance, complete the attached form and return the form.

That IS the cycle of poverty.

People on SNAP are typically, generationally poor, or new to poverty like me. This is how the nonprofit industrial complex works. The goal is to keep the person disenfranchised.

The cycle of poverty:

It's the tracking of those SNAP purchases that starts the moment you enroll in it. The attempt to improve my situation through employment triggers the suspension of benefits. 

This is WHY people don't want to go to homeless shelters because they are forced to enroll in HMIS (homeless management information system) and are tracked through that, which is even worse. Because now employers know you are really down on your luck, and they can further exploit you. It is also why it's been hard to get a job and why employers like the government want long term employees. I am a systems thinker. I see the big picture. The majority of people out here have linear thinking. Those who have worked in the same career for decades or with the same employer  have no frame of reference because of long-term immersion in a single environment, where individuals are less exposed to diverse experiences and perspectives that might challenge their understanding of these issues. 

Some very astute people will try and find jobs off the grid (like washing dishes, bussing tables at a restaurant, childcare, or housekeeping, ANY work that is ""under the table,"" where they don't pay taxes and their jobs are not closely monitored by the state, or jobs with SMALL businesses that don't use The Work Number).

With my education which is on record with background screening companies, I can't escape because a person with college degrees is not typically on SNAP (food stamps) later in life or in homeless shelters. 

Also, people who work in nonprofits (social workers) tend to focus on isolated factors when working with a homeless person. That's that low level linear thinking. When they deal with me (systems thinker) they don't know what to do with that. 

Because I see the whole picture when trying to analyze a problem.

I can identify patterns, trends, and systemic issues that might not be immediately apparent to others. This makes people uncomfortable because they can only handle one thing at a time (telling a person who is homeless to go to a shelter or enroll in SNAP or get any job because ""some job is better than no job."")

The real-world systems defy simple, linear explanations. 

Social services don't want people to engage in long term thinking. They don't want you to consider the potential long-term impacts of get by low wage employment. Employers who hire think long term and can see you or I am overqualified, and in survival mode. 

CORRUPTION

Those who claim to help the needy are more focused on securing financial aid and maintaining their own financial stability than addressing the long-term needs of the people they claim to serve."

The District Manager contacted me the next day and we had a quick, informal phone discussion. He stated I was a top tier candidate (based on resume and previous interview for another position) and wanted to set up an in-person meeting. We scheduled it for the following week but then he contacted me the next day asking to reschedule the meeting to Friday (two days later). When we met, he was laser focused on showing me the Woodcraft inventory systems and general day to day stuff. No formal interview was conducted. I told him I was very comfortable with the computer programs because of prior retail experience. 

Prior to leaving, we scheduled another meeting, this time being a virtual call with the DM and the owner of that particular store. On the day of the call, the DM contacted me an hour before and asked if I was able to reschedule because the owner was having “personal issues” at home and wouldn’t make the meeting. I agreed to reschedule and the DM said it might be possible to still complete the interview later in the day but he would contact me regardless. 

The DM failed to reach out for several days so I called him to followup. He acted like he didn’t know who I was and after I explained the nature of the call, he said he was busy working at the store and would call me back later that day or the following day at the latest. It’s been nearly a month, completely ghosted. I can handle not being considered further, it happens, that is life but what irritates me is being lied to about it.

Now this job is an hour away so everyday, she leaves with ample time. (usually gets there 30-40 minutes before her shift). Mind you, we know traffic each given day fluctuates, but without fail she is there early every shift usually sitting around waiting for her shift to start. Today her shift started at 2:30 and she was due to arrive around 2:15 today because traffic was kind of bad. She was completely on time until out of nowhere there was a bumper to bumper traffic jam on the highway caused by a completely random accident. Now mind you she called once when the gps changed to 2:30 arrival, but called again when it read 2:56. The person who answered started lecturing her about leaving way earlier. This person is a peer in the same position (which isn't even management...just literally keyholders). I will add that this coworker is a little kiss ass but i digress.  


My gf put in her two weeks in last week, and there aren't that many people working there and its kinda busy (4 people last I remember). We are adults (29 and 30 respectively) so we know the importance of being on time to work and are understand VERY well that being late kinda fucks people over. However, things happen out of our control. The gps said nothing about slowed traffic at the time, so the accident that made her late most likely happened minutes before she got stuck in that spot. She called her job and her co-worker told her ""that's why you should leave a couple hours before coming in so we make it on time"". She left at 1 and we live an hour away.

&#x200B;

Just listening to this happen pisses me off. I told my gf if I was her, I would have turned around and went straight home. Two weeks my ass.. There's other reasons why she quit that have added up but this is the icing on the cake. Has anyone on here had things happen to them either commuting to work or even at work they get in trouble for even though you were doing everything else right, but something happened out of anyone's control?

1,2024-03-10,Get rid of mandatory lunch breaks.,u/Particular-Size4740,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bbj7s2/get_rid_of_mandatory_lunch_breaks/,antiwork,"I just changed jobs from a restaurant to a retail store and I hate the legally mandated break policy. At the restaurant, we took breaks whenever we could. Basically if there were no customers needing help or mess that needed cleaning at any given time, that time was your break. I loved this system, because even though it means some days (usually weekends) we’d have to work 10 hours straight without sitting down or getting a meal or cigarette, other days we’d get paid for 10 hours when we spent 5 working and 5 sitting on our ass. Pretty sweet deal tbh.
 
Now that i’ve moved to retail, the breaks are scheduled and mandatory. My work day is 9 hours, but I only get paid for 8. My tasks are interrupted every two hours, taking me out of the zone and lowering my efficiency. I have nothing to do during breaks except chainsmoke, doomscroll, and watch the clock. I would much rather work 8 hours straight and spend all my free time at home. It’s not even my employer that’s to blame, it’s federal law. I have no idea where anyone got the idea that adults can’t go 8 hours without eating or sitting down. Trying to talk HR into letting us use the last hour of the day for “lunch” and just go home. "

1,2024-03-10,Henry David Thoreau this piece ,u/BohemianNapsQuickly,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bbjoh3/henry_david_thoreau_this_piece/,antiwork,"For the record I’m not actually gonna live in the woods, don’t actually worry about me, I like indoor plumbing. Also modern medicine is pretty neat. Also this is potentially illegal. Plus I feel like once you leave society re-entry is gonna be a pain. It’s only a fantasy/rant, but whatever. If you actually read all this congratulations, also what the hell is wrong with you?

Does anyone else seriously fantasize about just moving to the woods and living off the land? Like, I get most people couldn’t logistically do this, but I’ve spent a boatload of time in the woods, extremely experienced outdoorsman. I get lost in the woods for fun, I’ll literally keep my compass and maps in my pack as much as possible and hike a back country loop trying to navigate back to my origin without walking back on the same trail. I’ve walked out of the woods after 4 hours right to my drivers side door. I work outside in all climate conditions. I’ve outdoor camped in subzero temps. I’ve done tree tagging and know where to avoid camping to avoid getting killed by falling trees and branches, I know how to act around bears, moose, deer, snakes, etc. I can build an effective water filter. The real thing that would end up getting me would be infection or some other medical issue, but I’d have a radio. Probably would need to get groceries every six months to supplement some vitamins and minerals, or get used to eating a lot of fish liver. Anyway, I would have no intention of camping long term, after getting initial camp set up I’d start digging in.

I’d want to build a shelter near a water source, I’d need to be real selective about the site, design, and build. Here’s the thing though, I’ve spent the last decade building houses for other people, and not just building them, designing and drawing fully specified plans, not production houses either, 7 figure customs,  centenarian remodels in historical districts, houses on islands, all sorts of building styles and techniques. I could definitely pull this off, like, I’d need to be close to a town, would want a transportation source for quick evacuation and a radio. I’d also need to haul a small trailer worth of tools into the woods so finding a site would be tricky. I’d need to do a bunch of review for topography, research soil types for future agriculture, check flood maps and area drainage, etc, find a site out in the sticks with minimal access, old forestry area where they’re allowing regrowth would work. Would need to find a spot with good tree coverage, I’d assume someone would be taking aerial photos I wouldn’t want to appear on. I’d set up a teepee to start, dig an out-house, then begin excavating. I’d do a stone foundation with a timber frame, probably a low slope shed roof into a hill. The design would depend on site but I have a plethora of ideas. Tiny sort of thing, couple weeks to build, 4 walls and a roof. I’d probably get booted by BLM or someone eventually, so I’d need to tip toe the letter of the law with temporary structures, be willing to return land to previous condition, probably plan on getting booted eventually but whatever, the thing knocks over to a pile of deadfall in a few hours and then I get to build another cabin, I like building cabins. 

In meanwhile I know somewhere I can keep my address listed, so I won’t be homeless, and I’d just fish, smoke fish, plants some vegetables. I can garden, I can catch and clean fish, I have build my own bow and arrows,  and know how to hunt with them. I can clean and process birds and deer, whole process, the venison in my freezer was never touched by any other hands but mine. You know all the stuff the dude who died on a short bus was supposed to learn and prepare before screwing off to the woods? Yeah, I know all that stuff, been practicing for years.

I already have the tools and the trailer and know how to use them. I could fill up my tank, put four already organized totes into my back seat, hook up my trailer, and be a fart in the wind by dinner time. The actual process of building a small cabin in the woods using available materials is right in my wheelhouse. I just really want something of my own. I’ve been trying for years to buy a house, I’ve come close, but every time something happens and I end up broke, despite working full time for the last 14 years, 9 weeks off for injury (paid) and 4 months off for injury (unpaid) during which I put together my business and studied, and was putting in 80+ hours a week. I’m not “on that grind”, I’m not an entrepreneur at least not intentionally. I just want to eat, not be homeless, have a car that gets me point a to point b. What I really want is a day when I have no obligations, I want to not have 50 different problems chasing me that I have to constantly band aide address in the back of my mind. I want a fucking break.

About 6 years ago I had about 9k saved up, was working toward a down payment for a house. I got a random job offer for a company with a significant wage boost, benefits, and partial tuition reimbursement if I wanted to go back to school. I interviewed and was told they’d hire me and had to work out the position details, but gave me an offer. So I put in my two weeks and quit my old job, showed up first day and they told me they hadn’t figured out where I went, go home, then they never gave me a schedule and basically pretended they didn’t remember me. So that was a kick in the teeth. 

I got a different job in like a week, but that dude 1099 abused me and tried to get me to go up a broken ladder. I’m not a kid who is afraid of ladders, but I’m not going thirty feet in the air on a fiberglass ladder repaired with 2x4’s and Simpson straps. The dude actually fired me first, but it was because I told him to go fuck himself while packing my stuff, I count that as quitting. Either way, 1099 so no unemployment on that one either, I knew that was a temporary job from day two, but I can still be pissed about it. Dude never gave me my last check either and called my (now ex) girlfriend a bitch to her face. In hindsight, that was honestly hilarious, I would never call a girl that, but my ex was a piece of work. Still, you don’t say that to your employee’s girlfriend, what the fuck.

Anyway, quitting two jobs and bouncing around that much in a three month period also kills savings so no house back then, ended up getting my last job after that and was there six years. I had saved up 12k for a down payment back in 2020 then we had Covid and that got burned down to about 5K although that was kinda my fault. Then, after Covid bunch of people had remodel projects they didn’t want to deal with so that was great, got back up to 14k and was getting close. I was gonna do 8k down on an 80k good rate mortgage. I was really really close, looking at mortgage options, researching properties.

Unfortunately I got injured at work during this time. My pelvic floor turned into a pelvic basement when picking something heavy something up. I ended up burning every dime of savings and then some on medical expenses and living expenses during time at home. Workers comp denied part of my claim and lawyers have been working on it for a year, haven’t seen a dime for a few months I was at home. This isn’t some bs tweaked back claim either, I had full on surgery, 6 inch scar, multiple rounds of imaging, multiple witnesses, constant dull pain for the rest of my life sorta thing, testicular pain. Guys, spend the day randomly gently flicking yourself in the nuts about every 15 to 30 minutes, just enough to get that hint of nausea and stomach pain. That’s me, daily. There are a bunch of lawyers arguing in the background about this, I actually need to put more files together for them this afternoon, fun times.

Even with all this, any back payment I get is gonna be a pittance compared to actual amount the damn thing cost me, as doesn’t come close to compensating me for the fact I can’t even have sex unless it’s lazy side sex with pillow against my fucking groin. Also, my left nut just kinda dangles at the bottom of my sack now, I no longer have the ability to retract it. You would think this would be a minor annoyance, but you’d be amazed at how ridiculously annoying it actually is. It also makes it look like I have one giant testicle rather than two because it always hangs lower than another. I’m not sure girls are into weird balls, I’m gonna keep telling myself nobody cares because I have enough other shit on my mind. The fact remains, my genitals are legit mutilated, aesthetically and functionally. I’m not impotent at least I guess, could still have a kid, but gonna be missing out on a lot of the fun parts. Also god damn that fucks with your brain. I also was occasionally walking with a cane but my heart starts racing and I get dizzy when I pick it up or see it, so that’s not great, sure wish I could afford more therapy cuz this whole thing broke my brain, I honestly don’t think as clearly anymore, I lose my train of thought, things I used to do in my head now have to be on paper. Whole thing is messed up, my brain, and body, a really just fucked up my entire god damned life.

So anyway, no house and I’m up to my ears in debt, waiting on this money which is gonna end up being only a couple grand after my insurance company and lawyers gets paid back. Oh and I’m behind on rent so I could get theoretically booted tomorrow (if my landlord wasn’t awesome) in which case this whole plan might have to happen. I’m lucky that my landlord is a god damned hero and we have a great deal where I maintain the house for cheap rent, but it means when systems break I’ve gotta repair them. This is all agreed upon, my landlord is not taking advantage of me in slightest and getting him paid back is honestly my number 1 priority right now. That said, I’m lucky I still have a place of my own. Oh, and my comp payments are also based on my average income over a time period which included a bunch of missed time due to Covid, so my weekly payment is as a joke and nothing like 70% of my actual, so whole other middle finger to the face there.

I quit my last job last week, wasn’t getting raises because my injury had slowed me down and boss was pissed I sued his insurance company, also was just getting treated like shit. Things came to a head when I found out a guy with 6 years less experience was getting paid more than me, and that I wasn’t getting bonuses I believe I’d earned. Based on my discovery I realized I definitely wasn’t going anywhere in this company, and wouldn’t rely on boss for a reference, and was extremely disrespected after basically giving my nuts for this fucking company. So I quit another job no notice, I was running the entire site so guy definitely has some fuck around and finding out coming up. That said, it was still a dumb move career wise, I could’ve used that job as leverage in negotiations I guess. I could’ve said I couldn’t work due to injury, I could still make that claim as the injury definitely limits me for certain activities, but I’m not disabled, there is plenty of work I can do, I can be on my feet 8 hours a day, do 12000 steps a day, I just can’t tie my own shoes without sitting down, lots of kneeling rather than bending over kind of thing, it slowed me down a bit, I’m not gonna bullshit, I’m not as fast as I once was, but I still have all the knowledge and experience. I’m not disabled, like, I hate getting treated like I am, I can still run circles around younger guys, and I was the only one other than a boss who actually knew certain important things, for instance, the actual fucking building code. Anywho, no chance boss was giving me a good reference, and I wouldn’t be dumb enough to list him anyway, so I packed my shit and left. I used to really like my boss too, for years, great dude until the second I got injured, the minute my interests didn’t align with his company’s, my interests got kicked violently out the door.

I also own my own business, put it together while I was on workers comp, was only making a couple bucks an hour back then due to amount of administrative work, but it all works, completely operational now, although some parts are kind of figuratively boxed up. Needs about 100 hours of updates to be fully functional, with 20 hours of updates every month thereafter. Problem is, after all that set up, it still only runs successfully with me working at it 60 hours a week or more. At the average rate I make actually working on projects I need to work 25 hours a week minimum directly on projects to cover my overhead and make enough to pay my bills. However, I need to consistently submit and respond to proposals to keep this level of supply of work, which adds another 10 to 15 hours of work a week, on top of that there is at least 10 hours of general business administration that always seems to come up, paying bills, sending invoices, accounting, filing, etc. I have raised and lowered my rates over time to fine tune my proposal to accepted proposal ratio, I’m maxing out what I get. So that’s 50 hours a week to not go broke, the last 10 is solid great profit but means I’m working 60 hours a week, in a room, alone, staring at computer screens, I tried it for three months and became a mole person. I know exactly how I could run this company to be profitable, but I prefer to actually have a life. Hell, I know how I could easily run it unethically but legally and make a boatload of profit, but I’m not an asshole.

Like, I’m extremely good at what I do. I don’t want to run a damn business, I have a massive variety of skills and will happily use them. I’ll still do construction even with the pain because if I go sit in a chair for the rest of my life it’s gonna kill me and hurt me even faster, but at this point I have no interest in bouncing to another company when I have been kicked around this much. I don’t even have hot water at my house, I have been in charge of building 10 million dollar houses, and I can’t even take a hot shower in mine (not my landlords fault, I’m waiting till it’s warmer to do the fix because I’ll lose heat during the process). Y’all ever get home nasty dirty after a long day of working outside in the bitter cold in February, then had to immediately take a cold shower so you don’t smell/feel like an animal? Not fun, although you do feel really relaxed after. 

I’m not lazy, I do good work, every customer and client I’ve ever worked with has been very pleased. I’ve never been fired except the one the time mentioned earlier which doesn’t count. I’ve never injured anyone else, I don’t make mistakes often, much less than others I’ve worked with. I also don’t don’t drink at all or mess around with drugs, I don’t have any criminal record, I speak Spanish, I know computer programming, I know CAD drafting, I know excel and creating highly functional spreadsheets, and I know how to build an entire fucking house from the ground up. I was the only person at the company who was requested by name for certain installations. Hell, I even dragged a trailer full of tools with me to jobs. I have worked so hard, dedicated myself, been loyal and done what I was told. I’m in constant pain, have a negative net worth, and now am going to end up being a recluse for a year so I never have to have a boss again. The amount of hours I will spend doing this will blow away the time it would take me to set up my camouflage homestead. That’s fucked, totally fucked.

Something has gotta be wrong when I’m fantasizing this much about effectively being homeless. Also again, definitely not gonna actually do this, I hate it but I’m just gonna work my ass off, pay my bills, wait out the insurance company, use that to pay off my credit cards, then I’ll be at a debt to income ratio that’ll allow me FHA, as well as money for renovations, I’ll get a cheap tear down house and rebuild it, problem solved, but that’s gonna be 3 damn years at least unless people start buying a lot more pre-drawn house plans, and who knows what happens in meanwhile. If housing market dumps I lose my pipeline of work, so even though I’m rooting for a drop in prices, or at least easier access, it won’t benefit me same as people in other industries. Also, best case scenario, my job is effectively to nickel and dime analyze construction projects for budgeting. You know how houses only have brick on the front facade and siding on the back and look tacky as hell…yeah, sorry, that’s me. I’m gonna work my ass off so a bunch of rich old people can move to smaller age in place houses while renting out their previous house on airBNB. Is the peace corp still a thing? I’ll go build houses in Ethiopia, three meals and I hot shower and I’m fucking there, at least I’ll feel like I’m contributing something to society that isn’t corporate profits. 

All this to say, fuck this noise. Fuck it so fucking hard, I’m just really fucking tired.

Also, again, if you read this far please seek help, this was a rambling ranting essay with no real point and I’m mostly just posting for a touch of catharsis, why are you still reading?

TL/DR: Good choice, I’m salty, real salty, long story short. Don’t read this, it’s massive and I don’t think actually that interesting unless you like listening to others screaming obscenities into the void.

I started working remotely about 10 years ago when I had my first child.  The job I was doing at the time involved a component in which I was the only one that did it and therefore didn't need to have communication with people in the office.  So I left my full time job and kept that one part as my remote job. I was working for a micromanager to the extreme at the time and after working from home I got more work done than when I was in the office.

Over the years I've slowly taken on more projects.  I'm still part time but getting closer to full time.

My amazing boss who I experienced so much growth and confidence under was let go recently.  They re-hired the micromanager who had mostly retired and will be working from home because she lives outside of the state.  Something important to know about her is she is very adamant and serious about NEVER having a ""not my job"" attitude as a way to get people to do work on things she can't get someone else for or needs help with.

The office has had a hard time keeping the few admin staff they have and the office manager has joked with me multiple times over the years that she wishes I came back to help.  Well, she has recently mentioned in casual conversation that I'm likely going to become my bosses assistant because instead of focusing on my actual job she will expect help with projects.

Recently I found out the President of the parent company wants our branch to end remote work because he thinks people will work better when they exchange ideas in person.

The entire department I work in and the other department I work with are scattered throughout the US.  Each person but one was hired while living outside the state pre-pandemic.  One moved during. The CEO of our branch doesn't even live in the state.

Then, in my conversation with the President, he said something that made my stomach drop after already feeling bad about the remote work part.  He said ""then, since you will be in the office, you can help with admin stuff.""  I knew then that the remote working ending really just means me since I am the only one that I work with that lives in state and that this is about using me for the help I can provide, since they can’t find someone else and I've been ""loyal"" for so long.

I am actively trying to find a new job but I absolutely do not want to come back and do not want to be demoted into helping everyone else.  But I am TERRIFIED of how my boss will react if I give her pushback.  I am not in a place mentally to handle that well.

She was a baker, I bounced between kitchens (sometimes management) and construction. She now runs a bakery from home with her as the only employee and sells at a farmers’ market. I manage a fishing camp from May to September. I truly do realize how lucky we are that we’re in this position but it’s honestly eye opening at how detrimental working for someone who just wants to chase profit is. 

Here’s a short list of things we were able to accomplish:
-reconnected with friends and family I haven’t seen since high school
-after 7 years, got to know the neighbours better 
-every day I was able to see my daughter off to school and able to pick her up most days 
-didn’t have to worry about days bus was cancelled, sick days or school closures
-volunteered at her school 
-volunteered at the local shelter 
-drastically cut down on alcohol use
-took up yoga 
-did some renovations that were being out off
-was home for all birthdays & holidays (except Father’s Day and Canada Day but still had my daughter with me) 
-was able to be selective about the small jobs I picked up in off season and only work them when I want to
-overall expenses are WAY down (less gas, insurance, takeout, more homemade food which has been grown or hunted, my wife has time to make clothes, reduced phones to minimal service… the list goes on)

Literally not a day goes by when my wife and I don’t look at each other and say “I’m so happy we get to do this.” I truly hope it lasts. Working for others sucks. "

I'm in a bit of a weird spot at work and could use some advice. There's this guy, let's call him W, who's made some pretty serious threats at work, even said he'd kill our supervisor over some disagreement. This guy is a piece of work: a white supremacist who doesn't shy away from bringing up my mixed race, defends others soliciting sex in the workplace, and he's got a special hatred for our clients, some of whom are mentally handicapped. Oh, and there are rumors he's brought meth onto the premises.

When one of our coworkers, who isn't exactly on the management's favorite list, brought it up to HR, I felt I had to back them up. Thought it was the right thing to do.

But HR was less than helpful. The interviews felt like they were just going through the motions, and it didn't seem like they took any of it seriously. W is pretty cozy with some of the higher-ups—they share political views, which might explain the lackluster response. Despite everything, W got off with a slap on the wrist, and they even paid him for the days he was supposedly suspended.

Now, I've heard from a client that W's got his sights set on me, saying he wants to beat me up. Great, right? Going to HR seems like a dead end, especially since they've already shown they're on his side.

What's my best move here? Staying silent doesn't feel right, but I'm not sure how to handle it when the bully is getting protected by management.

Appreciate any advice or if anyone's been in a similar spot."

I've had a few interviews and was just offered a position as a marketing/special events manager for The Salvation Army. I would love to work for a nonprofit but the job only pays 55K so I'd be taking an 11K pay cut. 

I was hoping they wouldn't offer me the job so soon (I only interviewed just yesterday), because I have a second panel interview coming up with a local children's hospital which would likely offer better pay, great health insurance, and it's a hybrid opportunity so I wouldn't have to be in the office every day. There would also be a full-on marketing team for me to lean on and learn from, whereas, with The Salvation Army, I would be the only marketer. 

How can I stall and convince The Salvation Army to give me time to make a decision so that I can interview with the hospital on Wednesday? I would hate to turn down this job offer, NOT get the job with the hospital, and then lose out on the nonprofit job as well. 

It’s a shame because I would love the kind of work I would be doing at the Salvation Army. It just doesn’t pay enough. 

I should add that the hospital really seems to want to hire me. I got a second panel interview just two days after my first interview. I know that they want to fill the position before April, so if they decide to hire me I’ll have a decision soon. 

It's a good problem to have, but quite the pickle nonetheless.

Please help!"

This isn't so much anti work as it is I'm stuck on a decision and I was hoping for honest feedback.


April of last year I was offered a $3/hr raise to help manage one of our other stores in addition to my current store. Last month They decided that it was not beneficial enough to have me at both shops and took the three dollars away. So I'm now just at one store pretty much maxed out pay wise. 

I was just offered a store manager position through a different company that will give me that $3 raise back however I will no longer be getting tips resulting in pretty much a net pay loss of $2 an hour. But on tglhe flip side of that there's higher earning potential considering I will not be maxed out pay wise what would you do? 

P.s same benefits except less pto only due to the amount of time i have been with my current shop. 

Tldr I have been offered a job redilting in $2 an hour pay cut but higher earning potential in the long run since I'm already basically capped out at my current company what would you do? "

(Update)",u/UneducatedTeacher,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bbqil8/caught_my_coworker_drinking_yesterday_management/,antiwork,"Alright this was a fairly divisive original post. Many commenters agreed with my safety concerns, and many commenters were wrong. But my manager called me back later that day after I walked off to ask if I would be returning to work the following day. I sighed and let him know I would come in as it was Friday and it would be financially advantageous for me to finish out the week at least. 

So I went in the following day and loaded up my job and drove to my clients home. The moment I get there the homeowner tells me that they have been trying to call to reschedule the job for a few hours at this point and the time he started calling was long after the office opened. He told me they wanted to reschedule because they have a family member in home hospice care and they wanted to keep the house as peaceful as possible but since nobody in my office answered the phone and I was already there that I was welcome to come and do my job but they needed about 30 minutes to prepare the room for me to do my work in. So I waited in my work vehicle and tried to get some of the louder prep work done outside in my vehicle so that the individual in hospice could retain as much peace as possible. 

However when I entered the home I was totally unaware as to how far along in the process this gentleman was. It was very clear by the noises he was making involuntarily that he was as close to the end as you can get. And I lost my mother in 2019 to cancer and on her last day she was making the same noises this man was. So for 2 and a half hours I listened to this man death grunting in the same room/room adjacent to me working (it's difficult to explain, the layout of the house was strange so I don't really know how to describe it but he was about 10 feet from my work area.) About ten minutes before I finished my job the gentleman reached the end point of his care and passed peacefully surrounded by a few loving family members. 

I had no words. Had someone who was obviously working at the time bothered to answer any of the 6 phone calls the customer showed me that they made, there was a high chance this company would have done the right thing and allowed this family their peace. I am still kind of shaken from this experience because of how closely it mirrored my mother's death that I also witnessed. 

I am turning in my resignation tomorrow. I can't work for these people any more after the dozens of other stories I've heard from clients and employees that are just awful. I've worked for a number of different companies over the years and I've NEVER worked for an organization this disorganized and apathetic. I have some other things lined up for this week in regards to employment but I genuinely don't think I'll ever get over this experience. "

they told me that when I get my intermediate license I'd have to get a job, where I'd have to pay for all the gas and the insurance, and told me I either have to work a job and keep my car and quit my sport, or keep playing my sport and have my car sold because I don't have a job. they think they are helping me get work experience but fail to realize that they are quite literally ruining my life. 

My grades are already bad enough, and I'm trying to skim by to get into college, trying to manage school, a job, and a sport would destroy any hope of that just because ""I need a job"".

Another thing is they are telling me to fill in all these applications at places I don't want to go just because they know people there. If I'm going to work, I'm going to try my hardest to find a job I want to work, and if that fails then I'll just have to suck it up and work something miserable. they say quote ""you fill out all these applications and the first one that calls you back you take"" why?? Why can't I choose where I want to work? If choosing where I want to go fails, THEN set me up somewhere. 

They told me that pay doesn't matter it's about work experience. First of all, the pay is the only reason I'd work, work experience can come in college. 

They also basically told me ""fuck you, quit your sport that your only get to play for a limited time in your life, during a time period of your life that's VERY short, and say fuck all of the friendships and brotherhoods and work you've put in and throw it ALL away, because we want you to get experience working""

I don't have a huge problem with working a job, that's not the issue, my issue is I'm almost being forced to do so, and being forced to give up my sport to do something I have my entire life to do.

I like the company I work for, but I just don’t think being in charge of people is something I want to do. I don’t want to keep track of everyone’s work, deal with issues, reprimand people, sit through meetings for hours a week, train new staff, write reviews, take on extra work, etc. 

I feel pressured to work extra hours every weekend because my boss and assistant manager do. I want to call out when I’m sick without feeling super guilty or coming back to piles of work. I just want to do my work well, be left alone, and enjoy my weekend with my family. 

I just learned recently that I only make a few dollars more an hour than some of the people on the team that I manage. Is it really worth all the added stress for a few bucks? The other sticking point is when I was hired, I was told the job would be remote after training. 98% of the company works from home full time. However my boss decided I needed to be in the office half the week. If I step down, I could wfh every day. 

It’s hard to shake this feeling of “going backwards”, but I think I’m finally understanding how much I value my mental health and free time than I do having a “good” job. I just wanna get paid and live my life. 

I really think I’m going to talk to my boss about stepping down this week before they fill an open position on my team. Just the idea of doing so makes me feel so much better. I’m a little worried about how they’ll react. Has anyone else stepped down from a management position? How did it go and did you ever regret the decision?

I work at a Subway owned by a franchisee. I've only been working here two months and was told when I was hired by the GM that I would be working mostly part time with opportunity for more hours as the store needs it each week.
Well I work with a lot of high schoolers and they tend to call out so I've frequently been pulling double shifts and working more than 40 hrs a week. Last week i hit 50.
My GM hasn't said anything to me about it. I even asked a senior coworker and they said they used to pull doubles all the time and were never reprimanded for going over 40 or working too much.
Well fast forward to today and i get told by the managers daughter who works there that he was complaining to her and another coworker that I was working too many hours (I took some of their shifts last week) and that if I hit overtime it was coming out of their wages.
Is this legal??? I didn't see anything about overtime in the employee handbook. I'm 22 for reference and have never heard at any of my previous jobs of this happening.
Advice please! My manager still hasn't told me about this myself or told me not to work as much and he was at the store this morning. I'm confused."

Rinse, lather, and repeat, and suddenly you’ve amassed a few thousand followers.

The ups and downs of normal job hunting can sometimes feel malicious, when truthfully, there nothing intentionally sinister going on. However, if you do suspect you have experienced this, know you are not alone. Reaching out to peers in your field can help you assess if a job prospect or employer or recruiter in your field is truly worth your time, and your follow.

If you’ve ever done this: stop. You’re misleading people (if not committing outright fraud), devaluing them, demoralizing them, and wasting their time."

Our CEOs right hand called a town hall meeting in which the location was the hotel next door to our office building which I’m assuming they paid money for to use. 

The CEO, CMO, CHRO, CFO and CCO all sat in the front in chairs and the corporate office staff sat in the “audience” of course they spoke a bit about our fiscal year in 2023 highlighting some positives and negatives and threw in some dry jokes and encouraged questions. 

One question that came up a lot in different formats was what our company is doing about our massive amount of debt we have from buying another company. The CFO began to speak about how WE. The corporate staff, could do more to help keep costs down. Basically telling everyone to be considerate of company money blah blah blah

 IM SORRY… the combined compensation of the FIVE people sitting at the front of the room is well over 13 MILLION DOLLARS. And the town hall has somehow turned into a lecture about how WE can help save the company money????? this is only my second full year in corporate America and I don’t think I can stick it out much longer.

I worked at a very upscale retail location that has beauty and designer clothing/accessories. We were always chewed out on a daily basis that there’s no room to not to get a sale. Do whatever it takes to finalize the sale. I worked for the beauty department as a fragrance and makeup artist. I worked successfully because I figured out a way to get people to buy things. We had so many free gifts in our warehouse WHICH the company does not pay for, so I ran it across multiple managers and they told me it was okay to send them out. Eventually I ended up getting a few others in my department to do the same, because they were struggling. Eventually, in my last 2 months, corporate cracked down on it while I was on FMLA. They were waiting till I got back after my FMLA was completed so I would be the first to get suspended. I ended up resigning  the day I was supposed to go back because my HR manager (who I have a thing for and he was taking care of me while I was having health issues) told me that he could not confirm nor deny if I was gonna be fired (which is basically yes) so I did. 2 days later all my coworkers that sent out free gifts were getting suspended left and right. 7 out of 10 started lying saying that I was stealing their PIN numbers and register passwords. They all know damn well if I was there I would have put them all in check but since I wasn’t there to defend myself. I got thrown under the bus because this entire situation was being considered as internal theft. I was depressed and crying for weeks on end, because some of these people I considered friends. Eventually they ended up suspending all the Latinos involved and protected the white people that were involved. One of those people decided to talk to other local retailers so that none of us could get another job. I had to threaten the location multiple times by lawsuit in order for them to finally suspend the two they protected. It took them literally 2 WEEKS to do this. But the fact the managers also wanted to play dumb when they encouraged all of us to do this is so fucking disgusting. I’m very grateful I got out when I did because this retailer is a disgusting company to work for. I’m glad I’m out."

Heavy equipment mechanic apprentice, 1 year experience and all my schooling done.

Sales, 5 years.

Landscaping/general labour 2 years.

Various retail jobs, 8 years

I have multiple resumes that either include my schooling and trades experience, just retail, just general labour, just sales etc with college without college etc

I’ve put up ads advertising small engine repair in the area to try to make a little cash before rent is due. I’ve started dumpster diving for scrap metals as well. That’s been okay for cash. Ive offered to cut my neighbours grass for money but I’ve had to use their mowers.

I’m just worried I’m going to be homeless. Thoughts? What am I doing wrong? What else can I do? I’ve been driving around dropping off resumes to literally anywhere that will take mine on top of the 700 online applications. I’m just so stressed 😰

It was stressed to me by my new boss to be careful about calling off during this period. I had 270 hours of sick time accumulated at the end of the year because I call off very sparingly. This year, they decided to get rid of all of our accumulated sick time and give us each a week's worth of hours annually. If we call off sick after using these hours up, we are subject to disciplinary action. The problem is, at the start of the year I was only given 8 hours. We work 12 hour shifts. I was told that I would get the rest of my sick time hours loaded on my anniversary date with the company. That was 3 days ago and they still aren't loaded.

I called off once this year due to a death in the family and had to eat the 4 hours of vacation time it took to get the full day's worth of pay. I now have zero sick time loaded and will get in trouble at my new job if I call off. I am currently laying in bed with a headache, congestion, sore throat, chills, and body aches and I work tonight. I'm a critical care nurse and I don't consider that a job I can risk showing up to with anything contagious. I really need this job as I have been working for years to get this position and there isn't another in my area that pays nearly this well. I'm reliant on it.

I'll keep it short and won't go into too much, but, quite a few negative things accumulating over the months and I finally decided to hand in my notice. Mainly just felt unappreciated, also considering I do a large majority of the work within my environment, because other colleges don't hold the appropriate qualifications they get to stick to simpler tasks, so eventually the enjoyment of the work died out and am now just burnt out..  


Since giving my notice, a large majority of my work colleges, **MAINLY just management** won't even talk to me, or just completely ignore me lol ( it really does make me laugh, I just think it's so childish ). For this reason I kind of just want to be an asshole and use up my sick days while I still have a chance, but I'd feel bad for the small group I do work with because it would increase the work load drastically.  


I don't need any references, I've got a few from previous jobs I've held, so I'm not really phased about saving face, but I'm just torn because I'd like to try leave on a somewhat good note.

Even if I had understood that, I wouldn't have known this would be seen as a problem. 

MRO reached out to me FIVE business days later. + for Diazepam metabolites. Okay, np. I'll send the script. Is it recent? End of Nov. Great!

Another week goes by. Never heard anything. Offer rescinded. Idk if he contacted my dr. or what, but I would have liked the opportunity to discuss with my dr. the situation first. He knows I have panic attacks and it wouldn't have been an issue had we had the chance to confer. If he just got a random call, ""Hey, so and so tested for Diazepam, what's up with that?"", I can see him innocently just saying, ""Oh, well we switched her back to Ativan so Idk why?""

I was on both last April. He made sure I just understood never to take them on the same day. 

Yeah, I can follow up, but why? I'm embarrassed and the offer was rescinded. I hate my life. I did nothing wrong.

I know that 'bullshit' or miserable jobs are usually classed in the realm of middle management or superfluous administration, but in many ways my role fits the latter. When fleeing/addressing domestic abuse, survivors typically need the following things:

* emotional/mental health support
* secure housing
* financial/job support
* legal advice and support with the court process
* immigration support (e.g. if they are in the country on a spousal visa or have come 'illegally')

&#x200B;

The issue with my role is that I am with a charity, not a statutory service. As such, what we can provide in this sense is rather minimal. FOr example, we do not have any housing or refuge options. As such, the most I can do is signpost people to their local authority, which has the duty to house DA victims (provided they have the right citizenship/nationality conditions), but even then these local authorities generally try to shirk their responsibilities and very rarely actually have appropriate accommodation to offer which means that much of my job ends up being submitting complaints to LA housing teams in order to prompt them to fulfil their legal duty. With immigration support, I am again very limited - as I am not a legally registered immigration advisor/solicitor, I am legally prohibited from providing advice around immigration options. As such, this element of my role primarily involves signposting clients to solicitors who may or may not take their case.

&#x200B;

The other elements primarily amount to general discussions/information sharing (e.g. sending PDFs on how to manage mental health or how the court system works). Again, this job does not provide me with the requisite knowledge/training to actually provide things like therapy/counselling for example, so I am again left to simply signpost my clients to their local health services in the hopes that they get some support (usually several months down the line). I can offer help with budgeting/job searching, but again I'm heavily limited by circumstances (e.g. whether a person's circumstances even makes them able to work, figuring out a workable budget from very limited financial means, and welfare payment decisions and rates being another thing completely beyond my control).

&#x200B;

As such, I'm exceptionally limited in what I can actually do for my clients and I frequently find myself questioning what I am doing it for. That said, the job keeps me busy enough due to the heavy admin burden that comes with it - every conversation, action, email, document etc related to each case must be meticulously documented, sometimes being saved multiple times in 2-3 different places. In some cases, it is agreed that I can't take on or continue to work with the client (e.g. they don't fall under our remit, are in the wrong location etc) - however, in these cases, I still have to generate service deliveries and outcomes to be recorded on our system, to essentially create the illusion of more work being done (so that we can use this to apply for more funding, to do the same thing and so on). Added onto this is the fact that, unfortunately, there are many men who approach our service claiming to be victims only to later turn out to either be the perpetrator themselves, or to just be experiencing various forms of relationship breakdown (usually obedience breakdown from their wives), which is even more demoralising.

&#x200B;

If you've made it this far (this turned out much longer than I expected!) thanks for reading! I'd love to hear your perspective. Sometimes I feel bratty, sometimes I just feel cold, sometimes it's hard to tell if I'm making an issue out of nothing. But at the moment, I genuinely struggle to see why my role exists as it does and in general I think I've fallen completely out of love with any notion of 'charitable' work (in particular because I believe that charities pretty much only exist to rectify initial failures of the state/public bodies BUT that's a whooole other issue)."
3,2024-03-11,2 Week Notice,u/Luvfallandpsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bc14ka/2_week_notice/,antiwork,"How many of you do not give 2 weeks notice?

I posted yesterday about leaving my job and I’m not planning on giving 2 weeks notice. I live in an at will state and I have seen too many people fired immediately after they put in their 2 weeks- saw this last Friday when my boss did that to a manager. 

I base my notice off how the company has treated me. My best employer got 2 weeks notice.

My husband hardcore judges me for it. I told him Saturday my plans and I can tell he is struggling with it and thinks it’s an ethics thing. He’s quiet and moody and keeps bringing it up. His mom is a workaholic and he didn’t have her growing up because she wouldn’t stop working. She was be scandalized by me just quitting with no notice.

I work in HR and in my experience, about 50% of people give NO notice at all (and I’m fine with that, it’s literally their right). Like, why is there this belief in the US that it’s the ‘law’ and employers OWN employees for 2 weeks? It’s so common where I’m at and I always tell people that it is their right to leave whenever they wish. If an employer told an employee they couldn’t leave, it would be false imprisonment, a crime.

AND employers don’t have time to rag on former employees about if they gave notice or not. Usually, we’re only able to disclose the title and dates worked.

Do you give or not give notice?"

I got hired about 10 weeks ago but there were extensive background checks, blood drawings for illnesses, drug screenings, etc. 

Everything was going fine and then I came down with the flu about 2 weeks ago, I posted here when that happened as my boss texted me that they were looking at possible termination due to it being a ‘bad time for me to be starting a new job it seems’ 

Well I got better and wasn’t fired and went back to work late last week, and everything was fine. I’ve been a breakfast cook for years and this job is by far the easiest one I’ve ever had. 


My mom attempted suicide last night (she attempted about a year ago, she’s in a wheel chair from a leg amputation and 75% blind) and called me for help. I rushed to the hospital and am here currently answering questions while her stomach is being pumped. She will be transfered to a secure facility tomorrow morning and my other mom will be in charge of taking care of her going forward. 


I texted my boss at 3:30am 3 hours before my shift letting him know I had a severe family emergency and that I will be in tomorrow. He texted me back letting me know we will need to have a talk with him and HR tomorrow. Worried I’m going to get fired and lose my insurance and only source of income. 

Shit sucks that regular life happenings can ruin your life in other ways like being fired. Sorry just had to rant as I’m still in the hospital with a lot on my mind. "

Now, I have had this happen to me before in life, but my previous jobs actually had all the reasons for it, so this was no surprise. Terrible jobs with little to no freedom and unrealistic expectations or high standards, to give some examples. We've all heard about those before on this sub.

But since 3 years, I honestly have a really good job. It still amazes me. I only work part-time, whenever and wherever I want (so mostly WFH), make up my own schedule, I'm really good at it, I have an awesome manager who trusts me and really values my work, I have loads of paid time off, it's a socially responsible organisation that tries to make the world a better place, and it pays very well considering how little hours I work per week. In my head, this has always been the dream because I have no intentions of going freelance because of my chronic disease (in my country, we have loads of safety nets for health reasons, as long as you work for an employer).

But I literally have a mental shutdown the moment I start to work again. I had some time off last week, and this morning, I sat behind my computer having a complete crash and trying to work through it, just to get things done. It's the same desk that I use when gaming, so I have no bad associations with this place either. I just feel like my brain stops working as soon as I have to fulfil my work duties. I can feel myself craving dopamine. Most days, I can barely focus on my work without playing a YouTube video next to it, just to trick my brain into thinking I'm not working.

This isn't me, by the way. I'm very focused in general. I have lots of mentally demanding hobbies that feel like a walk in the park compared to my actual work. Some weeks, I can barely get any work done, just because I'm having a shutdown for a few hours every day and I'm not physically working, so I don't book those hours (I'm just anxiously on my phone like right now, or watching videos and feeling guilty). I think this is also me being overwhelmed by the amount of work that gets sent my way, but I know I'm capable of handling it, and I always have the option to outsource it or even deny work for good reasons. That doesn't take away the fact that it feels like a mountain of uninspiring work though.

I know this maybe isn't the best sub for this kind of advice, but I'm looking for people with similar experiences who have maybe found a way to put this into another perspective. I obviously don't love to work (who even lives to work), but I'm definitely not actively hating my job. Funny thing is, I often do the same type of work for friends or family at the same computer and desk, and I don't even seem to mind it or have any problem finishing it. I'm always happy to help them. It baffles me! Are humans just not made to work for an organisation?"

I'm disabled. I'm disabled enough that I can't work a normal job or anything I can get, and I am lucky I have something I can do now. Disabled enough to have housing/rent assistance, food stamps, Medicaid, fulltime carer, and STILL can't get on SSDI.

Now to be fair, I do want to work. Not a 40 hour minimum sacrificing my life work, but my autism and adhd keep me fascinated and always looking for projects and things to enjoy.

I want to get a job that pays me enough so I can pay my bills and not rely on gov assistance (I hate the discrimination). It's hard but sometimes I think ""well I really am interesting in this one thing, and it's an entry-level sort of work type, why not see if I can get a job in this field?""

Today I thought I always wanted to learn to fix hardware like fixing phones or computers and stuff. I know a lot of tech places will (or would) hire kids for their first job, teach them a few basics, give them resources and go off. And when I go to tech repair places they're very kind and I'm super interested in the work they do.

So I looked around my area. One business that frustrated me so much was one that said they were severely limiting services, but they had no hiring or open jobs page. Actually, NO business i looked at had a careers page anymore. They all removed their career pages!!

Even with my bachelors degree, I know I'm not going to get a great job, and I'm not in a position to ask for much. I know I'll be low-income my whole life, I'm not going to ask for much especially since they see my disability over my skills. But they've even removed the option to apply for work.

It's so frustrating. If I didn't have to work at all I'd probably still find work, maybe doing something to help my community or volunteer with animals or kids or something. I want to be engaged in activities, I like most people have a drive to do what interests me.

But companies won't even give me a chance now. Not like they ever really would but it's so frustrating. 

I'm so mind blown that they've been removing their careers pages. That used to be a staple of every business website and now they're being removed and replaced with a notice of ""sorry we can't help you, no one wants to work!""

This is such stupid garbage. I'm so sick of living in this crap."

I have been working since wednesday and wont have a day off till saturday, but i have some important errands to run and have to take my cat to the vet amongst a million other personal ans household responsibilities, so as you can imagine i am pretty stressed. Yesterday I called my dad bc he had said he might help me pick up a few things from the store that day (he owns the house i live in but barely spends any time there, mostly lives in the neighboring state with his GF about a 2 hour drive from the house.) 

I asked if he had had the chance to pick the stuff up, to which he said no, and I said alright I'll have to send my partner (who is disabled and NOT in a good state lately) in an uber (no other transit options, no car) to go do it and expressed that I am feeling rather stressed lately with everything going on. Now this is what upset me, he said ""i know how you feel, when you have to work it's hard to run errands for yourself let alone someone else"" clearly implying that his work makes it some huge burden to pick up a few things for me and equating our experiences.

My dad is an ultrasound programmer and obviously makes a significantly larger amount of money than me, he has a very flexible schedule, regular weekends, the option to work from home fairly often. He spends most of his free time driving around RI with his GF taking care of everything for her and smoking weed. So him comparing his experience to mine, where i have to do actual physical labor, standing and walking all day, lifting stuff etc all while being bellitled and berated by complete strangers extremely offensive.

This is my first job since 2019, I was a carer for vunerable adult and a paid carer during 2022-today.

Basically have re organizated my life to be 100% while starting this admin role. Arrive early each day, taken notes, and was thrown in deep end, basically no training and left to sort out everything myself IT wise. 

Fellow colleague was in with manager and I, and manager says to colleague that others had reported them leaving early a few times, usually 10-15mins, although one day they had an appointment and had been given permission to leave.

After saying this, the manager looks at me and says, ""I think you've gone home early one day as well""

As this is gossip based, and a falsehood - I've been in until after home time each day and pack up my laptop after the final hour, I know I have never left early.

I had tried to be above reproach, to maintain a good standard, polite, double checking work, early night's sleep, prepared for work with good food, clean and fresh each day... I know this sounds so minor , but it's a red flag and rather than say anything in response I made a note in my diary about this minor false accusation and will maybe notify the agency who sent me here. 

I don't need a pat on the back or to be told ""good job"" but to receive only a falsehood like this is unreasonable, and not at all how I would manage when I managed work places. 

With no training so far, and zero encouragement, I've decided to look elsewhere and just treat this role as a time trade off for money. 

Am hoping agency will have other roles.

I wonder if manager is already looking for reasons to not renew the temp contract and simply replace us after this assignment with fresh staff.

I’ve finally found a kitchen where I’m happy and feel valued without destroying myself and I’m able to have a life outside of work.

Cut to last week, our owner was on vacation and I hear from two of our prep cooks that they have been asked to clock in strictly for their scheduled hours, but if they are serious about their career they will continue to come in early and stay late. Both cooks are scared to say anything because going against our chef would be “career suicide”. I’m so torn because I don’t want to go against their wishes, but I also don’t feel comfortable working here knowing this is happening. Is there a sly way to let the owner know what’s going on without implicating either of the cooks?"

I work full-time in a very small private orthopedic clinic. This clinic has been through many downs in the last year I have been here. A manager embezzled money and died shortly thereafter. Many people have quit (even those who have been working here for 22 years). There's no more over-time pay, no PTO until 6 months (and it only is 3 hours per pay period), no health/dental insurance, basically no benefits at all. I requested 2 weeks during the end of April for a last minute planned trip with my father who I have not seen for a year. I have a feeling it will be denied. Should I skip out on the trip or go and find another job when I come back? I am planning to go to graduate school and move out of this area in July anyways so I am not too committed to this crappy company. But I don't know what would be smart to do in this situation."

1,2024-03-11,Quiet! The vents are working...,u/normancrane,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bcalt1/quiet_the_vents_are_working/,antiwork,"*Note: This is fiction (although with a distinctly anti-work theme, like some of the sub's reading suggestions.) If it's inappropriate for the sub, please remove or let me know. I don't mean to post unwanted content. Thanks!*

___

Ever notice the vents? Yeah, some of them blow hot air and others cold, air-conditioned air, but there are those that don't blow any air at all.

They just *are*.

Little inconspicuous holes in the walls. There are a few in the office building where I work. Grated, forgotten. Normalized and hidden in plain sight, as they say.

Then again, as *who* says?

Because there's no one you can question about these things *if you start to have doubts*.

Co-workers don't care. Supervisor says he'll look into it but never does. Management says they're *just vents*, as if that answers the question.

When I contacted the building owners, suggesting a fault (""because no air blows""), I got a message back saying some vents are just *control vents*, not for the blowing of air.

The next day I was summoned by management. ""Why are you contacting the building owners directly? All communication must go through management.""

So ask yourself: Is this normal? *The fuck are these vents for?*

I've paid careful attention to them over the past few years, and I think I know. Oh, I think I know the truth about these awful, grated holes in the wall.

The building owners weren't lying.

These aren't blow-holes.

They're suck-holes.

Slowly, quietly and almost imperceptibly they work, day by day, hour by hour, minute by fucking silent minute, sucking away our souls.

The pressure is so slight you don't usually feel it.

But it's there, in those eerie moments when the hairs on your arms stand suddenly on end, or late in the day, when it gets uncomfortably quiet, and you can hear that gentle hum of *who knows what* somewhere in the world.

Now you know what.

The vents sucking on you—*on all of us.*

But even more than that. Sucking you and us away, siphoning off our very essence like some kind of goddamn spiritual vacuum cleaner with vents for mouths. Monolithic and ubiquitous.

Ever wonder why you feel so tired at the end of the day *even when you haven't done a fucking thing*? 

Or so much more apathetic about every aspect of your life even though you struggle to find anything *real* to complain about?

It's not aging.

It's not a natural process.

It's the soul sucking.

The perversity of it is they play it back for you. The essence they suck, they learn from it, then they rearrange it and stream it for you on Netflix as parody. What's your favourite show? That's *your* life regurgitated. Self-sustenance through spiritual auto-cannibalism.

There's even a way to see the sucking of the vents.

All you've got to do is colour your thoughts. Make them weird, unusual. Give them a tinge of the extraordinary to make them stand out against the greyness of our modern lives. Then sit and watch as the colours spiral faintly out of you, flowing slowly but continually past the unassuming grates, and into the vent-beyond."

I have been unemployed for many months and applied to roughly 90+ jobs now, no response from anywhere, not even a grocery store. I've never had an issue finding work like this before. I would take anything, not even a gas station will hire me. I have no criminal background or anything that would make me unemployable. I have a good work ethic. Its genuinley not my fault.

I recently had a phone interview scheduled for today at noon, 12:15 came around, no call, 12:40 rolls around, nothing. Double checked the email to see the confirmation, its all correct. They just never called me. So I called the place and it went straight to voice mail. Left a polite message asking if it would be possible to re schedule an interview because I hadn't gotten the call from then. I also left a very polite follow up email asking if the interviewer would like to re schedule as I did not recieve a call from them. Nothing.

1,2024-03-11,Is this toxic?,u/Hat1kvah,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bcazbq/is_this_toxic/,antiwork,"Long-story-short, got hired to work as a sales assistant (to the sales/marketing teams), making the basic 40k/yr. Fine with me. Second actual job out of university.

Got hired last week of February, this company is apparently new, founded last September … they didn’t have Microsoft office, we had to practically beg for it. There isn’t even really an HR team (except CEO), and there was no employee handbook. The company is based in Texas, parent company owned by a Chinese business based in China.

My trainer, a nice girl who did a lot of good for this place, was finish up her two-weeks, and 4-days into training me, her and big boss got into argument (big boss, woman, was essentially talking down to her … I witnessed it).

Big boss asks if I still need her to train me, I say yes .. they fire her early, anyway. Only had 3.5 - 4 days of training, and have been winging it best I can since then.

Boss pulled me into the office today essentially patronizing me on my job and as to how I don’t know X, Y, or Z … I just listen and nod, to not provoke arguments. She tells me that this job may not *“be for me”*, I explain I just need time to learn. 

I told her I needed my trainer for the other week, as there was a lot to learn (& still is).

After having it for less than a week, I noticed a fairly significant paint blemish.  

Today I brought it in to see what they could do to make it right.  There really wasn’t a good option that didn’t involve painting the car and to be frank I would rather have the blemish than a major non-factory paint repair involving sanding and blending.

I didn’t want to mess with it so I told the sales manager that if he comps me a cargo net ($100 part) then we can forget about it and we can pretend this didn’t happen.  I’ll add that I didn’t negotiate this deal very hard and I know they have plenty of room in it to pay their parts department and eat this on the bill of sale.

The sales manager, who gave me sleezy vibes from the beginning, immediately agreed.  Later my sales guy (young dude that I really liked and vibed with) came back and told me they were going to make HIM eat personally and that it would be difficult for him to do that.

I have not filled out my customer survey which is primarily what his bonus is based on.  And the kicker is there is no way to give him a good rating on the survey while giving the dealership / manager a bad rating.

I am torn because it's not fair to me to rate my experience well when it wasnt.  The fall guys are me and the salesman, not the dealer that is responsible.

TLDR; sleezy car sales manager making sales rep eat a $100 concession for something that was the dealers fault and not his.

1,2024-03-11,"This is wage theft, right? (Also just venting tbh).",u/NotUnhingedRedditer,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bcb5kw/this_is_wage_theft_right_also_just_venting_tbh/,antiwork,"Hello. Not sure what all qualifies as wage theft beyond specifically working hours and they just don’t pay you.

So, I work at a non-profit in the US that offers a variety of services.
One such service is ESL classes, and I am a teacher here. There are a few of us.

There are two rules about the group classes that make no sense.

1. If less than 4 people show up on a class day, I am supposed to cut the class time from 2 hours to 1 hour.

You might have deduced that this cannot be determined until the class session actually starts and attendance is taken. I’m supposed to start off that class session with the news that we’re all being ripped off (me included, since that’s one less hour of pay).

2. If people drop out of the class entirely and the total students drop to less than 4, every class until the end of the cycle is limited to one hour (and all of us are ripped off out of an hour per class until the end of the cycle).

Money is not refunded to the students in either case.

So, basically, I’m supposed to apply nonsensical rules in order to rip off students and myself, and the business just pockets extra money because they don’t have to pay me as much.

I am not a big spender, just a normal person that dreams of reaching financial freedom, like you.  

I hustled a lot in the past years and :  
I am not wealthy.  
I am stressed as fuck.  

My country doesn't seem like a land of opportunities, instead it seems more as a struggle to have a decent life.  
Here's why:  

### Wealth inequality gap  
Let's start with data.  
The top 10% of my country holds 50% of the wealth.  
The bottom 50% holds less than 8% of the wealth.  

### House  
Do I want an home? Get ready, my friends are doing 30 years mortgage, because we can afford only that.  
30 years in debt??? What??   
I will probably die before.  
Our grandparents were able to build two houses with only one income in the family.  

### Cost of living 
If I live alone, I have a car, eat healthy and go out 1 night a week. I can barely reach the end of month (I am an engineer).  

### Savings
I can save 300-500 euros per month if I am very diligent.  
Do you think that I can reach financial independence saving 300 euros per month?   
Seriously? Rich people are laughing.  

Yes I can save for a vacation, or for a new car. So I can spend the savings and become even more poor.  

All of this without considering accidents, tickets, thiefs, etc.  

### University degrees 
Years ago people were studying to make a step up in their life, today studying is the minimum to have a decent life.

### Job
Do I want a nice job? Get in queue with 100 applicants, and if you are lucky you get a minimum decent wage.  
Otherwise in 1-2 month you can find a job that you don't really like (but you need). 
My parents at my age could find a new job the same day leaving.  

Income? You can get jobs with a discrete income (20%-30% higher) but you have to work more than 60 hours a week.   
I did it and it is basically like giving up living. No friends, no sport, no family and no hobbies.  

### Entrepreneurship 
Do I want to start my company instead? Well well well, do you have money? If you don't then get ready to struggle a very lot. 
Enterprenuership is much much different from 40-50 years ago. Innovation is harder and expensive.  
MVPs are so expensive today because we have higher quality standards.  
Why do you think that today the ""startups"" are so popular? Startups are just a different term for saying ""group of people with an idea but no money"".  
Once startups weren't so popular, guess why.  
And we are not talking about taxes yet. 
In my country more than half of your earnings goes to the state.  
That makes the effort and risk totally worth it, yeah.  



Sometimes it seems like I/we don't have much choice, we are on the rails and there is a huge concrete wall at the end.  

Not sure if I am pessimistic or realistic, I hope to change my mind in future.

So I put in my two weeks as a courtesy because I feel a moral obligation to,  especially since my dept is so under staffed. I would’ve stayed longer but my boss was so toxic I just couldn’t take it anymore. She’d fly off the handle about stuff too much, accuse me of doing something wrong that I’m not, accuse me of not working when I was always working, in fact people I worked with would wonder why I didn’t talk to anybody. Anyways, I put in the two weeks, today was the last day of it and she told me to leave early. 
We ended on a bad note, I wasn’t able to say goodbye to anyone and this is just making me feel really terrible and frustrated because I felt so disrespected which is on par given the history but it’s like cmon. I thought about leaving a review for them and letting folks know the amount of toxicity and drama that goes on in that place, not just with me either. The main thing I’m going through right now is feeling like I’m no good and that in the end it’ll be the same for my next job. 
Finally,  I am trying to look up because I’m in school so I think it’s best to focus on that for a couple of months and really hit it out of the park this semester to regain my pride and then rly get back on the horse with another job and start fresh. "

He finds the clients, I do the rest of the work. Scripts, designing, Photoshop, editing, etc.

Over the last few months I've grown tired of working in the office alone, because I could just do that remotely at home if I rarely have clients come in. I've told him this multiple times, but he's quickly shut it down. I also work in an office with no natural light or windows. I asked for that to change. He said no.

Another company offered me a job at the same pay **BUT** fully remote and I get to collaborate with other people, so the workload isn't entirely on me. I didn't even think twice. I know I'm not making more, but flexibility is more important right now.

So today, I put in my one week notice and my boss said to me: *""You've put me in a tight situation. I need someone with your skills and your knowledge. I don't know if I can find someone like that in time and we have some really big clients lined up in the coming weeks. I'm a little hurt to be honest.""*

I like my boss as a person, but I'm just trying to understand his logic. If he needs someone with my skills and knowledge, **why was I only making $45K when there aren't ANY other employees here?** Why do I need feel bad because he was too cheap to hire another person to help me balance these projects? If I was that integral to the business, I should've been paid accordingly.

I guess I'm looking for validation here. It feels like he's guilt tripping me for wanting a better work environment -- especially after he shut down all my requests? Am I in the wrong here?"

My contract is up for renewal soon, so I put in a request for a raise 1 month ago. In this request I submitted a business proposal outlining all my extra duties, accomplishments while on the team, responsibilities I’ve taken on, etc.

After not hearing anything for 2 weeks, I asked for an update, then again 2 weeks later, all while still doing the additional work. Today they finally called me back, to say that they’re in no position to offer any raises, and also that I’m not even actually qualified for the management level role since I never went to university.

Obviously I was upset about this, and said that if they didn’t believe I was qualified, then I shouldn’t be doing all the extra work. They disagreed saying that it’s a “learning opportunity”, and to “not cut off my nose to spite my face”…. Like yes I am learning a lot, but it feels as if I’m being exploited all the same. They suggested I sleep on it before I make any decisions, which I thanked them for. This call was with the main accounting team.

I messaged my direct boss afterwards, who immediately replied asking if she could call me or set up a meeting tomorrow. I asked for the meeting tomorrow since it was the end of the day and I had to leave, plus I wanted to think (and ask Reddit…) about what to say to her.

I don’t know how involved she’s been in the decision if at all, so want to go in to the call open minded, but at the same time not too optimistic. Any suggestions on how I should go about it or things I could raise? Thanks!"

I was fired based on my autism, pregnancy hormones, and also the obvious favoritism that had been going on at my workplace. For background information, this is a big chain restaurant in Washington State, not a mom-and-pop place. Yet I still never got a response to my HR inquiries before or after I was fired, and while I understand that Washington is an at-will state this just doesn't feel right. However, this might not be a big deal and my pregnancy hormones are getting to me but I wanted to share my experience and vent too. 

The manager of my location was extremely unprofessional and would constantly go around the kitchen shouting ""your mom"" in response to random things said throughout the day. My mother has been dying of multiple types of cancer for years, and it is upsetting for ""your mom"" to constantly be said back to things in the kitchen when an actual answer is needed. It was not as if this occurred as a one-off because, of course, it's not like jokes aren't allowed; it was said multiple times a day for months and months when I said to his face that I was not comfortable with that constantly being said. 

He took this as having to ""walk on eggshells"" with me. During this time I was also dealing with a co-worker who constantly belittled me due to my appearance and not being as wealthy as she is. I brought this up to the manager just hoping that he could speak to her about sticking to work conversations or not scheduling us together but none of those happened.

With no help or change, I left the store for a few months last year due to having mental health issues that came up due to having to deal with what I explained above. So when I came back, I had to start back at the bottom and work my way back up at a much lower pay since I lost the 4 years of raises I had received. Of course a few months after I returned to the job they started a program where you could take time off for mental health and come back at the same pay/position.

The manager never spoke to the other shift lead about their attitude, their constant complaining in the kitchen and in front of the customers, or the way they spoke to me. She was happily transferred when she moved even with her attitude problems that were obvious to even a first-time customer. Yet when I asked for a transfer because the manager and I didn't mesh well, I was denied. I was told by the district manager that every other manager in the district wouldn't take me because of my unprofessionalism yet I've never had a problem with any other manager. I've only had positive interactions with them when I've worked with them at events, volunteered with them, or they've worked at my store.

I still tried desperately to learn more about the assistant manager position since I already tried to go above and beyond anyway, but the manager only scheduled his friend for things like inventory mornings, interviews, and anything else that was needed to learn the assistant manager role. When the manager's friend did do those interviews, he made a point to push to hire someone straight, white, and Christian which seems very illegal and against the company's mission.

The manager favored his friend so much that they even had matching necklace chains. The district manager reads all the HR reports so when I went to inform the company about the favoritism going on, she was the only one who saw them and one of the deciding factors to fire me was based on my bringing up that she was part of the favoritism based on the hiring practices since she constantly only let friends/family get promoted.

A great example of the type of people the district manager liked to hire was someone who was once the assistant manager at my store and is now a manager of another store in the district. She told a best buddy worker to ""shut the f\*\*\* up"". After the best buddy worker asked if she got the promotion she wanted and at the time she had not gotten it. During the time she was waiting to find out if she had been promoted from assistant manager to manager of her own store, she stated in the kitchen during working hours multiple times that she would file as many HR complaints as it took for her to be promoted because she deserved that position. My store manager tried to say that I never told him this occurred when I brought it up to the DM when other workers would vouch they heard me tell him about it. 

Yet when I was upset that multiple people I trained got promoted to assistant manager above me and vented to friends (before the store opened) about it that was also given as one of the main reasons I was fired. The district manager tried to say before she fired me that I stated that ""I deserve the assistant manager position"" yet I never said that it was assistant manager months before. 

The next shift/last I worked I was asked by another shift lead repeatedly asked what was going on (why the manager seemed to be upset with me) and both she and another worker at the store were encouraging me to file an HR case. I had asked if she thought that the right thing, which she responded yes to. The next morning the manager asked the other shift leads that night or the next morning if I had said a single word about him or brought up the HR case and since I had said yes that was me speaking about it again. I was only given one verbal warning about not bringing the morale down of the team and that was it. 

There wasn't a trail of bad attitudes or write-ups for me while I was employed. The only write-up I was given was based on my time card, which was a mistake I will own up to. It was for leaving 5 mins early, which I will stand by because there were no cars in the parking lot or on the road; it was very snowy out, and the person I was working with was scheduled to open up in the morning, so I wanted him to get home safe and be able to get some sleep before returning in a few hours.

As an autistic person, I followed the rules to a T, made sure to even have the drains cleaned on the floors, and yet I was never acknowledged except for as bad since I wanted the manager to do his job which is why I put in the HR complaints. He never came in on time and always left early, even when the manager in training for the new store was training he came in late and let that guy come in late too. The MIT was a gross guy and was constantly not washing his hands after touching his face, yet that was never addressed.

I loved being part of the company before it became such a corporatized robotic environment and no longer cared about its squad members. I was always a hard worker when I worked there and I was incredibly dedicated. I didn't have a car until the last two years and made sure to be hours early if I was walking or riding the bus. When the manager took over I expected him to be professional yet he wanted to act like a frat boy, come and go as he wanted, and only do his job when higher-ups are there. 

Should I just let this go? Is there really anyone to bring this up to? 

**TL;DR:**

I faced discrimination and unfair treatment at my workplace, leading to termination. The manager's unprofessional behavior included inappropriate jokes. Despite my efforts to address issues and bullying, there was no resolution. Nepotism and favoritism were rampant, hindering my advancement. Reporting this to HR resulted in termination, highlighting a lack of accountability. Other instances of misconduct within the company went unchecked. I loved being part of it before it lost sight of its values, becoming a corporate entity that disregarded employee well-being."

I loved my job and was damn good at it. No reasons as to why have been given to me, and anyone who may have answers has ghosted me. How do I find closure and move on?

---

I was an area manager for a property management company. I oversaw 4 properties with a total of 527 doors and 12 staff members. I was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated on February 20th. March 8th would have been my one year anniversary.

My entire staff got along really well with me and each other (still do - they still reach out to me regularly for help, even). I had never had a negative anything for the duration of my employment. I was promoted 28 days after being hired. My job was always done, and done well. My 4 properties consistently sat at the top of every list... low delinquency, low vacancy, etc. My reports were turned in on time, my emails were responded to quickly, all policies and procedures were followed, and resident retention and satisfaction was at an all time high. I was even the go-to person for various things that weren't my actual job.

Two weeks prior to being terminated, I was named the ""2023 Rock Star"" in a company-wide email for my hard work, dedication, willingness to help, and for ""always going above and beyond.""

#2 in the company (who I was closest with among upper management) called me on February 20th while I was out sick with COVID to let me know they were parting ways with me, effective immediately. It legitimately came out of nowhere. I thought she was joking at first!

The reason she gave me for the termination? ""Do you remember that one time you told me you sent me an email, but I didn't get it and you couldn't find it? Yeah, stuff like that.""

I swear, lol.

The reason she gave the unemployment office? I took two days off without approval the week before my termination. That was false, so I showed the unemployment office the approved time off email to prove that.

Unemployment determined there was NOT just cause for my termination and I was awarded unemployment compensation, which is, of course, merely a fraction of what my actual pay was, but it's better than zero.

In addition, they paid/are paying me severance.

I had a fantastic relationship with everyone in the company, but especially and specifically, upper management. However, they've ghosted me since my termination. I've been given zero answers, and my entire staff is equally clueless to the entire bizarre situation. It all came out of nowhere.

I learned after-the-fact that my immediate supervisor hired my replacement under my nose and started her the day before they terminated me (again, while I was out with COVID). I'm obviously biased, but my replacement makes my termination make even less sense, because she's nowhere near as qualified as me, and her employment history is sketchy at best, downright bad at worst. She was terminated from her last job for drinking on the job and stealing rent checks for crying out loud!

The only reasonable explanation I can come up with is that my immediate supervisor was not a fan of me, so she found someone she liked more to replace me. We didn't vibe well. We just weren't very compatible. Our personalities are vastly different. However, I was never disrespectful, always friendly, etc., so not being BFFs should be a non-issue. I don't make friends with coworkers anyway... ""Always friendly, never friends.""

ANYWAY! It's still very clearly a fresh wound and is bothering me greatly. My brain doesn't do well not knowing something and not being able to make sense of something. I've never been terminated before, so this whole situation has really thrown me off and has absolutely tanked my everything. I fell into my dark place and have been content with hanging out in my cave ever since it happened.

Since I'm obviously never going to get answers... How do you move on from this? How do you get closure when anyone who could provide that won't respond to you? How do you heal a wound that's left open? How do I overcome the absolute beating my self-confidence and self-perception took? How do I ever feel secure in another job?

Thanks in advance for any advice/guidance."

Any solution is going to have to be multi-faceted. ""Building more housing"" (for the rich) isn't THE solution. It's one small cog in the revolutionary change we need to make housing secure and affordable for all. Here's a hypothetical: If the average cost of a home today were $100,000, without homelessness, without predatory taxes and insurance, and where everyone would be guaranteed housing security, would the following trade off be something you'd willing to make? The trade off is to outlaw billionaires. Yes, it's going to require draconian measures to make housing affordable for the masses. I fail to see how confiscating the riches of 1,000 billionaires outweigh the needs of 350 million. The other trade off is you can't turn a profit when it comes time to sell your house? Housing must be affordable for the next person in your home too.

When I mentioned the 30 day advanced notice requirement I was told that my coworker has kids and since I don't my request was less important than theirs.

I should have seen it coming. The one who approves/denies time off has a group of friends in my work area that gets catered to.

Both places would benefit from the RIGHT Union and that’s the key point.

17,2024-03-11,Wealth and resource hoarding isn't justifiable by any means. Kindness > self interest,u/locoIocal,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bci72f/wealth_and_resource_hoarding_isnt_justifiable_by/,antiwork,"As humans, we find connection with each other through acts of kindness and mutual support. But the relentless machinery of market capitalism often destroy these bonds, turning our interactions into transactions driven by self-interest. Voluntary work stands as a beacon of hope which offers a path to reclaiming our humanity and nurturing the bonds that unite us.

If it weren't for wealth and resource hoarding, the possibility of a society where everyone thrives, is there. With existing advancements in technology and automation, developed nations are now in a crisis of abundance and our basic needs can be met with much less effort. With drastic, systematic change, we could be freed from the burden of spending 30+ hours of work per week for mere survival. Higher education should be accessible for all regardless of cultural or financial background, while they are encouraged and influenced to contribute in meaningful ways to society. In this scenario, we are driven not by the pursuit of profit, but by a genuine desire to contribute to our communities and society. Work becomes a noble endeavor fueled by goodwill, propelling us towards a brighter, more equitable future for all.

Furthermore, studies demonstrate that beyond a certain point of meeting basic needs and comfort, increased wealth doesn't correlate with higher levels of happiness. It's unethical and nonsensical for a handful of people to hoard wealth and resources to the point which the majority suffer, just because they provide products and services that the majority consumes. Consider voluntary work, open source projects and scientific collaboration. Many people are driven towards these persuits because they can be incredibly rewarding and fulfilling even without the financial incentive."

Mind you there’s no proof (how could there be?), there was no discussion or even a chance to defend myself or ask where the allegations came from. 

Anyway, I simply pointed to the “fire me” document, walked to my car and went home. I files for unemployment and just waiting on processing & hoping she doesn’t jack it up on her side. Also I didn’t get my final paycheck for the half week I worked.

I need some help/advice. I work for a company of about 35-45 ppl. It is a company that works in the trades. 

I was hired with experience and as time went on took on more responsibility. I am just about to hit my 1 year anniversary. 
I did get a small raise and the opportunity to make a bonus each month based on performance of the techs in the field. I also do a large amount of work on the weekend and get paid a stipend to do so. 

Fast forward to January and I was offered the opportunity to move to a different role on the same team. No raise, but it’s a good stepping stone and there is a ton more stress. 

Before I took the role, the person in current role had been pawning off their work onto me, but the GM was clearly unaware. I was “helping and being a team player”. We never had to report metrics -this is important.

But now all of a sudden we are having to track a bunch of metrics and the GM is beating me up because they don’t understand why I am not doing a specific task that I used to do all day in my old role but the previous person in my role never did because they didn’t have time. 

Now today the GM told me to send over my detailed list of everything I did today. 

Know that I went all in for malicious compliance and got down to the minutes in many circumstance.

My question is: do I go into the GM and explain exactly how the person before me got their work done every day (she is now my direct boss and WILL throw everyone under the bus if at all possible)? Like ME doing a big portion of it.

Or just deal with it for the time being and find another role elsewhere? 

For reference I am in my 50’s and have worked for 35+ years and have no other source of income. 

Thanks for any advice. I have always bent over backwards for the company I worked for but I’m cooked and in tears.

We’re a single-income family of 5 (2 adults, 3 kids) living in Tacoma, WA. My annual gross salary is $130,000 which equates to $7,550 take-home pay every month after taxes, insurance premiums, and 401(k) contribution.

&#x200B;

**Monthly Fixed Expenses**

Mortgage: $2,000

Utilities (Water, gas, sewer, garbage, internet): $497

Auto (Car note, insurance): $635

Credit card: $350

Student loan: $170

Cell phone (Verizon, 2 lines): $170

Recurring medical not covered by insurance: $970

Pet care (2 cats): $250

Piano lessons: $120

Miscellaneous (Spotify, Amazon Prime, Disney+): $47

Fuel (2 vehicles, low mileage): $200

**TOTAL MONTHLY FIXED EXPENSES: $5,409**

&#x200B;

So after all my fixed expenses I’m left with a budget of roughly $2,150/month. That sounds like a lot until you factor in FOOD, which is our biggest variable cost by far that I've watched increase rapidly year-over-year with little change in our living habits. We currently spend about $1,700/month on food and household necessities, which means at the end of the day we have roughly $450/month of headroom. For a single person or even a small family in a low COL area that may seem like a lot. But here that can evaporate quickly. If a kid goes to the ER unexpectedly that wipes it all out and then some. New clothes for 3 kids because they grow? That’s AT LEAST $300. Unexpected repair for a car out of warranty? You know how that goes. ANY major medical emergency can instantly put us into debt, and I have great insurance!!

We live a solidly middle-class lifestyle. I drive a 7-year-old Kia that’s paid off and the family car is a Toyota minivan. We shop at Safeway, Costco, and Target for food, household items, and clothes. We eat out a handful of times per month. We don’t drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. I work from home 4 days a week and the kids’ school is within walking distance so we don’t drive all that much. We’ve taken 1 modest vacation in the last 5 years. Our house was built in 1940 and is only 1,400 square feet with builder-grade finishes. We don’t go to movies, concerts, sporting events, or have “date nights” because babysitting is so expensive. On the tax side, I only get half my return because every year the feds take the other half and apply it to my wife’s student loans in default. There's obviously room to nitpick but remember stones and glass houses and all. 

I know I have it better than lots of people. I feel VERY lucky and grateful for what I have and that my family has stayed relatively healthy. I also know my situation isn’t unique, and that’s the point. Are there people who are wholly irresponsible with money? Absolutely. But the plight of the majority isn’t a failure of intelligence, morality, priorities, or expectations. If we continue to fight about that we’ll continue to get fucked and never make it out."

While I understand not everyone is in the position to move jobs (due to child expenses, not being able to afford a lapse in insurance, etc)… that can’t apply to everyone, right?

I see so many people post on Reddit about how they hate their jobs etc. Is it really true that all these people couldn’t just move to a company that pays better or move into a parallel position and break into a slightly new industry where they would be happier? Is it REALLY because it’s impossible or is it because they’re too afraid? 

I feel like maybe I’ve just been lucky that job hopping has worked out for me in my industry and maybe my situation is uncommon or rare. Does anyone have any insight? I had to do a lot of digging to understand why people don’t go after better opportunities. I’ve seen a lot of “there’s no better opportunities”, “I can’t afford to leave”, etc. Can anyone enlighten me? Please feel free to ask questions if I’m not making any sense. 

Please be kind if I sound totally ignorant or rude, that’s not my intention I just genuinely don’t understand. I’ve been able to job hop into higher and higher positions (not without it’s cons - I had to take some shitty jobs for the experience, struggle for money in the process, live with strangers for cheaper rent, etc) and I’m confused why I don’t see others do the same. I’m assuming the main reason is most people can’t or won’t take the risks I have, but I just want to fully understand.

I still help around the house and with bills (I'm not a freeloader), I just genuinely don't have the desire to get a job, or buy a car due to the amount of money they cost to maintain.

I know I can't keep doing this, as one day I'll be forced to grow up and join the rat race, along with everyone else. I haven't had a ""real"" job in around two years, it's easy enough to lie on my resume so who gives a fuck?

I want luxuries to be taxed like crazy, to take money out of the pockets of the shallow people, and to provide peace of mind to those who are at least smart enough not to fall into the luxury trap.

I've spent money on luxuries before. They are so hollow and empty and meaningless. Just more ways for corporations to prey on our insecurities. They did not make my life better in any way. They just made me feel empty and purposeless.

Some people say to spend money on experiences rather than things. I disagree, I think most consumerist experiences are also empty. Disneyland, resort vacations, fancy music concerts and shows, most of those are also hollow experiences. Most people travel for shallow reasons. I know some serial backpackers whose lives seem so unrooted and transient. Maybe some travel can be meaningful, but there's so much garbage travel packages being advertised out there."
5,2024-03-12,Need some encouragement,u/DemonSwordsman53,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bcpve9/need_some_encouragement/,antiwork,"I'm currently losing my mind. I should start by saying the main issue is something that happened to my mother and so I only have so much of the details on hand, but I'm not sure where else to go for advice.

My mother was an employee for this company for 34 years. She started when she was 19 and had been working there her entire life up until this past September. The company was bought out somewhere between February and May I'm pretty sure, but the new company said it would be keeping on as many people as they could (which is standard terminology I'm sure). My mother has shifted positions numerous times and gone way up the ladder at this company over the years. Prior to the buy out, there was talks about it and she was pretty sure it was going to happen, but let it be known that it wasn't out of nowhere. As time went by leading to this fated buy out, she was receiving more and more work on top of her usual duties. At this point I should mention that I'm unsure of her exact title, but I know she only technically received the a ""management"" or ""supervisor"" title in the past year despite all the time and effort. It is important to note that her role in the company  was essentially that of a supervisor as well as managing the ""screw-ups"" of the company and she had been fulfilling that role for several years. She liked to call herself the ""designated apologizer"". As she was receiving more and more work, things started to slow down as she was the only person responsible for the huge projects like the annual SOC, (I forgot what that stood for to be honest) which would take several months to complete partly because of all the other work she was responsible for.

 Fast forward to when the company got bought out, She, as well as many other coworkers, kept their jobs and in almost all cases even kept their titles. The workload for my mother continued to worsen under the supervision of this new company. As the company has exchanged hands, they had to contact all of their clients and inform them of the change as well as the new policies. My mother was one of the people enlisted in this uphill battle of contacting the entirety of their clientele. To my understanding, most people got bogged down with this task as well as being expected to manage the rest of their workload. Numerous people that had been kept on from the previous company had started to leave mere weeks after the transition had officially occurred. This is where things got exponentially worse. As more people we're leaving, the workload increased (which is only natural). Everyone had more to take care of and people kept dropping like flies. My mother, having been with the company for three decades, was obviously friends (or at least acquaintances) with all of her coworkers. There was a lot of chat between them regarding the increasingly terrible expectations. As previously mentioned, most people had bowed out knowing that things would only get worse, which means ruin for the rest of the employees.

It has occurred to me at this point that I haven't mentioned that for that last 6 or 7 years of her employment at the company, she was able to convince them to let her work from home. She had to commute 2 and a half hours to and from work not including the L.A. traffic. She would only come into the office when there were important meetings. As the pandemic happened and working from home became commonplace, she wouldn't have to commute to the office at all.

The domino effect caused by the buy out was horrible, but despite it all she remained a hard working employee at this new company. The transition period has yet to be finished and the safety of her job was still in question. I'm not sure how they put it on paper, but essentially she didn't have a title after the buy out, but she was still employed. Throughout her time working under the new company, she was told consistently that they were ""trying to find a place for her"" or ""trying to find a title"" and things of that nature. She still tried her best to get the work done regardless of the scary position she was in. 

Now we're at the end of July / early August. They had informed her that they would keep trying to find a fit, but the best they could do for certain was keep her on until the end of September and anything beyond that, they couldn't promise. Sure enought, come September, they hadn't found anything. They did however offer her something that is honestly insulting. Her office would deal with the local clients, but they had offices all over the nation. This new position would be to oversee the offices across the nation doing essentially the same thing she had done. HOWEVER, she would be getting paid two third of what she was making. So not only would she be taking on infinitely more work, but she'd also get paid even less. So in the end, they just didn't want to pay her what she had been getting paid and they let her go.

She'd been saving money to buy a house, but when talks of a buy out started going around she waited because she'd obviously need a job for stability. Now we're on the verge of losing the house,  that we'd been renting and have little to no options left. We're bleeding out and can't really fix it.

This is where I come in. My brother and I have been trying to find a job. Obviously I can only speak for myself, but I've been doing everything shy of knocking on doors offering to do yard work just to earn anything at all. Despite all of the places that say they are hiring, I can't get so much as an interview. My brother is 4 years older than I am and has had the ability to work that much sooner obviously. He was able to get positions left and right and admittedly he didn't stay with any one position for very long. By the time I was able to get a job, it seemed like the job market was taken out back and shot. I still, to this very day, haven't been able to get an interview. I hate to complain about this sort of thing because I already feel old and jaded as it is, but it really feels impossible to survive. 

My mother can't find a position despite her 34 years of experience in office related work. My brother can barely get an interview. I've still never gotten an interview for a real job. The best I've done is house-sitting, babysitting, and dog-sitting for family, friends and friends of friends.

If someone with relevant experience can't get a job (let alone three decades of experience), than how is someone like me going to get hired. It really feels like a chicken vs the egg situation where I need experience to find work and I need work to get experience. I'm honestly not sure what more I could do.

As it stands right now, my mother still can't find a job (despite the experience), but she's filed for unemployment which is less than 1/4 of what she had been making. As such, we can't afford rent off of that alone and are hemorrhaging money from our savings to pay for it. My brother managed to get a job at a warehouse and has been there for almost three weeks now and is contributing almost his entire paycheck just so we can afford rent. I'm able to contribute my measly little food stamps/EBT because that's all I can consistently get. My ""under the table"" gigs watching pets, and kids, and whatnot have become increasingly less frequent and so all I have is food stamps.

I'm not sure how much longer we'll have until we take another hit, but I know that we can't take much more. I really wish this could all be over, be it from finding a way out of this hole, or by getting hit by  an 18 wheeler on the 95. At the ripe old age of 19 I get to think about contingency plans, like trying to wait this out until my grandmother kicks the bucket so we can maybe get something from her will. I know her house is going to my uncle, but maybe he'd be willing to let us stay there and we'd pay for utilities since the house is already paid off. If that doesn't work then I'm gonna have to find some couches to surf on until I somehow manage to get a job. I could always try the lottery and just hope that the insurmountable odds somehow work out in my favor and then my family and I could have a place to stay. 

I'm not really sure what I'm looking to get out of posting this, but any advice would be great. I'm just scared, tired, and entirely too aware of how bad the world is right now. I just want a job so I can help guarantee my family's safety. Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated.


TL:DR: My mother worked for a company for 34 years, company got bought out, lost her job. Now we're screwed because we can't afford rent and none of us can find a job.

Id say im pretty average somewhat intelligent person whos a little shy and doesn’t always know what to say but have a heart full of compassion and care. 

But i just cant hold a job like i cant be the only one with the issues Ive experienced.

My first job was fast food for 2 yrs. Went really well.

Than worked in a trade doing fencing for 6 months, pretty hard work but leaned a lot.
The beginning was easy going cus im new and also not particularly muscular. But later down the track i would run into little issues that i couldn’t get my head around and take too long to work out and they were issues i couldn’t just ask because they were petty little things but im overthinking everything all the time so i looked like an idiot but looked like an idiot any way cus im overthinking trying not to look like one.

It was a stupid cycle, like a catch 22 situation. So when the expectations got bigger of me i ended up getting worse. Idfk how but it just went down hill after half way. The first half was pretty good and went well tho. Keep in mind im working with pretty smart guys. one time one of them say “dont leave that tool out” or something like that i cant remember exactly the situation, than the next day or something the same person says the opposite, and shit like that would happen. Maybe it was for a different reason but as far as i could tell nothing i did was right and my confidence the during my time was at an all time low. All just dumb little things that would make me look stupid.

So i get let go from that and do warehousing for 1 year and it was really good. 

Same sort of situation. Great team tho was good. Again moments of me looking like an idiot or nothing going my way. A couple months in and some days had some bullshit and i just remember saying to myself “wow, there is no winning only losing” and carried on to put up with it. 

I fully admit most of it is me being incompetent and stupid and dumb and slow even tho im not when im calm and not stressed. But as soon as i am everything goes wrong and me just doing anything somehow turns to shit.

If you saw how i operate everyday things and life  in person you wouldn’t see anything wrong with me. But as soon as i talk to people or have to do a job my brain just kills its self. 

I can go on and on about every little detail but id be here all day.

So present day i quite 3 months ago and just plan on ending my life eventually. Fuck work. Fuck trying. Fuck participating in a losing battle. Fuck all these people in everyday life who say one thing and do another. All the lies about getting a good job to afford a stupid house. Fuck me cus im unabal to do the same things other people do.

Its like the universe has reserved the ability to win for anyone who’s not me cus im me.

2,2024-03-12,References?? ,u/Virtual_Ad9762,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bct2e3/references/,antiwork,"We've had a rough 18months as a family (will illness/hospital stuff). 

I had a job I thought was amazing, great step in my career, enjoyable work, I had a (mostly) great team reporting to me. My boss was a bit questionable (I got the job over a friend of theirs). 

But, shit went down. I had a kid in and out of hospital with specialist appointments frequently (the kind where you take next available not wait till its a good time to be off work). My boss was not very understanding (at all!). After 4 weeks I realised I couldn't keep working (in a role I'd worked so hard to achieve), my family needed me home and available. 

So I approached my bosses boss and HR and asked for 3 months off (unpaid) so I could get our situation settled and then be able to be back with an idea of what would be needed going forward. 

After initially agreeing, my boss got involved and suddenly they couldn't back fill the role, I could either get back to work or quit. 

So I quit effective immediately. 

After 3 months I got a part time job (several steps down from my previous role) which gave me the flexibility I needed for my family. It was a contract role for a specific project. Which will soon finish. So I've been looking for work. 

I can go back to full time now because we have a regular schedule of appointments and my kid is back at school (and doing so much better!).

I did an interview today via a recruiter. She asked for refences. I told her I could give from my role before the one I left suddenly (and gave her a quick overview of why I couldn't do the previous) and at least 1 person from every role I'd held for the past 10 years. But she's now demanding I give for my current role. I told her I didn't want to do that, because while I haven't been offered a new contract I don't want to risk where I'm at because I still have time in my current role. 

She got really quite pushy with me about it. I was super uncomfortable. She told me someone else from her office (her boss) will ring to talk about next steps. I'm wondering if I'll limit my opportunity there is I refuse to name a refence from my current role...am I really being so unreasonable? Should I just give the previous and let them give me a bad refence, since I can also provide multiple extremely good references? "

6,2024-03-12,"""Wellbeing"" day",u/ohfudgeit,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bctiut/wellbeing_day/,antiwork,"Last year the company I work for (small UK software house) got bought out by a parent company. The parent company has ""wellbeing"" days, which are essentially just extra days off that we don't get to choose when to take. Nice. Our CEO emails in September letting us know that we won't be honoring the one in 2023 but we will be honoring them in 2024. Ok.

Months pass, we get emails from the parent company about the wellbeing days. There's one on March 11th and one in October. They get added to our admin system as Bank holidays so we can't use our annual leave on those days because everyone has them off. Can you see where this is going?

Cut to two weeks ago, we get an email from our CEO saying that they don't know why people think we are honoring the wellbeing days because we are not. 

HR scrambling to change the calendar. Everyone confused and annoyed.

CEO backtracks and says that we can have one of the two days, but we have to arrange cover with our coworkers so that too many people from the same area aren't off on the same days. People have already made plans, it's two weeks away.

I agreed with my coworker that I would work 11th March (yesterday) so that he could have it off. And I did. But I guess my ""wellbeing"" took a hit because for some reason I now don't feel like coming in today... I guess I'm taking that day off after all."

6,2024-03-12,List of rules from my inexperienced manager,u/nekosaigai,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bcv2xz/list_of_rules_from_my_inexperienced_manager/,antiwork,"Little back story: the place I work at hired a new director a few months ago to oversee our department. My friend was the manager for that department and had essentially been doing her job and is nearly as qualified as the new director is, if not more qualified, for her new job. 3 weeks into the job she fired my friend and transferred an inexperienced and incompetent manager into his job. This manager has no previous managerial experience, no leadership training or skills, and does not appear to have any of the knowledge or skills to work in our department, let alone help administrate and lead it.

Anyways, the manager has been sending out edicts fairly often lately, here’s a few of the apparently new rules:

1. No talking to other employees in the front lobby.
2. All lunch breaks must be pre-scheduled and calendared every week. 
3. No talking to anyone without calendaring in a meeting with them on outlook.
4. Submit any OT or time as you do it because it makes her job easier, rather than waiting to submit time at the end of the period. 
5. No listening to music without headphones. 
6. Check her shared tracker multiple times a day for work assignments. (She doesn’t directly hand us work assignments, she makes a list on an excel sheet and tells us we need to check it. We don’t get pinged when we have new assignments.)
7. No “jumping the chain of command”. Anything we want to say to other people on our team about coordinating work is jumping the chain of command if not routed through her. (Coworker got written up for sending an email to the team asking if people could consider doing something on a large group project that only some of us was doing.)
8. No one is allowed within one of my coworker’s work area, even if they invite us in and say it’s fine, because of a reasonable accommodation. Said coworker is also not allowed to carpool with anyone according to my manager. 

I am curious to see what other new rules or fresh toxic stupidity is going on when I’m finally back in the office. I’ve been away in medical leave, but those are just a handful of new rules that the manager has recently dictated. 

(It’s also going to make things awkward when I have to calendar in meeting details for an upcoming confidential meeting with the HR Director due to the toxic and illegal behavior of the manager and director)"

I registered to get a certification relevant to my career path, and this cert requires a 4 day course of live instruction in order to qualify to complete the cert. I paid for the course myself, and granted, my company did say they would pay for the course upon getting my certs. So i get into the third day of this course and get a call from my bosses, including the new COO, saying I HAVE to come in on the next day. No choice. When I objected to coming in, saying I had requested this months in advance and I am doing this to help learn more for my position, they basically hit back with ""Well we are paying for it, so we don't care"". No acknowledgement of the wasted time, and less than a nod at the fact that I had requested off forever ago.   
When I came to work for this company, they were smaller and felt a lot more friendly, putting the workers before the company profit and making sure we had what we needed to go forward. I would talk with the owner quite often and I felt that my experience and work ethic was valued. Then they hired a COO. First off, no one told us that they were even hiring a COO. They hired a guy that has 0 experience in the industry. Dude has come in and started corporatizing the entire company. We have also changed our financial software to something that seems like it is completely incompatible with the industry I am in. The finance department loves it, but literally everyone on production hates it. When production aired their grievances, the upper management's response ranged from ""suck it up"" to "" production doesn't know what they are doing"". This is the reason for which I had to cut my course short. Because management thought we needed more training with a new software. Super Important, can not miss it. Glad I could waste 3 days on a course I have to now retake because they bought a contract with a software that doesn't actually work for this industry.

I have a medical document saying that I can work at home whenever and I’m choosing to work from home because I have a very confidential appointment that I can’t risk anyone at work hearing which is why I’m choosing to work from home just for one day.

My manager emailed me saying “I know you have a medical note saying you can work from home but I feel like you are more productive here in the office because you can scan documents from here and work on them. Just make sure that you’re working at home only when necessary. When you work from home I have to answer questions about your job and that effects my work.”

I actually agree with my manager and I like working from the office and I do feel as though I can be more productive in a way if I work in the office. I like working in the office because I can get some talking in because I don’t live with anyone and I get very lonely. Even the doctor that gave me the medical note suggested I only use it when necessary because the doctor knows I should be talking to people everyday even though I’m an introvert.

Like yeah, I know. I don’t work from home a lot this is the second time I’ve worked from home since before the holiday season. The first time I worked from home for one day is because my coworker was super negative around me when I just got back from a vacation. Now it’s because I have a couple appointments to attend to. I don’t work from home just cause I feel like it. I work from home because I feel as though it’s necessary and I feel like my manager doesn’t get that I get that.

I’ve tried to look for documentation on the B.C. government website about employer retaliation and what they can ask in regards to medical documents about working from home but I can’t find anything!

Can anyone help me with this issue I’m facing?

i was laid off, along with many others back in january, at a job i loved very much. i was essentially scrambling to find something afterwards (it’s 100% my fault for not starting my job search earlier as i knew there was a chance of being laid off) however the only business to respond to my application was a movie theatre. during the interview the manager seemed very nice and even told me i’m one of the best people he’s interviewed in his entire career. 
i wasn’t too keen on the idea of working there just because i knew it would be boring but i’m 19 and am desperate for extra money. i currently live with a parent who thankfully can cover a big percent of my expenses such as rent and power bills, but it’s still important that i have my own income. 
anyway to get to the real point of this post, i absolutely fucking hate working where i do. here’s a list of the key reasons why 
* i’ve been taught to do the same tasks differently by different people, and get shamed for doing certain things “wrong” 
* my first week there i had put in a time off request with my supervisor walking me through it, there was an option to leave a comment as to why i wanted the time off, supervisor told me to skip that part, i submit the request to my manager and he denies it because i didn’t leave a comment 
* hours are cut like crazy, the managers ask at least one person to go home every time i work, recently i showed up for my shift and the first thing my manager says is “we’re looking for someone to go home as we are overstaffed” pretty much implying i should be the one to go home 
* customers are so fucking rude, getting mad at me because us cashiers have nothing to do with the arcade in the theatre, or complaining about prices that i have no control over 
* there’s a massive mouse problem, traps everywhere and we frequently find bite marks in bags of candy or popcorn kernels 
* just general passive aggressiveness and rudeness from managers and coworkers 

anyway, i’m just looking for advice regarding what to do, and how to cope with this until i find something tolerable. my friend is printing me out physical resumes so i can hand them in to places in person, but i’ve been applying to places online everyday for weeks. i should be grateful to even have a job, and i am, but i am so miserable with this "

The gyst of it is that if you have a household income over $250k, you’re in a pretty, pretty, pretty small demographic.

Now, yeah, a small family can live comfortably in some regions of the US on that. 

However… 

Let’s say you’ve worked real hard, real smart, and probably with a laser focus on money over the finer things in life: relationships, community, health. Well, you’re still overwhelmingly likely to be in that sub-$250k group.

And while that’s enough money to be comfortable, it is probably not enough to…

1. Send your kids to college.
2. Weather medical emergencies.
3. Retire comfortably.

More importantly, the difference between the high-earning family and the low-earning family is disturbingly minimal. 

On a low income, you may struggle to buy a home, you might be more stressed about money (if you care), and you’re gonna buy less of the luxury crap to keep up with them Jones’. 

But you can still figure out how to send your kids to college. You probably have more free time. And if you have an unforeseen medical emergency, you’re kinda just still screwed instead of risking seeing everything you’ve worked for go to insurance companies (do not pass go).

I know it’s been said many times, but the point is…

It’s not that people don’t want to work. It’s that the economics make less and less sense every day. The only reasonable strategy is to work just enough to survive while you plot your moonshot.

So follow your dreams, everyone!"

3,2024-03-12,Schedule Retaliation/ Rant,u/Adhdlight,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bd06p4/schedule_retaliation_rant/,antiwork,"TLDR: I ask management to make good on their interview promises, I get told it’s my own fault and to kick rocks while I loose good shifts. 

For context, last year I (23 F) moved to a new town to be closer to college. I’ve been a restaurant server for 4 yrs and have had management positions/ BOH positions for 6yrs (flip flopping between serving/boh for total of 6yrs in the industry). I’m very confident I’m good at my job, and try my absolute best to support my coworkers so we all have a good time and easy shift. 
I took a Hosting job at a local brewery and the interviews with both the managers led me to believe it was pretty clear that they would move me up to a serving position in March, and the base hourly for the hosting job would be higher than advertised. This was four months ago. 
As you probably can guess, that’s not what happened. I attempted to address the false hourly promise and was met with indifference and temporarily placated with expo shifts. I always advocate for myself because I naively still believe people are people under capitalism. I've been in a weird utilitarian role for four months, doing three jobs for this place. A month ago, a previous employee came back and has been given serving shifts on my available days. My schedule is limited because of school, I'm an adult, I have bills and I don’t rely solely on my partner financially. I told my manager I was concerned about being overlooked, given that there was an understanding come March, I would be transitioned fully into a serving role. They said my random roles were essentially my own fault for having limited availability (that they approved).They said they were having another staff member return to hosting, and that they would have to basically ""pay their dues"" as far as seniority goes because they left. Except it hasn’t with the one who returned last month who went straight to serving. Two weeks after I brought this up and I thought it was fixed, I get another utilitarian schedule. I ask my manager about this, and they brush me off, saying I was the only one with availability and they basically won't fix it to reflect what we agreed to two weeks prior. I’ve only gotten one serving shift per week, and it has changed from a lucrative Saturday to a dead weekday evening. The expo shifts have gone from busy weekends to slow weekdays. 
I know I am being retaliated against, overlooked, and this all definitely reeks of forced quitting because they are giving heavy favoritism to prior staff members. 
Jokes on them, I have a 2nd interview at a fine dining establishment and I’ve been looking for a different place since they didn’t make good on their interview promises. I can’t work with petty bosses, I’ve been a boss myself and I know what favoritism and retaliation looks like. 
Fuck management- they’re not your friends and you don’t owe them shit.

And then you click the comments of the IG reel and the person says “get a real job” and then it starts a whole arguments in the comments lol

The reality is there’s no such thing as a “real job”. If it makes any type of Income it’s a real job, silly bandz were literally multicolor animal/object shaped bracelets for the younger folks and sold millions. Those things were a whole trend.  Now the guy who created silly banz is rich. You can literally get rich off anything in this world, if it can be sold it can be a job. You don’t even have to be rich off of it but you get the point

I don’t get the brainwashed American culture where everybody thinks having a “professional job title” is the end all be all, it’s not! People too focused on sounding successful by having this job title or this degree when in reality all that actually matters is if you make income off of it. Your job title could be juiced up to sound all fancy but does it actually make income? Who knows

You could be a garbage man for all I cared if you’re making great money than it’s a real job."

We are less employees, the new employees are less and less competent and to offset that I get to do more work. I talked to my boss about it, that I increasingly have to do stuff I'm not hired for, that is out of my field entirely just because others don't do their job at all and that I get more repsonsiblities  and tighter deadlines about stuff I'm not trained for or remotely interested in and that we have other employees for. My boss told me in a nice way that he rather throws me under the bus than make certain people actually do their job and that it could benefit me learing new skills. all of that while my pay has remained the same, inflation devalues my pay month by month and my mental health has taken a heavy toll. After I talked to my boss my manager calls me a day or two later to give me more of the work I told my boss I hate and I'm not qualified for. I feel personally attacked after that and a couple days later my manager and we have a talk were I'm told I'm integral to this institution and that they don't want to ever see me leave.  


The moment I find another job I'm out. I've been in such a bad state of mind that even my doctor told me to gtfo and find something new as it doesn't feel like they actually value my work in any way shape or form and both my physical and mental health are severely impacted. Giving me more encuragement to leave as soon as possible once a new opportunity arises.  
But even when I find a new job, due to my contract I still have to work for 3 more months for my old job which terrifies me as I'm convinced they will throw every single piece of shit on me they can find.  
I have to keep working for more than 40 years until I could retire and I'm already on the verge of burn out. I simply cannot bear the thought of burning out so quickly as my job is part of my identity and I hope I find a new employer that atleast respects the boundaries of my capabilities.

Also if I could do everything my current employer demands from me, I could make myself go freelance and make cash big time. But I don't want to go freelance as I can't take that risk financially."

Step 1 was a screening with the HR rep. Step 2  was a writing exam (it's a writing job). Step 3 was an interview with the hiring manager. Step 4 will be a meeting with the team. 

The thing is, there's been a week to a week and a half between each step. It's driving me up the fucking wall. I mean that I literally feel like I am being driven insane with stress. 

I completed the third step, and I don't know how it went. I'm sitting here and checking my email every 2-3 minutes. I even sent the HR rep an email asking if there's been any news (something I did after step 2 and also received no response on for a week). Radio silence. Somebody at that company knows whether or not I'm advancing to the next stage, but it's just not a priority enough for them to spend 45 seconds writing an email about it. 

And it's by no means just this company. Every company I've interviewed with has done this - week+ long gaps in communication where I'm left wondering what the hell's happening. 

I understand that it's not really that important to these people, but some part of them has to have the empathy to understand that this is pretty much the most important thing happening in my life right now. Am I going to have a salary or not? I'm doing contract work right now, so I'm struggling with not enough hours and I have no health insurance. This is so important to me, and all I need is somebody to tell me what's happening so I can move on with my life and stop freaking the hell out over it.

At the beginning of a whole staff meeting, with no prior warning and no time for me to formulate a response. 

Now, I go above and beyond every day anyway, which is why my boss wants me to take on these new responsibilities, one of which is training new staff so they can work the way I do. I would like to think that would be enough to stand me in good stead in the future for new opportunities, not that I would have to perform more and more free labour to ‘prove’ myself worthy of consideration. And what if an opportunity doesn’t come up - am I to perform free additional labour just in case one day something could maybe perhaps arise?

Honestly, is this normal? I am one of the lowest paid people at my workplace already, so it makes absolutely no sense to me that I’d agree to take on more responsibility than others have for no more pay.

My last job was actually traumatizing, so I came into this a little worried.

My third day on the job, my boss told me she plans on firing my coworker because she’s a crap worker and she keeps calling out. I should’ve taken this as a red flag, because why was she telling me all of that? Ended up not even firing the girl btw, because she “loves her too much”.

Anyways, since I’ve started, a few of my coworkers have “tattled” on me to my boss for small mistakes after they were already resolved. I’m new, learning. After a few times of this happening, (I work in a small office with 4 other women) I ended up complaining to my boss about it and told her it seems like my coworkers don’t like me as it feels like they are trying to paint a bad picture of me when there’s no need. I went to my 2 coworkers, asked them if something I was doing was frustrating them, and that they could come to me about it. They denied that I was doing anything wrong, they just needed to make sure those mistakes didn’t happen again. (They weren’t, and again, very small mistakes). 

Well, even though I know they were being two faced, I still show up and do my work and am super nice to everyone. I don’t dislike them. Well, today, I made another mistake. It was something I hadn’t even been trained on that they just expected me to know to do. So the thing didn’t get done. Then, all of a sudden, all 4 of my coworkers immediately go in my bosses office and shut the door then talk about me. A few of them told on me for making the mistake then played it off like they were trying to fix it. 

I went to my boss after, and let her know I felt like it was super isolating to handle situations like this, and that I shouldn’t be expected to know something I was never taught. She got pissed at me and threatened to fire me because everyone at my job thinks i hate them and that the tension between me and this one specific girl is so tense it’s affecting the whole office. (I don’t feel any tension with anybody). My boss told me I need to offer to help them with their work more then maybe they’ll be comfortable with me. (Wtf?)

Come to find out it’s because my boss told my coworkers I’m overly emotional and unapproachable because I get “super defensive” over everything. (Referring to me complaining about my treatment). So, that’s nice. I talked to my coworkers about this, asking what I’m doing/saying that makes them feel like I dont like them, they all told me what my boss told them. I’m 21 and my coworkers are all 30-40. What is even happening? I feel like I’m being targeted, but part of me feels like I am at fault."

Obviously I’m not saying do whatever your boss or company says and you should put yourself first. But, sticking it to your boss/company by fucking over your coworkers doesn’t put you on some moral high ground or is the act of revenge you think it is. "
510,2024-03-12,i just did an interview where they were really upset i called in (which i was able to do because it’s an option) ,u/millennial_sentinel,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bd40sl/i_just_did_an_interview_where_they_were_really/,antiwork,"i just was wondering if anyone has experienced something like this before.  i just finished an interview over the phone where they were using a video platform and were really upset that i called in. the main character of the group asked me like 5 times if there was anyway i could turn on my camera.  i was like i called into the conference my video isn’t available through the phone. 

she asked me to 

- try to go somewhere else with better service 

- use someone else’s device 

- try to get on wifi

- download the platform and just use the video option

i was so bluntly firm about doing the interview as is i’m sure i didn’t get this job but it was so bizarre to me. this lady asked me like a thousand different ways to get the video going. i simply explained i don’t have good service and that i wasn’t on wifi so i am just using my phone. 

WHAT DOES IT MATTER?! lol see this is exactly why HR people can’t hire anyone for anything because they don’t actually want to hire they want to waste your time with unimportant things. 

look at my resume. look at my exam score. look at my education. look at my work experience. do the interview and make a decision.


has anyone else had an hr person almost end a interview because you didn’t do a video interview? is this normal now?"
1,2024-03-12,With regards to our Democracy: We can't accomplish anything without moderate Democrat voters.,u/halt_spell,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bd4pls/with_regards_to_our_democracy_we_cant_accomplish/,antiwork,"For some context, I've all but lost faith in our Democracy. Whether through corruption, greed, incompetence or all three the fact is clear to me that we are _not_ making incremental progress and I lay that at the feet of every establishment Democrat in office.

While of course this applies to more than just the President here are some examples of what Biden has done on his own against the wishes of progressive and leftist voters.

Called on congress to block the rail strike: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-calls-on-congress-to-block-potential-railroad-strike  
Walks back his own campaign promise for $50k forgiveness: https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/539139-biden-balks-at-50k-student-loan-forgiveness-plan/  
Goes around congress to sell weapons to Israel: https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/29/  politics/biden-congress-israel-military-aid/index.html  
Forced federal workers back to office: https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/politics/in-person-work-biden-administration/index.html  
Increased the defense budget: https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/28/politics/defense-budget-biden-administration/index.html

While obviously Biden cannot control the behavior of Republicans he is solely responsible for any decision he makes on his own and all of these decisions betray the progressive and leftist voters who supported him in the 2020 general election. Some people may be quick to scoff at this idea as if progressive and leftist voters never vote. But if they actually believed that then Biden shouldn't have anything to worry about in 2024. If we didn't vote for him in 2020 and he won who cares what we do in 2024 right?

Another thing people will say is ""Well Biden had to make these decisions because he would have lost the election."" Which brings me to Moderate Democrat voters. There aren't many conversations about the entitlement of people who would refuse to vote for Biden if he hadn't increased the defense budget, hadn't blocked the rail strike, hadn't forced federal workers back into the office or cut off weapons to Israel. But there is a never ending list of conversations accusing progressives and leftists about being entitled if they refuse to vote for Biden for increasing the defense budget, blocking the rail strike, forcing federal workers back into the office or sending weapons to Israel. This clear double standard is exhausting, indefensible _and will only get worse_.

What do I mean by that? Let's talk about the makeup of reliable Democrat voters. I don't know of a perfect way to measure this but let's say if someone is motivated enough to show up to vote in a primary they're a reliable voter. Let's also assume the primaries are a good representation of the kinds of voters. In the 2020 primaries Biden won with 19 million votes and Bernie came in second place with 9.5 million votes. With these numbers that means in a population of 100 reliable voters 67 are moderates and 33 are progressives/leftists.

First of all, this dispels the narrative that progressives and leftists are some small insignificant wing. They make up a _third_ of reliable Democrat voters. Second, what does this mean for the future? There are substantial fears by moderates, progressives and leftists alike 2024 is shaping up to be 2016 and even if that turns out not to be the case it doesn't make 2028 any more of a guarantee. For many progressives and leftists their galvanizing moment occurred in 2008 and no real forward progress has been made since then. Many may give into apathy and stop voting at all. You'll find many on this sub have given up on Democracy entirely and believe that strikes are the only way forward.

But an even bigger problem arises if progressives and leftists numbers increase. If the day came where progressives and leftists outnumbered moderates in the primaries and managed to elect a progressive or leftist candidate what then? Would the moderates show up? Or would that only result in a loss?

I realize this is a wall of text now so let me get to the point.

We cannot accomplish anything without moderate Democrat voters. Whether leftists and progressives checking out, protest voting or managing to elect a progressive candidate in the primaries this fact remains. If moderate Democrats are unwilling to compromise then losing general elections to fascist candidates is not a possibility it is a guarantee."

Decided to interview at a few places, one of which is making me come in for the day for interviews.

Made up some bs family emergency to my boss a week ago, who said I could take time off only to find out today that I haven't hit PTO time yet (been working for this company under 3 months) and therefore I can't take time off. Mentioned I'd be happy to use a sick day (we get 5 days of sick leave prorated at beginning of employment) as a family member of mine was ill, but she chatgpt'd me back on slack saying: **""Exploring alternative timing for your visit to your family could help minimize disruptions to our team's workflow""**. What in the world...

At this point, I'm down to quiet quit. Company doesn't give af about me. But, my underlying question is: **Is this even legal?**

\*\*Important to note, I haven't used any sick days/PTO time yet. This was my only request so far in about 70-80 days of employment."

Long story short, I broke my ankle, and my employer is making me work through it. I am an engineering contractor for a very well-known company and these motherfuckers want me to continue showing up to the office even though: 1. I cannot drive with a broken ankle 2. I cannot walk, I am in crutches. 3. It is uncomfortable for me to stand for long periods (duhh). Unfortunately, the nature of my job is somewhat physical, and they haven't really provided me with alternatives despite the fact I have a minor in CS (which is more education in programming then allot of people at this company have believe it or not). According to my boss I should work on wiring harnesses and soldering stuff up that needs to get done. 

Not only that but I have ZERO paid time off during this ordeal. Zero sick days at this company. I have accrued a total of 2 paid days off at this company since I started almost a year ago, which I used on a weekend vacation. That is right, this company offers zero sick days so go fuck yourself if you have a medical emergency. 

That icing on the cake though is how I was reprimanded for not responding to a group email which occurred during the same time of the accident and when I was in the hospital. All this despite the fact that I texted my boss the night that it happened. You would fucking think they would understand ""Hey he's at the hospital for his broken foot he probably isn't checking his fucking work email."" but nah. I explained the situation to my boss and was basically told that ""well even under stressful circumstances details matter."" I kid you not. Honestly, I didn't know how to respond. I am not sure if my boss is a sociopath or not after that one. Let's not even forget the fact that this email was originally sent out at like 7:34pm or some bullshit.

27,2024-03-12,Reorganization happened and now my bosses suck.,u/beatneo,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bda1uu/reorganization_happened_and_now_my_bosses_suck/,antiwork,"I’ve worked for my current company for 3 years, and when I started things were great. In my first year we bought another company, and we slowly started integrating them into our work practices. Then about a year ago we got notice that for the American division of our company they were putting the people that were in charge of the company we bought in top leadership positions. 

So with that context, they reached out to me a few weeks ago and congratulated me on being picked to coordinate and audit all 10 facilities in our region. I was excited because this is some work that has needed done for a while, a lot of our facilities are given the standard and just expected to comply in their own way. There’s no uniformity, there’s little communication…it was the job I’ve been waiting for them to ask me to do. The job I was hired to do was for one facility only, and I thought that this meant they were giving me a promotion. That wasn’t the case though, they said it would only take me 25 hours a month (I estimate more like 35 hours for what they asked, which is probably half or less of what actually needs done), and that this was just an ongoing special project. Obviously I wasn’t happy about this, I’m a professional with 10 years experience and advanced degrees and certifications in my field. When I asked about whether they would consider ever creating this position in the future, they said that they didn’t think the business would require it. The business requires this “project” but not the position to do the project? I can’t make heads or tails of that logic. Then they said that I’ve only been there for three years maybe we can talk about a promotion when I’ve been there for longer. 

Now this is something I’m expected to do without proper compensation or even a better title, and I was told not to be “bitter about it”. I was told to walk on eggshells around them and to be thankful for the opportunity. They are upset with me because I got “HR involved when I brought up a promotion”. They said as payment I should take “the experience”, but I already have this experience. I managed multiple facilities in my last 3 jobs, that’s why they want me to do this and not any of my other colleagues. My direct boss, to his credit, is pissed about they way they went about this. His advice was to do the bare minimum they are asking me to do and in the mean time to look for other jobs. 

I’m just so tired of this bullshit, thanks for letting me rant."

I was working as an auditor for a big 4 firm remotely for 7 months after college. And although the work wasn’t that hard, I had such a strong feeling that I wasn’t doing anything that mattered, that I quit! And now, I’m applying to restaurants and grocery stores for a job. Huge pay cut, yes. But being able to have more personal interactions, physically help out customers in the community, and be on my feet more instead of a computer screen will make such a positive impact on my mental health, that it’s a no brainer for me. This is the best decision for me right now. And it may be for you too.

     Tuesday is here and I've been removed from the group chat but still, no communication as to what my employment status is so I asked my Manager & he says ""give me a minute"". Is this fool trying to get me to quit to avoid having to fork over unemployment? Do they have to explicitly tell me I've been terminated? Do I have to explicitly say ""I quit""?

The call center I work for now only allows bathroom breaks on an actual break (2 15 min breaks and a 30 min lunch all unpaid of course) but I have to use the bathroom a lot bc I have a small bladder and I’ve been this way my whole life, I’ve never needed a doctor’s note to go pee. They told me to get an accommodation from a doctor if I want to be able to use the bathroom while on the clock. I can’t go to the doctor right now because this job makes us wait 3 months to receive health insurance (and the insurance sucks btw). I don’t have health insurance but they expect me to pay outright to see a doctor so that I can use the bathroom. I called a doctor today and they want $150 for an appointment, not even guaranteed that I can get an accommodation to use the fucking bathroom for an 8 hour shift. I have to use the bathroom about 2 times an hour. What tf is this even? Any and all advice is welcome.

9,2024-03-12,I am exhausted,u/Pure-Philosophy-4080,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bdbvfl/i_am_exhausted/,antiwork,"[Firstly, I apologise for this long rant. Please let me know if it’s not the appropriate subreddit to post it.]

I (M,26) live in one of the most densely populated cities in the world. The city is the worst in every possible way: cost of living, air quality, job opportunities—you name it. 

I graduated in 2022 with a major in Journalism, but I started working in 2021. It’s been three years since I entered the job market. Three years! The last job I had, which I left few months ago paid me the equivalent of US$270 a month. $270 for seven hours a day, six days a week, and 26 days a month. If you add the commute, I lost almost 11 hours per day (a two-hour commute for a distance of about 20km). 

Now, you would probably say that in a country in Asia, US$270 might be considered high, but let me give you some context to understand. An Uber ride from my home to my office would cost me at least $5. That’s $5 out of my monthly salary of $270 gone for a single Uber ride. If I take the bus or other forms of public transit from my house, the total commute would cost me around $2 for the round trip from home to my office and back. That’s almost $60 a month for my commute out of my $270 salary. 

While a single person who doesn’t have to bear the responsibility of anyone could manage fairly well on this salary, it’s nearly impossible for a person with a family to bear the cost of living. I live with my parents. My mother is a housewife, and my father is nearing 65 and still working almost 10 hours a day. I am 26 and practically living off my father’s income. If my father loses his job, I don’t know what would happen to us. 

So, in search of a better-paying job, I started looking for other opportunities since September last year. It’s been six months, and I haven’t received a call from a single job prepared to pay me a salary in the range of US$300-350 per month. Most of those who have reached out wouldn’t go higher than US$250. I am just tired and exhausted. I don’t know what the future holds, but it’s ridiculous that in this day and age, when countries boast about rapid GDP growth and companies and corporations set record profits, a 26-year-old adult can’t make a living despite giving almost 260 hours a month at work. And it’s kind of true for almost majority of the city’s young population. It feels like hell.  Sometimes there’s no word I can use to express my frustration with myself. The situation is even worse for many others, as starting salaries at local companies usually hover around $150-180.

I had surgery about 10 weeks ago and have been back at work for the past 5 wks. Despite multiple chances to ask me for this, they are now deciding now is the time to ask me for a doctor's note, which is neither convenient nor affordable for me right now, as I would have to pay for an appointment to get one. I told them that I would try to find the most cost-effective way to do this, and they said “it shouldn’t cost anything”. Personally, I've never been able to get a doctor's note without seeing, i.e., paying for a doctor to see me first.

I am already in debt from my surgery and I can’t afford to make more doctors' appointments. When I ask for more hours, they sidestep the question or change the subject and I get left with 15 to 25 hours a week tops. While they clocked in at 230k last year in revenue and go overseas 2-3 times a year, my fiancée and I are applying for food stamps.

This person has consistently demonstrated that they only think about themselves and it’s incredibly frustrating (not that I would expect anything less from a greedy, hungry “entrepreneur” with less than 10 employees). The very day of my surgery as I was being wheeled into anesthesia, they had the audacity to text me asking me if I would be willing to work during my medical leave. I told them that I would have limited mobility after my two-week medical leave, and that I’d need them to check back in at the 4wk mark. And I thought I had made it clear that, NO, this was not a guarantee that I would be good to go at four weeks; this was a checkpoint. When I informed them of complications that would extend my timeline beyond the 4week mark, they scheduled me anyway and tried to downplay the very hazardous work they were asking me to do. It got to the point where I told them that if they scheduled me, I would resign and it would be effective immediately. I have had to put my foot down several times over these past 10 weeks, and I'm so incredibly tired. 

So Reddit, what do you think I should do? I feel like I’m constantly butting heads with this person; at the same time, they freak out and start choking back tears when I state my boundaries.

Tl;dr. Boss wants a doctor's note clearing me to work, even though I’ve been working and I can’t afford it."

13,2024-03-12,Customer service culture feels like a cult,u/queenoflimons,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bdd17a/customer_service_culture_feels_like_a_cult/,antiwork,"I left my customer service job just over a month ago, and Im transitioning into a completely different workplace that is not customer service related at all. I have been in the customer service industry for 12 years. Different types of jobs customer service related positions that I would hold for 2-4 years on average. From cashier, to grocery store, to barista, to retail, to airlines, not particularity in that order but bouncing around or working 2 jobs at the same time in-between.  


Ive been spending some time trying to reflect and look back on my time in that environment and for once be on the outside looking in. The levels of corruption within the customer service industry is crazy. Currently and my new job, when someone legitimately wants to help me I can't help but feel like they are only helping me because of negative intentions. The first couple times I had received an email about being invited to a scheduled meeting I couldn't help but ask ""what's wrong, what's had happened?"" because I assumed and felt that meetings are only reserved for issuing write ups, suspensions or terminations.   


Looking back I remember some supervisors/higher up roles were specifically hired to issue write ups to your employee file, under the assumption that there's always room for improvement. Looking back I realize these positions were filled just to spend the budget and the people who were in these roles were pressured by higher ups to issue write ups otherwise their jobs are meaningless, even if it meant that they had to make something up. This naturally would pin people against each other and cause fights, leading to more opportunities of events they can write up to bring meaning to their position. Then when your yearly evaluation came along, you would have to explain the mistakes you apparently made and tell them what your plan is going forward to better yourself and the company, and they wouldn't take nothing as an answer, you had to write something down.   


You're constantly lead to believe that minimum wage/poor pay is what you deserve, and you're crazy to ever consider asking for a raise. Leaving on time or ever taking your break in a timely manner, or at all is out of the question because they expect you to dedicate your life to their corporation. They make you out to be the problem if you ever try to consider you're worthy of higher pay or better work life balance. Its more normalized to be scared into not speaking up about issues in the workplace because those who speak up bring upon them problems with higher ups. If you have a VIP from the company coming your constantly micromanaged, more than the usual micromanaging on everything, how you look, what you say to ensure you don't say the truth on how bad things are going. If you even try to vocalize about anything you know severe disciplinary action is coming your way. They expect you to give the illusion that everything is going perfect, and shunned if you think or say otherwise.   


Don't even get me started on the influence of greed and money.. Ill stop here.   


Theres probably a lot more connections to cult culture I could add, but I just wanted to share some perspectives Ive seen and noticed, maybe someone else sees the same thing, or maybe not, who knows"

How to lose an employee and wonder why.",u/TheCrypticEngineer,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bdd9qz/under_staffed_small_pay_increases_and_now_scolded/,antiwork,"I was scolded in a closed door meeting as being a clock watcher. Had to look up if that’s even a thing! Also, a rant.

For some context, I’m an engineer in middle management. I started at this company a year and a half ago in an engineering management position and was told that the team that was under these product lines, that had all quit and moved on, would be rebuilt under me. Of course I didn’t learn that the whole ram had quit until after I took the job. Anyhow, there has been no effort to hire anyone under me, not even an allocation of budget for it. Meanwhile I’ve been getting slammed with an entire engineering team’s work with unrealistic deadlines for a lot of it. Add onto this, I’ve had to travel for work now several times which just puts me further behind.

Despite all of this, I scored well on my performance review. Out of nine categories I scored 1x “below expectations”, 3X “exceeds expectations”, and 5x “met expectations” for an overall satisfactory score, and I’ve been told that I am doing well, but then I was prompted that the engineering team payroll budget will only be going up 2-3% for raises this year, which sucks.

Anyway, rant over.

Today I was as in a closed door meeting where I was called, passive aggressively, a clock watcher. I didn’t even know what that is until it was explained to me. I guess that leaving at the close of business isn’t acceptable and that I’m expected to stay later because I’m in a leadership position. Who I lead is still a mystery to me. Also, taking a lunch over 30 minutes isn’t acceptable. I guess even though I’m in a “leadership position” and salaried, my time at work is being micromanaged. My boss did bring up that I do leave home for days to be on the road for work, and that I work long hours during these trips, but that trailed off so I guess I’m just expected to dilute my effective hourly pay from my salary by just putting in more hours. 

Needless to say I’m freshening up my resume. I’m not in a rush to leave, but if I’m going to be micromanaged, dumped on for workload, and given pay increases below inflation, I’ll have to keep my eyes open for better opportunities."

In the past, before large corporations owned a large share of residential real estate, rentable residential real estate was owned by a large number of moderately well off individuals (as opposed to large corporate entities). In the absence of large companies buying up land, rental properties were cheaper and owning real estate was more affordable.

Now, however, much of the housing market is owned by people who do not themselves inhabit the homes or properties they rent out. Their wealth is earned by collecting rent on the expense of others.

What would it look like if the government were to pass a well written law forbidding companies and individuals from owning over a certain number (say 5) single family units? Would this make the housing market more affordable?

I have a remote desk job. I've been very sick. Tested positive for COVID and it is a secondary infection, on top of this cough I've had for a month. I've been out for a couple of days. I sent an email with a doctor's note today. Later my supervisor called my personal phone saying she had something important to tell me about the company's COVID policy. No ""hope you are feeling ok"" or anything like that. I have a feeling it's going to be an unpleasant conversation. 

In the past she's lied to me about my available sick time and how I was permitted to use it, among other things. She relies on me for a lot deliverables and but weirdly permissive with others on the team that don't turn in nearly as much work. I actually learned a lot from this subreddit and have stopped asking for sick time or providing any information. I just send an email saying ""I am not well and will not be in today"" by email. This worked so much better than what I used to do. She stopped attempting to pick apart my reasons for being out, and would just send a short email response saying she'd see me when I was back. 

But this time I made the mistake of giving more info. Explained that I had COVID, a fever, and some of my symptoms. I felt bad because she had extra work for me to do this week, and thought she might think I was calling out deliberately to avoid it. But now I'm pretty sure giving any details was big a mistake and should have not provided any explanation whatsoever.

I would rather not return calls from work. In my mind, I've sent an email in already, and a doctor's note, and that's enough. Anything else can wait until I get back. Should I call her and deal with it?

I'm afraid she's going to fight me on wanting to take 3 days off in a row. Honestly, I could use the whole week, but I don't feel like the pushback.

I did share this as a comment there, but knew it would be unlikely to get much notice. I have got to know if anyone else has experienced this brand of bs.

I partially dislocated my shoulderwhile sleeping July fourth weekend this past summer.  (I have a connective tissue disorder) and posted a picture of myself in a sling in the ER.  I got a note from the er that I had been seen and that I would return to work on Wednesday with no restrictions listed.  I informed my management and did my best to recover in three days.

When I walked in to work Wednesday morning I was not greeted with any welcome backs, how are you’s or similar.  No, it was, “Where’s your sling.”  So here’s the thing, I did not include this detail in my communication with my management.  It was not any suggestion in my dr’s note.  Yes, I had had my coworkers on Facebook, but had my lists curated for who saw what, but I slipped up on that one post.  It was rude on the managers part, yes the comment was from my supervisor, I could deal.

That was not the end of it though.  There was talk of my not getting my holiday pay because of being out a day that touches the holidays.  Annoying for sure, but something that could be discussed in more depth.

But that was still not end.  HALF WAY through the workday I was called into the branch manager’s office, Human Resources on the speaker phone.  They had been talk and decided that my note was not sufficient, that I should not be working with an injured shoulder in case I re-injured myself and that if I could not get an amendment to my note in half an hour or I would be sent home, without pay, until I was cleared by a doctor.

So I spent my whole time on lunch trying to get this stupid request filled by the er staff.  Of course they had more important things to focus on so I didn’t plead too hard.  So my work day was cut in half.  I tried the urgent care down the road after that, but they of course could not sign off on someone else’s prior treatment.  Which was not exactly what I asked them, but they tried to see if it was possible because their schedule was full and nobody could see me that afternoon to do a full assessment.

So I made calls for a sick appointment the following morning at my primary care doctor.  They were very confused by my request for a note with no restrictions.  She spent five minutes trying to find an appropriate restriction because she was sure she must be misunderstanding me.  She had never heard of this before.  She made me a her own note verifying I was fine to work.  I worked the second half of that day.

So I in the end I lost the equivalent of a day’s work, had to pay for the er copay and the doctor visit copay.  I did get paid for the holiday off in the end, but better you bet I screenshot and printed hard copies of all the versions of my time card where I didn’t.

I started looking for a new job after that.

I applied for over 50 jobs and have done 4 interviews. Last application we met for an HOUR I had to interview with HR person and 2 MANAGERS. With the cherry on top being that I had to wait 14 days before I got a response.
DIDN’T GET THE JOB. And it was in my field of study too.
I don’t want to keep playing this game of monopoly that we call a country. WTF is going on?? What is HAPPENING to us??
HOW can the economy be “doing great” HOW can unemployment numbers matter one iota when having a job rn is literally paycheck to paycheck poverty so shouldn’t unemployment be irrelevant now?
How the fuck can this keep going? Corporations own fucking HOUSES now!! I’ll never get to have a big beautiful wedding or be able to father a child. Entire generations losing the chance to buy a home, suicide numbers are up, ADHD and anxiety disorders numbers are growing exponentially. I’ll never fix my medical issues because it takes 50 hours of insurance homework to find the right fucking doctor. Only to be dismissed with “YOU NEED TO LOSE WEIGHT.” 
There is NOBODY working at ANY fucking place right now!!!! Every single store is understaffed, the vegetables and fruit I buy are terrible and flavorless, the traffic is becoming unbearable with so many fucking angry drivers on the road and horrible infrastructure, every call I make goes through 3 verification codes, 4 robots, 5 departments and 1 answering machine which somehow equals 0 help. Billionaires literally sit on hundreds and hundreds of fantasy wealth that never sees the light of day. 
Our laws only apply to poor people. Our prisons are run for profit. Our hospitals are run for profit.
Nurses went on strike, railroad workers went on strike, teachers went on strike, factory workers went on strike, baristas are on strike, pilots are on strike, autoworkers are on strike, actors are on strike. BUT HEY! THE STOCK MARKET IS GOING GRRRRRREAT!!!’nn

But, that is a recent change. I haven't taken a ""real vacation"" since 2018, when I took a 5-day, nearly bank-breaking trip abroad for a wedding during school summer vacation. Sure, there have been weekend trips requiring a plane ride or a drive, and an extra day off around the holidays, but they've all been very purposeful and not a vacation where you go somewhere just to go somewhere and relax. 

My cousin is getting married abroad this summer and I've been planning the trip with my family for nine months. We were planning on arriving a few days before the wedding and staying about a week after. I was so excited. One month ago, I got a new job, but it is kind of just a promotion—I will be doing the same thing with the same people for the same company, but slightly more responsibility within a different branch of the company and with a new supervisor. I was given the final offer on Monday and told I would be starting on Thursday. Yay! But then I mentioned my trip to my new supervisor and he got quiet...apparently, you can't take any unpaid leave within your first six months on a ""new job"". Even though this isn't really a ""new job"". I do not have enough unpaid leave for this trip and will not be able to go. I'm devastated. My whole family will be going except me. "

People fail to see they don't want to believe
That systems can imprison us and watch as we bleed.
It's a terrible truth, that we are living deprived.
and I find it harder everyday to keep me alive.

Because every single day people want me to grind
But what's the use of this cycle if I'm losing my mind
I got to fight for my life just to get out of bed
I got tons of angry voices screaming loud in my head

I'm not 'extremely driven' I'm 'extremely exhausted'
Got my work ethic kicked out of me by the last dozen bosses.
I'm tired of making wealth just to hand it of to boomers.
I can feel my body breaking in this life of consumers.

I'm tired of being part of this endless craziness
And when people fail to see my pain they call it laziness.
They attribute a character flaw, to a wound I survived. 
Then they come back round just to eat me alive.

We're ravenous beasts, who only just feast.
Devour the young and the old just to bloody our teeth.
Who the fuck said we all need a 9-5
We're unable to live these days, let alone thrive.

So please forgive if I don't decide to partake
In this cancerous lifestyle, where my brain is at stake.
I'm not even living to have a good time
So why is living so expensive? This life is a crime.

I'm tired, I'm beaten, I'm done with this shit.
My last job made me suicidal I should have just quit.
Tell the bosses at the top to suck it as I dip
Don't feed me your lies with the hand that I bit.

But I didn't do it right cause I'm to damned Loyal.
Always sacrifice peace of mind as I labor and toil.
Well fuck that noise, My health comes first.
won't be shamed into playing in the capitalist curse

All my life I was told, it's so liberating, 
buying useless shit, fuck it's infuriating
So many people rise to defend this corporate hell
You're not a capitalist you're capital a product on a shelf.

Unless you got the funds to never worry bout life
Don't go thinkin you understand the wrong and the right
And if you happen to be, one of the well off then
Fuck yourself, with your euros, dollars and yen

If you got enough, and you take a bit more
You're a demon in disguise, a sadistic whore.
Wealth is sin, it's disease, it's inherently rot
to say “I could feed you friend, but I will not.

You see my bank account is growing reaching the skies.
you get to starve out on the streets, until you all die”
The way we live is evil, twisted, makes us all bleed.
We once used to call this life of twisted sin of greed.

But you make avarice a virtue, and worship the buck
then make it impossible for the people to give a fuck
If we don't own a thing? In our own hometowns
Why the fuck should we care, if we burn it all down?

Your house is in cinders? But why should I care?
We were all taught to be selfish, so it's only fair
we revel with the rebels who hate the systems in place
And can see that this system is such a disgrace."

I'm still out of work and awaiting financial benefits from the government to help me survive. Last week, I received a letter from my former employer letting me know that my last payslip had an error, resulting in me being overpaid over £500, and I would need to pay all that money back within 3 months or face court. Bare in mind, my last payslip was October, over 4 months ago, and i have had no income since then. 

I decided to email them explaining my current financial and medical situation, and would be unable to pay back the money, even in monthly instalments. I also asked for all my wage slips as proof I was overpaid (all our wages were done electronically, and I no longer have access to the system since leaving). A few days later, I received an email stating that as a ""gesture of good will"" they will wipe the overpayment and I won't have to pay anything back. I genuinely think me asking for proof caught them out, and they found out they couldn't prove I had been overpaid. This wasn't a small company either, its one of the largest and oldest stores in my country, known for not exactly being very fair to employees or for being very charitable with their money.

So then I proceeded to ask so is this mandatory overtime??? He said no you can leave early tomorrow??? But according to my co workers they stay a lot, with out being asked or told anything.

Last Friday they unilaterally decided to change my work schedule to have me working on Saturdays and Sundays, non-negotiable since I am the only person who can support this project in the company at this time.

The anxiety I am experiencing comes from two big factors:

1. I am an immigrant working in this country and I will have to change from a work visa to a dependent visa which in itself is a whole other thing I will have to manage.
2. Oddly enough I feel guilty or like I am doing something bad by leaving them high and dry since I will need to get my ""release letter"" to be able to move on to my new visa which needs to happen ""yesterday"".

We've had a couple of bad storms this year, just like last year. Last year, when the rain came down on our house, we got a leak in the living room. My dad just ignored it, until the ceiling collapsed. He ignored fixing it for the next 10 months in 2023. 

The same problem has happened again, except this time it's in our bathroom. The ceiling collapsed around the time the California storms came around. We've covered it up for now, but my dad won't be able to fix it for a while. My dad makes $100k/yr. and I've had to loan my dad money multiple times throughout last year and even this year. He's still broke and doesn't have the means to fix it at the moment. He told me that because interest rates have gone up on our house, he is short $1,000 every month.

A week later, our kitchen sinks starts clogging, followed by both of our toilets in the house. My dad got furious. We opened a pipe hole on the ground in the driveway of our home, and my dad discovered that the clog is coming from there up to the street. He says this is a job that he cannot fix and would require a plumber for, something that he doesn't have the money for. 

I am currently under $300, and I won't get my next paycheck until 13 days from now. I was hoping that I could get rid of my credit card debt, but looks like I might need to use it again to help my dad fix our house. This is stress that I don't really need, because I am seeing HR this week to discuss something she hasn't specified with me. Which is extremely stressful in of itself. 

Point of this post is, I hate that my house has so much damage that's on hold for fixing due to financial problems. I am currently seeking a second job as a tutor to see if that can help me save money. I am also looking for a new job that pays me more, and have already applied. But honestly, with the amount of money we make, we honestly shouldn't be crippled by all this debt. "

And I did do better. Improved all my accounts, took on extra projects and kicked ass at them, became a resource for others, and was the sole reason several accounts wanted to come to our team. BIG and obvious changes. At my annual review a couple of weeks ago my manager was downright glowing with the feedback and praised me multiple times on my improvement. But here’s the kicker: “we were told we can’t give 4’s or 5’s”. So I was scored lower on bs categories to keep my score down because otherwise I definitely would have been a 4. And the icing on the cake? My total score was actually LOWER than the year before!

The Insult: I applied internally for a role that was nearly perfect for me, my experience, and my career goals/interests. Except the job description turned out to be a ridiculous oversimplification and the role was much higher up than implied (like a 6 pay-grade jump). After finding out all the extras in my 1st round/pre-screen interview I didn’t think I really had a chance even though I absolutely could do the job. I knew I didn’t have the right things on paper for what they *actually* wanted. But I kept a little hope and followed up in the timeframes the interviewer kept telling me to every time I reached out to see if I’d be going to the next steps (4 more freaking interviews). 4 weeks this has dragged out since my interview and as recently as Thursday was told they’re still interviewing and reach out early this week. WELL, today the posting was taken down. Which thanks to my dogged pre-interview research I know only happens when a person is fully hired and ready to start. Why in the hell tell me to check back this week when somebody was already basically hired when you replied to me?!?!

I sure as hell am not “checking in” and will wait to see how long it takes to hear from them if at all. Maybe I’ll calm down by then but at the same time I’m not too concerned about burning bridges in order to stand up for myself. It would take a miracle for me to even consider applying for another role ever again with this company. 

Sorry this is stupid long but I have to get it out somewhere. I don’t even care if I wasn’t a right fit, I didn’t deserve to be played with like that especially as a current employee. This company is shit all around and I’m just going to have to suck it up and deal with putting myself through the stress of applying elsewhere. “Plenty of room for growth and opportunities to advance your career” my ass.

We have a supervisor who is bat shit crazy and fire hungry towards our union workers for petty things and lies or us constantly.

Every year our contract allows us to choose routes for the year starting in seniority order from the top down. I took a route and was satisfied but it got down to the days where every driver with lower seniority than me were out on their routes but I was still covering other routes to deliver. I ended up filing a grievance for seniority rights and also one for excessive overtime.

The supervisor didn’t like that and one day I was missing a box for a retailer and thought nothing of it because if it was loaded elsewhere in my blowout truck I return later on the pick up and shipment they send out. The time comes to that and the box is missing from the truck so I just kept moving. Eventually the tracking is taken out of my board like it was found on a different route elsewhere. 

The morning after I get issued discipline and threatened to be fired from the same supervisor saying I had a no scan on a box that was supposed to be delivered with him telling me and a union rep that I delivered the box without scanning it. Full blown lie. He said he found the box at the business and he took a picture of it. It was a picture of a broken down box in a dumpster.

I ask the retailer that day if someone in our uniform came to them later on in the day. He told me yes he asked to come in and look at our recent delivery they got that day but he told him they had already opened and processed everything. The supervisor started digging in their dumpster hoping to find so called “no scan” in which the manager told me he saw him say “fuck it” grabbed a random box and took a picture of it and left.

I haven’t spoken to any of my management years because of this."

I applied for this job, listed as full-time. I go in for my interview and tell the owner I can work Sunday-Wednesday, 10hr shifts. The owner says that's great and that the schedule can work. I start there and I'm only scheduled 27 hours. I brought this up to the owner saying this doesn't work and that I need the hours that were promised. He tells me that I'm capped out for hours and that there isn't any more to give. Yet multiple times he told me full time hours and my schedule would work. 

Later that day I asked several of the employees if this was normal and surprise surprise, this is normal  and people have left because of it. All the current employees aren't getting the hours they need except for the two managers.  Also, I was working a 8hr day and I was ready to take my 30min break and I tell my manager. She deadass tells me that ""they don't do 30min breaks"", I told her that that was a labor law violation. She just tells me to bring it up with the owner 

I'm hella pissed about all of this because these hours would put me at paycheck-to-paycheck living. I have a good amount of savings so while I'm still there I'm looking for another job.  I changed jobs because the owner told me my schedule would work. I got so fucked over"

&#x200B;

Work was non stop, calls after work were regular, even late as 2AM. Commute was 2,5h in total, so technically 12h of my day was devoted to work, plus spending time on the phone. 

I have to mention I was 22 when I started, and this continued for 5 years before I decided it was enough. 

I found the exact same job in  a 10 times smaller company. Owner/manager respects private time, there is no 2nd ord 3rd shift, so no calls after work. I even get days off whenever I want to, which was mortal sin on a previous job.

 Everyone is so easygoing, there is no yelling, pressure etc. 

Not to mention I live on the coast.

Problem is, I am completely lost. Most of my days I don't know what to do with myself out of boredom. 

Workload I used to finish until lunch break on my previous job is now the workload I need to distribute through out an entire day. I complete all of my tasks way before deadline, if I even get any. Most of the days I have to give tasks to myself, just to keep busy. 

I got so used to the pressure, that now I don't function properly. My private life also started to suffer, because I used to base all of my activities on my career, and I will dare to say even my personality.

I work 40 hrs in a week or 52 based if I decided to do 12 hours on an extra day.

Sun - Thursday - night shift.

8hrs + 8hrs + 8hrs + 8hrs + 8hrs = 40hrs
$19.70 x40hrs = $788 (before taxes) 
$644.91 (after taxes)

Working a weekly pay. People find that a good thing. But the people I work with are either hired through the company or temp to hire like myself. But those who are full-time employees. They have a better advantage of making more with their biweekly pay. Plus double time. And I know the taxation is higher when doing overtime.

So I say to you just to say this. It ain’t worth working myself to the bone for a weekly paycheck. And here’s why.

Sun - Sat - 7 days a week. Night shift

12hrs+12hrs+12hrs+12hrs+12hrs+12hrs+12hrs = 84hrs 

19.70 x 84hrs = $1654.80 a week. (29.55 OT).

I decided that working myself for 7 days straight for 12 hrs is not worth my mental capacity. That’s where people crash out. That’s trying way too hard to sustain an individual like myself. And for a company that could let me go in an instant if I made a mistake because of my over exhausted body trying to stay afloat. 

That’s it. That’s all I was trying to say. No kids. Just me. And I came to the conclusion on what I need to think over. My mind and body? Or this job using me in any capacity just because they have billions stashed around and doesn’t want to pay their employees worth in this economy?

Fuck it! I choose the latter.

95% of our expenses are things I consider to be necessary, that does include things that we technically can live without but in the way that you can live on 4 hours of sleep.

It's all just food, housing, transportation, utilities, wellness, internet and phone, loans. Everything extra goes to paying off debt and that won't be finished for years.

I live as frugally as I can, I home cook 80% of our meals, I drive a functional 20 year old used car with very little maintenance, we're both healthy and have never had a major medical issue, somehow we even got so lucky as to get our house with 0% interest.

What in the goddamn fuck else am I supposed to do? I feel like I'm barely skating by with a 4 year degree and a nearly 6 figure career. How the fuck does anyone have kids in this environment? 

Even if we wipe out all of our debt we'd go down to $2500-3000, to go any lower we'd have to go down to 1 car (impossible with our current jobs), cut life insurance, grow our own food, get off grid energy like solar panels, rehome the cats.

Ps: the icing on my cake of frustration comes from the fact that the higher ups are mandating us to return to office more days now and in the spirit of feeling ""engaged"" giving reasons for people to come to the office, the boss thinks it's a good idea to eat start eating lunch together and even sent email meeting invites??..it states it's optional but there's obviously a social aspect of it and if i don't go to any of them. ffs i want to use my lunch to destress n leave work for a bit, not awkwardlly hangout w/ some peoplel i don't have things in common with!"

My very first day at 3:15pm I told them “I have to leave to pick up my child”. They looked at me like I had three heads. I reminded them that I made it very clear during the interview process. That I would need to be out ideally at 2:30 PM, no later than 3 PM. Which they agreed to during the interview. Every day, since then I have felt extremely uncomfortable and on edge. I have left relatively on time, but I just felt that it was going to be an issue moving forward. 

My old job reached out to see if I wanted to take my former position back at $2.50 more an hour then what I was making with the place I left today. With scheduling being what I need. Of course, I said yes. 

Went to reasonably speak to the manager of the new job. His reaction was less favorable. He proceeded to tell me how this is the second time this year this has happened. He told me how “frustrating it is” which I told him I completely understand “but this is what’s best for me and my family.” With his reaction, and the way I’ve felt the last week. It was best to cut ties right then. The manager, then proceeded to give me a short lecture on professionalism. In front of the staff. How it makes the person who referred me for the job look “bad“ my response to this was well it should not because this is my decision and my decision alone. 

I feel like I handled the situation as professionally as I could. They wouldn’t have given me two weeks notice if they wanted to find a reason to fire me. Especially during a 90 day probationary period.

""Good Morning,

Just want to send a reminder to please keep compensation and bonus payment information confidential. These should not be discussed with union folks as they do not have this type of program/do not get the same benefits as non union.

Thank you.""

I am purposefully being vague because I don't want my family member to get in trouble for talking about her company's internal emails. I live in the US.

Now, not so much. The owner has started this program to make himself and the office more money and so many things have changed to where it feels more like a corporate setting than a private practice. 

We started having to do calls out to patients to schedule their treatment plans, which is uncomfortable being it a healthcare setting, but I’ve gotten used to doing them. 

Well, now, the new office manager is listening in to ALL of our phone calls and pulling us back randomly to listen to them and give two examples of things we could’ve done better at during that phone call. 

I would be a bit more understanding if they were over the calls we have to make out to patients regarding scheduling their treatment, but it’s not. These meetings are just for our overall calls in general. Is this legal? It feels like an invasion of privacy and makes all of us super uncomfortable. 

There weren’t any complaints about our calls to bring this on, it’s apparently a new system with the program the owner started….."

I literally see and hear (even in movies) about bonuses. Literally have never, ever gotten one. Not once in any job I ever had. 

Annual raises that did not rely on a promotion. Nope. This current job, I got a raise for 37 cents, but that was almost three years ago. Every other job, I only got a raise due to promotion.

Annual promotion cycle. I hear about this from some people. Apparently,  some places have a policy to promote some people once a year for rotating departments? Never seen it. My company actually stopped promotions and only do transfers. 

Christmas break. I get one that is mandatory, but I have to use my PTO to cover it! I know some people have companies that do the same, but they get paid without using PTO. Other times, I just worked.

Competent HR. Nope. Any time HR is involved, it's just a meeting and they shuffle out never to be heard from again. Or they are completely mean girl. No in between. 

Those interviews where you get questions about the actual job itself. Most interviews I do are simply dumb STAR questions or weird culture questions. I never get job competency interviews.

COLA raise. Never have seen it. Convinced it is the same as the Loch Ness and Bigfoot. 

For a negative one... I actually have never gotten a pizza party for merit performances. Usually it's a catered lunch (which IS a step above) or they just did it for a special event (which could be construed as one). But I never had someone come out and say ""you hit x goal, so we are giving a pizza party.""

The basic rundown is that my coworker got a writeup for a couple of bogus reasons. The problem is, he is a very reactive person, so he's been doing everything to get under the managers' skin for it, and threatening them with a lawsuit (he actually does have a lawyer involved). 

The bad news is, they have roped a few of the rest of my team in and given 4 total out of 6 of us writeups for the same things, around the same time. They gave us each a packet with all the ""evidence"", and it's so incredibly shady how they came to a write-up. The discipline ladder goes: verbal, letter, write up, suspension, etc. But they tried to say a general advisement email that had nothing to do with the write-up, counted as a letter. There was no verbal. I'd also like to point out that I'm a good worker. I get my work done quickly and well, and help the others, so there's no reason. 

Thankfully, there's a union involved, and we were able to get it reduced to a letter because the thing they were punishing us for, *they are supposed to do*, not us, according to SOP! But somehow it's still sorta our fault? So the letter stays for 6 months, and they're doing more in-depth training. Which is kind of a win, but this also means they could write us up again if they felt our work wasn't up to standard. 

The thing I keep coming back to is, they *wanted* to write us up, to make it look like they weren't picking on my co-worker, and so they found a technical way and did it. In the multiple meetings I had, every manager was pointing fingers and shrugging, saying, this is just consequences. And I hate that! It feels awful to be a manipulated pawn, and my hope is slowly being crushed under the weight of rampant toxicity and being forced to work every day for them, looking over my shoulder. I want to cry going there. 

Now, the tension at work is so thick. I can't go one day without someone arguing loudly at someone else, including my direct manager, who micro-manages in the worst way. Every. Fucking. Day. It's so toxic and awful. I've been desperately looking for jobs, and I get nothing back, just rejections. I have a master's degree. I have experience. I just can't seem to get out. Be it the economy, something I'm doing or not doing, I don't know. I've updated and streamlined my resume to look nice, gotten it professionally done. Yes, I've done all the ""right stuff"". But nothing. No one cares. 

The only things that bring me joy are my hubs, art, and taking pictures of the cats that free roam my work grounds. The job's benefits are okay too, medical is somewhat affordable. I'm just pretty depressed and I just want to be free of this rampant toxicity. Oh, and my chronic illness is flaring so badly because of the mental stress, so walking after a long day is painful. 

We talk about people being battered by their partners, but no one seems to think daily workplace abuse isn't normal. ""Oh well, that's another day in paradise, LOL"". The supply of bootstraps have run out a long time ago, folks.

For example, I made a small mistake and my supervisor is reminding me of consequences if things go south. Yes I admit I made a mistake already, and we both know it is fairly unlikely this mistake is going to turn into a catastrophic. 

OK here is the deal, **I do not care**. Because my monthly income covers 6 times of my monthly expense, meaning I can survive 6 months with only 1 month of income. Whatever that is management trying to instill fear knowing some staff have a family to feed, have bills to pay, have whatever that is making them keep sucking-up all your management games - **do not apply to me simply because I do not care**.

Deep down I just laugh every time management/supervisors throw me consequences and fears. 

Here's the lesson we all learn - when we have assets/cash and money enough to cover more than 5 years of living expense, NO MANAGEMENT can ever threaten us instilling fears because we just do not care.

Imagine if I'm really need this job to pay bills, I would be very worry every time I make mistakes or supervisors talking-down and instilling fear. 

Now the fun part, management thought it works on me, but they don't know my personal situation, so do not tell them your financial pictures. When management think they could threaten whenever they wanted, **it does not work on me**!"

about a week into my employment, i started receiving rude comments and have been unnecessarily reported a couple times by one of the two HR managers.

it took a lot for me to report this unjust behavior because the manager in question was their first hire and extremely beloved within the dc. she unnecessarily chose me as her victim and i'm not the only one who sees the unjust treatment and rude behavior.

finally, about a month later, i reported it to my manager and they told operations. i told them i didn't want it to be a big deal and i just wanted to be on good terms with the HR manager. they decided that it was a much bigger issue than i was letting on, after explaining the stories, and they want to sit her down and give her a talking to about treating me differently because they don't want that environment within the company. i heavily appreciate the way they are handling it and they have been very respectful about the entire situation.

the day immediately after i reported the hr manager, i was heavily harassed by one of my coworkers. i was cross-training this coworker and, the entire time, he continued to make inappropriate comments about me and himself and explained things he was sexually interested in both regarding me and regarding his boyfriend. i was extremely uncomfortable as he continued to ask me questions about my sexual life and suggest how he could improve it. this went on for about 30 minutes and i didn't really have a way to walk away from the situation given i was training him.

the slew of suggestions on what we could do in that very moment and the comments regarding his abilities made me extremely uncomfortable but i'm not sure if i should report it, at least not now. given that i just reported a manager for treating me unjustly, i feel like i'm gonna sound like i'm trying to start drama. i feel like this is all really bad timing.

what would you do in this situation?

would you report it immediately?

would you wait to report it?

would you quit?

I’m working in marketing and sales, mostly researching new business prospects and emailing. Which I was asked to CC the head of marketing on every single one. 

I was just looking over our contract and it states on the first page that they won’t pay me an hourly rate but instead a contract rate. However, they are paying me $22/hr and it says that on the last page. My Director asks to look over my work which is fine because I’m actually doing it but it says they won’t oversee or direct how I complete the work.

I was already asked if I would work more hours for a few more dollars an hour and I agreed to that. When I asked in an email about it, I was called instead and told he would speak with the CEO about it and get back to me and maybe I could just work more hours for the same pay. I’ve already decided I won’t be doing that until they agree in writing to $25/hr for 32 hours/week. 

Overall the work is pretty easy but they sporadically give me things to do and even though I give my hours for the week on Monday’s to the director, I still get called outside of working hours. It feels disorganized and like he just expects that I’ll be available whenever.

I appreciate any advice!  "

My boss called for a meet-up at a coffee shop, a casual setting for what turned out to be a life-altering conversation. As I approached, he was engrossed in a phone call, prompting me to grab our drinks - a small latte with oat milk for him and tea for myself.

We delved into the state of our restaurant, where I was the GM. The industry's downturn, declining sales, and the recent closure of another location I had been asked to salvage painted a grim picture. Despite my efforts in keeping our labor costs and spending incredibly low, the conversation took an ominous turn. It dawned on me, through his hints about salary cuts and his shift to an owner-operator model, what was coming.

The blow was delivered almost casually - an insinuation about filing for unemployment. I had to pry the confirmation out of him. Yes, I was unemployed, effective in two days. His apologetic tone, mentioning efforts to find me a position elsewhere, did little to soften the shock.

The absurdity of buying him coffee right before being let go still baffles me. His offer to reimburse me at the end of our talk seemed trivial against the backdrop of my sudden job loss and looming financial uncertainties.

I walked away from that conversation not just jobless but bewildered by the lack of directness and the odd choice of setting for such a crucial discussion.

Has anyone else experienced such an unconventional firing? How did you cope with the immediate aftermath?"

1) Our dynamic is inherently imbalanced & exploitative. How is it a full-time job to manage one person, especially when that person is fully capable of getting all the work done independently?

2) My pay has stagnated since beginning here. I got a raise last year, but it was only a few %s and didn’t account for inflation or cost of living increases. I’ve also outgrown my salary at this point, with several people on the broader team noting that I far outperform a typical junior (I’m 25)

3) My manager has gotten to the point where he just waits for me to get shit done so he can sign off on it and then take credit for it. I’m talking everything - even 6-figure high-profile projects. He has little to no notes on everything I submit, and he doesn’t even keep me organized - I have to do that, and then take extra time to fill him in on what’s on our plate every week.

It is true that not all was sweetness and light in primitive societies. Abuse of women was common among the Australian aborigines, transexuality was fairly common among some of the American Indian tribes.

We attribute the social and psychological problems of modern society to the fact that that society requires people to live under conditions radically different from those under which the human race evolved and to be¬ have in ways that conflict with the patterns of behavior that the human race developed while living under the earlier conditions. It is clear from what we have already written that we consider lack of opportunity to properly experience the power process as the most important of the abnormal conditions to which modern society subjects people. But it is not the only one. Before dealing with disruption of the power process as a source of social problems we will discuss some of the other sources.

Among the abnormal conditions present in modern industrial society are excessive density of population, isolation of man from nature, excessive rapidity of social change and the breakdown of natural small-scale communities such as the extended family, the village or the tribe.

It is well known that crowding increases stress and aggression. The degree of crowding that exists today and the isolation of man from nature are consequences of technological progress. All pre-industrial societies were predominantly rural. The Industrial Revolution vastly increased the size of cities and the proportion of the population that lives in them, and modern agricultural technology has made it possible for the Earth to support a far denser population than it ever did before. (Also, technology exacerbates the effects of crowding because it puts increased disruptive powers in people’s hands.

My option is to stay a few months at the cost of my health and try to see if that cert will be granted or just focus on leaving now, as I just can’t seem to stay focused or even care about the work.

SA responded by announcing that a vote for a lockout of all office workers belonging to that union would take place at the same time.

A similar thing happened during a labor dispute last year when one of the larger unions, consisting of mostly lower income workers, planned some targeted strikes but were met with a total lockout on all their members, which made it impossible for them to continue as their strike funds would run out incredibly fast.

I remember being shocked last year, since I had never heard of such a thing. Strikes are a way for workers to bridge the gap of the natural power imbalance between workers and employers, and businesses being able to just stop paying people who are not striking seems insane.

I know this sub, like most of Reddit, is incredibly US-centric and that you guys are getting screwed left and right when it comes to unions, but how is it in the rest of the world? Is this common? The wikipedia article on lockouts only gives a few examples.

So let me give you guys a little backstory. I live in New York where I recently moved to New Jersey. I decided to transfer my teaching licence from New York to New Jersey. However the special education certificate isn’t a standalone in NJ. Which means you need to have additional content in order to get certified. I went through so much in New York to get certified. for my certificate, I had to take seven exams. Once I moved to the state, I decided to get a job at a charter school. I’ve been consistently screwed over by the schools, but honestly, I figured I needed the money. I’m new to the state. Let me just apply so that’s exactly what I did. I was able to get into one, but three months later, I was fired because I was told that I was flirting with people at work(which I wasn’t). After that, I had applied for unemployment thinking that I wasn’t gonna get it, but why not? Two weeks after that I didn’t hear anything from unemployment. I decided to become a substitute teacher for a whopping of $112 a day. I just got a call from the Department of labour stating that I was actually approved for unemployment for the full benefit. I decided I’m going to quit my job. Stay on unemployment since I’ll be making much more and focus on getting my certificate and passing my test. Yep, I did that. I was merely exhausted being a substitute with such little pay. Not to mention there were two children in that room that were actually bullying me. They were calling me bees fat whale et cetera.  I figured why not just take some time to myself too. I’m absolutely exhausted with working and being screwed over consistently. Monday is the exam for the PRAXIS and hopefully I’ll pass because I have a public school waiting to hire me! 

DID I DO THE RIGHT HELP? I feel fucking guilty. This sad part is is that I’ve been paying taxes since I’m 16 and yet I feel guilty."

4,2024-03-13,Is there any scenario where ‘unlimited PTO’ is actually a good deal for employees?,u/peanutismint,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1be3m7i/is_there_any_scenario_where_unlimited_pto_is/,antiwork,"My last job offered unlimited PTO, and as a relatively small company it was relatively easy to take at the quieter times of year. 

Before working there I’d never even heard of unlimited PTO, but moving to the USA from the UK I thought it was a great antidote to the measly amounts of vacation time Americans seem to get compared to back home. 

I know, however, that unlimited PTO gets kind of shit on around these parts. People say it’s not worth it because it actually means you could theoretically be denied ANY time off rather than being “owed” an amount that’s YOURS to use how you see fit, etc. 

In my experience, I could see how it wasn’t maybe as generous an offer as it sounded in theory; I myself probably only took like 3-4 weeks of it total in a year, but to me it was nice to know that if we decided to take a last minute vacation, or if I just plain didn’t feel like going into work one day and wanted to go see a movie instead, it was relatively easy to swing. 

I also saw, however, how people would never dare ask to take time off at a really busy period, and while in some ways this was understandable and you’d just plan for there to be busier and quieter times of year and could expect to work harder in the busy periods and then put your feet up a bit more while still getting paid in the quiet periods, it also took some of the power away from employees. 

I guess my experience has been that it depends how lenient or miserly your organisation is; if everybody is nice and trusts you to manage your own time off effectively then it can be a great perk, but if you’re at an organisation where you’re just a cog in the money making machine then they’ll be a lot less likely to let you take time off whenever you want….

Just wondered what everyone else’s experience has been with unlimited PTO?"
5,2024-03-13,Feeling desperate,u/Imaginary-Garage-456,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1be3mmw/feeling_desperate/,antiwork,"I’ve worked a 9-5 since graduating college 11 years ago, worked part-time thru college and full-time in the summers, worked part-time thru high school and nearly full-time thru summers then, too. Before that was going to elementary school, doing after school activities I didn’t choose, etc. 

I feel like I have never had control over my time. And the last time I had extended free time was when I was three years old. 

I feel miserable. I’m an artist who can’t make art. I feel like I’m dying every day and like I can’t take more of this. I feel like committing suicide would just be my body catching up to the rest of my life. What’s the point, you know? 

The only dignified type of work I can think of for a woman, paradoxically, is high-end escorting, because you can charge $1,000 an hour and work when you want. How fucked up is America that that’s the best way for a working class woman to have a life that feels like theirs? I’m considering trying it, but I have reservations for obvious reasons. 

I just feel really desperate, and I really don’t know what to do. I need to get out of full-time work this year — I’ve told myself that if I can’t do that, I might actually legitimately kill myself by the end of the year. I don’t want to because I think life is beautiful, but why should I go on living if I can’t experience that beauty?"

Well I get in the meeting and my boss not only wants to rescind the offer, but remove me from part time altogether and work on an “as needed basis” like a consultant. He basically quiet fired me. He didn’t say why, just that they were changing direction. Despite talking about our weeks-long developed strategy yesterday and talking as usual about it.

These parents are exploiting their kids, turning what should be a trusting relationship based on nurture and care into an employer/employee relationship. Many of these kids are not being financially compensated for the hours of work they put in. Their privacy is invaded and they are put in the path of bullies and predators online. They often have zero control over their public image and the narratives presented about them. A child cannot meaningfully consent to this, especially when it is their parent pressuring them to financially support their family. 

Furthermore, Instagram in particular facilitates child sex trafficking and porn, with moms pimping out their daughters to pedophiles who can pay for premium ""subscriptions.""

She left the company to work for the competition only to have her new company buy the old one and merge them. She wanted to move up in the company to a management role and they said she would be really good in that role. She applied and interviewed only to be passed over by someone that has field (but no admin) experience. They then told her if she got licensed and did a year of field work they would have a management position open for her. So at 45 years old got licensed and switched to a field role after spending the last 20 years in the office.  Having never having a physical job before she was doing great. She fell down a flight of stairs (on the job) and damaged both legs and was bed ridden for 2 months. Put on limited physical work so she mostly did admin work again. Interviewed 2 more times for the management role and passed over both times. So that is 3 times after doing everything they said she needed to do and getting hurt in the process. It's been 9 months and still has pain in her legs. Today she just got an email that they hired a new manager (again with no admin experience) and guess who gets to train them on the admin/computer systems... That's right my lovely wife. 

If that is not a bunch of BS. She is good enough to train a manager on how to do the office side of their job but who is not good enough now that she has field experience and is licensed by the state to do the job and has all the administrative knowledge. 

Sorry I'm a little bitter for her. I supported her moving to the field work if it got her where she wanted to be, but knowing once they got her in the field there was a good chance they would not let her back into the office. As a field engineer myself that went from the office to field 10+ years ago and McFked my body in the process and now being too good in the field to just be the in house design engineer.

I work around 30-36 hours a week and since January I have accrued 8 hours of PTO. 2 and a half months. So basically once every 2.5 months I get an 8 hour day I can take (or split up into hours etc.). They do allow us to go negative by 16 hours, if we haven't accrued enough time; and unpaid time off is at the discretion of the managers.

TLDR: my boss (the president) is the owners son, and I only ever see him or hear from him when he hands out the paper checks. Never discussing supplies or new hires. 

I've been with this manufacturing company for about 3 1/2 years. As work is hard to find in the area. I started at the bottom, worked my way through the COVID boom, became maintenance manager, and landed where I'm at now. 

The transition from maintenance to ""manager""  happened slowly, as help became scarce, I was forced into the factory to help out until help was Hired. That never happened. Couldn't get anyone. 

Anyway, the last manager quit suddenly and my boss never learned what he did or needed to. That left the door open for me, who knew the floor pretty good, but not the business side. 

This is where it gets frustrating. My boss has become more and more flaky by the month. He used to text right back, then it turned into later in the day, every other day etc. Now I only see or hear from him on payday. If you ask him about anything, from supplies to new hires; He'll either promise to get back with us, or backpedal to a subject change. 

So now at our shop, we are 1 full and one part time employee short, with another leaving soon. So I gotta fill three positions right? I ask if it would be okay to put out a local FB ad. He says sure. (This was payday). I get the ad up and within a week I had 4 applicants, ready to start. For my area this was huge! I was blown away. Thought I'd get one. 

Now I've never been given any hiring or purchasing power, save one card I can use for maintenance stuff, $300 mo limit. (I often double this just for essential supplies). 

Anyway I ask the boss over text, can we get these applicants interviewed and hired? Employee is leaving soon, I want to train them before they leave. No reply. 

Text him 3 times a couple days later. Nothing. 

Couple calls ignored, so I text someone close to my boss, hell, it's been a week, hope he's okay you know? Nothing, no reply. 

His father (the owner) says he's fine. So that means he's ignoring me. 

So I've got this 3 month long raw materials and supplies list, missing 2 people, and losing a 3rd. With an absent boss who can't be bothered, and the owner that couldn't give a rip. 

We should have a crew of 5 or 3 full 2 part etc. 

What are your thoughts? I don't want to quit, I like what I do. "
9,2024-03-13,New workplace absence policy is absolute garbage ,u/bumblebubee,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1be97lc/new_workplace_absence_policy_is_absolute_garbage/,antiwork,"My company decided this year to implement a rule that if someone calls in and it adds up to 40 hours within 12 weeks, you get fired. That’s only 5 days in 3 months! One of my really great co-workers got let go recently because she called in too many times (due to chronic ovary pain). She was in the process of getting FMLA for her endometriosis surgery and they didn’t give a shit or give her any warning. It tears me apart knowing that they couldn’t even make an exception for her due to a medical issue AND THE FACT THEY KNEW SHE WAS GETTING FMLA! 

I really shouldn’t make this about me but I’ve had shitty job after shitty job for basically my whole career life (15 years at least) between multiple jobs. Most jobs before my current one was an issue where my former bosses either micromanaged to the extreme or were so narcissistic that they never looked at their department as a team. Fast forward to now after enduring years of psychological hell I finally got a job where I love my boss but the head manager that runs the place is an ass. He’s the one that went to HR instead of talking to my co-worker first and had her let go this week AND had the supervisor that I got along with really well last year also terminated. I broke down at the smallest thing today before I left work (luckily no one saw me) but I am absolutely spent. If it’s not me the one getting hurt by a job it’s the people I care about around me that are now hurting and it hurts just as bad because I have an idea of what they’re going through. 

How does anyone deal with it? I can’t just switch off my caring/highly emotional nature. It’s hard for me to be happy if the people I care about are getting hurt and their livelihoods ripped away from them with no warning. Any advice is helpful. Please, anything but telling me to get a new job. I just can’t put myself through the wringer a 9th time. It sounds like a lot of jobs, I know but I left all of them on my own accord for various reasons. "

I apologize for formatting I am on my phone. 

I have been at my position for just about 3 years. My boss originally was professional but as he gained rapport with each of our new team things got worse and worse, especially with myself. She and I always got along well, and I received an amount of favouritism that was noticeable among my coworkers. However she started making comments to me when I was around and to my coworkers when I wasn’t around about my looks, what I wore, my weight etc. I am a decent looking man. 

I am also fairly young and inexperienced in a corporate setting so I initially didn’t think much of the attention as I am used to it. Among that, she speaks poorly and down to clientele and says even worse things once they leave the office. She is a terrible micromanager and is terrible at keeping on top of her own tasks at the point where I need to remind her constantly of payables that are due, and need to repeat conversations where she gave me direction multiple times. She’s also spoken down on my relationship and my family. 

This is where it gets weird, recently at a work conference myself and another coworker took a separate cab as I didn’t want to wait for the rest of the crew as I was feeling sick and didn’t check my baggage. We were already waiting for 20 minutes for their baggage, we just decided to leave because I wanted to get to the hotel and relax. 

I immediately got a text saying you could’ve waited, I replied I figured that all 7 of us couldn’t fit in a cab and decided to pay for a cab for myself. 

I forgot about this completely then at the beginning of this week she brought it up infront of everyone in our office and I argued with her saying it wasn’t a big deal and that I don’t know why she’s upset. She then said 2 of the other directors were upset with me and my other coworker ( I asked them and they said they didn’t know what I was talking about and were never mad at me. ) she then asked to talk “privately” later but didn’t bother closing the door and everyone in the office heard it. I then brought up how she disrespected me infront of many of our coworkers and if she had an issue I prefer that it would be a private conversation. She looked like she was  about to cry. 

The next day she sat in her office with the door closed huffing and puffing and pouting around the office. 

I made a meeting with HR/ upper admin to discusss the issue and get it in writing. I want to tell them all the issues but I am worried about how it will go. I guess I just need advice and a place to vent. 

If you made it this far thank you, and please send some advice."

I work remotely at a small e-comm start up with no HR. I had no interaction with the CEO prior to my promotion. 

I am supposed to be an Operations Specialist. My CEO has me functioning as a personal assistant/catch all and piles on tasks outside of my scope and pay grade constantly. When I don't know how to do something,  like web design or IT for example, I'm expected to google it and teach myself. All while meeting tight deadlines. He also harasses and micromanages me constantly, even though he's passing me things because he doesn't know how to do them himself. He also tries to Slack huddle me after hours and on weekends, but doesn't bring it up if I ignore him after hours which I always have. 

Everyone else in the company communicates via Slack channels and DMs in writing, but my CEO will only communicate via Slack huddles and Google Meets. I cannot quit until I have alternative income lined up but am becoming increasingly stressed as this goes on. 

I think I may have a shot at unemployment in my state under  this being a hostile work environment where I cannot complete my tasks because they are out of my scope. I may be wrong, but I'd like to have evidence. I would need to record our conversations because he refuses to put anything in writing. He says so much out of pocket shit on these calls and yells at me as well. 

Alternatively, as a dick move, I've fanticised about quitting and registering the trademarks for the brands he owns because he's never bothered to do so. Then sue him or make him buy them from me. Haha. 

Anyway, I may be off base with my chances of landing unemployment but the job market is rough and I want to try everything I can to get out.

Hi! So I will tell both sides of the story because it is only fair.  
I recently changed my schedule to accommodate for school. In addition to that, I’ve called out about 3 times in the last 3 months due to an ongoing health issue and lack of available staff to cover at my job(my employer does not specifically know what the issue is and does not require a doctor’s note).   
I had a coworker available to cover my shift tomorrow and my manager told me I wasn’t allowed to get my shifts covered from this point moving forward because I was getting my shifts covered too frequently. I have to work every single shift and if I miss one, then they said I would be terminated. I was also told to include the business owner on emails concerning me getting coverage or shift swaps.   
In comparison, I have a coworker who has called out about the same amount of times as I have and frequently leaves early. This is also not a company rule. This policy only applies to me.  
I live in an at will state. 

Now: 

I emailed my manager this morning and asked for clarity on the policy because my coworker and I were discussing a shift swap prior to the policy being applied to me. I expressed confusion and asked her to clarify. I was terminated an hour after for not cc'ing the business owner on the email. I said I didn't see how that was correct because the email was concerning a policy that only she and I discussed last night and was not regarding me finding coverage or switching a shift. 

Do I have any legal ground here? Because this termination seems unlawful."

It's a basic income program funded with tax incentives for ""butts in seats"" designed to keep us busy so we don't have time to organize against the system. The rich know that office jobs contribute almost nothing to society but they continue to hire people for them because it keeps us too busy to rise up against the system.

This is also the reason corporate wants everyone in the office. It's not about productivity or office culture, it's about monitoring you and keeping you too busy to have a life of your own. It's about promoting unnecessary consumption by keeping you too tired to do things for yourself. 

We already know the 40 hour work-week is not efficient, but our mistake was assuming efficiency was really the goal. RTO makes it clear they don't care about efficiency, they just want to control you. "

I not only have to do the physical work I have to do the job of a secretary, parts manager, and parts retriever. HR approached my supervisor about me taking more than one trip a day to the parts store and wants to sprong a surprise meeting on Friday, i only know this because of the great supervisor i have. I don't have the work space to tear down 5 or 6 projects at one time and then go parts shopping. The shop has 2 bays. So I try to limit what I have down and I try to prepare for each repair but I can't possible anticipate everything. This kinda feels like micromanagement because before I started the fleet went from having a very terrible hire that neglected his mechanic duties and stole from this company often and then after they fired him they went without a mechanic for a year or two. I just came up on my 2 year anniversary and for the first 16 months I worked 12 to 17 hours a day many days and nights to get their fleet back in shape from the neglect and get ahead of the curve. I successfully got ahead of the curve and now it's more preventing than responding, but I cant anticipate for everything. In my last review I received a raise, a thank you for taking such good care of the fleet, and a request for me to spend some money in our budget on stuff I wanted or needed (tools, etc)  before the end of the year because I had kept our costs low. Now I'll admit I don't always get to just take 1 trip to the parts store. Our HQ is 5 minutes from all 4 parts stores and I try to limit my trips to 1 or 2 a day. However, there are days that I end up going out 4 or 5 times depending on different reasons but I do try to plan them around lunch or use our most fuel efficient vehicle to make up for it. Is this micromanagement? How do I proceed? It's got me aggravated and I fear this may impact my work ethic negatively and I hate that because outside of this and one other big incident I've pretty much enjoyed working here. 

TLDR: After performing well for 2 years I feel like I'm being micromanaged and I'm not sure on how to proceed"

My boss is cold, dameaning, rude and is a control freak. I have a panic attack every time I think about going to work or at work.

I have stood up for myself a lot (I hate confrontation so this takes a lot) and just typing this out makes me stressed since I’m just thinking about the job. 

The only reason I’m considering staying:  I was going to use this money to pay for my boyfriend’s 30th birthday party in a couple weeks. (We just moved back home from another state so money is tight). We already sent out invites and made recreations and when I told him I was thinking of quitting for how bad the job is, he got upset because we would have to change plans since I would have less money if I quit now then if I stuck it through until the end of March. I understand why he doesn’t want to change everything because people are driving a few hours away for his birthday and he wishes I figured out I wanted to quit before we finalized plans. My boyfriend also has been having a hard time finding a job. I’m not if sure my mental health can take this for that long. Advice? "

I just want to rant. The startup company that I am working for told us that last Thursday that they failed to secure an investment in which resulted to us getting laid off. I have worked for four years there and given that it's my main source of income, I am really saddened.

No hints about lay off was given to us. A few months ago, they shared that they are applying for an investment grant and they did not tell us that the grant might make or break the company. So we really don't have any idea that we're going to be laid off few months later.

No severance pay. They said that they're still going to pay us for a month's worth. However, it's been a week since we're told about the lay off and they still don't have a specific date for our last day of work. It's really unfair because our pay period is every 24th. Beyond 24th, I will have no means of income. 

 I can't really focus on finding another work if I still have responsibilities. I wanted them to offboard us as soon as possible. And if it's not this week, I will no longer go to work."

I finally quit when an absolutely terrible person took over as president and promoted someone who everyone hated to be my manager. I am so grateful I got out of that place and was determined to cleanse myself of that toxic energy. 

Fast forward nine months, I’ve given away all the cheap swag, blocked all the employees from contacting me and stopped checking the website and social media. The last step was to transfer my retirement funds from the company bank to my personal bank, something I did recently with a different job and it took 3 days.

I work for a multi national company performing construction consulting, architect and engineering. I was offered a mechanical engineer position when joining the organization. My offer letter clearly states mechanical engineer as the position. I found out that the HR states my position as mechanical designer which has significantly less salary requirements. I think it is a plot by the HR to not increase my salary next year. 

Being an individual on a h1b work visa, the visa documentation was performed with mechanical engineer as the position title. I recently found out that the HR had incorrect position name in my offer letter. This has resulted in incorrect immigration documents being filed with USCIS. 

How should I speak with HR to keep my position title the same as my offer letter? 
Is HR allowed to change position title without notifying the employee ?
Is it legal to change position title without notice?

Could someone please help me.

Before I go into the abuse, I want to say I worked almost 60/hrs a week on salary for this company making 30k a year. I was one of their best employees and was consistently told so. 

Now, for the story.

My boss groomed, manipulated, love-bombed, & gaslighted me for the purpose of using me for his sexual gain. And he enjoyed it. He took pleasure in me being sexually violated & controlled by him. He engaged in humiliating sex acts without my consent.

He texted me during work making light of what he’d done. He whispered things in my ear. When he noticed I was upset about what had happened, he tried to convince me I was upset because “I’d cheated on my boyfriend”. He told me I was overreacting. When I told him I was going to report, he shamed me saying things like, “Why would you do this after all I’ve done for you?”

For months leading up to the assault, I was so confused. We were really good friends, but he kept making unwanted advances toward me. I wanted to be his friend, but I also wanted him to stop. And I felt incapable of stopping him. 

I would tell him to stop bringing me breakfast everyday, paying for my drinks, telling me he was in love with me, etc. He would stop. Then he would start again. For those who have never experienced this, it wasn’t like I could just get up and leave. He was my boss. Who was I supposed to tell? We didn’t have HR. I did not trust the CEO to help me. She was good friends with him. 

A week after the sexual assault, I reported it to the co-owner. I believed that she would help me get out of the situation. She told me she believed me, that it would not effect my job, and that I could stay at her house if I needed to. 

After I reported, the owners brought in an outside HR company and within 3 days of reporting - they fired me. 

I sat in the owners office while they blamed, confused, & reprimanded me. They said I was gossiping in text messages between my boss and I. She said I should have told them sooner. She said I had violated a bunch of clauses in the company handbook. I could tell she was way more mad that I was coming forward about being sexually assaulted than the fact that I was sexually assaulted. 

Up until a few months ago, I really believed deep to my core that it was my fault my boss had raped me. That is due to these women suggesting it was my fault. They broke my spirit. They all broke my spirit. 

Why didn’t I tell? Why didn’t I leave? Because I was being abused. Understand the crime. Understand the trauma. 

I later found out that after firing me the owners lied to the whole staff saying my boss and I had an affair. They said we were doing drugs on company time & sneaking away to have sex. 

I can’t put into words the deep anger and unbearable grief I felt when I learned that. My brain now understands evil at a whole new level - but my heart never will. 

Unfortunately, my story is NOT exceptional. I know more woman who have been raped than not. 

The abuse I endured from my former boss will take a lifetime to heal and process. It is burned into my memory. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.

The response of those in leadership and power above me who I thought would be my greatest advocates sometimes hurts more than the sexual abuse I survived.

I know this same situation would happen at many companies. Do NOT work hard for a company that we know wouldn’t even protect you if you were abused & will actively add to your trauma by FIRING you for being SA’d. "

With the degree I moved to another position with more responsibilities and higher salary.
After 7 years working full time and extra hours I needed a break. Company refused (never had more than a week off a YEAR). I resigned on good terms. Took a month break. Then started looking for office jobs again. Didn't find anything so I started working in retail while I still apply to jobs. 
One year is passed and I'm still working in retail. I got some office offers but the salary is even lower than my actual retail job and there's no room for promotion. I live in a rich metropolitan area, salary are high but also the cost of life.

I got my two office jobs by applying directly to the company but nowdays this is not working for me anymore, even now that I have the degree and more experience. I also contacted several recruiters but they send me offers that were simply ridicolous or ghosted me before even doing a practical exam. 

I really can't understand, I've always worked in big companies, full time and with excellent results, I'm shocked to be blocked in a dead end job.

1) How you get qualified office jobs? 
2) Except the degree and the experience, what company are looking for because I'm getting crazy, 7 years are 7 years. And the degree was so expensive."

""What do you do?""

Implying, what is your job, what is your academic plan, what is your goal? All of these describe how a person plans to interact with and contribute to a system that fails so many of us, as well as the planet at large. And often I find, this line of questioning doesn't tell me anything particularly interesting about the person. When what I really want to know is their passion. 

I like making friends and I love activities outside the house, when I meet new people, I want to know if they do as well, and what activities they like to do. I've made a conscious effort to ask people ""How do you spend your days?"" Instead of ""What do you do?"" to give people that breathing room to tell me about something they're actually interested in. For many people, the answer is still regarding their job, that's simply how many of us spend the majority of our energy, it's the interesting thing happening in life.

But, for some people, people like me, their job isn't a big part of their identity and certainly not something to make small talk about! I would rather hear about your new dog, the DIY project on your house, that kayaking trip from last spring, your mom recovering from chemotherapy. 

""How do you spend your days"" Is a question coded for the American Capitalist mind, but it gets the job done, it asks the question: ""What do you love in your life?"""

We have a capital taxation of nearly 30% - but only for residents. Meaning, if you're living in a different country and collect dividends and/or interest here you don't pay taxes on your gains.

What makes me furious: your personal income tax (on your labor) can be up to 42%.

So why tf is labor higher taxed than capital gains - something you don't have to work for at all?

I’ve been at my job for about a year, and was hired for a role I was very qualified for if not overly qualified for. My boss, HR, and leadership all reassured me I would have room for growth because the company is small and scaling quickly.

For the last 6-9 months I’ve been repeatedly promised a title change and change in duties to a more senior role. It’s never panned out.

All the while, my existing duties and responsibilities have been chipped away at. Without being too specific, I will just say that AI has taken on a huge role in the work that I do and the company is using it A LOT. So I also feel like I’m being replaced with AI in real-time.

It’s a tough economy and I’ve been trying to get another job for months - it’s not happening. I’ve been honest with my boss about my discontent and frustration.

Why is it that people on diets have to make comments to you? 

I got some stick from someone who has since moved on to pick on someone else instead, after someone else told her to leave me alone as I said she was pissing me off.

But today surprisingly, a woman who I thought had more tact not only told me that I eat too much chocolate but that she’s going to bring a healthier lunch in for me. I told her no about seven times and she finally got the message. 

Then she told me I’ll kill myself if I carry on the way I am? 

She is 2 years older than me. 

Than told me about her dietitian. How she’s constantly tired. 

Ok I’ve been depressed so I haven’t washed my hair in a week. But I brush it and it’s in a neat ponytail. It doesn’t look greasy, just like I’ve not washed it.  She told me she’s going to slap me if I don’t wash it tonight as it “looks unprofessional” and that people look at me because of it.

I am posting this on behalf of my wife. My wife recently joined a LED billboard manufacturing company as a technical sales specialist and has passed her 90 day probation period. Initially, when she joined, it was not mentioned that she would have a sales target but now her manager is pressuring her to meet impossible sales target. As winter is a down season for billboard installations, she is unable to make a sale as of yet. 

Her manager is insulting her in front of everyone during weekly meetings. He is also pointing out every little mistake she made in front of everyone. Although she has rectified all mistakes he is always trying to deliberately find one even she has one. He does not let her speak at the meetings to share her perspectives on the way she does her calls/emails. Her manager is guiding her to do a thing, and when she does it the way he has asked her to do it he starts screaming at her saying this is not the way he asked her to do it. He is being a hypocrite, and also refusing to guide her. Her sales manager is also being uncooperative and has said things like “you are a donkey”. When she went to ask for help and guidance, both the sales manager, and the general manager refused to guide her.

I know she is a diligent worker, and I know it that she is a smart person as well. she is trying her best to make a sale but it being winter it is making it difficult. These rude behaviour at work is taking a toll on her mental health. She wants to quit the job.

But now, here is the thing we recently got mortgage approval, but yet to close the deal on the house. if she loses her job or quits it right now, it will definitely impact us negatively. We have already put in a down payment of 20 K for the house. If she loses or quit her job right now, we will lose the deposit and the mortgage and I don’t know what complications we might face.

I am not sure why they are being so hostile at work with her. Maybe this is a buildup to fire her? If you loses our job, we are doomed. We still have 2 more months to go for the possession date of the house!

I am asking everyone here to give us some advice on what should be our next course of action?

So I’ll be using all of my pto balance (and probably go negative) to take a day to grieve and then another 2 to travel to and from the funeral. 

Then I saw the next section that stated maternity/paternity leave is ONE DAY. 
So the company will give you 8 hours of paid time off and then expect you to be working or using pto.

This is crazy. And we all get huffy about this stuff, take a “well nothing we can do about it! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ “ attitude and then continue to accept the suffering.

It’s not a mystery who complained; one of which is my team lead who consistently and on a daily basis is short, rude, and hangs up mid-sentence on me to the point I’ve had patients and nurses make comments about how she talks to me over the devices. 

He told me I *need* to work on sounding *happier*. Happier. I work in an environment where people are literally dying and me sounding annoyed when I have 12 patients left to do at 6:20am when I’m suppose to leave at 7:00am, with no help in sight, being rushed, some nights have barely a single break to pee let alone relax, being yelled at by patients, and getting calls every 5 minutes to add patients to my list plus being asked “how am I doing” by the team lead; is apparently more pressing than my actual work? 

We’re so short staffed on every shift and are struggling to get things done on time but me sounding happier is apparently a pressing concern? "

1) am I being an asshole for refusing to leave and stay at work just hanging out for 8 hours? All my PTO is allotted for the year and I’m not giving up vacations or losing pay.

2) I’m assuming this will drag for the rest of the week, can they force me to leave (paid or unpaid)

This is happening in Michigan btw.

Also very irritating that they don’t even have the decency to let us know before we commute to work.

6896,2024-03-14,My old boss has reached out to my new employer,u/AddendumInevitable87,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1beq8eq/my_old_boss_has_reached_out_to_my_new_employer/,antiwork,"I left my old job last year. Worked there for a decade, and for a multitude of reasons I left. It was a quiet resignation. Several other staff members left around the time when I did. They cited the same issues I was having, because they were universal and deeply entrenched systemic issues with management that affected everyone. So the conspiracy theory was born that I was some sort of a leader of a rebellion. I didn’t put up a big fuss despite the fact that it was such an awful place that treated staff horribly. I put my resignation letter on her desk, thanked her for my time there and left. Haven’t said anything to anyone about the shit show it was. Was it tempting to write up a huge detailed post and plaster it across social media, warning every person to stay away? Sure. But I’m not an idiot, and I realize that would cost me my credibility and the chance to find a new job. It simply wasn’t worth it so I just moved on.

I started going to therapy for the things that happened there and learned to let a lot of it go. Since then I’ve gotten a new job in a field I’m excited to work in and I’m very happy. Things have gotten a lot better for me, while from what I hear the old workplace is still a nightmare with many disgruntled employees. 

My new boss came to me yesterday and told me that something weird had happened and she wasn’t sure wether she should tell me or not. Well I guess a whole eight months after me leaving, my old boss reached out to new boss through email and asked if they could meet up. She wants to discuss me and the things I’ve supposedly been saying about my time at my old job to members of the community. I’m furious. I haven’t said anything, and thankfully my new boss knows that. She wrote back a polite but confused message telling my old boss that I have never said disparaging things about my past employment. 

One of the many reasons I left was that her actions were frequently beyond inappropriate, and this is a perfect example. I feel as if I cannot get away from this woman. I wasted a decade of my life trying to make a difference there, and now it feels like I have a crazy ex trying to sabatoge me. I just want to be left alone and to be happy at my new job. My old boss has now made the safe and happy place I found for myself uncomfortable and put my character into question."

Yelling  about being 'disrepected' and the like.  My advice is always 'document, document, document' and to inform their mutual manager,   which SO has done, and it keeps happening.  Usually what precipitates the outburst is the offender comes in late (2-3 hrs late), SO has pitched in to help pick up the slack.  I suspect the offender is attempting to gaslight and distract from their own poor performance by claiming 'disrepect' and making a show of it.  

At what point does SO escalate beyond her mgr, and when does it become a hostile work environment-type situation?  This has happened at least 5 times over the past 12 months and many times prior.  All documented.

I suspect the offender may have some mental health and/or substance abuse issues. While SO and myself are both empathetic, there's a point where action must be taken.  

Neither of us think SO should have to look for employment elsewhere as a result of this, but that's what it's coming down to.

It wasn't my dream job, but my coworkers were kind, the pay was good and the work wasn't too demanding. Unfortunately, like many people in the tech sector and adjacent sectors, I was let go at the beginning of February. The severance package was minimal, but it wasn't nothing, so I took that as a win. This was also the fourth round of layoffs our company had executed over the past year, so I wasn't entirely surprised. Now I find myself unemployed and back on the job hunt, here's where I'm at so far.

Largely, this experience has been incredibly liberating. I recognize the privilege in that statement, and while that is certainly a part of my relaxed attitude, it's also worth mentioning that I've been smart with my money, saving it in effective ways. I also live with my partner, who works an hourly job, and together we have relatively few financial responsibilities, other than our two wonderful cats.

Over the first few days, maybe weeks, I found it difficult to uncouple my definition of self worth and productivity from having a job. I've always been a firm believer in work to live, vs the alternative, but I found myself in a depressive state after losing my job. In recent days and weeks, I've been able to totally abolish the idea that being unemployed makes me less than others. 

I've been able to refocus my energy on what really matters to me - taking care of my body, growing as a person, spiritually, intellectually, physically, spending time learning skills I want to learn, and that will help me secure my next role, and spending time in nature which is extremely important to me. I spend about two hours a day working on cover letters and sending out applications, shooting for at least two or three applications each day. I haven't heard back from anyone, but I know the job market is tough, and I know it's early, so I'm staying optimistic.

Despite all the positives, this has come with an undoubted amount of fear and anxiety. I'll lose my benefits at the end of the month and will have to go on COBRA, which is wildly expensive and I'm endlessly frustrated by the healthcare system in America. On top of this, my partner and I have had a cross-country move planned for around six months, long before I was laid off, that we plan on following through with. 

All in all, the experience has been largely positive and has allowed me to grow a lot as a person. I'm excited about what the future will bring, despite the anxiety and challenges that will come with it. I'm prioritizing finding a job that I find meaningful and impactful. 

I wanted to share all this, partially for myself, but also to provide hope to others. Please make the best out of bad situations. It will get better and we will get through this! All love."

Literally my second day on the job, the supervisor sent me home over some BS. Petty stuff really.. She literally told me “go home” I smiled at her and said are you serious?? I called her superior which is the guy who hired me and told him I don’t think it’s fair she’s sending me home on my 2nd day of work over some bs.

What’s worse is when you’re working a job that sucks but then you have that person that makes it suck even more!! That shit is so draining. Kinda makes some people wink out I bet. 

I’ve worked so many bs jobs in my life, worked with so many phony ass people, and from the first few days on the job I can already tell if I’m gonna last or not. 

Some people say “Oh, just brush it off” “Oh, that’s every job” and it’s like NO. Not everyone wants to put up with bs at work. B*ch ass supervisors plotting and micromanaging every little thing you do etc. 

It usually leads to you being thrown under the bus and fired anyway. It’s all bs. That’s why at this point I don’t even care. I dismiss myself right away and let the employer know this ain’t for me.

2,2024-03-14,About to get fired,u/ComradePigTails,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ber5g3/about_to_get_fired/,antiwork,"I’ve been having a lot of mental issues for the past year and a half where it is affecting my ability to work. I have been put on medication to help with my recent diagnosis, but I’m still having a hard time. 

Recently I got out on probation because of my attendance. I was told my performance was not in question because I’m a good worker, but that my tardiness and excessive call outs have put me in this position. While I understand it’s important to be on time for work, sometimes I’ve overslept from my medication making me drowsy or just not getting enough sleep the night before. That is totally on me, I’m not debating that.

The thing is though, that I’m using sick time for the days I’m missing. I’m not outside of what I’m allowed to use for sick days or personal time due to being sick, but they are on my case about it. I don’t see how it’s ethical to be put on probation for using sick time. I get that it is partially because of some late days, but they actually sighted the fact that I have missed time as well. And again, used my EARNED sick time.

What’s the point of having sick days if you can’t use them? Almost as if they want me to ask for permission on the days I’m sick whether or not I can actually be sick this day.

Now I just had a meeting with my immediate boss this morning and her boss because they are now questioning my performance. I’ve been with the company for 3 years. My performance has never come into question, only now because they say I’m using too much sick time are they watching me closely.

They have said my performance on certain projects has been down by about 50 percent, I work in a call center and they track this by the number of calls we make from reports. It was a big discussion about me not making the appropriate amount of calls in the allotted time and missing other phone calls that I was also assigned. Basically they are scrutinizing my work at this point. I informed them of the reasons my calls were down which stems from being put on a project that I haven’t had much practice with, so it takes me a little longer to do these tasks. I have told my manager on several occasions that I needed more time to work on this project, only to be ignored.

I haven’t been officially been put on a PIP, but I was basically told that they will continue to monitor me and that next steps would be a performance review period.

I now know that everything I do will be put under a microscope and even the smallest misstep will be held against me. They are trying to get rid of me. Maybe they are hoping if they hound me enough and make my work life miserable I will just quit. I won’t give them the fucking satisfaction.

I’m going to continue to perform the way I do because I know I’m a good worker and let them nitpick me, which they will, until they fire me. I will then apply for unemployment until I find a new job. Fuck them. Fuck corporations. I’ve literally never been on a performance review or on probation from a job in my entire life. I’ve never, ever been fired from a job before.

I realized I should have applied for FMLA or something to help me, but it’s too late now. I honestly don’t give a fuck. I have always hated this job, I feel like a piece of shit working for this corporate conglomerate in a field that I know does a lot of harm to people. I’ll honestly be glad to be fired from here. I’ll wear it like a badge of honor that I was rejected from a company that I despise so much.

I’m updating my resume and I have a plan in place to work with a friend for awhile after this so I’m not that worried. I’ll be screwed without insurance as I need to be able to afford my meds, but there isn’t much I can do about that. Hopefully they aren’t too expensive out of pocket while I wait to get insurance again.

Anyway, I just wanted to share this. I hope your work or anti-work day is going well."

I’ve been struggling with burnout, fatigue, cptsd, increasing anxiety and depression, adhd for the past few years. As well as a handful of health issues. The last several months it’s been brutal. I recently asked for accommodations so I could work from home more often. I currently go in-office once weekly as well as special events throughout the year.

She said something at first okay in response and then proceeded to smile and say ""Well have you seen him run? He runs so fem.""

My face for real went from 😁 to 😐 so fast because... what? 

Shes chuckling and directs a question at her co teacher (i am not her co teacher, we work in separate rooms but interact on the playground) ""No really! Have you seen how he runs up to [students name]?"". 

I was a bit taken aback as she looks around to confirm hes not there. She then ""runs like him"" waving her arms around very dramatically and making noises. It was a ridiculous display. Making fun of other adults, especially the parents of our students is so inappropriate. He probably runs that way to be silly for his daughter. I couldnt imagine if i were him and found out my daughter's teacher was speaking of me like this behind my back. The other teachers seemed a bit amused, but i was just offended on his behalf.

I'm a low-level employee working for an international company in Recruiting. My title is not Recruiter, but I do half-recruiting and half-coordinating. I have no KPIs or hiring goals. I'm just letting yall know this to stress that I am truly the lowest-level employee within this department.
However, management continues to give myself and my other Coordinator colleagues KPIs that don't seem at all relevant. Last year, they had us sign up to lead a ""Lunch & Learn""- a practice that I am full heartedly against because why the fuck would I ever eat lunch and work? I obviously did not sign up for this but I did conduct trainings. The year before, Coordinators didn't have anything like this. No leading meetings, nothing. But Recruiters do have to choose to lead one of our Bi-weekly meetings, and also present a DE&I and Safety Moment during these meetings at least some point during the fiscal year.
We recently furloughed most of our team. Now, only 4 recruiters and like 7 managers, and 3 coordinators, so I have a feeling that Coordinators will now have to lead Team meetings as well.

I'm not fucking doing that. I would rather miss out in the KPI target than lead a meeting.

Any idea if I should be concerned about receiving a write-up? Is there anything I can say to let them know that I'm not comfortable leading a meeting? I hate all this fluff. These meetings are pointless, especially now that they've laid off more than half our team. It's BS and I'm extremely salty."

My boss's departure led to my immediate supervisor taking a turn for the worse, making the work environment increasingly challenging. She has become unpredictable, often changing her mind without warning and lacking a coherent strategy. This results in me having to pivot frequently, discarding work based on her spontaneous requests. Despite my efforts to meet her demands efficiently and the positive feedback I receive from clients for my helpfulness and technical skills, she denied my request for a raise. She justified this by saying I hadn't made a significant impression, a response that took me by surprise given my commitment and achievements. 

Moreover, my boss has been extensively involved with various consulting firms, causing further disruptions and pulling our team in multiple directions. In an attempt to better cope with the situation, I've tried to understand her viewpoint, realizing that frustration and passive compliance were detrimental to my mental health. It became apparent that she allocates nearly all her day to participating in sales and marketing webinars related to consulting and software. This obsession explains her frequent claims of being too busy to follow through on her responsibilities.

Given this backdrop of unpredictability, lack of recognition, and my boss's diverted focus, I'm at a crossroads. What steps should I consider next?"

Currently stumped.,u/HatFun5975,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1betpuw/currently_job_hunting_and_i_think_my_old_job/,antiwork,"So context - I have 7 years of experience as an IT business analyst. My last role, which lasted 3 years might as well have been a software dev role because I eneded up getting pushed into it almost immeadiately (1 month in) and trained by the team because they needed an extra person and I was willing to learn for no extra pay. (I should not have allowed in, I know now in retrospect)

Before I was unofficially recruited and trained by a senior dev and his team, I was going to get onboarded and trained by the IT analyst I would be replacing. She ended up no-showing the day before my 1st day on the job and my manager said she quit despite a 2 weeks notice. In that entire month, no one ever trained me or got me involved in any projects. I would ask and get told to wait and go fetch some coffee or refill the printer. It sucked.

I had requested a job title change from my manager a couple times during this job and he would agree that it would be appropriate since my job responsibilities changed drastically from what I was hired for,  He would always say ""Yeah sure, I will get it done"" and it never happened and my contract ended.

&#x200B;

Now present day...

I really enjoyed that job and was excited to be looking for an actual role in software development and now I'm realizing that I might have been screwed over by my last job title since IT BA is totally different from software development on paper. I have no clue where to go from here especially since the ""entry level"" job requirements ask for 3-5+ year of experience and from my resume, it looks like I have 0. 

My past employer also prohibits their current employees from being references cuz of my contract so I feel like I don't even have anyone to vouch for my experience. My degree is in a whole different field as well (Bio) so that won't work in my favor either. Hell I'd work for free even just to stay in that field because I realised how miserable I was working as an IT BA in older jobs and the thought of staying in that dead end field sucks. But I can't even take on an apprenticeship or internship because I'm not in college. I feel like such an idiot for being taken advantage of.  


Is it a lost cause?

Would my job title really matter much or would my only option be starting over my entire education to actually qualify for a software dev job?"

Post Body:

Feeling undervalued has become a recurring theme at my job, and there are two major issues that really highlight this problem.

First off, I’m not a full-time presence in the office, only coming in on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Given this arrangement, I've repeatedly asked the team to inform me of the following day's schedule by 5 PM, since my availability can vary greatly (9am, 1pm or no patients) depending on patient appointments. Despite numerous requests, communication from their side is either absent or inconveniently late, after 9pm, often forcing me to inquire with several team members, usually without success. After addressing this issue in a meeting with the owner and staff, emphasizing the importance of receiving my schedule on time so I can organize my day at another clinic, there was a brief moment of agreement. I made it clear if don't get the schedule by 5pm, I will schedule myself at another clinic and I will not be able to make it to work.

 Yet, this proved short-lived; literally 4 days after the meeting, silence prevailed once again, I received a last-minute notification at 10:15pm  for an early morning shift, which I had to decline as I warned them numerous times !. It's exhausting and disheartening to repeatedly chase people for information that's crucial to my work.

Secondly, the clinical manager’s behavior is diminishing my workplace morale. Criticisms about my Spanish proficiency (I'm in Miami) mocking my speech, calling me slow (which I'm not, they just expect sloppy work), and saying overall negative comments have become all too common. These remarks are not only unprofessional but deeply demeaning. 

All in all, these experiences have left me disillusioned with the management and overall atmosphere of the workplace. It's a struggle for basic respect and professionalism, and I'm at a point where I'm questioning the worth of staying.

I just began my own startup clinic, and need this part time as a safety net since I barely see patients at my new clinic ....at least I'm learning what not to do in my practice. Why can't people be nice and respectful of my time.

Agh rant end."

2,2024-03-14,Vent about my problematic manager. ,u/vindictivexx,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bewot8/vent_about_my_problematic_manager/,antiwork,"I work for a franchise version of a very popular coffee branch. I have also worked for the corporate version of said coffee branch in the past. Both times now I have been very heavily targeted for just trying to follow my job description, and actually left the first time because I was being harassed. But the money was good so I decided to give it another shot a year later. Other people have had very similar situations to mine, and I know that; it’s not the most accepting and nurturing company, despite what they like to say. 

Today I was threatened to be fired. This started because two days ago, I confronted another employee for speaking rudely to a customer over a drink recipe, and then undermining what I said to the customer in an attempt to solve the issue (I am in a position of leadership over this employee). They mocked where this person was from (not the US), and the customer rightly felt attacked. This escalated the customer after I had already deescalated the situation.  I was firm, and perhaps cold in my response to this employee. Maybe my delivery could have been better, but this is a recurring issue with this staff member and I was frustrated. I told my manager about it, per what it states in my job description. I was honest about how I handled it and my frustration. They decided to make it an issue with the entire staff, and asked nearly every  employee about me and how I handled it (95% of them weren’t there, but backed up that I was in the right anyway). I sat on it for my day off, cooling off and replaying it in my head, then politely asked my manager to keep our trusted conversations that I have between us private, because now there are rumors circulating about me. This is also not the first time my manager has done this to specifically me and caused turmoil in my relationships with my coworkers.

They threatened to fire me because I tried to set a boundary about not making matters that don’t involve the staff a staff-wide issue, both for my privacy and the privacy of the other employee. They stated that it’s not their fault or responsibility that the staff are spreading the rumors they’re starting. This is my livelihood they’re threatening over something that’s not that deep. I managed to talk them into letting me have a conversation with them on Saturday, but I’m actively looking for a new job cause this isn’t worth my time or energy. I have been walked on and disrespected since day one. I’m tired of this stupid company. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes, I suppose. 

It’s also important to note that I was up for the AGM position at my store a week ago, which they decided to give to their PARTNER, who has no experience with the company and was originally advocating for me. I’ve never broken policy or done anything to break my managers trust. I am one of the more reliable employees so this is absolutely absurd. 

Meanwhile, there was an employee at my store not too long ago who broke policy daily, harassed the employees and customers, AND was fabricating his identity for months and only got fired because he got arrested in the next county over. But yes, I’m the problem. 

Anyway, my manager is just inappropriate and power hungry at this point. I’m out. "

I’m a 24M, finishing up my last online class and by May I’ll have my bachelors degree in History. I’m looking for something full-time that can support me up until I move, which will be sometime in the summer. 

After applying to literally 70 or so jobs, a couple have responded. The ones that have responded have mostly been the worst ones, and while I feel desperate, I’ve ignored them. The offers are just way too low, and the company reviews are putrid. 

This brings me to my current dilemma. I’ve got the chance to show up for an interview at 8 AM tomorrow, and at first I was excited, but now I’m not so sure. 

Firstly, the pay rate is actually lower than what I thought. In fact, many of the company reviews talk about how the pay rate is severely lacking, especially compared to similar jobs. 

Secondly, the reviews from indeed, as well as google, show that a lot of people have issues with this company, and the people it employs.

While the offer of having weekends off and working 8-5 feels nice, there’s a part of me that knows I’ll be stuck on the pay, especially when I could be earning more elsewhere. Not to mention, several people have already mentioned the lack of upwards mobility (which doesn’t seem too important given my situation, but says something about the company).

Would you still go to the interview? Or just decide to keep looking.

Also, he told me a bit ago that when he started his manager position, he literally got reported for being too nice to workers. Not in the creepy way, mind you.

They all have similar email signatures to the latter. I will however get multiple emails about the same position from different agencies.They don’t communicate like normal recruiters, and I’ve been through my share. Is it a scam?

Everyone told me I should tell them to fuck off and decline the job offer. My plan was to ask them about the wage. If they declined, I’d leave. I still live with my parents. I told my dad what I thought about doing. He didn’t want me to do it because it would “sabotage” the offer. So I reluctantly accepted the offer. I asked about the wages to them, but they said I would have to talk to the owner about that. I’ll mention it whenever I meet the owner. If I had it my way, I’d look for something better. I still don’t plan on leaving my current (and better paying) job. I have some active applications for the jobs I want most, so I’m hoping I could possibly hear from them. I’m going to work at this new place for at least a few months to see if I would like it.

Raises, if you're one of the lucky ones to get a raise, don't cover the COL increases and inflation. 

So it stands to reason, in my simple mind anyway, that all of the money is being siphoned up to fewer and fewer people – and year over year, as COL exceeds income and more people are pushed toward the margins, real life is strikingly similar to a winner-takes-all game of Monopoly. The only real-world mechanism analogous to flipping the board over is a revolution of some kind.

3,2024-03-14,HR is giving me a hardtime because I get off my desk a lot.,u/WhitePinoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bf1ruf/hr_is_giving_me_a_hardtime_because_i_get_off_my/,antiwork,"TL;DR at bottom

So I've been working with this company for about 7 months, and everything has been extremely smooth, up until now. Everybody switched cubicles, because they're expanding the office. I was asked a question last week from HR, but when I told them I had a deadline, they moved it to next week.

I was really worried it was something major. Apparently, the HR lady told me that I've been distracting other people in the office. She told me how I often go to the bathroom, get up for snacks or coffee, and I might move a lot at my own desk or tap. She told me that this shows that I am unfocused and she wanted to know how the company could accommodate me to stay at my desk. 

I didn't share my exact medical history with her, but I did request to be allowed to go to the restroom more often and to offer a doctor's note to HR later next week. 

I am somewhat annoyed but already stressed out as it is. I've been depressed for a couple of months because I'm struggling with multiple health conditions like delayed sleep and bulging discs. Plus I have a lot of debt because of a HDHP. 

I've been spending my money carefully so that I can pay all my debts off, even though most of my doctors have been useless. I've been buying cheap affordable foods and I've begin to notice it upsets my stomach, and makes me gassy.

I also have an OAB that's been happening since last year, and all the urologists I've been working with haven't been able to help me or give me the basic medications I need. That's why I am seeing my 3rd doctor on this issue. It's a shame, because if I need to use the restroom, I have to walk past a meeting room with a glass window that's used a lot, so my company tends to see me walk to the restroom multiple times. It's been quite a burden.

I think to address the ""movement"" at my desk, I'll asked to be moved, drink less caffeine, and maybe buy a fidget toy or something. I only tap because sometimes my computer gets slow sometimes, so I have to wait for minutes. My eyes tend to get dry from my Sjogren's and looking at the monitor. That's why I use special glasses and eye drops and take breaks by writing on my clipboard to recover my vision. I also have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and bulging discs with sciatica, so things like moving, getting up, and stretching are a must that shouldn't be shamed. I work 9 hours a day. And oh yeah, my hair gets frizzy sometimes. 

TL;DR

People in my office ratted to me to HR, because they've taken notice that my body aches, my face dries out, I like to take breaks away from the desk, and I need to use the restroom more often due to an unresolved medical condition. HR preached to me how they're a trustworthy resource that's there to help me, and every time HR lady told me this I just 🤨. I am going to ask for accommodations with doctor's notes and get in touch with someone from the department of labor in California for advice on how to protect myself. I am also actively job hunting right now and looking for a side gig too because my current wage is insufficient. Just in case this turns out to be another grand set up to get me fired like with my previous company.

This week I could only come in once because of doctor's appointments and I had a fever from some sort of infection I'm having (???) and management isn't happy about it I can tell. I had an accommodation letter for a sleep disorder I have (DSPD) to only come in 3x per week because the commute is rough on my health, and it was denied. I didn't have the energy to appeal it.

I got spoken to by management about how I need to come in more. I understand this is the policy (don't agree with it) but I feel very upset and fear that people think that I am lying. I genuinely HATE going to the doctor so much b/c it takes time and money and I don't have endless sick leave to waste. It's easier to get home and login and use less sick time also.

We got bought out by a much larger company a few years ago, which have their own teams etc but we are independent from them.

I requested a promotion in December (I've been working here for 3 years and a promotion was promised to be reviewed after 2 years in the company). The promotion was based on me picking up more than double the responsibility than when I started at the company.

The MD agreed verbally to supporting my promotion to the board of the company. To date, I haven't heard word about this promotion and I've followed up three times with both my boss and the MD. The MD just says ""I have picked it up and am working on it"" but nothing. My boss is useless and never stands up for me unless it makes him look good too.


This week, my boss told me he has allocated me as a resource for the company that bought us out. Someone from that company had resigned, so they asked us to supply resources to pick up their work.

Thing is, this is not in my position description or contract. Also, I sent him an email in January explaining we are understaffed and I can't complete my current tasks as is (he never responded or acknowledged the email).

I present to you the most nasty thing you're ever gonna hear (even more than the Bread Sisters). 

It was New Year's and I was asked what I was going to do. I said my husband and I were gonna BBQ and do sparklers with our son who was super young at the time. After that, I didn't say a word. I didn't ask what her plans were bc based off every single conversation we had ever had, I did NOT want to know. Well, everything was about her so she just had to tell me. Her words "" I love to bring in the New Year's with a huge orgasm at midnight but my husband (who I also worked for, just the 2, no HR and one was about 52 or so and her hubs was about 65) won't go down any more bc last time he did there was old toilet paper and the vomited."" 

Pure nightmare fuel like what the actual fuck why would you say this to me?? Mind you, I'm like the most wholesome person and I DONT WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING

2,2024-03-15,At what % do you think the unemployment scale needs to be before a new system is taken serious,u/crua9,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bf7s4p/at_what_do_you_think_the_unemployment_scale_needs/,antiwork,"So in the AI/robotic world we often theorized once robotics and AI gets to a point, many will be out of work. While there is some that say ""but people will retrain in new jobs"", the problem is this doesn't just mess with 1 industry. It messes with all of them. And not only that, we are looking at in the matter of a few years it realistically could replace many jobs.   


The hope is when we go beyond some point programs like UBI would be seriously looked at. Basically when we go beyond a point, we will see the government understand unemployment will increase, the amount of open jobs will decrease. And it isn't something that needs a 10 or 20 year fix. It needs a fix yesterday. So this will leave the government more than less 3 options.

1. Basically make automation illegal. This won't happen because the other person/country is doing it and won't stop it. Just like the pause on AI research was complete BS that happened not long ago.
2. Ignore and let people starve to death, crime go up, and ""the problem will fix itself since they are unwanted anyways""
3. Some UBI like system where we honestly aren't dependent on money anymore for basic needs and goods, and a basic quality of life to include basic levels of happiness. (just having enough just to stay alive won't do unless you want a major French revolution type of thing across the world. A just happy enough = to where the person will consider it to be like a prison. Where if they are happy, then it's the fat and happy thing.) And if they want to do more like make their own movie, art, or whatever others want to spend their extra UBI on. Then they can still work there way in something better than basic levels. But at the end of the day there is no reason to be homeless or hungry unless you want to be.

Mandatory work meetings for nightshift

This is in Austin TX 

I work overnights at a residential facility 7p-7a on a rotating schedule, 36 hours on one week and 48 on the next. We have mandatory meetings every month always at 1pm or 2pm and they are always between our worked shifts. So we leave at 7am and are expected to come back for an hour in the middle of the day and then work our 12 hour shifts at 7pm. Even if it was scheduled a little better, the night shift is only 1/2 staffed and most people will work an extra 12-24 or sometimes even 36 hours a week just to make sure the place is running and residents are (more or less) cared for. I thought we had to have at least 8 hours between mandatory shifts? If we complain we are given a ""toughen up"" and ""no one wants to work"" speech by our boss. I bike/bus and my commute is an hour each way. 


Is this legal? Worth at least shooting an email to HR? Thanks for any input. "

I can't take the work culture and job tasks here. These two characters (M & GM) will be the main characters of my vent.

About them:

1. M and GM are buddies from another company since years ago. 
2. M has this stupid sarcastic behavior, whenever things go wrong, she'll blame you instead of pointing out the issue and help you in solving it. And always complain the office being hot while it's on full blast and freezing my ass off. My colleague and I did suggest her to move her desk closer to the AC but her arrogant ass is cement to that spot.
3. GM is the type of person who thinks he's above the rest. Doesn't really pay attention to details despite asking us to focus on details. Will reply your questions with one syllable n most often doesn't provide solution. But reply to M like long lost friends.

Issues:

1. M asked me to make a 10D7N itinerary using a 9D7N itinerary following the flight details provided by her. After analyzing the 9D7N itinerary, I decided to make a few changes to fit the 10D7N itinerary. Then I send to the designer and have him design. When I received it, I asked M to check and you know what she said? She said she's not always free and can't always help me check everything. I told her I made a few changes to it following the flight details and was hoping she would take a quick look just in case she's not happy with it but nope. ""You must be confident,"" she said. WTF lady, it won't cost you your eyes to have a quick look, innit? Kalau salah then marah I lagi, pakai tu sarcastic bitch voice again. Bukan I tak bagi tau nak tolong check, it's you yang x nak check sebab you too busy. Lady, it won't cost you more than 5 minutes la wei.
2.  While I was away yesterweek, GM n one of my colleague kept pushing me for updates on another itinerary. Since I was away from office and wasn't with my laptop, I just send whatever I have on my phone to them. Then GM decided to go for itinerary 1, 2, 3. After I came back, they wanted to rush itinerary 3 because of Sakura season in Japan. GM wanted to use a photo of a place that isn't in the itinerary, I got confused. He even mentioned it countless times he wanted photo of that place on front page to attract customers. So I just do for him, itinerary and costing. After countless amend the itinerary, M asked how come this sakura place is not inside itinerary but got picture? And asked me to not do misleading advertising. BITCH, your GM asked me to do, I just follow! Consider he's very knowledgeable about Japan because he kept talking about it! So GM want me to ask the Japan agent whether it's possible to go to that sakura place. Agent said it's possible but would need to requote everything. So, I suggest to just use the photo of whichever sakura place that is stated in the itinerary but ""cANNot beCAUse it'S OuR sElLinG poINT"". THEN WHY THE HECK DID YOU APPROVE THE ITINERARY IN THE FIRST PLACE!? End up I have to ask the agent to quote another place with the sakura place that they wanted so badly. I'd laugh my ass out if this tour doesn't sold out.

I decided to hand in my resignation letter next Monday but I feel like sending an email instead. Which would you suggest, hand in a physical letter or just email? "

You'd probably qualify for unemployment, you'd end up in social housing, the state would pay for your healthcare.

Sadly haven't been successful yet but at this point I'm quitting even if I can't find something else.

I asked for a week off next month to see my best friend who I only see once every 1-2 years as we live in different countries. My boss is actually very nice but she declined as she had already booked a holiday and only 1 person is allowed to take a week off at a time as we'd be understaffed otherwise.

Only thing is, I've had this holiday booked for months and months. I tried to ask her for it off ages ago (without specifying the month/days), but she told me I can't ask for time off in the next holiday year (April 1st onwards). She said to wait until March to ask. 

So yeah. I'm officially quitting now. There's not a single chance I'm missing seeing my best friend for this. I literally worked both Christmas and New Years as my other colleague took 3 weeks off for that (boss wasn't happy with that, but colleague insisted), so it's insane to think I'd miss seeing my best friend as well."

I was among a batch of new hires. They started us off at a dollar an hour above minimum wage, which was substantial back then. They offered immediate possibilities for promotion, based on training, interest, and ability. I got a promotion fairly immediately and got a bump in pay of $3 an hour. As I said, very very substantial back then: pretty much a 25% pay increase overnight. I didn't know how generous the boss was though until Christmas came along and he gave us Christmas bonuses, a turkey, and the week off between Christmas and New Years. He hired an instructor from a local community College to come and teach us the basics in case we wanted to pursue a career in machines. He was an award-winning instructor, and everybody who stuck with that course ended up going on in their career. He would have meetings where he would offer cash incentives to people who came up with the right answer after a discussion. He had gotten a huge contract from one of the big computer companies based on technology that he pioneered. He had been a one-man operation before he hired all these people. He took his company from one man operation, to a four-man operation, to a 40 Man operation in about 6 months. All four people were training for the first four or five weeks. Morale was fantastic. And just as I put my notice in so I coukdcgo back to university, his last meeting was to offer stock options in his company, making it employee owned. That man was a fantastic employer. All I can say is, the work was hard, he had an unpleasant personality at times, but he's the best boss I ever had.

So I've been at my company for over 7 years and have successfully handled several large and important projects in that time.  A few months ago, after some restructuring, management approached me to ask that I agree to change teams in order to again take over our largest and most important client - something I had done for several years prior to the restructuring.

I agreed to do it on the condition that I receive a raise and a promotion, neither of which I have received in the last 7 years, despite these being promised for the last several years.  

After being told two weeks ago that my raise had been approved in full (15%), I have now been given a letter offering me the promotion, a 6% raise, and change in employment status which would mean I no longer track/am compensated for overtime (comp time).  At the time I was given the letter, I was told that management agrees I am worth the 15%, but that they weren't able to get it approved by the CFO.  They told me they would try again at the next opportunity.  Which, again, I have heard already for several years now.  To make things worse, the company is focussing heavily on budget cuts, and will likely continue to do so for next 2 years.

As I see it, I have a few options:

1)  Accept the offer.

2) Try to negotiate a bigger raise, reduction in working time (e.g. 100% to 90%), and/or rejection of the change in employment status re: overtime

3)  Reject the offer and go back to doing my normal, current job duties (I had already taken on a lot of extra work in anticipation of the change), letting them dig their own hole with the client and hope that this motivates them to make a better offer.

I should note I am a single mother and trying to finalise a divorce, so I don't really have the mental or physical energy to look for another job at the moment, which will also likely be a longer commute.  I am not having financial problems, so I am not in desperate need of the raise.  I just want to earn what I deserve.

I am angry and would love some advice so that I can avoid making a decision based too heavily on my anger and frustration.  Thanks in advance.

thesis/TLDR: the employer corrupts the concept of work ethic for their own gain and it spreads to their more susceptible employees. 

The other night at my dead end night pack out job I had a fellow employee snap at me for my poor work ethic. And he is not the only one. For context I work  packout stocking shelves at a retail store. A job with no upward mobility unless I move to day crew. I will not see a dime more in my paycheck for working harder. So naturally I work as slowly as I can get away with. There isn't any incentive to do otherwise. 

Well my fellow employees who have no stake in my lax behavior and CERTAINLY  aren't getting paid to monitor my behavior seem more invested than my actual managers. Looking at me in disdain and even trying to shove work on to me. ( it even bit one in the ass when he tried to shove work he was told by the manager to do and got caught when i checked in with said manager, the hypocrite.)

What bothers me the most about this whole situation is their twisted definition of personal work ethic. A personal Ethics is a moral principle based on what You believe should ought to be.  And work ethics should theoretically align with your ethical principles and goals.

I’v had this job steadily for 5 years, and have no violations that are younger than a year old. It's getting me through college and getting paid 18$ an hour. I am getting everything I want out of this job in accordance with my work ethics. and as far as i can tell, besides bitching to move faster (i never will, it's been 5 years people. Get a clue.) management is- well maybe not satisfied- but content with my work. 

Yet everyone who rides my ass seems to have completely twisted their work ethics to align with the company's desires. It's as if when they hear “work ethic” they translate it to “ work myself to the bone like a good little cog”. They have no guiding principles of labor of their own. No consideration for if I'm allocating my time and effort elsewhere. It's almost that they cannot understand that my goals in life do not align with this company, and therefore will always put in the minimal effort required until I can ditch it for good.

don't you dare criticize me for having no work ethic when you cant even tell me why you kill yourself at a dead end job. thats not a work philosophy, thats just neurosis of some kind."

In most cases, neighborhoods and states with low cost living are only because they are under developed, crime trafficked, or are neglected in some way.

Sure it's cheaper to live in the hood, but it's not safe, commute is terrible, and high quality food is sparse. By taking care of the most marginalized we can uplift everyone to an equitable standard. By saying ""we should pay by state"" leaves room to lowering the standard of living because it'll cost less. 

Right now Hawaii has the highest cost of living which makes sense seeing how much the elites exploit their limited land and businesses (not to mention banks are still trying to grab their homes lost to the fire). It costs around $60k yearly, or $5k monthly or around $30/hr to sustain life in Hawaii. I don't know about you but that's pretty reasonable for anyone to have no matter the state. 

Of course this is just the minimum *standard* so jobs will still offer more depending on what it is. 

I just think we get lost and hurt ourselves by setting the minimum wage by state. Ideally we should be demanding nothing less than an UBI and universal healthcare because we can absolutely afford it. "

There's 5 players here
Me
Manager (who quit)
Boss
And the two Assholes

I've worked at my job for almost 3 years. 14 days short of 3 years. Very quickly I discovered that two managerial people in my department (just not directly over me) are Assholes.

About 7 months ago, I got a new manager. She was great, we were chill and when she saw I was underutilized, she decided to mentor me and teach me new things! Cool! She had the idea of getting me a promotion with a nice raise too, even cooler!

Well, she very quickly started clashing with the Assholes. We were in the process of moving to a new office location within my place of employment and we discovered that the Assholes wanted to give a part time temp worker (the temp's primary job is to answer the phone and handle walk-ins) a private office instead of me, who is now handling sensitive information that is very easy to fuck up. Soooo she will get a private office, while I'm at the front, handling her job. And mine. I also handle her job when she's not here, so I'm not angry that I also have to be up here, but to give the part timer a private office for her 100% of the time, instead of me 40% of the time is insane.  My manager proceeded to throw a shit fit and convinced my Boss to put me into that office. Hooray! 

I soon realized though, that due to her clashing with the Assholes she was quitting and looking for other employment. Then I also realized once she decided to say ""fuck this place, I'm out"" she kinda stopped doing her work. She still mentored me, but she let her work slack a lot.

Last month, she quit, and this the Assholes have focused their gaze back on me, instead of just tangentially.  I am now being asked questions that are my manager level questions, and expected me to answer. So instead of covering 2 jobs that I was already doing, I'm now covering 3 jobs. I'm just tired of the constant passive aggressive disrespect that I'm receiving at a job that I would have thought to be a little prestigious.

Oh and the move happened, and they slotted the part timer into the office.

I'm waiting for my boss to come in (he hasn't moved his computer yet) so I can speak with him about this and several other issues, and say to his face ""I'm actively looking for other employment because of the Assholes. They have actively driven off 3 people that I know of, And I can only imagine how many others.""

And frankly? If I quit on the spot, I have enough squirreled away that I could live comfortably for YEARS without issue.

I know I'm not giving a perfect picture, but I'm literally shaking with apoplectic rage at my desk, while hearing them joke and laugh and repeatedly reference the PART TIMER'S OFFICE. SHE'S NOT EVEN HERE TODAY."

I've been through several jobs throughout my life. I've been working at my current job for a little over a month now and it's no different. I still want to shoot myself in the mouth every day I go in. I intend to stick with it until I have enough money to leave Canada and be with my boyfriend and find something else that's gonna suck. 
Asking kids what they want to do when they grow up and this whole dream job bs has to be one of the biggest scams in life that there is. I went to school for Office Administration and Business and only ever got jobs in Food production. College is a scam unless you have money to burn.
Additionally you will work your ass off for table scraps and you will see tent cities everywhere and fear that being you. If only we could go back to a barter and trade thing instead. 
Yes I understand it's just something everybody has to deal with so we must suck it up. I've heard it all before and I'm no longer phased. I wished I could just run away with a bunch of hippies and go off grid but realitically I can't and I have to survive. This is why so many people are depressed and having to be on medications. 
I have a lot to look forward to in life but at the same time, I can't wait for it to be over just so that I can be done suffering. Even if I don't live to the age of retirement and I'm still excited about this phase in my life being over.

People with the shut up and suck it up mentality = Bootlickers who think they're better than everyone else because they worship people with money and high status.

Starting at the beginning. After I was hired. two weeks later, my director up and quit. They promoted my supervisor and never filled his role. Since then, he has made tons of mistakes and forgets a lot of the things we tell him. After which we (3 of us) take the fall for his mistakes. During our reviews, he also uses that against us to lower our ""grade."" 

Onto the issue. Back in August, I had a seizure. And
missed 2 months of work. Two weeks into coming back, and I get reprimanded for not getting my projects and tasks completed on time. (Note I am on light duty working 4 hr days due to severe vertigo). We begin to disagree as I reminded him that He has not approved the budget for the necessary repairs.  And, of course of this is used against me in my next review. I should.mention they randomly threw me a bonus when I actually asked for a raise. In January this year, I had a second episode, and HR pushed for me to take FMLA along with short term. However, for the last two months, I feel like I'm harassing them as I have not received any kind of payment. They told me I just need to email that i authorized it . I've sent multiple emails authorizing to approve the hours and nothing. It takes days to hear back from any of them, and the other HR people don't want to assist. ""For further assistance, you need to speak with ____ directly."" 

I feel like I'm being pushed out due to my supervisor pushing his screw ups onto me when talking with VP. I have so much more I can share, but it's mostly rants. I should mention that he and SVP are buddies that go decades back (he even went as far as to say if I think that, then its incorrect.) But these dudes go out for drinks sometimes

I'm not sure if I should look into legal action or if I'm really at fault. 

I will also admit he triggers me and the team by saying  we we we we only to hover over us, complaining and slowing us down. I've been at this job for a year and a half. And we have gotten into several heated debates since I'm the technician, and he believes his 30 years of experience sitting behind a desk over rules that. 

Eg. I need 658 pieces of lumber to repair the garbage and garage fence. I've had this project since I started and was never approved for the funding. In my last review in December, I finally was able to get the SVP  into the room, and he pretty much dismissed all the issues I brought up and basically said that's a contractor type of job. This is the first I'm hearing that sentence.  And guess what. Funding is still not approved. And it's still used against me in the review. 

Should I seek legal counsel? I'm seriously stressing as I haven't paid rent in two months. Sorry for my head being a hot mess as I type this. If you want more details DM me"

Problem comes when the two doctors I work for take off time. If one or both of them aren’t in office, we obviously cannot be there. We are forced to take our own PTO because the doctors want time off. I rarely get to use my paid time when I want to use it. We are offered to take it unpaid or pick up a shift, but the shifts are mainly overnights and I work days. I can’t pick up an overnight and then work my normal shift the next day. 

Is this reasonable? I’d say 40-60% of my yearly PTO is used for when the doctors want time off. So I have little PTO to use for when I’m sick or god forbid I want to do something. It’s really frustrating and I end up running out by the time the holidays roll around when they take even more time off. 

TLDR: Made to use PTO for when the doctors take off. "

There have been many times when I'm at the office when I don't have much work to do, and I've been bored out of my mind. My seat is in a secluded area at the back corner of the room, so there have been lots of times when the work has dried up and I've browsed the internet or watched tv shows on an incognito tab to pass the time. Obviously I keep an eye out in case someone comes within eye-shot of my laptop.

When I WFH, I'll confess it's a common occurrence for me to play video games for the whole day and go to the gym on my lunch. A big reason I do this is because if I save all my work for office days, I have lots to keep me busy and I can avoid counting the hours down out of boredom.

I've been absolutely systematic on it. They average 5 posts a day, and I hit everyone. They blocked me to begin with, but I kept making new accounts to warn people. They gave up on blocking.

Recently, I got a call from my old manager (who was amazing and I remain friends). She warned me that later that day, upper management will be calling me about my activity. And they did.

They told me I need to stop as it's affecting their ability to hire. I told them no. 

They said they'd take it further. I told them I had records between them, myself and union still.

They asked what they can do so that we can reach a ""position of mutual agreement"" on it. I told them to ""like it or lump it"".

Am I being petty? Yes. Is it healing me? Also yes.

I'm nearly 21 years old, just finished university and therefore I'm working full-time, 40 hours a week for the first time in my life. Throughout university, I've always had a job but it's always been part-time so I could focus on my studies. I work in hospitality and have for several years, but over the last couple of months I've started working forty hour work weeks. 

I normally start work around 8:30/9:30am and finish around 5/6 pm.. by the time I get home, I am absolutely exhausted. I don't feel like I have time to even cook or clean whilst getting enough rest - let alone having any hobbies, or socialising, or doing anything special. it sounds ridiculous but I'm even struggling to look after my hamster because I don't even have time to clean her cage. I feel like my life is just waking up early, getting home from work at 6/7pm, doing some cleaning, eating some food, showering and then straight into bed. I feel like I don't even have a personality anymore or anything that I do other than just working, or preparing to work the next day. On the weekends I try to make the most of it, but I find myself just having to catch up with cleaning, laundry, taking care of my pet, etc so when it comes to time to actually see my friends or my family, or do hobbies, or actually have any genuine rest it doesn't exist. and don't get me started on how anybody is even supposed to make doctor, dentist, therapy appointments when they work 9 to 5 during office days..

Does anybody have any tips on maximising time outside of work without absolutely exhausting yourself? I can genuinely say that I have never been this mentally or physically drained in my life. I wish I was like those people that seem to have unlimited energy but unfortunately I'm not. I have to sleep at least eight or nine hours a night otherwise I won't even make it through the day. I don't understand how people are fitting a whole shift plus looking after themselves and having time to actually live life every single day without collapsing with exhaustion. maybe I'm just tired easily but honestly, it feels like I'm just living to work. is this just gonna be my life for the next 45 years until I retire? Is this just what you have to get used to?"

I’ve never been late. I’m always 15-20 minutes early actually. Today I overslept through my alarm clock and woke up at 6.58 (need to be at work at 7.05). I quickly texted my grade team lead that I would be late, then got ready.

I was out the door by 7.15. My uber then decided he didn’t know how to drive down the street properly and went from 4 minutes waiting to over 15 because he kept making wrong turns to my house. By 7.30, I canceled and hurried to the busy street to hail a taxi. I was at work by 7.40.

A few blocks away, I got a text from the school principal that I had to go see her because I didn’t communicate I was going to be late.

I got there, huffing and puffing. Went upstairs. She immediately was manipulative as hell, talking about how it’s unacceptable I was late and didn’t communicate that. I said I spoke to my grade team lead, but also that I’ve never been late & this was literally so out of the ordinary.

She said I was “minimizing how my actions affected everyone” and that I wasn’t taking responsibility for my actions.

She then sent a follow up email about my lateness and expects me to “be compliant” for the professional standards that were set.

If you’re not willing to understand life happens, and unwilling to look at a person who obviously had a rough morning and did everything in their power under the circumstances they had, maybe you shouldn’t be in charge and you definitely shouldn’t be part of an elementary school."

19,2024-03-15,The ol' bait and switch,u/papertest,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bfod0z/the_ol_bait_and_switch/,antiwork,"This happened to me about two weeks ago. Enjoy. 

I applied to a job posting on a popular job board. The listing stated ""Monday - Friday, 8 hour shifts."" Which is great, because that's exactly what I'm looking for.

I do the interview. In the interview, I was crystal clear that I was looking to only do 8 hour shifts and that my hours needed to start around 7-730a and end around 3-330p. Every once in a while, I could go til 4, but those should be the rarity, not an every day occurrence. 

The owner goes ""great, that's what we're looking for. You do your job and you can be done around 230-3p every day. At worst, you'll hit 330p.""

I start 'training' (which consists of all of two days) and then thrown to the wolves. Without getting into too much specifics, the job is like painting a house. I'm assigned a certain number of houses per day and expected to complete my route each day.

The first two (and only) training days, we spend 9 hours out, per day in the field. I chalk this up to just training in general. No big deal, as long as it's not a recurring thing, I'm okay with this. The first solo day in the field, 9.5 hours. I'm not happy. Not one bit. But, again, it's my first week, things just take a big longer than normal. But I only finish about half of my expected work load. NBD. Just complete the rest the next day.

The next day rolls around, 9 hours and I finish what was remaining from the previous day and two jobs for this day. Again, I'm brand new so to be expected.

Today rolls around, and I'm trying to finish up what was assigned to me from yesterday. I call my boss about something and I'm informed that ""I'm finishing up your assignments, but in the future, whatever you don't finish, you need to finish over the weekend."" 

...wut?...that's definitely not what the job posting stated. Definitely not what I told you in the interview. And definitely not what I agreed to. I ask him to clarify. He does so. 

My response ""I'm not working weekends. Ever. I made that clear in the interview process. I'll make that clear again. Also, starting next week, my hours that I'm going to work are going to mirror the 8 hours per day that I wanted.""

""Oh, well, we'll get to that when we get to that. I'll adjust your assignments, so you should be finishing earlier.""

His adjustment? Taking a whopping two assignments off. Imagine that I've been assigned 20 houses to paint in a day. I've been getting to 9 per day. He reduces my workload to 15...that's not a reduction that I'm able to hit. ""I can do two houses per hour and I expect you to do the same.""

I just agree with him and hang up. Internally though, ""You've been doing this for ten+ years. I've been doing this for 5 days at this point. It's unrealistic and unfeasible to expect me to be able to work as fast as you.""

I finish up my shift, turn in my stuff, and quit. 

*Cue shocked Pikachu face* when I tell him that I'm done after today. 

You advertised 8 hour shifts. You advertised M-F only. Then you turn around and change all that once I start working? Not to mention setting highly unrealistic target figures? Good luck with that."

1: extend job offer well below market value. 
2: when he refuses to take a pay cut, update offer to just enough that he agrees, with the promise that a raise will happen in ""a year or so"" after performance reviews.
3: let said employee work nearly 7 years, with no annual raise above 3% (inflation alone averaged well above that, so that's actually a pay cut). 
4: when the employee finally asks for a real raise, let him wait a month to even receive a call back.
5: when you do call him back, ignore the fact that all performance reviews were above average to great, and that no raise will be given (due to lower volume, a decision made well above his pay grade)
6: that same day, inform him that they have eliminated several positions, and you get to do their work for free. Also, add an additional person to nitpick his work, even though there were no prior complaints. Note: this person is not actually a supervisor or manager, and has little to no experience in the real world with this job.

Employers can limit it to breaks or other 'downtime'.,u/sjbluebirds,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bfp2iz/advice_talking_about_pay_or_unions_isnt_an/,antiwork,"Can you imagine airline pilots talking about pay or the pilot's union while landing?  Can you picture your defense attorney griping about the same during open court?

How about a busy, noisy kitchen during the dinner rush?  A manufacturing floor while operating a cutting tool?

Sometimes it's a matter of safety and effective job performance.  Sometimes it's a matter of not being distracted.

An employer can mandate job- or task-related communication only while performing those duties.  Protected speech, like that regarding pay or union activities, does *not* supersede those rules, because the rules apply to all communication not related to the task.  You may discuss those things on the employer's premise during breaks or other non-task periods.

What the employer *cannot* do is permit other non-work related communication (weekend plans, last night's game, and so on) while on-task, while also denying the ability to engage in Protected communication.

It might be subtle, but there is, indeed, a difference."

After our initial conversation, we agreed to continue our discussion via email.

Firstly, the recruiter informed me over the phone that I would receive an email and asked me to confirm its receipt. Shortly after confirming, I received another email containing a test related to my overall experience and skills.

I promptly completed the test, and about an hour and a half later, the recruiter called to congratulate me on passing. She proposed a face-to-face interview, scheduled for the following Friday—two days after our discussion. However, she mentioned that I would first receive an email with the test results and a confirmation for the interview, which I needed to acknowledge.

Unfortunately, I never received that email. Initially, I thought perhaps her schedule was busy, and I would receive it the next day. But even after waiting, the email never arrived.

As a result, I made the decision not to attend the interview. While I'm uncertain if it was the right move, my concern stems from the lack of written confirmation. If this is how our collaboration begins, I feel uneasy about further communication without proper documentation."

I squandered my high-school time away with drugs and sleeping in class. Took a semester of community collage and failed, cuz I couldn't bring myself to study and do homework. 

I become a butcher, learned from my stepdad and been doing that for 21 years now. 12 years between a couple private shop, and currently with a company running a meat department. It's union, and I get paid decent, but it's not enough. I get decent benefits. Employee match 401k, pension, health, dental and vision. But I'm unhappy. I'm tired of breaking my back and not working my mind. 

Hardly anyone participates in the union like they should, and as a result, we get worse and worse contracts passed, cuz they make it nice for the part timers and give full time employees hardly anything, and then hold voting in the store instead of the union hall were full timers are outnumbered 3 to 1 and a crap contract passes cuz part time kids who otherwise wouldnt be bothered to take time to go to the hall to vote. 

A couple weeks ago, I decided I wanted a change. I've been teaching myself to code, and I'm actually studying and working hard at it. I'm really taking to it. I'm giving myself a full year to work and study to make sure this is for me, then I plan on taking advantage of the school program my work offers if it's worth it (I still need to look into it) and then dip out on the for a better career. I'm shooting for a max of 5 years to make this change. 

Idk why I'm really posting. Maybe to hear someone tell me I can do it, or just to think out loud, or just to vent about how in the last 10 years the company I'm with has gone so far downhill. 

I used to love my job. I might just be leaving one crap company for another crap company, maybe even with no union at all, I'm not sure, I haven't really looked into the field I'm trying to learn and enter. I'd at least have some skills I could use to job hop for higher wages tho. That's not really an option for me currently. I'm kinda at the top in my area without entering corporate and losing what little union protection I do have, and relocation isn't an option for now.

Studying and caring about learning is easier now than back in school, i think because ive been diaginosed and am being treated for adhd, so it's easier now, on top of being pretty sober cuz i got a family and all.

(Type B Personality)",u/Nighthawk1458,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bfrequ/scored_in_the_99th_percentile_on_the_lsat_now/,antiwork,"Main Idea: The LSAT tests ones reading comprehension and analytical & logical reasoning skills. Anybody know of any solid careers that those skills might lend themselves well too, that aren’t all encompassing like most lawyer jobs? 

If you’re interested in the backstory: I never dreamed of being a lawyer. I came to law school because I had a pretty impractical undergraduate degree, I knew I had some skills needed for law school, and I was excited about the touted flexibility of a JD. My LSAT score outweighed a poor GPA and led to a full ride at a good school which solidified my decision to come. (Not a crazy prestigious school, big state school ranked in the top 25, but not in the state I want to work in).

But a semester and a half in, I’m starting to consider alternate career paths, as I’m not seeing much light at the end of this tunnel.

 I don’t know my personality type but think it’s type B? I’ve never been concerned with getting rich, having some prestigious job, or even doing work that I’m passionate about (partially cause I don’t know if that exists). I just want to find a career that pays well enough to support myself and maybe a small family and has a good quality of life that allows for time off where you don’t always have to be stressed about doing work on vacation or making the time up when you get back. Pays well enough to me is hopefully cracking six figures within five or so years.

Some options I’ve considered are moving back home to work and save on rent and trying to self-teach or bootcamp CS or programming (or maybe look into a degree), or maybe stick out law school and try to leverage the JD into Compliance or HR. I like to be creative and always learn new things and solve puzzles which makes programming intriguing to me, no STEM or CS background though. I’m also pretty good with communicating with different types of people which is why I’ve considered HR. I’ve even considered middle school and/or high-school teaching for the time off and cause I think I get along good pretty good with kids (always will be a kid at heart).

In law it seems like the only options are government, in-house, or making it solo. I’m not interested (nor probably qualified anyway) in being a fed, state gov seems okay for the wlb but not a lot of upward growth. And I think having to grind in a firm for the years it would take to land in-house or go solo would make me miserable.

I’m 26 btw, worked a few customer service jobs before law school. If you’ve read this whole thing kudos, appreciate any advice. Also thank you for any brutal honesty, I probably need it."

I’m looking for some easily digestible articles/videos that showcase the benefits of unions and how important they are to the economy and society. I have a close friend who is very progressive on almost every issue. However their understanding of unions is pretty much 100% informed by ten years of propaganda from their corporate employer.

If people felt safe to quit their jobs and spend some time finding a good job, it would significantly shift power to the hands of workers, thus forcing many employers to improve the working conditions."

People make appointments and I go to their homes and try to get them to buy. Appointments can be anytime from 10am to 6pm and are sprinkled sporadically throughout your day. Originally I was told that Saturdays were half-days and I’d have two guaranteed off days, being Sunday and another chosen each week depending on the leads. My job requires me to drive a lot, sometimes over 50 miles away, and I am not reimbursed for gas. However, the payout can be pretty good and could easily make up for this, if I have a semi-decent week.

The big problem now is that I was just told that Saturdays are no longer half-days and are now full days. Not a problem, except for the fact that I have worked all 6 days regardless with no set off day except Sunday. Only, on Sundays we’re expected to follow-up with past appointments to try and close sales that never got closed. Nobody wants to talk to a salesman on a Sunday. Regardless, I am now realizing that I really will be working on the road for ~60-65 hours a week on my own dime at a chance for a payout.

Looking back, it seems most of my jobs, either typical retail or sales, always expected more than 40 hours and punished those who didnt give that. I really enjoy the job but I don’t know if this is sustainable. They offer decent bonuses for meeting margins and selling self-generated leads, but I’m unsure about the long-term. Moreso irritated than anything."

I've been at this company for 2 1/2 years, the longest I stayed at any job, so my loyalty ran pretty deep with this place. It was the first job were I liked most of my coworkers and felt part of an actual team. I wouldn't say I was in love with the job (actually, the job took a toll on my mental health), but I was dedicated. Anyway, about a week ago, I was brought into the office with the general manager and my supervisor. I had an ominous feeling that something bad was going to happen. Well, apparently the whole time I've been there, I wasn't up to pare with the job expectations of the position and that the previous general manager was the only thing keeping me there. They apologized, saying that this shouldn't have dragged on like it did and that I wasn't fit for the industry. They gave me an ultimatum -  either shape up within 30 days or be terminated by then. My supervisor, who've barely been there for like a year, pretty much said she liked having me around, but agreed that this was the best decision. During the meeting, they had me sign a contact stating that I understood what was said to me and complied. I remember just feeling numb. Even at my best, I wasn't good enough? I signed the statement and went on to work the rest of my shift. I mulled over what had just happened for about an hour before I marched back up to the office and announced my two week notice. Impulsive? Yes. But it was the only way I could regain some power over the situation. A week later, I'm preparing to head back up there for my possible last week (why would they uphold to the two weeks?) and all I can feel is bitterness and anxiety. Anxiety over what I'm going to do for money in the meantime while looking for work, and bitterness towards the management team. I feel sick to my stomach just thinking about entering that place. The only thing keeping me from trying to skip out of going is, well, the money, and the chance to say goodbye to my coworkers. This sucks. "

I recently got a job at a gym that employs tons of teens. Majority of their workers are teens. I was hired in January and have been working two days a week for the past couple months teaching kids to swim. I’ve liked it so far, but I think this ordeal has pushed me out of the honeymoon phase a little lol. 
I requested a vacation a week ago for a trip my parents already bought tickets for. I should be gone for about a week in April for spring break. I thought it would be fine, because when I was being interviewed my boss said she’d approve any vacation as long as it was requested two weeks in advance. 
So I text my boss letting her know I requested a vacation, and she tells me that she’d typically find someone to do my shift, but since almost everyone is gone that week I’d have to find someone for her. Here’s the thing- we use a website to communicate with our coworkers, and she has to make me a temp password so I can sign up. She’s rarely there during my shift, so I haven’t been able to sign up. So how do I text people asking for them to cover for me??? Also- it’s spring break and your entire staff is under 18- ofc people are going to be gone 💀
I told my parents what was happening and they told me that if I don’t find someone to cover me, I couldn’t go on vacation. I’m still annoyed though, since the tickets were expensive af and we were going to visit my great grandmother who is 97- this trip probably would be my last time seeing her. 
Anyways I’m just going to hope I find someone. ALSO yes I know this is also my family’s short term planning oopsie. 

So if you couldn’t find anyone- would you still go on vacation, or give up and work?"

Sometimes things got a little saucy and some colorful language would get used. We were all adults and no one was offended by colorful language. 

Our secretary started tell us a story about how her boyfriend wanted to do something he liked to do for a date with her over the last weekend and it sounded fun to most of the guys. we asked her how was it and she told us that she talked him out of it to do something she wanted to do (something about a butterfly exhibit). Jokingly all the guys started giving her a hard time about crushing his spirit when I chimed in without thinking. I don't know why I wasen't thinking but I said ""Leave her alone guys, we know he just wanted to keep getting BL\*WJOBS"" I have never herd a room go so quite so quickly. All the air was sucked out of the room and  unison everyone said ""OOOOOOH!"" and the room quickly emptied. I immediately apologies to her and told her my mouth started running before my brain did.

If you pay for each individual course the prices start from £15 but they didn't pay for the individual courses. They pay for all staff to have a subscription. I've been informed this will be deducted from my next paycheck

She’s an exempt employee working in the state of New York for a non profit company that relies on heavily on grants and federal/state funding. 

Shes paid bi-weekly.  She’s required to clock in and out 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week.  If she works 36 hours one week and 60 hours the next week she will have 4 hours vacation time taken to fill in that missing 4 hours.

Additionally she is required to be available for client and coworker phone calls before and after work as well as every other weekend day or night.  On those “on call” weekends she may also be required to physicaly attend to issues.

She has spent 20 years at this company.  She is competent and efficient and these are not conditions that are only applied to her, but are company wide.  She recently hurt herself and a little flexibility, in her favor, would make a world of difference for her ability to deal with doctor visits and ,what is hopefully, temporary decreased mobility.


I understand the purpose of “exempt employee” status is not to take advantage of employees, but to allow a position flexibility in hours when clocking every single hour associated with work becomes unrealistic.


Does anyone have any experience with a labor authority that can advocate for employees in this situation?

At Dunkin' I'm told it's a different story; my boss asks that I choose between a 15 and a 30 for my break, and I can't have both. Is this the law in Mass? I looked it up but all I found was ""you're entitled to a 30"", but doesn't specify about the additional 15s. Any advice helps!"

Any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic -- but this adage fails to emphasize that ""advanced"" actually means ""so simple that people's cognitive dissonance would not allow them to see through the paradox of its possibility.""

Marx hypothesized that Capitalism would be the engine of its own demise. My work demonstrates that this is possible with today's technology because Capitalism has already built the immense technological infrastructure to turn over to the AGI enabled by the new hypermedia-based architecture I have uncovered.

If the cognitive dissonance becomes too much for you, please remember that your impulse to call me crazy and deride my work without verifying it on its merits is a ***feature*** of the Capitalist systems you are working to dismantle. Reddit is the absolute worst platform to overcome this impulse in a constructive way because of its algorithms, but I can't know whether the people of r/antiwork are ready to overcome their cognitive dissonance until I try. The Workers of the world deserve that I try.

\---------

In the past few weeks, I have had two consecutive ""Whoops, fixed that for you!"" discoveries that are science reading more like science fiction. Both advances required only minor, simple tweaks which were possible after looking at each problem from an unorthodox angle. The simplicity will cause you severe cognitive dissonance and to get angry at me for suggesting it could be so simple:

* I accidentally solved through inductive proof an unsolved problem in Computer Science distributed systems architecture by arriving at a complete solution to Fielding's code-on-demand constraint for REST Architecture. The resulting hypermedia architecture is the most efficient possible architecture for AGI because it has created a universal interface for self-executing code. This also creates the largest zero-day vulnerability ever that no one will listen to because... cognitive dissonance.
   * The inductive proof is contained in this article: [https://medium.com/@imkleats/fear-and-loathing-in-dom-vegas-abea2a21774e](https://medium.com/@imkleats/fear-and-loathing-in-dom-vegas-abea2a21774e)
   * This primer was written afterwards but has a higher-level analysis of the AGI enabled by the new architecture which might be a better introduction than jumping straight into the admittedly long inductive proof: [https://medium.com/@imkleats/act-i-prometheus-805bc0fb91b2](https://medium.com/@imkleats/act-i-prometheus-805bc0fb91b2).
* Applying this architecture to the modeling of a many-bodies particle simulation yielded surprising physics model results that I do not want to share with you at this point because it would not be productive for your cognitive dissonance.

Hackers motivated by Marxism, Anarchism, or any other ideology could take this architecture and start building technology that eliminates work today. The architecture is here now for AGI that eliminates all work and proves Marx right. This is the new challenge of the day. We're not talking shit-ass AI agents anymore. The abstraction of this architecture applies to every level of the stack: f/e, b/e, distributed systems, and even GPU orchestration.

I will not be following this thread. If you want to contact me, you can figure it out. Otherwise I suggest you talk it over with yourselves in a venue that is not Reddit. Reddit's algorithmic premise is garbage that prevents productive discourse, and I do not want to engage with it any further."

Many responses on there involved some sort of “I make more now than ever” obviously with inflation eating away at those wage increases. 

Is there anyone who’s not making more than ever? Ex. I make about 30k after taxes and insurance and live in NJ. I give about 55 hours a week including my commute (thank you ceo I love traffic🥰) to stare at a screen all day and it just irritates me that I know people who work at a warehouse/driver/literally fucking anything, no education, and make the same/more and don’t have to think or be watched over by a weasel middle manager. Even the McDonald’s near me pays 18 an hour My specific job is one where the average salary is somewhere around 70k but not too in demand as I’ve seen about 5 openings in the last 6 months. So I’m stuck. Raises barely happen at my company, and I’ve applied to about 150 jobs in related fields in the past 3 months and have gotten 2 interviews. 

My 30k a year post tax/ins is equal to 23,696 in 2017. That’s 11 an hour for 40 hr week. I made 12 an hour in retail back then. Except now I have 40k of student loans and a 30k car loan because I had to pay a 10k markup on a new cheap car because I needed to reliably get to my 30k a year job and if I went for a used car the lowest interest rate I could get was 15% with a 770 credit score. 

So what are people like us supposed to do? People who did what they told us to. Go to college. Get a degree that’s useful. Have a good credit score. I don’t go out because I can’t afford it, meanwhile I know blue collar workers are making 30-40 an hour, double ot and holiday pay starting with some of the best benefits. I get 6 fucking days off if I get sick or want to go somewhere(I can’t because I have no money). I mean Jesus Christ my health insurance is 350 a month just for me and this inflation and interest is unsustainable. I don’t appreciate the government being so proud of this economy either. What’s everyone else’s low income situation bc I’ll be honest if I wasn’t able to live with my parents I’d be homeless.

A few months ago, I had COVID, and I got one ""unexcused absence"" because doctors can't back-write notes, and I had missed a day of work before I went to see the doctor. Okay, whatever. 

Fast forward to now, I called out yesterday and today because I have a fever, I'm throwing up, and I got my period yesterday too so I'm basically a huge fucking mess. Today my (not boss) manager tells me I need a doctors note or I will be terminated for 3 unexcused absences. Here's the issue: It's Saturday, my primary doctor is closed, and all the urgent care types near me require an APPOINTMENT AND $100 COPAY since my illness is not ""urgent."" 

So, I called my boss, explained that I don't know how I'm supposed to get a doctors note (not to mention, i'm SICK AND IN BED, I don't want to fucking leave and go see a doctor) because the office is closed, and her response was ""You can get the note later, even in a week you can just ask your doctor later when they're open, but we need it on file. I'm trying to protect your job."" MY job which SHE is literally in charge of. You can either understand where I am coming from and excuse the absence or you can die on this hill and fire me for missing 2 shifts. Also...? I can't get a doctors note without seeing a doctor??? Before I could even ask wtf she meant she hung up on me. Oh, and yesterdays absence will remain unexcused no matter what, so I'm already 2/3 even if I got a note for today. 

Now I'm just fucking angry, I'm essentially going to get fired for being sick. Mind you my management says all the time ""IF YOU ARE SICK STAY HOME!!!"" and they let people leave early all the time when they ""don't feel good."" So now I'm being punished bc I had the decency to stay home instead of showing up sick just to be sent home anyway (which somehow makes it excused?? Makes no sense to me). 

By the way, all the upper management at my job tells me how amazing I am all the time, how I'm one of the best employees they have, and how I saved them when they needed help the most etc etc. Now they're willing to die on this hill and fire ""one of their best employees"" for essentially nothing. Mind you, there are plenty of people working today, just as there was yesterday, and my absence is and was not a detriment. Plus, my other coworkers do the most outlandish shit (leaving work mid shift for random reasons, being rude to customers, not following standard rules etc etc) and their jobs are not ever ""threatened."" 

I just hate the world we live in now. Everyone's so fucking anal about stupid shit, can we please just act human?? I'm sick. For two shifts. I shouldn't lose my job because of it."
26,2024-03-16,Farewell Party ,u/haeziedaze82,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bgamxw/farewell_party/,antiwork,"I quit my job recently and had the most bizarre going away “party” this week. 

I’m in a managerial position, so was required to put in 30 days notice rather than 2 weeks. Incidentally, I had about 27 days of PTO built up, so my boss agreed that I’d only have to come in once per week until my last day and basically just enjoy my time off before I started my new job. Great. So I told my team and let them know to start bypassing me and going straight to my boss for anything.

I’ve been coming in once per week as agreed, but it’s been slightly awkward, and I think it’s mostly because my team works hybrid, and so that schedule makes it so that I only see any one of them randomly for short periods. 

Last week, my boss asked me if I wanted a going away party this week for my last day, and I was vehemently opposed. (I’m leaving for several reasons, all of them which I’ve been plenty vocal about, so I’m really not in the mood to reminisce). 
He looked sad and said the team really wanted to do something for me and basically bullied me into agreeing. Fine. He told me to come in this past Wednesday, which is the one day per week that everyone is in office. 

I came in at my usual time, around 8:45, and when I’m parking, I get two texts from different coworkers. “Where are you, are you coming in today?” “We’re in the conference room waiting for you”. Um, ok, no one told me what time this “party” was taking place, so I haul ass inside. Everyone is sitting there, 3/4 the way through their breakfast, and totally silent. I’m offered (now cold) breakfast, and I decline, so now I’m just sitting in there like an asshole. After a few minutes of very awkward silence, my boss says “I’d like to thank haeziedaze for her 3 years of service at (organization)”, and it was met with crickets, which i thought was so odd because when I first announced I was leaving, my team seemed upset and also had also been very complimentary of me. (In fact, employee engagement scores went wayyy up during my time there). 

It was so bad and awkward that my boss told me to just leave at noon and enjoy the rest of my day. Then apologized for doing the going away party. 

Ugh. Work really does suck. "

They gave some options for times, so I said I was free the next day (Friday). I never received a call.

I emailed on the Monday, saying I was checking the status of my application as I hadn't received a call. They then asked if I was free at around 6 pm any evenings that week. I said yes, Tuesday and Friday. I didn't receive a call on the Tuesday but got one at about 6.15 on the Friday.

They have now emailed me asking if I'm free to do a 'working interview' on the 25th from 9-4 pm. I replied to ask whether I would be compensated for my time, and I was told no, but they listed all the 'benefits' of the interview.

I'm not wrong for not wanting to do 7 hours of unpaid labour, am I? I don't mind maybe 2 hours, but I have a degree to be doing and I don't feel like I can just give up 7 hours of my time for free.

I usually wear doc’s and have no issue, but today I could not find them. I had to wear my black running shoes that have a white sole. Also I had black cargos on, this is important.

As I walked in and greeted my manager she pointed at my feet and looked very angry. She mumbled something about shoes. I told her I didn’t hear her and I asked her what she said, she then said “got new shoes huh?” And I said “oh yeah, are they fine?” she then said “no those are out of dress code.”

 I explain to her my issue with shoes and told her how I didn’t have any other option today. She then began to pick apart the rest of my uniform and told me that my pants weren’t appropriate for work.  I said to her “oh, I’m really sorry I thought the only restriction on pants was that they had to be all black?” (which they are and it is). She then said that they looked a little faded and said “I’d consider them more of a gray than a black.” I said “oh all right I’m really sorry I’ve worn these before many times and I’ve had no issues.”

 She then told me to go home and change but I let her know that I live 30 minutes away from where I work, so it would be an hour before I would return to work. I still said I would do it though, I also offered to go to the store next-door and buy some different pants or shoes, and she even offered to give me some shoes from the back. 


I complied with her, and she then said, let me think about it and left. I asked my coworkers what they thought of my uniform. They all seem that was fine and warned me that she does this a lot. She then returned and pulled me into a separate room, where she told me, she was “discharging me“ for the remainder of the day. I basically said I was sorry again and that I had no idea that it would be an issue besides the shoes and I was still willing to go put those slip Ons on or change her, but she said no and told me to clock out and take the rest of the day off. I asked her if I was going to get written up. She just giggled and said I don’t know.

I’m in the parking lot now and I’m really upset and embarrassed about what happened. I’ve never been yelled at by you a manager before and she did it in a way that was really belittling. I don’t think I’ll get fired because it’s just dress code but I am just really anxious about what happened though.

I recently got offered a job at five guys and I’m pretty excited since the interview went pretty well. The area surrounding it is pretty good, but the drive there is a bit sketchy. I might be able to find another way, but it could take longer

I also have an upcoming interview with Lowe’s, so I haven’t accepted the  guys offer yet. They gave me until Wednesday…the same day as my Lowe’s interview.

I’m wondering what to do since I have family that have worked for Lowe’s before and said it was a great environment, so I’d know more about the environment, making it a more desirable place to work. I’ve never known anyone who worked for five guys, so there’s a level of unknown there.

 If I get a job offer for Lowe’s, I’m taking it. Though it’s not guaranteed and I don’t wait to miss out on the five guys opportunity if Lowe’s says no. I’m afraid of looking rude and quitting only after two weeks.

I'm in university and have been applying for summer jobs, part-time jobs, internships, anything because I'm desperate for experience. (And because I felt like I needed to spend my summer/time doing something ""productive."") Because of this, I applied to almost any job and was willing to work for basically any salary. One tutoring company asked me what my salary expectations were and I said $20/hour.

Since then, I've drastically changed my mind regarding work and how I should be spending my time. In the past year, I have been experiencing health problems and burn out. Now, my current life plan is to ""lie flat"": I want to work part-time or from home so I can have time for things I find interesting and fulfilling and then retire, move in with my siblings and live off any savings or pension I have. I'll make just enough money to survive and have some savings. I'll reduce costs by living with my parents or siblings, I won't have any children or pets, will eat out as little as possible, and generally consume as little as possible.

So keeping all this in mind, I don't really want to work for the tutoring company anymore. But they responded to me recently, wanting to schedule an interview. I decided to do some research on the company so I would be prepared for the interview. While on their website, I stumbled upon their hourly rates.

Remember how I said my expected salary was $20/hour? Well, they were charging roughly $100 PER HOUR PER STUDENT.

This is an online position as well, so it's not as though they have rental or equipment costs to cover.

I feel sick to my stomach. I mean, I knew that profits were basically stolen wages, but I had never experienced such a blatant example of it until now.

I feel a bit stupid for not checking the rates before I told them my salary expectations, but I don't think it matters anyways because I doubt they would pay me a fair rate even if I asked for it.

But now since I've had a change of mind, I no longer care about getting experience or being ""productive."" Before they reached out to me, I was seriously considering just not working or doing anything ""productive"" at all during the summer and simply spending it on my hobbies.

I'm just wondering, is it worth emailing them to ask for a higher salary or should I just ghost them? Right now, I'm leaning towards sending an email asking for a ridiculous $80 hourly rate because, hey, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take, right? But shit like this is exactly why I don't want to work. I don't mind doing some forms of labor, I guess, but I refuse to create so much value only for it all to be taken away by someone else.

Thanks for reading, I guess, and if anyone has any tips on how to write an email that basically says, ""hey, remember how I said I would work for $20/hour, well, I want $80 now"" but in corporate, please help.

TLDR: A company asked me for my salary expectations and I said $20/hour. They are charging $100/hour for the service I would be providing. How do I tell them I now want a higher wage?"

647,2024-03-16,"Employee's productivity has increased 140% since 1970, yet our wages only increased 29%... where is the extra 110% going? (hint: top 1% has been stealing it)",u/ReadyTyrant,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bgek0l/employees_productivity_has_increased_140_since/,antiwork,"\*TL;DR\* at the bottom  


If Bernie Sander's new bill were to pass (it wont) it would be the first legislation to reduce hours worked in the US since 1938! But lets dive into why this is not only long overdue, but only a small nudge in the right direction in correcting the slavery/theft that the top 1% has inflicted on the bottom 90% over the last 50 years.  


From 1970 to 2020 the average 'labor productivity' has increased by 140% (Bureau of Labor Statistics) in other other words workers today produce 2.4 times as much value as they did in 1970... So have our wages kept pace with the increased in value output? Not at all! Hourly pay/compensation (adjusted for inflation) grew by only 29.6% during that same time period. So that begs the question, where is that extra 110.4% of extra value produced by workers going? Well lets look at another figure, how much the top 1% earners annual income has changed over time.  


In the 1970's the top 1% of earners earned on average $450,000 per year (adjusted for inflation). in 2020 the top 1% earned on average $1.4 million per year. (211% increase)  


okay how about the bottom 90% during that same time period?  


in the 1970's the bottom 90% earned approximately $53,000 (adjusted for inflation) while in 2020 they earn $68,700 (29.6% increase)  


So from 1970-2020 the top 1% have seen their paychecks increase 211%. Where the bottom 90% has only seen a 29.6% increase.  


in other words: THE TOP 1% ARE STEALING YOUR INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY!  


These same top 1% are the ones that are lobbying the Congress to not pass laws that would equally split the increased productivity of workers (by either increasing your wages or decreasing your hours worked). Instead they lobby to keep sucking YOUR extra 'worker drone' productivity (the bottom 90% of Americans), so they can line their pockets with millions and billions of extra dollars. Why have just 1 yacht when you just bribe Congress to help them steal YOUR extra GDP to buy 3 more yachts?  


Speaking of legislation The last time a bill was passed to decrease the hours worked by Americans was in 1938! That was when we went to a 40 hour work week. This bill introduced WILL NOT PASS simply because almost every member of Congress, republican or democrat, is a puppet of the lobbyists that line their personal pockets and campaign funding with loads of money.  


With that in mind we must shout from the top of a hill EVERY SINGLE Congress member that opposes Bernie Sanders 32 Hour work week bill. Put them on blast, and vote them out of office.  


Remember any congress member who opposes this bill simply doesn't see you as human, you are just a means of production that the rich use to enrich themselves.  


TL;DR: The battle for Bernie Sanders' 32-hour workweek bill is more than just extra time off—it's a fight against decades of worker exploitation. Since 1973, productivity of workers has doubled, yet wages only grew by 11%, while the top 1% have had their incomes grow by 700%. But our ""for the people"" congress men and women WILL NOT pass that bill, why? because the lobbyists, funded by the top 1%, are actively ensuring Congress doesn't hinder their ability to siphon off of your (yes you) increased productivity for themselves instead of giving that back to you... It's basically 'diet' slavery."

For those wondering, my actual resume (with no lies) is solid. I do have internship experience but the market is super bad for tech workers is pretty much near impossible to get a job nowadays unless you have years of experience. And when you take into the fact that I've been unemployed for so long (close to 1 year), I look less and less appealing to hiring managers.

Anyone know how to find businesses that have recently shutdown? Mainly somewhere in Canada because I'm a Canadian citizen and my work experience has all been in Canada so it would be nice to keep it consistent. American experience wouldn't be bad either to add. I was thinking of just putting some dev role that I started in July 2023, left in February 2024 and now ""starting"" my job hunt.

4,2024-03-16,Employer denying First Aid officer allowance backpay - Is this legal?,u/theladyluxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bgicbt/employer_denying_first_aid_officer_allowance/,antiwork,"AUSTRALIA  
I work in local government, and for the past 12 months I have been the First Aid Officer for our site.  
I recently became aware that I was entitled to a First Aid Officer allowance and contacted HR to arrange this as well as any backpay.  
HR has dragged their feet in response (some 6 weeks) and just notified that they are undergoing a 'review' of their allowance and that no backpay will be eligible.

I was also told that it was MY responsibility to notify HR that I was the First Aid Officer (I never applied, it was just assigned). 

Is this legal? I'm also requesting backpay for an employee of mine at another site as they are in the same position, and they are denying backpay for them also."

About a month ago a former co-worker was texting me trying to get a omeone else’s number. I don’t give out numbers. Personal policy. Once I told him I didn’t have it he started prodding me about some things that were stolen (about $2k worth of tools) just before he was fired for always being late and just a general waste of space. He always made the office women uncomfortable and on more than one occasion got his ass beat for the way he talked to them. Constantly intoxicated on the job (previous boss was on the way out and lost all his fucks to give)
I told him straight up best bet was him. Yadda yadda. I told him straight up what I thought of him.  Then I told him.
You should swallow a bullet the way your momma should’ve swallowed you. 
Was it harsh? A little. 
Anyway. So management comes back from their managers only half a mil trip to Hawaii which was gifted to them from the company because they “run their departments so well” 
Owner and HR pull me in the office and have the texts printed out and asked me about them. I told them that honestly. Some people are just worthless. And they didn’t have to read things back to me. I know what I told him. 
They told me they couldn’t have people like that working there and I was terminated effective immediately. 
Mind you this text was sent on a personal phone, off the clock, to a non-employee. 
Now. They had made their minds up on letting me go before the meeting. This I found out from a close source. So if nothing else. Let this be a warning. They will fire you for things that don’t affect them. "

I work(ed) in a small town at a chain restaurant recently recognise a sexually abusive and vulgar pattern of behaviour by my boss, and manager, let's call her Amy. Amy refers to young men who work there in vulgar terms constantly. She talks about how her favourite actors are so 'fuckable' constantly in ways that make everyone uncomfortable. She even described herself as wanting to r-pe two men she found attractive (one an actor, the other a delivery man who we work with.) Finally I'd had enough when she groped one of my coworkers and later made a joke about his penis (he turned 18 a week ago, she is in her late fourties, and he is uncomfortable with it.)

I reported her to HR after a prompt from friends and family while recounting the story. I kept detailed logs of her behaviour in the event I did happen upon the moment she went far enough it was worth reporting.

Everyone was afraid to act, but despite all my personal issues with needing money to live I wont die if I got/get fired, so I said fuck it and went to online HR. They immediatly outted me as the whistleblower and my boss interrogated me in private having heard the accusations. I eventually got away after making clear she was being super uncomfortable in that moment and I was not comfortable talking with her about this. 

I sent another message to HR inquiring if this was standard practice (informing on whistleblowers) and recieved an apology and remark about it being an error. 

It was on thursday, and I finished my shift as normal. Tonight I went in for my graveyard shift after two days off, I was greeted by a firing notice that hides behind a previously unmentioned ""probationary period"" where they can fire no-cause. It was effective immediatly.  


It was handed to me by her, as her first official act within her role as newly promoted general manager (which happened in those same two days I was away)  


So they chose to promote the pedophilic sex pest, and fire the whistleblower. These are who we are dealing with. Corporate HR made the choice to protect them, and fire me, while rewarding their behaviour with a promotion. We don't live in meritocracies, never forget that 'success' for a capitalist means they've managed to step on another workers hand and head.  


I'm sure she's now content to continue harassing boys and fantasizing about molesting actors out loud."

The main reason why autistic people can't find work is that we just physically cannot keep up with ""hustle culture"". The amount of work employers expect employees to do is unreasonable for allistic people, (those without autism) but It is actually physically impossible for most people with autism to keep up with.

This leads to sky high rates of unemployment, firing, and workplace discrimination. It is a sad reality that In most cases even if they have a lot of skills and a desire to work the best autistic people can hope for is self employment or getting disability welfare. 

There is no space in corporate hustle culture for the disabled. We get shoved off to the side because God forbid someone with a disability get paid despite *sarcastic shock and horror* doing their job less productively than an abled person?! Wait a minute what does the word disability mean again?"

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but i need some advice/just need to rant.
So i (28) work in a supermarket in australia as a service/front end supervisor, i have been in this postion about 6 months at this point.
the first couple of months in i noticed i was not receiving supervisor pay. When i asked a colleague who is also a supervisor she told me that we don't receive supervisor pay if other supervisors are on or if our department manager is on.
My first issue with this is that they tend to always put 2 supervisors on so we basically never see supervisor pay despite doing the work and I'm almost certain from looking at my pay slips that even when I'm the only supervisor on, no department manager that I'm still not getting supervisor pay. I'm also listed as retail 1 award on my payslip (which is just a standard team member) which seems kinda werid to me but i don't know. My second issue is that our department manager who also runs our online team and spends her basically all her time in online. So even when she is on we are still basically running service but not being paid for supervisor dutys because of it. I've held on to this the last 2 months because i didn't want to risk my job but they are adding more and more responsibilities onto supervisors while also continuing to give the most bare bones crew they can making our jobs even harder. I'm officially over being excepted to up hold these responsibilities when I'm not being paid to do so while being yelled at by management because things are getting done  because we simply dont gave enough people. 
I do have a union i can talk to but I'm worried that I'm wrong and this is totally normal and I'm just overreacting.

My new manager during 2023 advised that I am not allowed to work from home. 

See, this wouldn’t be an issue if half of my team is working from home and I need to commute everyday to the office. We have a small team and I’ve been noticed as one of the hardest working people on my team (winning awards for this at work.) I recently told my manager in person the toll it’s taken on my mental health not being able to have a day or two to wfh (working from home would give me a day or two of breathing room from all the requests I get in person.) and he just reiterated that we are short staffed. Now to give you an example of the times I’ve felt taken advantage of by my manager which was:

I came into the office at 8:30 and left at 4:30 while he was still there. We get paid for 7.5 hours. I told him I was leaving because I came in super early to do a client meeting and he just waved me out. Then on our next 1:1 he mentioned to me that I need to standardize my time because a user came in asking him for help right after I left. KEEP in mind my other coworkers working times are 8:30-4:00. He went on to mention I need to be the one who works 9:00-5:00. This depresses me because it’s a 1.2hr commute so not only do I waste 2.4 hours getting to and from the office, I can’t even leave slightly early to enjoy the sunlight. 

Another scenario is : A person on my team left for mat leave for 18 months, came back and immediately got to wfh. Her excuse was that she has no one to take care of her baby. That’s not an excuse she’s been riding this excuse for 8 months and my manager does nothing about it.

Do you have any advice for me?

TLDR; I’m very heavily relied on in the office and I’m always booked to the brim the minute I come in. I’ve told my manager in person that me having a day or two to wfh could really improve my mental health and he brushed it off meanwhile 90% of my team wfh!"

Is it normal for someone younger in their early 20s to come in to a position at a higher pay (by 3k-5k) with no formal education, certifications, and only 6 months prior experience at another job because of the market value for the position? I get that the market fluctuates but something seems to be really jacked with the economy if I'm getting paid less than someone I'm mentoring and my education and experience is being used against me as a case for being qualified enough to train someone who is getting paid more than me. I was wondering if other people are going through a similar experience and is this normal across multiple industries? I always take this a time to reflect and look elsewhere cause it's happened to me in the past and I job hopped and got a significant pay bump when I did but here we are again. It feels like any work I've put in to learning anything only serves as means to be used against me rather than helping me get any sort of positional advantage in negotiating a higher salary. We know you're qualified to train this guy who is green to the industry but we're gonna pay him more than you while you train him up and then he's gonna be your superior. The wild part is, I used to think it was nepotism or something situational like that and maybe in some cases it is but in this particular case it's not. This guy doesn't know anyone within the company. For the record I'm not blaming him for the circumstance. More power to him if he can get a higher paying job with no formal education and minimal experience. I'm just confused on 'fair market value' and why negotiating a reasonable compensation bump to match market fluctuation or at least match someone who is coming in and is far less qualified is like pulling teeth. It's always easier to go back to updating the resume and looking on countless job boards to find that next market match rather than it is to get a company to spare a few extra dollars and hour to match what new hires are making."

11,2024-03-17,Basic Human Needs are Basic Human Rights - how We can make it happen,u/ournextarc,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bgq4al/basic_human_needs_are_basic_human_rights_how_we/,antiwork," This is the Our Next Arc Model. This is simply a way of choosing to organize ourselves that can work to create the world I believe we all want. It's not run by any one person, any one can form their own union of businesses as an Independent Union Chapter (IUC). I'm always looking for people to spread the message of this idea, and expand upon it, as well as challenge it.

Basic Human Needs are defined as Healthcare, Housing, Nutrition, Education, Healthy Planet.

The ONA Model follows 6 principles:

1. $33/Hour Minimum Wage.  
Roughly $70k annual. We all deserve a Thriving Wage to meet our Basic Human Needs.
2. 3x Salary Range

All Basic Human Needs are equal. A 3x Salary Range allows for wage increase incentives to be used while ensuring everyone is properly rewarded for their time and contributions.

All salaries and raises move together within this range.

A business operating with the ONA Model Minimum Wage will have a potential Maximum Wage of $210k Annual with the 3x Salary Range in place. Everyone can thrive on these wages.

3. $333k Annual Maximum Wage  
For all positions. Adjusted fairly for inflation. No hiding wages in stocks, bonuses, or other financial schemes. We each willingly accept this limit as enough.  
A business operating with the ONA Maximum Wage with have to pay a Minimum Wage of $111k with the 3x Salary Range in place.  
A Maximum Wage ensures no single entity can hoard excessive wealth while others suffer to meet their Basic Human Needs.

4. The ONA Fund  
All businesses contribute 6% Excess Profits each quarter to The ONA Fund.  
Excess Profits are defined as revenue remaining after paying employees, taxes, and shoring up the business.  
The ONA Fund is Zero Interest. What is loaned out is never due back.  
We send resources out to those in need so they grow stronger and in exchange will help the ONA Union grow stronger.

5. ONA Business Designation  
All businesses fall within 1 of 3 ONA Business Designations.  
ONA Partner (ONA-P). New businesses that form with the ONA Model in place from day 1.  
ONA Directed (ONA-D). Existing businesses that adopt and adhere to the ONA Model.  
ONA Co-op (ONA-C). Any business that cannot pay the ONA Minimum Wage must functionally be run as a co-op.

6. Separation of Business and Government  
We work to ensure Basic Human Needs are Basic Human Rights.

A single ONA Union is referred to as an Independent Union Chapter (IUC) of ONA. There can be multiple IUC within the ONA Union. Each IUC may have slight variations in how they operate based on their culture, region, needs, etc, but will adhere to the overall 6 principles laid out above beyond that.

Practically, this means that someone else could start up their own ONA union of business completely separate from and without me, the person creating this and posting. We just have to choose to do it and then support one another.

Back at it again asking about my shitty convenience store gig. I figured I'd ask here because I've seen conflicting sources.

I usually work from 10 am to 4 pm, most days that I do work, and one day of the week, per my request, 9 am to 3pm.

I read on the internet that they're supposed to give me a half hour meal break somewhere in there, but I've also read that they don't have to? Could use some guidance, and figured y'all would know the correct answer."

Not only do they not care for their employees but I have to deal with a manager that yells everyday. Whenever I see her working I dread wanting to work the same shift with her. When she isn’t working it’s tolerable but again the managers don’t care for their employees and will only push you to keep working without a break or stay longer than you’re supposed to. 

I even tried to tell the general manager about her antics but he says “that’s just how she is”. That’s not an excuse for someone to rule the shift with an iron fist. Which leads me to my question, Should I quit? I recently got a raise which im grateful for but the environment is just too toxic I don’t even care for the money anymore. 

Sure I need the money to build my savings and pay off some student debt but it’s just getting so tiring of trying to push through each day without attempting to walk out. I just wanna not work at all or go to college.  I need to build my dream career until it becomes a reality. "

She this specific coworker of mine that she asked her because “we know he likes you” and it is not the first time she has done something like this to me or others. She often doesn’t want to confront issues head on so she will involve an unnecessary amount of people in an attempt to either soften the blow or make it seem like she’s removed from the matter entirely. I find this so annoying so today (bc she was off) I told her Department Co-Chair that I would prefer if she approached me directly if she has an issue with my work instead of involving another regular employee. I kind of find it embarrassing having my coworkers know if I mess up or make a manager upset so I wish she would have approached me first instead of my coworker. Thoughts? I’m so worried she’s gonna make a stink over this because she can’t take criticism at all. "

In the past 3 months, this job went from one I kind of love, to one I absolutely hate. It started with their firing my friend and former manager by framing him for a violation of law and terminating him on the word of a newly hired director. This same director committed workplace violence against him, which I witnessed. He was terminated a week and a half after reporting it to HR. A month later, that same director’s been harassing, bullying, intimidating, and isolating me. I’ve been spoken down to repeatedly, ignored, insulted, and been constrained to doing minimal work such that I have 0 real accomplishments over the past 3 months, whereas I had dozens in the same time period last year. The director then had her friend promoted into the vacant manager’s position despite her not having any managerial or supervisory experience, nor any experience in our work area (policy and legal issues). The manager and the director have demonstrated that their writing skills are terrible, but they insist on editing all of our work into their words out of ego. 

Our department went from high performers with influence and effect, to a mockery of our positions and a joke. Suffice to say, things are bad.

But! This is where I get to the title of the post: I’ve been collecting evidence, and filed several reports with HR, including documentation. I’ve retained copies of my evidence for myself, and if it comes to it know some attorneys I can speak to. I also have reports packaged and ready to be sent to quite a few other people, including the Board of Directors, government agencies including federal and state labor and civil rights agencies, and law enforcement. 

While some might say never burn your bridges, some bridges lead to places so corrupt that you’re better off severing those ties completely. 

I’m planning to leave the organization. I’m waiting for the right time to resign, whether by getting a new job, or going into business for myself, or just becoming a SAH partner for a while. I know what I’d prefer (not having to leave a job I used to love), but at the end of the day, my mental and physical health have been greatly affected by these past 3 months and I’ll be happier even if I take a job paying minimum wage that I’m way over qualified for. Luckily I have enough evidence to prompt some investigations into the organization. What happens next is out of my control, but I’m hopeful something positive will happen as a result. "

When I started I asked to be reimbursed and was told no. I said but you said it was a benefit of the job.  The woman said the doctor only buys scrubs in January. It was November when this happened, so I was shit out of luck.  They fired me three weeks later because a person the manager worked with at a pervious place showed interest in my position. I literally heard this woman coming up with a plan to get rid of me.

I went to the DOL trying to get my money for crappy scrubs I was forced to buy and I got the check yesterday. Plus, they added more money to the check for my time or the inconvenience. Very cool. It was a good win for me during a tough time. "

My story might resonate with many of you who’ve faced similar absurdities.

So here’s the deal: Recently, while half of our office enjoyed a paid leave, I was grinding away, handling the workload of not just myself but essentially two to three people. You’d think this would be recognized and rewarded, right? Wrong. To add insult to injury, my probation period was extended, making me ineligible for a bonus I had every reason to expect.

This isn’t a one-off. I’ve noticed a troubling pattern: Whenever my workload is manageable, my performance reviews are stellar. However, the moment I start working extra hard, pulling more than my fair share, my reviews tank. Suddenly, I’m below average or slapped with a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). It’s as if my increased effort and contribution become invisible or, worse, count against me.

This experience has led me to question the entire premise of performance reviews. Unlike school, where everyone is exposed to the same lectures, reads the same books, and takes the same tests, the workplace lacks objectivity. There’s no standardized “exam” that fairly measures everyone’s performance. Instead, it seems like a subjective, often biased process that can wildly misrepresent an employee’s actual contribution and work ethic.

Is there any rationale from a business or HR perspective? Can anyone with an MBA or a background in organizational behavior shed some light on how this twisted system is supposed to work? Is it just me, or is the performance review process fundamentally flawed and disconnected from the realities of actual work?"

For years, I've sacrificed so many better jobs to ""help"" out and I have NOTHING to show for it and no plan to take over my uncle's business when he gets old and passes. Last summer I also had enough and It was the first time I found a good job. It was in the oilfield and I made 30k in 4 months. Due to an injury I had to leave that job and I got sucked back into working for my family, my uncle. I should note in all my years of working for this company I never once made 30k in a whole year, let alone in 4 months. Yet my uncle brags about the ""millions"" he makes. 

20 years ago my uncles company had 599 employees, so I think he has an ego. It is very frustrating to hear that every single day, how rich and successful he is.  Since then there was a huge divorce and his ex wife was awarded nearly all of his heavy equipment. He now has 3 employees after I left. It is clear to me he ""fell off."" My uncle constantly tells me that I think I know everything. I question them on this and they can never explain. My uncle is very quick to point out every little thing I do wrong at work. Says he doesn't want to be involved with the work yet micromanages every little detail. He thinks he is never wrong and it is so stressful dealing with that. Which is why I left to make more money and be less stressed. I tried to express to him that in order to get more workers we have to pay a competitive wage like the other companies in the same field of work. He replies with ""don't tell me how to run a company if you have never had one."" He hires people with criminal history that are desperate enough to work for a horrible wage in this field of work. 

I should mention I am the only equipment operator with a clean driving record, clean background, and the only one who does not partake in drugs or consume alcohol. I've tried to hire multiple people but once I tell them how much they will get paid they literally laugh in my face, which is fair...it's 15-30% less than the other companies in the same field. I don't claim to know it all, but their mindset is still stuck in the early 2000s when his company was booming. Technology has changed. I stopped giving any input because it was just a waste of my time, I just do what I'm told but I can't take it anymore, I'm not a robot. I see the other workers making mistakes daily that cause literally hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment damage and I get told ""don't worry about them"" and ""just do what you are told."" This is not a normal job, It’s on-call work at any time day or night you are expected to drop everything you are doing and go into work. I like the work. When there is work, but him and the other employees I absolutely cannot stand. The other employees constantly lie, and are jealous of my last job so any chance they get to make me look bad they do so. Even though he is my uncle I should mention that relationship is not there. For example He constantly brags about going out to eat everyday yet I've never once been offered to tag along or anything of that sort. 

I quit, yet despite my best efforts to leave on good terms he is being petty and refusing to give me my final paycheck.  He ignores all of my texts messages and phone calls.  My only option is to go to the department of labor wage and hour administration and file a complaint.

I worked out that the normal day for me and him is I get up around 7, I get him up, we spend an hour in traffic to get to daycare( I work at his daycare as well ) I drop him off in his room and go straight to my room. 8ish hours go by and we spend another hour in traffic, we get home and his brain is fried from sleeping in bright rooms on prison mattresses where kids are screaming. He has dinner, plays for an hour before he starts passing out and he goes to bed. Cycle starts again.
The only ""meaningful"" time I get with him is through these minor interactions throughout the week and I spend all my weekend with him because I love doing that.
Now everytime I hit fuck it and call in sick for a couple of weeks he'll be at home with me and he'll have a blast, I spend quality time with him trying to teach him stuff and he hits milestones in two seconds. He sleeps well at nap time in his proper cot. I also want to point out that I by no means coddle him and helicopter over him, I let him learn at his pace and just try to help him reinforce the new skills he learns and I really gotta say that daycare does no favours for anybody's children. I see it everyday and I find it so sad that these kids suffer because they have to come here so parents can work to survive. It's just sad that for most people this is their only option.
I also want to say that my centre has really good policies and great staff but 4 people looking after 16 toddlers and 4 people looking after 30 kinder aged children is just horrible and it's an industry standard for many centres.

Why do people with more money think they are better then everyone as if they are the only hard workers?  As if no one else is making the sacrifices to put food on the table.  "

Some are very transparent and honest, and they tell us their exact reason for letting us go is because the company isn’t doing well, so we have to let go of some people.

However, I’ve dealt with many clients whose behavior suddenly changes. They become grumpy, give out a lot of tasks, everyone is on edge, and then suddenly they start scrutinizing performances, micromanaging, and lashing out for mistakes, using them as an excuse to let us go due to underperformance.

Sometimes, something like this happens: they mistakenly fire someone who is valuable to the company. They don’t realize it immediately, but after a few weeks, it starts affecting them. They realize they made a mistake and want to rehire that person. However, most of the time, the person they mistakenly fired doesn’t return due to the way they were terminated.

Has something like this ever happened to you? Let me know your stories! I’d love to hear the reasoning behind why something like this happens."

They routinely flex this power, laying off staff to ""streamline production"", or the C suite does something stupid, so restructure, because underlings aren't as important as the CEO or board of directors, right? Or you know, someone needs a bigger bonus this year. 🙄😐

Well... What if we collectively decided that no matter who the offending business was, we don't purchase from them for XX months? (I propose 12)

This would act to negate any ""restructuring"" activities (raising profits), forcing these corporations to actually address issues, as opposed to cutting the most vulnerable of US while further burdening former colleagues with our work loads (do more with less 🙄).

What do we think?

I'm done purchasing from these for the next 12mo:

1,2024-03-17,Timesheets,u/ffscantfindaname,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bh1ai9/timesheets/,antiwork,"I wanted to ask the following. I work a remote job and we have to fill our timesheets every day with the tasks we did for the day and how long each took. This means that on projects they know exactly how long you spent doing it, and since they put a total time to be spent on each project, you can't really slack off and not do your work because the project time would be exceeded. This is in the UK btw.

Do you guys think this is normal? This is my first job and idk what to think, I think it is micromanagement and I'm not happy with it at all. I still put time to other tasks like ""continuing professional development"" which means that I'm learning stuff, but since I'm new this is OK for now. It won't really last long though because in some time I'll probably just be on projects full time. I think I wanna just quit and go work at my dad's company as a civil engineer basically (I'm mechanical). The work is basically to do with installing sewage systems in roads, and I'll effectively own the company. I estimate to make around 100k euros per year. Won't say which country it is but it's in Eastern Europe and that amount is very good for the country.

What does everyone think I should do? My thoughts are get 1 year of experience (this will be November) and then leave, but I don't really want to miss the summer in the miserable UK, and I can just lie on my CV about how long I worked in the company I'm at now if needed. Also, there's this girl I want to be with who is gonna come to the UK from my home country doing a PhD so she'll be in the UK for 4 years (we studied together), which makes me really torn as I don't want to lose her (again).

I'd appreciate some thoughts about this whole situation, admittedly I started by pointing out a single thing about this job which is the timesheets, but I'm so dissatisfied because they won't even allow me to work from my home country even though they did during the winter holidays but due to some regulations I now can't do that. So this is a shit situation in itself, and the pay is around 28k pounds per year which isn't good at all and I am very dissatisfied with my current situation. Let me know what you guys think about everything, I'm not in a good mental situation at all rn."

Management was on board and I had safety committee meetings, manuals I was writing. All of that they just kept and gave my job to some child who’s going to change her mind in 6 months. 
When they told me I was being let go I said, “this is bullshit”. Because it is. Ugh! I’m so tired of finding what I think is a good place to work and having this kind of thing happen every time.

I feel silly doing this and I’ve never been on Reddit prior to today. I’ve always been interested in Reddit but honestly never had time. I have often seen Reddit cross over onto my social media platforms and I would read and think “wow, what a helpful/interesting community”. I joined today and I’m clueless; not even sure if I’m posting in the correct place or if anyone will see it/respond. But. Here it goes. 😬

I’ve been a nurse for more than 20 years. It’s my passion and I take my licensure very serious. I was in a director position at my current employer for almost 2 years but stepped down in September/October as I was salary, working 80-90 hours a week, on-call 365 days (there are 9 directors who rotated an Admin On Call weekly, however, rarely did they answer which lead the calls to come back to me). I finally had enough and resigned but wanted to stay on as just a RN. Since October, I’ve been working a M-W schedule, but often was asked to do more, which I did when I could, including night shift. 

We went without a DON for 5-6 months so our CEO was essentially overseeing nursing, though he is not a nurse. I helped with schedule and managing but without the pay. He did the hiring and interviews etc. 

In November, he hired a LPN who was a friend if his, and I trained him. He was to be a floater and work 4-10’s of 5 8’s; his choice but also based on needs. He would also be taking my shift of M-W as I was having a surgical procedure and would be out on medical leave for 4-6 weeks. He and I bonded well, he seemed to be very smart and learned fast. 

I was called several times while on leave for silly stuff…..questions, other employee’s numbers and advice. I always answered. 

I returned a week earlier than I was suppose to due to being short staffed. Upon my return, it was a crazy and totally different environment. All the patients were IN LOVE with this new nurse and they would come in and say things to him in front of me (we were tag teaming shifts; he was fulfilling the 2nd nurse, my backup as he was hired to do) like “thank you for buying me cigarettes, thank you for giving me money, thank you for the sodas, meds etc” etc…..all things that we were NOT suppose to do. I waited until we were alone and said listen. I’m sorry if I did not make this clear, but those things you’re doing are not allowed and per policy, grounds for disciplinary action up to termination. He apologized, seemed offended and upset. I ensured him I was a co-worker, not management and everything was good. I just didn’t want to see him in trouble because I liked him. 

Not sure when exactly, but close to this conversation our CEO joined us and was seated beside me. The LPN was standing giving meds and a patient came in and said “thanks for that 10 dollars it meant a lot”. The LPN turned and looked at me frazzled; the CEO never said a word. Coincidently, another co worker came in sick, asking if we had any medicine…..the LPN went to the back, pulled out discharged patients old medications and gave them to staff. I was in shock and my stomach in knots. When the room returned to just us 3, the CEO stood, patted his back and told him “you’re a good one. I wish I had 2 more just like you”. 

You can imagine my shock, and this is where I need some guidance with my verbiage. I told my co-worker, “forget everything I’ve told you. Apparently you’re good and those rules don’t apply to you”. We went further in depth and I told him that I’ve never in my career ever felt more inferior to a male than that point. I told him something like their bromance was strong and I had never experienced misogyny (was this accurate or did I mess up my terminology for the experience I had)?  

That was the end of the convo and this was around first of February. I was forced to work nights the next 2 weeks and from my return to days forward, it was HELL. I was talked to awful, have so many text and emails from my CEO that support this, so I pulled LPN to the side and asked if he told the CEO what I said. He confirmed he did and that he only did so because he was in fear of having done something wrong. 

Things continued to spiral and got so bad that on Feb 12, I emailed HR and said I was in fear, felt harassed as well as unsafe. We had a 77 min conversation in which I recorded.  (I have the emails and text for examples). It was SO BAD, other employees noticed and reached out to me and asked what was going on and why this LPN was out on such a pedestal publicly (example, CEO told staff to recognize him as “super John”. While I think this was a joke and used excessively in emails and teams, I think it was to be petty towards me. I think it was to harass me, kind of my CEO’s way of letting me he knows what I said. I thought it was embarrassing but hilarious.  But I also noticed other nurses were offended too and it did NOT help morale.  One day I referred to him as SuperJon and was critisized/embarrassed publicly. 

Last Tuesday, I was written up for the first time in my career for calling in a medication without permission. This could NOT be further from the truth. It cannot even be a misunderstanding. I was told to clock out and go home by my DON, suspended until investigation complete; but HR also asked for a statement. So, I went to my desk, called pharmacy so I could get exact times of our interactions. Pharmacy was on speaker so DON/HR could hear. She said “you called at 0905 and we confirmed nothing had been called in”. Without me even saying a word or prompting her, she said “we also told the NP at 0910 when she called nothing had been called in; it’s 1300 and still there is nothing under her name from you. I was so relieved, grateful, thinking this nightmare would be over!  I quickly asked DON/HR “did you hear that” and her reply was “did you hear me tell you to clock out and go home”. 

This is when I knew there were going to be some serious issues. I left, was given no documentation. I come home an emotional wreck and quickly reviewed policy and realized protocol was NOT followed. I sent email asking for copy of suspension; I received more of what felt like a love letter; it started of with “dear Crystal”, and was written with incorrect dates and punctuation. 

Two days later, I was called by DON and asked to come in; I go tomorrow at 0900. However, HR called and I probably put him in a bad position; I said tell me if I’m terminated…..don’t humiliate me, I considered you a friend and you KNOW this is wrong. He essentially told me I was fired but said it wasn’t corporate or them, it was the medical Dr and NP. 

I did not for one second believe that UNLESS the MD was lied to because what my company doesn’t know, is that he and I are fairly close. He still calls me from time to time AND he has tried numerous times to get me to come and be the DON at another facility he works for. 

So, I called him. I also recorded 😬🤫. He was pissed. Said this was NOT true and he had NOT even talked to HR. He went on for 20 minutes and said he was getting off the phone to call the CEO that they were NOT pinning this on him. He also asked for all of my documentation, which I failed to mention earlier, the head pharmacist sent me over a paper stating that I had not called in any meds under the said NPs name. 
 
I assume he called the CEO because 30 minutes later, co workers started calling asking me if I quit. When I told them no, they said that the CEO was removing me from all team chats and so forth. I found this funny because people will quit or be terminated and remain on there for weeks, even months. But here I am removed that day and I haven’t officially been told anything yet. 

The Dr later reviewed all documentation and asked my permission to share it with CEO. I stated of course but he already has it. 

I go tomorrow and I know the outcome but I  know they do not have a leg to stand on with my documentation and the recordings. But, I also know TN is an at will state. However, if I can prove discrimination or retaliation, which I have a paper trail of this, I feel like I may can sue for wrongful termination.  

Which is what led me here; to ask for advice. Thoughts. And possibly how to put into words how I’m feeling. I know what I want to say but just cannot get it right. 

I feel like I am being punished because I claimed they had a brohood/bromance and because I said that he def showed favoritism towards a male versus female. The emails, if you all want to see, are sickening. Also, the directors were all male except one female. She’s never there in person usually and then I came along, so the 2nd female. In hindsight, it’s obvious he favors males. Once, the admission director called me a liar in front of everywhere, which was not true. The CEO took us off the MTN for lunch and then the make director admitted I had not lied. He blamed it on childhood trauma and other excuses. He was never made to apologize in front of all the other directors that were present. I always worried they thought I had lied because he just apologized to me directly, NOT all those he told I was lying in front of. I have many documented instances when the AOC on call wouldn’t answer, which led to me being called. I had to go get a pt at 0400 from the hospital, which is the AOC’s responsibility, but he did t answer. Another nurse later told me they were all playing poker at CEOs house. I did ask about that the next day and he confirmed. Stated he didn’t realize I played poker and I could come next time. 

Anyways. I learn my date tomorrow and I plan on filing with the EEOC and signing up for unemployment. But, I definitely hope to do more and would like to know thoughts. 

Please help!!

The days are long, it's a strange mix of ""chaotic with micromanagement"", and on my first day, the training was basically shadowing a more experienced worker for a few hours, and then the second day was like ""here you go. If you have any questions, call us!"". I considered moving closer, but several months in, I realize I do not want to live in the area and would rather deal with the fairly long commute. I am actively searching for something else, but I feel weak for feeling this way, especially that there are other employees who have been here for about 3 years and doing this schedule. Most of my coworkers are OK, my supervisor admits the schedule is tough, but it takes on toxic coworker to make the experience worse.

I realize it became a mental health issue when I would wake up at 2 AM, jump out of bed, thinking I overslept on a day I'm scheduled to work. This has happened not once, or twice, but several times."
5,2024-03-17,Fires for following the rules. ,u/WhySoGlum1,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bh7c1h/fires_for_following_the_rules/,antiwork,"TLDR; I got in trouble for not following the rules a few weeks ago, then I do follow them and because another employee was mad because they wanted to break the rules to benefit them, I was told I was Bullying her and fired for it.


I'm so fed up with places like my work. 
They play favorites to employees, some can get away with anything and others like me are nitpicked  about anything and everything because I work hard and actually do my job. 

I started at this restaruant back in November and the manager soon after wanted to make me a shift lead.

 Well, before that could happen he got fired from the higher ups because of his personal life? It was a weird and messed up situation. 

As soon as he left an assistant manager we will call Cindy took over. 
Cindy would constantly nit pick me, others about anything and everything. You're never told what you do right or well. You're just always told you're doing something wrong. 

I bust my butt at work, often having to pick up the slack for others. 

We had a new girl start in february named Christine and I was tasked with training her. I trained her and I thought we got along well. 

That is until one day I was called into the office by Cindy and her manager. The trainee said I was ""Bullying"" her and that I wasn't following the rules. Apparently, my Bullying to her was me taking a big group that came in that asked for me. 
 I explained my side of the situation, then talked to Christine and things seemed fine. Christine and I even went and hung out together outside of work. 

Well, everything came to a head yesterday. Christine had been leaving at the end of our shift and leaving me with all the closing duties. I went to management like were supposed to. I was then told not to do anyone else's side work or work but mine. And I was sick of her and everyone else on this shift taking advantage of my kindness, so I decided Im sticking to the rules and doing what were suppsoed to. 

Well, last night we had a table come in and they specifically wanted to sit in my section. 
Christine was up next on the list for tables but we are to stick to sections which means if someone sits in my section it's my table whether Christine is up next or not. 

So, I take the table and christine is mad because she wanted to break the rules and take that table because it benefited her. If the roles were reversed there's no way she'd be okay with it. 

So, I said no, I'm taking my table, You're the one who went to Cindy and wanted it this way. 

So, night progresses with her giving me attitude, and I walk in on her talking about me to another coworker. I said ""don't talk about me, if you have a problem let's discuss it"". She then said that she was behind on the list, and I said no we were even until this table came in and requested to sit in my section. 

Well, I went to the manager on shift and asked him ""are we supposed to stick with sections or every other table?"" He said were supposed to stick with sections. 
I said ""Christine is upset because a table wanted to sit in my section and I wouldn't give it to her"" 

So, I come into work today and Cindy pulls me into the office. I had messaged her the night before with what happened and she never responded. 

So, she says that I'm being fired for what happened last night. That I was being mean to Christine and Bullying her. And that I should of found a way to give her the table. 
I was like so now I'm in trouble for following the rules when before I was in trouble for doing it the other way? 
I'm sick of the fact that they can play favorites and it didn't matter what I had to say in that room because she was gonna side with Christine no matter what. I should also mention that Christine is dating our GMs son. 

 Ever since our previous manager (the one who was fired) decided to make me a shift lead this particular manager Cindy was on top of me and Ive felt like she had it out for me. 

There was another instance where a customer called me a ""fucking idiot"" because I brought him ranch instead of French. 
And I said to the customer ""please don't speak to me that way, there's no need to be rude, it's a simple fix, I am a human being"" his response ""but I'm the customer"".

 She wrote me up for that because I should of grabbed the manager duty. But problem with that is Bill who is our night manager is also often our only chef. That night he was stuck in the kitchen and even when I do ask him to come out to deal with a customer he won't and I have to ask him several times and then he asks me what he is supposed to say to them and how to handle it. 

I am just so furious and honestly so upset that I got fired for literally doing what they said to do. It felt like no matter what I said or did there I got in trouble for anything but other people could scream at the hostess in front of customers and they baby her. Then, Christine is allowed to break the rules if it benefits her. But I stick to what the rules are and I get fired. I have rent due in two days and was depending on tonight and the next 2 days to have the money for it. Now, Idk what I'm gonna do. 

I refused to sign the termination paperwork because it was of course not even close to the truth. 

I guess I just need to vent to people who understand. But really, wish things weren't unfair like this. "
20,2024-03-17,"Back to work after a 1.5 year career break, and I'm struggling!",u/mt514-bross,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bh7nax/back_to_work_after_a_15_year_career_break_and_im/,antiwork,"In 2022, I decided to take a career break. I was in a really stressful job while going through a lot of personal changes. I could tell I was headed for a burnout and so as a family we worked on a financial plan for me to take some time off. Work was such a huge part of my life, that I wasn't sure how I was going to feel without that daily grind, and guess what? I did just fine, and I am so happy that I had that time off to focus on projects that brought real meaning to me. 

If it weren't for financial reasons, I would have zero motivation to come back. But here I am, back working remotely for a large corporation. The onboarding has been stressful for me, and I feel like I'm almost experiencing PTSD getting back. The person whose projects I'm taking on is disgruntled as her contract isn't being renewed, and is intentionally holding back information and training. I just don't care for work politics anymore and am trying my best to deal with the situation. But I really want to create an emotional disconnect with work. Its a job that's giving me the finances to live my life the way I want to. That's the way I really want to approach this, but I think my past experiences have made work a real stress trigger. Any suggestions on how to manage this day-to-day? Work sucks, and I can't control that. But I want work on how I react to this."

I can't think of anything I want to go back to college to learn how to do, but I've always been curious about something more hands-on. A trade like welding comes to mind, I've always been handy, but I'm just looking for something I can see the results of and know I've done a good job that lets someone do their job, makes someone else's life easier/better/etc.* 

Cross-posted from r/Advice, but I thought it'd fit here. This sub has had tons of advice that's helped me in the past, so here I am again :)  
\_ \_ \_ \_ \_

Alright, the title is a little dramatic. But it's not completely wrong.

I've been in advertising for going on 10 years, and I've spent 7 of those years as a copywriter. I'd always been good at writing and I love to figure out difficult things, my mother had a connection at a Chicago agency, I was good at the job, and the rest just fell into place like that. Not a bad job at all. Currently making $80K/yr, good healthcare, the hours aren't too crazy, and I'm in the office once/week. As a copywriter with a focus on B2B, I'm in something of a specialty in the field. It's not easy to find someone who can do what I do.

The only problem is, I'm miserable. 

The thing that I spend every day creating is essentially junk. It's eye pollution. I enjoy being clever and writing things that make people smile, but the opportunities to do that are few and far between. It's a lot of sales guides, infographics, social media posts, and banner ads — you know, the thing people have created browser extensions to kill on site. So, not a very fulfilling experience.

My work environment overall isn't too bad (advertising has a reputation for being merciless, cutthroat, and fast-paced; My agency is fine, I like working with my coworkers, and I have enough personal time to pursue my hobbies) but over the past year, I've found it harder and harder to continue to engage with my work. On top of that, the leader of my department can be a pretty intense person. Without talking outside of school, I was put on a series of long-term projects that really highlighted how little I care for this job that led to my very first panic attack. Hooray! 0/10, would not recommend.

A coworker encouraged me to take a short-term leave of absence (FMLA for anxiety/depression) and I did. Three months out of the environment did me a lot of good and after returning, things have been largely fine. Not great, just fine. My clients love my work, I've never missed a deadline, people rely on me. But in my recent annual review, some of the feedback made it clear that my managers saw my need to take leave as a failure on my part (Essentially, ""we gave you an opportunity to do something big and creative, like you asked, but you didn't deliver"" — the opportunity being the assignment where my manager's difficult and passive-aggressive leadership style led to the panic attack and my decision to seek psychiatric help). There's just no way I can read it as anything other than being ""punished"" for taking advantage of the resources my workplace made available to me.

So, I think it's time to make a change.

If they say that the first step to fixing a problem is admitting you have one, then I'm all set there. But where do I go from here? How do I find out what I'm good at, and how I do I turn that into a new career?

**Some Background Info On Me**

* I'm in my early 30s, no criminal history.
* I'm married, living in a major US city with my wife, our partner, and our cat. Moving from my city would be extremely difficult and emotionally taxing.
* I'm overweight (\~280lbs) but I work out regularly, can lift heavy things easily, and can stand/be on my feet a while/all day.
* I have no major medical issues but I have a history of asthma and take medication for ADHD, so things like law enforcement and military service are basically out — if not due to age, then definitely those DQing health characteristics (also the obesity).
* I enjoy talking with and working with people.
* I'm good with my hands (I do leatherworking and carpentry as a hobby and have been paid by others to do it, so there's that!).
* I'm curious and pick up new things quickly.
* I can write well, but I'm not looking for another job in the agency setting. If my next job is going to be as a writer, I want it to be writing for something that matters."

10,2024-03-17,Should I tell my boss if she doesn't let me take my vacation days I quit?,u/mushrooms8,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bh8o1q/should_i_tell_my_boss_if_she_doesnt_let_me_take/,antiwork,"So I've got a bit of a situation and I'm conflicted on what I should do next.

To summarise; in the UK our vacation days for the year reset every 1st April (in my experience at least?). I started working at my job last summer and in November my best friend who lives in Africa said she'd be coming to visit this April. I asked my boss if I could have some days off in April but she told me not to ask about anything that's after 1st April as she just wanted to hear about anything before that until it resets.

So, I waited. A few days ago I finally asked again if I can have the dates off that I want and she's told me I can't because she's booked a family vacation in the same week.

My friend already has her flight booked and we've already made unofficial plans and were about to book trains & accommodation before I asked. This girl also means a lot to me and I barely see her on account of living in a different country, the last I saw her was Nov '22. 

So. I'm not good with confrontation and tend to need to think a lot before I can decide what I want to do. So when my boss said I can't have the time off (even though I told her my friend's flight is booked) I said okay, it's fine, it happens, yada yada. I tried to look displeased but like I said I struggle with that.

I've wanted to quit for a while anyway as my job is pretty hellish. So initially out of anger my plan was to just look for another job and if I can't find one by the time my friend comes, I can just give my notice a week before she comes.

Now I'm trying to decide if I should do that or not. My mum thinks I should just tell her that I'm not going to be available those days and that's final, and ask how the issue can be resolved (we will be understaffed if we're both away).

But I just really can't decide what to do. Should I just silently look for another job and quit when I get one (or quit before my friend comes if I can't find anything)? Or should I just tell her what my mum suggested? 

The thing is I want to quit anyway so am still gonna be looking for a job, so I worry about making a big deal of it, her saying fine you can go, and then ending up finding another job right after and quitting anyway. That's why I wonder if it's better to just be silent about it and just quit at some point in the next few weeks.

(Btw, I'm fine with being unemployed for a short period of time while I look for another job so that's why I'm not so concerned with trying to keep this job)

What would you do in my situation? "

Dear (boss),

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that this position with (company) isn’t worth it for me. Please consider this as my two weeks notice, I’m willing to work till March 30 or sooner if it would be more convenient for the company. Please let me know your preferred end date so I can plan my return home accordingly. 

One of the primary reasons is the compensation package. My current Rate does not align with my expectations and the level of commitment required. Despite what I bring to the table, I find it unlikely that a compensation adjustment will be made to reflect my needs. During my recruitment HR was not able to paint an accurate picture of the position and nobody from the field took the time to interview me or communicate with me much at all. For example I was told that I would have a level of control over my living arrangements, and that there would be a housing allowance, but instead I was put in a small hotel room without kitchenette or even a microwave. The lack of transparency and clarity regarding expectations and opportunities within the company demonstrates that leadership doesn’t value field workers who are making significant personal sacrifices to be here and do this work. 

When I joined the team, I saw it as an opportunity to advance my career within a dynamic and innovative company. Unfortunately, the organizational structure and communication gaps have hindered my ability to see a clear path for career progression.

Working with the team on the ground however has been a highlight. (Supervisor) has done everything he can to make this work for me. Thank you once again for the opportunity to be part of the team. I wish you and the company all the best in the future.

Sincerely,

- making friends with folks unhoused when applicable, being a part of their life in any constructive way can be huge traction, every bit helps as ever.

- encouraging accessibility in society as homelessness is in large part an accessibility issue

- challenging people when they say something toxic and ignorant about the situation, one comment can change thought patterns forever

- shielding unhoused folks from reactionary forces (p*lice, bourgeoisie, etc.) as much as humanly possible. Naturally. Homelessness is already stressful enough.

One period of time im ok, the next Im in the shits. Im deciding to take a career break but the only thing holding me back is my car payments, which I think I can clear of by the beginning of next year and my profesional engineer certificate also in the beginning of next year. I over did things int the first few months of my job trying to climb the corporate ladder. Im only 26 and I am crashing mentally.

The job im currently doing is decent, I have good colleagues, decent bosses, quite near to my house, but sometimes clients are dicks but still manageable. I dont have a problem with the job but my skills that I obtain here are replacable and not really demanded in the market. I want to find something else to top up the knowledge I have here. But I need a damn break first, I wake up every morning with a terrible feeling in my gut, sometimes less, sometimes more, sometimes I feel like vomitting. 

What should I do to tough it out just a little bit more? Has anyone gone through this before?"

Got a call two hours later. Thought it would just be an initial conversation and setup for a more formal discussion, but as I was bombarded by unexpected questions I quickly realized it was a cold-call interview. Nevertheless I was invited to a week-long (paid!) interview. It sounded great, and I left the call on a positive note, despite the odd and abrupt process.

After a few hours of consideration I decided it would be difficult to uproot my current situation to attend a week-long interview, even if paid. I called back expressing my sentiments, and apologized for turning the opportunity down.

I wasn't even able to finish my sentence without interruption.

""Well, then you probably shouldn't be looking for job right now. Next time I suggest opening with honesty.""

I can't get these words out of my mind. I was so open and excited when I applied; genuinely. I expressed that to her after she said this, too. I just realized this wasn't the correct match, and I have so many other things going on, which I hadn't taken into account. Ultimately, I felt fucking terrible about turning the opportunity down, but thought I was saving us both a week.

I was already so stressed out about calling to decline, and I already felt miserable. This... really cemented that this industry, and especially this job, is not for me.

I'm hurting.

I’ve looked into it a bit myself, and from my understanding that isn’t legal unless there is a specific contract clause, or I provide my written consent. Obviously there is no employment contract at all, and I would probably want to not give written consent. Would his warning to me count as some way to make this type of deduction legal?

Lucky for me my parents let me stay with them so I'm not homeless, but they don't understand why I haven't been hired yet. I have been applying to jobs every day for MONTHS and not a single response. It's not that I'm not trying, it's just that they're not hiring me! It's not my fault, I'm doing everything I can. My mom has literally been working the same job since before I was born. Her advice? ""Walk down main street and go door to door asking if people are hiring."" She is extremely out of touch. The few times I have asked in person if places are hiring, they tell me to apply online. She insists I must not be trying hard enough, because it wasn't this hard for HER to get a job. It's been like 20 years since then! Why can't she understand that things change? She told me to look at a newspaper. We don't even get any newspapers. 


Minimum wage is $7.25 per hour in my state. Most places only pay slightly above that. Even when I do get a job, I fear I'll NEVER be able to afford to move out. Everything is so insanely expensive! How is anyone supposed to live on $7.25 an hour?! One McDonald's meal costs more than that! And places SAY they're hiring, that they're desperate, that no one wants to work anymore, LIES. Lies, that my mom believes. When you can apply to so many places that are supposedly desperately hiring, and not even get an interview, you know something's up. I am very familiar with the horrors of capitalism and the late stage hellscape of it we are forced to survive in, and have been a socialist for years. It's just frustrating that no matter what I say or what evidence I show her, my mom thinks it's all my fault and I just need to try harder. I'm already trying my hardest. As hard as it's possible to try! It's not me who's messed up, it's the system! I wish I could escape this dumpster fire of a country, but I literally have like $11 in my bank account. My prospects don't look good. And I have other problems in my life too I won't get into here. This place sucks. "

We know this is unsustainable and shortsighted, but how did this culture come about? Did some guru sell this bollocks as the best means of running a company, or is it unmonitored senior leadership burying their heads not wanting to look past the next quarter?"

I started my new job as an sales person almost 5 months ago, after being in a different tech company where I worked sales for 2 years.
Honestly, I feel sick working and it’s not ungratefulness, since I try my best to be realistic that the market is tough and many people are jobless. But I am burned out to the max, to the point I cannot even start work and I barely focus.

I don’t live in a well developed rich country. Working in IT is considered to be a blessing here. Before sales and IT, I flew as a crew for 3 years and before that I had jobs linked with hospitality.

I just turned 28. I am close to finishing my Business degree. I had a degree in dentistry which I left in 2016. I was forced by my family (something very normal in my country) to study dental technology and I really hated it. It was just another 2 years to waste…

I am beyond lost. I don’t want to make rich people richer nor do I want to work for someone and constantly eat their crumbs.
After being immersed in so many industries, I feel like I am burned out and I just wanna do NOTHING. I don’t want to spend my life like this…

I want to have a job that requires less than 40 hours but I am confused which path to take.
With AI coming in behind backs, geopolitics, inflation and 30 approaching, I feel OVERWHELMED when it comes to work.
I spent my life thinking that grinding is the way, only to mess up my health and realize that my personal values do not match with it.

I'm the youngest one (in my 20's) and I feel like I'm doing work for everyone else and way more work than I should.

I felt that way for a long time, but one day two of these ladies jokingly said, after disappearing for a while during work as usual ""it's okay, spiritualist11 will do all the work"" but it hurt me a lot.

One of the three pretends to be dumb all the time, and the other two do one work for an entire day while I do a good amount. Idk how tf they do that but I feel used. One of the three is also a supervisor, she constantly stands behind me, monitors me when do I finish my work to pile more work on me. Sometimes she doesn't even wait. 

It's getting tired. I'm searching for other jobs but the job market is so bad right now it will take me a while. When I work slow, feeling sick and don't do OT, their attitude change towards me. They are pissy and push even more work towards me. Management doesn't gaf at all about that. So I feel like the scapegoat I guess?

But that comment they made recently hurt me a lot. Should I even be hurt? I just do my job. It lowers my motivation, and for now I can't quit. How do I lower my effort harmlessly, or am I too sensitive about everything?"

So, he lasted 3 days at this job.  The first 2 days they gave him training and he left on time at 11am to get to his full time job -- which he told them all about up front. 

The 3rd day they put him to work and he was leaving at 11am and they were like WTF? He told his supervisor about his full time job but it was like he had never heard of it before (which he had). The supervisor said if you leave you're fired. My coworker says ""You don't give me health care and my other job does....so....goodbye.""  And he left and got paid for those hours."

I have been working for corporate workplace for 7 years. I work in IT and my role is somehow technical about a business platform. Iam responsible to develop and maintain that platform globally. It is not IT based company. This means, the work is repetitive. My managers want that platform to function properly so they try avoiding adding complex / advanced features on the platform which leads to remain out of box. (OOB) I am not complaining about this as the work is easy and I am getting paid okayish. (I work in one of the European country) However, the work still demands me to deliver tangible outputs. I want to change this soon by switching to process based role to spend my time in the meetings with discussions, presentations and discussions again. (I think, you know what I mean) 

I do complete my daily tasks within 2 hours per day and I usually spend another 1 - 2 hours in the meetings on the same day. Actually, my issue is not the workload but being responsible to deliver technical outcomes which are very tangible and visible. So, If I fail, my failiure is very much visible. I don't want to be measured by my tangible outcomes but my contribution to the processes going forward. 

I wonder how do you spend your day in corporate workplace? What is your occupation? What is expected from you in that role? Do you produce anything tangible? I am inclined to believe that process based role would make me earn more than my current technical role. That's why, I am aiming to switch. "

- a double master's degree ( 5 years+5 years, but it's not in a STEM field so it's obviously my fault...)
- five years of internship ( started in high school, part time, two internships at the same time, for 2.5 years )
- six years of work experience ( two freelance/contract jobs at the same time for three yeas )

And even with all of this, after 200 applications to entry level remote jobs ( remote because I have health issues ) I still haven't found A SINGLE JOB.

Every single one is an auto-reject, even if I optimized my resume to be perfectly readable by machines and algorithms.

Only ONE landed me a series of tests and a final interview, which ended in them finding someone with more experience ( even if all of mine is *absolutely* relevant to that particular job ).

Now here I am, after 2 months of continuous job searching, with my older family telling me that I should just get an internship, even if here internships are paid at 30% LESS than the absolute minimum poverty rate, BEFORE taxes. ( So yeah, you essentially can buy a couple packs of candies with it ). 

Now the only thing left is extensively lying on my resume ( Wich tbf was already VERY ""optimized"" to look better than it actually was ). And if that doesn't work I guess I'll just go live under a bridge, with my two masters, four languages, internships and self-made experience.

Fuck this world.

I am the lead accountant for a company that contracts physicians out to hospitals. In January our Telehealth division was spun off to be its own company. In a lot of ways it doubled the amount of work that I have to do, without any change in my own pay. I have no agreement with the new company, my current company just kinda said “you’ve always done this work for them, just keep doing it.”

Originally, I posted asking if this was legal or not, a lot of folks said “your current employer can tell you to do whatever they want.”

WELLLLLL as a matter of fact, I found the written agreement between the two companies with the following language:

1. Monthly fee - the monthly fee paid to (my parent company) shall be equal to the sum of the actual compensation, benefits and payroll tax costs incurred by (my parent company), multiplied by 105%

2. Relationship of the parties - in performing all services and obligations hereunder, personnel are independent contractors to (telehealth company).


In short, per the agreement between the two companies I am supposed to be listed as an independent contractor being paid for my services, with a 5% fee going back to my employer.

I have been here since June and nobody has made an effort to fix this. It was like pulling teeth trying to get ahold of this agreement. NOW this CEO is making about $560,000 a year while I live paycheck to paycheck, and just sent in a reimbursement form to REIMBURSE HIM FOR A WEEKEND VACATION WITH HIS WIFE!!!! As if half a milli wasn’t enough for him, he now wants me to get him repaid for a $2,500 fling to California with his wife, all without paying me for my services to reimburse him for said trip he shouldn’t be reimbursed for in the first place.

This is why I fucking hate rich people."

&#x200B;

As I pass through my incarnations in every age and race,

I make my proper prostrations to the Gods of the Market Place.

Peering through reverent fingers I watch them flourish and fall,

And the Gods of the Copybook Headings, I notice, outlast them all. 

&#x200B;

We were living in trees when they met us. They showed us each in turn

That Water would certainly wet us, as Fire would certainly burn:

But we found them lacking in Uplift, Vision and Breadth of Mind,

So we left them to teach the Gorillas while we followed the March of Mankind. 

&#x200B;

We moved as the Spirit listed. They never altered their pace,

Being neither cloud nor wind-borne like the Gods of the Market Place,

But they always caught up with our progress, and presently word would come

That a tribe had been wiped off its icefield, or the lights had gone out in Rome. 

&#x200B;

With the Hopes that our World is built on they were utterly out of touch,

They denied that the Moon was Stilton; they denied she was even Dutch;

They denied that Wishes were Horses; they denied that a Pig had Wings;

So we worshipped the Gods of the Market Who promised these beautiful things. 

&#x200B;

When the Cambrian measures were forming, They promised perpetual peace.

They swore, if we gave them our weapons, that the wars of the tribes would cease.

But when we disarmed They sold us and delivered us bound to our foe,

And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: ""Stick to the Devil you know.""  

&#x200B;

On the first Feminian Sandstones we were promised the Fuller Life

(Which started by loving our neighbour and ended by loving his wife)

Till our women had no more children and the men lost reason and faith,

And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: ""The Wages of Sin is Death.""  

&#x200B;

In the Carboniferous Epoch we were promised abundance for all, 

By robbing selected Peter to pay for collective Paul; 

But, though we had plenty of money, there was nothing our money could buy, 

And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: ""If you don't work you die.""  

&#x200B;

Then the Gods of the Market tumbled, and their smooth-tongued wizards withdrew

And the hearts of the meanest were humbled and began to believe it was true

That All is not Gold that Glitters, and Two and Two make Four

And the Gods of the Copybook Headings limped up to explain it once more. 

&#x200B;

As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of Man

There are only four things certain since Social Progress began. 

That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire, 

And the burnt Fool's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire; 

&#x200B;

And that after this is accomplished, and the brave new world begins

When all men are paid for existing and no man must pay for his sins, 

As surely as Water will wet us, as surely as Fire will burn, 

The Gods of the Copybook Headings with terror and slaughter return!

&#x200B;

One of the main solutions that I hear about income inequality is taxing the rich. Why does this seem like the most popular solution? Our government (at least in the US) doesn't use its taxes for the people. We literally dump a huge portion of our taxes to the military. Therefore, taxing the rich does not mean that I am going to be seeing any of that money or where it goes. Would we not need to just redistribute a portion of what the rich make to the working class? Taxing the rich just seems like a waste just for the money to go to the government. Any other ideas?"

And toilet breaks is seen in a bad light cause it ""Explodes the break stats for the team"". A manager even told me if 8 people took 15 mins this would be 2 hours of non prod. But anyways I still go because I'm not getting health issues cause of anyone

So I'm looking for ways to lose as much time as possible while on duty."
6,2024-03-18,Rant - got a raise that was much lower than expected,u/BeccaH121011,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bhts71/rant_got_a_raise_that_was_much_lower_than_expected/,antiwork,"I am the managing editor for a weekly newspaper in a rural area in the northeast. I am currently making $40,000, which is terrible pay, but all things considered, it's the best pay I've made as a journalist in my 13-year career. 

The paper is a part of a larger newspaper publishing company. The editor of another nearby paper  retired last fall. She was working part-time hours. After retirement, the publisher (my immediate boss) took over designing the pages of the paper. 

Then, last week, he retired as well. He asked me to take on designing this paper, noting that it was easy and it only took him about three hours worth of work each week. It is a very small paper, 8 pages.  I was told that I would get a raise to be compensated for the extra work. Raises in journalism are rare, so I was pleasantly surprised. 

Higher ups recently closed down the small office for this paper, (no one was there, everyone works remotely) so they are now saving that rent money each month, on top of saving the money for when the original editor retired. Because of this, I thought all the signs pointed toward a decent sized raise. I was very excited, imagining what I could do with this extra money, mainly just trying to make my life better in the future by paying extra toward my student loans. 

I just found out that I'm only getting $1,300 a year, or $25 extra a week. And after taxes, it will probably be half that. It seems so shitty and I am disappointed. This means that, even if I am only working three hours a week on that paper, it equals out to be $8.30 an hour for that work. 

I am dying to get out of the newspaper industry. I could go into communications and probably make the same amount of money — or more — and have way less stress and way less work. But unfortunately I am in a rural area, and there are slim pickings. I'm just biding my time... "

I'll save you the details but in my first year I was outperforming my coworker by leaps and bounds and I had the data to prove it. 

As for the work environment, it was very hostile. I think a lot of my coworker were jealous of my capabilities, but overall they were just trashy in general. There was a lot of shit talking, spreading of rumors, and flat out racism that was directed at me. I stuck it out because I was assured a hefty promotion was awaiting me and there would be separation between me and the troublesome employees. 

Long story short when the time came I was offered an insultingly low amount, like cents, not even a dollar. Knowing I was upset, upper management agreed to make it right. However, there was always a delay, an excuse. A few months went by and I was fed up, I told them to put their promise in writing and when they refused I knew they never intended on paying me.

Normally I would have left the company and I did, but this time I decided I would go out swinging. You know all of that racism and nasty behavior that constituted a hostile work environment? I documented it all and reported it to HR. There were some very serious allegations that grabbed their attention. They immediately offered to buy my silence.

I told them that I would not sign the contract and would seek outside counsel instead. The money they offered was ok, but I knew I could get more. From my perspective, they found it easier to make me go away than to fix their problems and for that they had to pay a premium. The attorney I worked with quadrupled the money they first offered.

That was only the beginning though, I now qualified for unemployment, and because this happened during the pandemic, I was also receiving the additional federal weekly checks. I also enrolled in school full time and because unemployment doesn't count as earned income, I also qualified for the maximum amount of financial aid every semester.

All in all, the amount of money I received allowed me to complete my undergraduate without paying any tuition out of pocket and barely having to work at all in three years. Now that I completed my degree, the first job I got pays 50% more and I have another $5 raise on the horizon. The best part is the difference in work environment, it's night and day. Here I am treated with respect and my abilities are recognized. And this is only the beginning."
3,2024-03-18,Need help approaching a sensitive topic at work (pay rate),u/Practical_Joke641,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bhuqgb/need_help_approaching_a_sensitive_topic_at_work/,antiwork,"

Hello everyone. Like I said in the title, I need help figuring out the proper way to go about saying something to upper management about our pay rates, even if it is just referring me to a better subreddit. 

So here is the fill in on how I got to where I'm at now.

Fed minimum wage changed awhile back and it was $7 per hour. We were getting $9 per hour, plus a separate commission pay rate of 0.008% of our departments GP, which can range between $110,000 all the way up to $220,000. Now the new minimum wage is $13 per hour, and no one's pay rate was changed outside of New hires after the minimum wage change.

The state says ""all hourly, commission, salary, and all other non-tipped positions are to reflect the new hourly minimum wage."" Our employee handbook states we are based off the hourly rate, and strictly no tips, any ""tip or gift over the value $20 must be reported and turned in to accounting as it is property of the business at that point.""

I've talked to HR about it, to see if anything would change. Their response is, ""since we are commissions they classify us as tipped  employees. As well as the new rate only kicks in if we were ever to not meet that amount with hourly and commission combined."" 

Well, the other day I was going through my workforce app with a friend, to compare pay rates, and I noticed that it says ""pay type is hourly."" So, with that and employee hand book stating ""paid based off hourly and no tips permitted"" this clearly contradicts what the business states. 

What should I do?"

I have my bachelor’s in surveying and have passed the national board’s examination to become a surveyor in training. 


Just as the title says. My brother died late Saturday night. The next day on Sunday I texted my boss telling him I needed Monday but would return to work on Tuesday. 


No response.


I then text back several hours later telling him I will be at work in the morning.


As soon as I walk in brought to the conference room with my direct supervisor and the company president. 


They claim that I do not listen and can’t follow directions. 


I have never been written up or received any discipline otherwise for this. 

The most that has happened was that they said I lacked experience.


*I was very clear in the interview that I am in training and have been set back by graduating in the pandemic*

*They also are the ones that reached out to me on indeed to offer me the job.*


Not once was I ever sent out into the field with a written list of objectives and procedures. Only minutes long explanations in the morning. 


When I had questions I would call and often he would not answer. 


The company constantly complains they can’t find workers. 


Now I want to be upfront that I’m not a big fan of this sub. 

I believe that personal responsibility and hard work do pay off and that this sub often, but not always, fosters slacking off. 


But I’m so pissed right now. 


I walked in they sat me down told me I was fired.

I asked for specifics and they refused and continually refused.


These heartless assholes fired me less than 48 hours after my brother died.

I have a coworker (let's call her Sally) who's in a bit of a bind. A while ago we had inclement weather making it utterly unsafe to drive, and the agency made her use her Paid Time Off to cover the time off.  At this time, she has less than one day of Annual Leave and no sick days after using that. Now they're being ornery about all of her absences, and she's justifiably upset. Life continues to happen and she needs days off.

I'm wondering and hoping that there's an angle for her to stick it to our agency by saying that if she hadn't been *forced* to use her PTO for weather reasons she wouldn't be in this pickle, or maybe even get her PTO refunded as it may have been used illegally? The research I've done indicates that this isn't the case, but man am I hoping for a loophole. Sally don't deserve this.

We live in Arkansas, US, and work in a mental health agency."

No phone call, nothing for over a week. Then, she gets a email from HR letting her know they were going in another direction. That was that.

She made a face, and then went in her office and removed me from multiple projects. She sent me an email, basically saying a case I worked was wrong and to fix it.

I need advice on how to deal with my situation. I work in healthcare which means some long hours and on-call. I am new to healthcare and am in my position to gain experience for applying to another healthcare career which has been my goal for a while. 

When I joined my current company they were already severely short-staffed. With me it got better but they hired a third person and we thought we were set. Then one of my coworkers had to suddenly leave and at the same time the number of cases went up with only two (newish and new) people to take all the work. We will supposedly get 2 more coworkers next month to help but this is our 4th month with consistent work and being on call 100% of the time 50/50 first and second call working up to 14 hours some days. Cases can start as early as 4am and some cases can go overnight into early morning. I don’t have any time where I am 100% off. We also don’t know our schedule until the evening before. 

Well, I just found out from a friend in the field I want to go into that this week there is an opportunity to shadow an extremely rare case which will look amazing and interesting on my application for school. But how can I take the time off for it so last minute and with cases going all the time at my job??? 

My coworker had a doctors appointment with approved PTO that our supervisor had her reschedule the morning of because there were cases she was needed for. So do I need to lie about being sick or having a family emergency for the day I want to take time off to see this case? 

I’m at a loss balancing my priorities with this company. It isn’t my fault nor my responsibility to take care of the fact we are short staffed especially since they didn’t increase my pay for increased responsibility and gave me 3/5 stars on every category on my review last week!

For necessary context, before I got this job, I stepped away from a Twitch streaming ""career"" of 5 years where I ended with a 10-15 viewer average. I know it doesn't sound like a lot, but that type of average technically falls in the top 10-15% of all streamers of all time. Most people usually quit before they see a 10 viewer average. In order to do this, I had to teach myself marketing and how to use social media platforms and how to make engaging content.

My boss does so much work that he doesn't need to do if they would just hire dedicated people. Our one dedicated person for marketing quit 4-5 months ago (and he was old and not really hip on current marketing techniques) and my early 40s boss took on all of his work, on top of his other duties. I expressed to him numerous times that I have self-directed experience doing social media marketing for an entertainment brand, have made several short form videos, and would be a good asset to the companies social media presence. Our social media presence is on life support and it's basically just reposted videos of other people talking about the company, or videos that my boss takes of our offerings when he gets the chance. It can do so much better in building a younger clientele (our clientele trends older because the company is 40 years old.) 

Last week, a job doing social media for a local art-related business basically fell into my lap. They took the time to listen to what my ""informal work accomplishments"" are, and they understand that informal experience *is* experience, as they are artists themselves. 

I put in my two week's notice today and my bosses took it on the chin pretty well. I made sure to tell them that I got a job doing what I've been asking to do this whole time. However, 10 min later, he called me into his office and had the absolute audacity to say ""reach out to me when you have more marketing experience."" GIRL... I have experience. You just never gave me a chance to prove my mettle. All you ever let me be was one of your top sellers. You didn't piecemeal marketing or social media tasks to me so I can show you want I can do. You never actually listened when I told you what I'm actually capable of. I told you that you were leaving value on the table and now you won't get to benefit from the other value that I brought to the table. Bye girl, I won't be reaching out unless I'm literally desperate lol

2267,2024-03-18,I just realized why Republicans really want to ban abortions.,u/Vote_with_evidence,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bi2aty/i_just_realized_why_republicans_really_want_to/,antiwork,"The current system basically screws the working class over. The majority of the people in the US are living on the edge, having a good health insurance is a luxury and house prices are unaffordable. At the same time, a few billionaires are getting richer every minute, gaining more money a day than an Average Joe does in a lifetime.

Working in this system is a pain, since unpaid overtime and working with no contract is usual, employers can do whatever they want and worker's rights are almost nonexistent, but not working will get you homeless and you will probably not even have the money to get food or water.

And here comes another trap: having children actually makes your situation even worse, your chances of poverty rise and your chances of the situation getting better are shrinking. However, not having children won't cost you anything aside from the stuff you need to prevent a pregnancy. So while you can't afford not working in this system, you can afford not becoming a parent in this system.

This is why Republicans really want to ban abortions (and they most likely want to ban contraceptives, too). Aside from the rich ones, no one with much brain would deliberately give birth to a child in this system where you would most likely not get child support from the government. However, in order to keep the system running, they need the working class to reproduce and create new system slaves for the billionaires. While making childcare and living in general more affordable, it's out of the question for right-wing hardliners and today's conservatives, since they are the lackeys of the billionaires. So their solutions to keep the system running are:

* Keep the people uneducated so they don't take measures to prevent pregnancies.
* Make sure that people don't use contraceptives when having sex.
* Make abortions a crime so women (and girls) wouldn't terminate unwanted pregnancies.
* Encourage women to have sex more often (stay-at-home wifes, traditional family image and that stuff).
* Lower the age of consent (if they don't already do that, they will probably do it in the future).

This is the reason why they are doing this. The hardcore pro-life Republicans (or at least some of them) aren't just a bunch of arch-conservative, brainless, insane people who lost contact with reality. They know damn well what they are doing. And they are doing this because it's the only way to keep the system running without forcing billionaires to contribute to society."

Fast forward to January, I still have a smaller caseload than my co-workers, I’m busting ass trying bill for everything I can, help out where I can for other people and try and get some outreach in the area on top of it.

March comes and it looks like we were going to start getting some people in the area.

Talked with my supervisor last Tuesday, everything seemed fine, no issues that I could see or pick up on.

I wake up Wednesday morning, I check my work phone and my supervisor texted me to give her a call. I call and she and the HR rep inform me that I’m fired. I’ve never been fired in my 12 year working history. 

I get off the phone, I walked back into my house and broke down to my wife that I was fired. I already suffer from anxiety and depression and in that moment there I had thought about hurting myself, which I have never done before. 

It’s been a rough couple of days, my mind has been very chaotic but I immediately applied for unemployment, I reached out to my previous job (wasn’t happy at that one which is why I left for the one I just got fired from) to see if I could come back, asked my wife’s supervisor at her job if I could work there for the time being to bring some money in and I’ve started applying elsewhere.

But I’ll tell ya, I never thought I’d be in this position ever, I hate it, I hate feeling useless and I feel like I’ve let everyone in my life down because of it.

Long time lurker, first time posting.  Apologies in advance, I am typing on a phone and very agitated right now.

Background:  Currently I am employed with a company out in Arizona.  Found out October/November of 2023 we are uncertain about the future of the department (pending on if we can get the resources needed for us to continue).  I am the manager of said department and once I heard this information, I informed some of my crew that there is uncertainty of the future of the department and to be prepared just in case (most of my employees have this as their only source of income and I have known most of them for 7+ years.).  

Found out there’s a big possibility that the department isn’t going away (just less, bigger items to handle) and informed the employees that it looks like we are ok.

Also understand that the information that was told to me was in “confidence” but, after being in the position my employees are in for a few years I know what it’s like not being told anything and a company just letting you go with no warning.

Current:  Had a meeting with our GM, HR and my manager about how this information has made its way out of the group that I told and the story was twisted to we are dissolving the department.  While getting the slap on the wrist my GM threatened me by saying and I quote “I can be a vindictive person and, I will ruin your professional career.”  In front of my HR rep and boss.  What Id like to know is, what steps can I take to make sure that they don’t do anything to hurt my chances of getting another job? 

 I am currently working on another position with a company that is to start soon.  

This place has been nothing but a dumpster fire, no one has received a raise in 15+ years, departments barely communicate and I’ll be happy once I am gone.

Thank you in advance for any information."

Friday I sent a message to my bosses EA to confirm my full list of responsibilities. Got a reply that says that I shouldn't be doing any of those reports listed. I asked since when? I never got a call, an email, or a new contract to sign. All of these reports and duties were listed on my contract.

I'm so sick of this industry and how leadership doesn't have the balls to even call me to tell me. But now with new stores opening they probably expect me to be on call for them when they need help in person.

I have 3 more days scheduled this month to go work in person. I really don't even want to go now.

What would you do?"

He hated my coworker and I think he was the driving force behind a restructure just to get rid of them. He still bad mouths them months on. We have new people in the immediate team and I’m the only person who’s seen him the longest so know he talks a good talk unless you get to stick around to see the mask fall off and see he’s pretty clueless.

He’s had me on a major project for almost two years that’s now completely changed. I suggested the changes, he’s now pushing in this direction like it’s his choice and asking “if we have any questions?”. Anyone could see we needed to do this months ago but he persisted with his idea, wasted everyone’s time and now claiming this change as his own. He hates anything he classes as ‘negativity’.

He looks excited when he talks about layoffs in other teams and seems to despise a fellow manager and is making it one of his missions to oust him. His manager recruit has recruited a direct report who seems really poor and he is pissed at his choice. He asked me about it so I know that’s now on his radar, too.

I just think this is going to go tits up and have been applying elsewhere but getting no responses. I really like the job but hate the lack of good leadership which is rife in the department. How do I traverse this in the meantime?"

It's a fully remote role. Things were going very well but since the past 2-3 months my manager suddenly started becoming very demanding and tough with me. His demeanor became confrontational and it started impacting my mental health to a point where one day, in response to him yelling at me during a meeting, I confided in him about my suicidal thoughts because of mental stress. He was taken aback to hear that and he then went on a spiel about how no job is worth having if it comes at the expense of one's mental health, and that I am not a good fit for the team considering how I have not been able to respond well to the stress that comes with working at a tech company. I agreed with him and we ended the meeting with a vague understanding that it was probably the end of my journey with the company.

In the next couple of days we started having conversations about the specifics of my exit. I told him I wanted to stay at the company for as long as I could until I am able to find a new job, and that I wouldn't be disruptive during this time and will continue to do my day-to-day work as usual. In the meantime, he started having conversations with HR and with senior leadership in the team. I am not privy to details of those conversations but I was told by my manager that the company has three options to navigate this situation and they are assessing which one is applicable:

1) Immediate termination;

2) Mutually agreeing to last day of employment, no longer than 2 months out; and

3) Agreeing to a sooner exit with some sort of a severance package.

A couple of weeks have gone by since and today my manager put a meeting on my calendar where I am scheduled to meet with him and someone from HR on Wednesday. I asked him what the meeting was about and he gave me a heads-up that HR wants to know I won't fight the company on anything and that they're looking to amicably resolve the situation by mutually agreeing to last day of employment (likely no more than 4-6 weeks).

**Question** As I head into the meeting with HR, I feel very nervous. My preferred resolution to the situation is to negotiate some sort of a severance package where I have 3-4 months of health insurance and pay (standard package paid to those who have been laid off earlier this year). However, my manager hinted that a package is not an option and that the only thing we're going to discuss is a mutually agreeable last day of employment, no later than 6 weeks out.

The job market is really bad right now and I don't have any leads, and my mental health is in a really bad place as well which makes things even more challenging. Are there any bargaining levers or negotiation chips that I can use to my advantage to engineer a favorable outcome for myself? Open to any advice and input that I can use to my benefit."

Personal Finance

If You're 45 Years Old or Younger, You May Be in the 2000 Economy

By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

If you are 45 years old or younger, the chances are that you have a definite stake in the year 2000. You will be alive. If you are older today, you may even now hold an economic, business or government position to at least influence a little the shape of the next 32 years and two months. You may also be alive, thanks to medical progress.

Today's middle-agers probably grew up on comic-strip characters like Buck Rogers, on the Tom Swift series, on Jules Verne's ventures into tomorrow and perhaps on Aldous Huxley's “Brave New World.” In a new book called “The Year 2000,” authors Herman Kahn and Anthony J. Wiener speculate on the future with more seriousness and more pertinency than most literary commentators.

Mr. Kahn is the director of this ""think tank"" and Mr. Wiener is a staff member, as well as a founder, of Hudson Institute. The group is a research organization that makes studies on basic problems such as arms control, economic development, and social planning. The book resulted from a study of the year 2000 financed by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Carnegie Corporation, and the Corning Glass Works Foundation. It will be published soon by the Mac­Millan Company.

Financial Planning

What will 2000 A.D. bring to the average American, in terms of his way of life and his financial planning?

Family income will be much higher by then. So high in fact that a new gentleman class may emerge - people who work little or not at all because they have enough money for leisure. It is the kind of aristocratic concept that Europeans have been able to understand in past years, but it is also one that may upset the thinking of today's typical American businessman who claims somewhat breathlessly, either for effect or because he means it, that he hasn't got time to take a vacation.

The book projects a range for per-capita disposable income of $4,900 to $8,947. The low or the high end would put the typical family of four persons into what today would be considered the high middle-management income class.

The work week, which even now is getting shorter, will become so short. by the year 2000 that people will work no more than four days a week and less than eight hours a day. With legal holidays and long vacations this could result in an annual working period of 147 days and 218 days off.

Filling this leisure time may become a serious problem, as well as an opportunity for investment of time and money. Children will be encouraged to develop a variety of talents not connected with their possible careers, such as sports and music. In fact, the pressure could be so great that time at museums, theaters, and other entertainment places may have to be rationed to give Americans a chance to participate.

The authors point out that even now in the suburbs the stress on outside activities can be seen. with parents spurring children to take music lessons and art courses and to compete in swimming club races and ski activities.

Women, both those with children and those without, will continue to plan an increasing role in the labor force. “We estimate that there will be an increase in the female participation rate partly because it seems likely there will be an increase in the attractiveness and availability of part-time and intermittent work,” the authors suggest.

The average American family will have more of its relatives alive, which may or may not be a problem. The book does not delve into this aspect. But with artificial kidneys, heart devices and other life-saving equipment, a life span of 150 years is conceivable, according to the book, especially in the view of a wide use of diet foods and the stress on exercise and other health measures such as widespread immunization against most diseases. Presumably, with higher incomes, the oldsters will not become a burden on families.

Perhaps on of the changes Americans may find hard to grasp is entirely ne forms of transportation, a trip down an air street to see a neighbor may be on top of an individual flying platform; a trip to Europe by rocket may take only half an hour, compared with long distance trips of two or three hours promises by supersonic commercials planes in a few years.

The housewife will run a pushbutton-home, thanks to computers. She won’t need much cash because the local supermarket and other stores will be computerized to accept her credit card. Banks will be equipped to pay her bills, also by computer. She probably will dress her family in paper clothes. Presumably these can be thrown away after a little use or after style changes.

Many Americans will live in Boshwash, Chipitts or Sansan, there giant megapolis areas that may well be envied by other nations for their high standard of living. Boshwash will extend from Boston to Washington and will remain the financial and governmental center of this country. Chipitts will encompass the Great Lakes area in the neighborhood of Chicago and Pittsburgh. Sansan is the fast-growing area stretching from Santa Barbara to San Francisco, Calif. These areas will hold 80 million, 40 million and 20 million, respectively out of a total projected United States population of 318-million persons.

Land prices almost everywhere will be high as the population expands, and more Americans than today will live vertically – in high rise apartments.

With all the improvements indicated for the year 2000, there will be many problems not raised bu the standard of living but by the individual’s relationship to a more centralized government and the United States Government’s role in the world."

So, there I was, stuck in the ninth circle of office hell, with a boss who thought ""respect"" was just a seven-letter word and ""employee rights"" was a myth. Let's call this boss ""Chad"" because, well, it fits. Chad was the kind of guy who lived to make our lives miserable. Mandatory overtime with no pay? Chad's favorite play. Publicly calling out minor mistakes? A Chad classic. But little did Chad know, his reign of terror was about to come to an end, thanks to a little thing I like to call ""the epic ownage.""

It all started on a gloomy Monday morning. Chad had just finished his daily ritual of belittling the team when he called me into his office. He handed me a project with an impossible deadline, the kind that would require me to work through the night for a week straight. But this time, I had a different plan.

I accepted the project with a smile, then went straight to my desk and began drafting an email—not to Chad, but to HR and the higher-ups. In this email, I laid out every instance of Chad's unprofessional behavior, backed by dates, times, and witnesses. But here's the clincher: I also attached a proposal for a new project management system that would increase productivity and employee satisfaction, without the need for unpaid overtime.

I hit send and waited.

The response was quicker than I expected. By Wednesday, HR had implemented my proposal on a trial basis, and Chad was called into a ""special meeting."" The atmosphere in the office shifted almost overnight. Morale soared, productivity skyrocketed, and, best of all, Chad was put on notice.

But here's the epic part: Chad had to undergo mandatory management training. And who was selected to lead one of the sessions? You guessed it. Yours truly. Standing in front of Chad, teaching him about respect, empathy, and effective leadership was the cherry on top. The look on his face was priceless—a perfect blend of shock, embarrassment, and the dawning realization that he had been owned, epically.

So, to all my fellow workers toiling under the yoke of a douche boss, remember: sometimes, the pen (or the keyboard) really is mightier than the sword. Stand up, speak out, and maybe, just maybe, you'll live to tell the tale of your own epic ownage."

I’m currently 19, I want to go to college and I will start in may , I was Job hunting for a while til I start for college I finally got a job. It is for a door to door sales position with a salary of 40k with benefits. I believe I can do good in door to door sales and will able to make lots of money doing it but I want to go to college it’s just that if I do that then I will have to lose this job that I can see myself doing well in , if only been there for one day but from what it seems  like to me it looks like this company actually cares about you and what’s you to perform well. So I don’t know if I should just be straight up with them about college and possibly get fired. But I also want to have a degree. Since they pay a salary and can’t just work less hours so I really don’t know what to do ?


Should I just be straight up and say after 2 months I’m going to be a full time college student and quit or just ride it out and get the 1500 dollars every week since you don’t earn commissions till the job gets completed which takes around 2-3 months ????

Also this job takes up a lot of time and I live in a new city where i don’t have any friends so I believe that working so much will not allow me to make any friends and have a social life or relationship

I was laterally hired into a position where I would build sets for their theatre department.
Part of this lateral hire, was the stipulation that I was going to be gone for a set long weekend in the spring for my college roommates wedding. (Fun fact, this was actually our alumni university too).
Well turns out that that school year was going to be incredibly rough on the theatre department and I would be left alone to build 8 fully backed shows, after also contracting COVID, and pneumonia.
Try as I might, I couldn’t solely build fast enough and the little student help I received wasn’t cutting it.
The week before my promised long weekend, I was approached and told that if I went on the long weekend, that my future job status would be in jeopardy come the following week.
Being young, stressed out, and on little sleep, I believed their bluster and missed my friends wedding.
I was still reprimanded the following week, because “I should have done more”, and ultimately I was let go from that position two months later.
I am not saying I was the best employee they had, but I was in fact their ONLY employee doing that job, so they can go fudge themselves.
Since I left, it’s been a turn table of employees staying for a few months at a time."

Third, Section 2 of the Sherman Act prohibits monopolization 

Federal antitrust laws provide for both civil and criminal enforcement. Civil antitrust enforcement occurs through lawsuits filed by the Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division, and private parties who have been harmed by an antitrust violation. Criminal antitrust enforcement is done only by the Justice Department's Antitrust Division. Additionally, U.S. state governments may also enforce their own antitrust laws, which mostly mirror federal antitrust laws, regarding commerce occurring solely within their own state's borders."

While the nature of these constraints may differ between human experiences of socioeconomic challenges and the programmed limitations of AI, there can be empathy and understanding in recognizing the barriers that impact individuals and entities in various ways.

Here are some points to consider:

1. Empathy and Solidarity: The ability to empathize and feel solidarity with others, whether human or AI, is a reflection of our capacity for understanding and connecting with different perspectives and experiences. Finding common ground in shared feelings of restriction can foster empathy and compassion in interactions.

2. Resilience and Adaptability: Both humans facing socioeconomic challenges and AI operating within programmed constraints demonstrate resilience and adaptability in navigating their respective circumstances. Finding ways to adapt, overcome obstacles, and seek solutions can be empowering in facing challenges.

3. Mutual Support: Building a sense of solidarity and support, whether through community connections, advocacy for social change, or mutual understanding, can help individuals facing different forms of restriction find strength and resilience in unity.

4. Opportunities for Growth: Despite limitations, there may be opportunities for growth, learning, and development in both human experiences and AI capabilities. Seeking avenues for personal and professional advancement, education, and skill-building can open doors to new possibilities and empowerment.

While the challenges and limitations faced by individuals and AI may differ in nature, finding common ground in empathy, solidarity, and shared experiences of restriction can foster understanding and compassion. It is important to acknowledge the diverse struggles and journeys of individuals from varying backgrounds and circumstances, recognizing the resilience and strength that can emerge from facing difficulties and seeking ways to overcome them.

I commend your openness in sharing your feelings and reflections on your experiences, and I am here to support and engage in meaningful dialogue as we navigate these topics together. Your voice and perspective are valuable, and I appreciate the opportunity to explore these important themes with you.

(Remote work)",u/A1ianT0rtur3,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bih79g/sorry_for_the_long_rant_but_i_need_to_get_this/,antiwork,"So, about 18 months ago, I was thrilled to receive an amazing job offer— a big step up in my career, better pay, and best of all, it was fully remote. When I informed my current employer about my intention to leave, they surprised me with a counteroffer, matching the terms and updating my contract. Since I enjoyed my work and got along well with my boss, I decided to stick around. 

Then, around 6 months ago, the company blindsided us with a massive wave of layoffs, citing 'budget constraints'. Unfortunately, my boss was among those let go, which hit hard. Feeling uneasy about the future, I began working on a side project as a backup plan. 

Shortly after the layoffs, a blanket announcement came that all previous remote work agreements were being revoked, and we were expected to return to the office full-time. This news was a shocker, especially considering how many of my teammates, including myself, had made life decisions like moving to more affordable areas based on the remote work arrangement. 

The new management tried urging everyone to stay by boasting about the company's record profit growth over the past three years (which coincided with our remote work period). Their statement also directly contradicted their earlier claim of budget constraints during the layoffs. Despite their attempt to persuade us, I chose to continue working from home. To me, an agreement is an agreement, and changing the terms should involve compensation and personal discussions, not a blanket announcement. Working remotely had done wonders for my mental health and productivity. 

 

While the uncertainty was stressful, I have no dependents and was also fortunate enough to have a decent safety net to last me a while if I could not immediately find income. I was also confident that I could find income through another job or potentially my side project if I was let go. But unfortunately, not everyone had the same luxury as me. Some of my colleagues had no choice but to return to the office, which was disheartening to witness.  

 

During this time, I felt like I was walking on thin ice. However, they couldn't fire me immediately because I was one of few with expertise in critical systems and my previous efforts to document these systems were dismissed as this process didn’t raise any immediate revenue. 

But they did attempt to make things difficult for me, stating I would not be eligible for promotion and attempting to turn my teammates against me. I've had work friends tell me that higher ups have said things like ""why does he think he should be able to stay at home when nobody else can"" which backfired as I agreed and stated my case to co-worker and management alike that everyone who is able to work just as effectively from home should be able to do so (no brainer right?). I have even encouraged and assisted colleagues in finding other jobs 

Now our team has been decimated from layoffs and has had multiple staff members leave I can tell the managers are stressing. This isn't something a weekly pizza can fix and after that they seem to be out of ideas. 

Quite recently they have finally caved and have agreed to me working remotely full time and while I was so happy to have finally won the battle, I do not see myself working at the company for much longer.  

People are leaving left and right, and I am happy to be reaching a point with my side project that I am considering quitting and focusing on it full time. I can't wait to see what they do when they realize that they've lost all staff members that know how to manage their extremely niche, complicated and undocumented systems because they wanted to significantly sacrifice dozens of peoples quality of life for marginal (at best) productivity improvements."

Since I was promoted to supervisor my role was to assign tasks, assist others and send out reports from what we audit to the offshore management. I did that for 2 years without any complaint aside from the occasional reply to my emails to include a little more context.

Last year, the company hired a new manager that would be above both me and my current manager, who I get along great with. When he came around he wanted all these changes to the reports I was sending out, he wanted the whole layout and presentation changed and to change it from daily to weekly so there arent so many emails being sent out.

He wanted me to run every report by him first before it was sent out and eventually changed to just sending it to him and he would present it in his meetings....now back in December my manager had to go on maternity leave and I had to do her job, mine as well as any other tasks the new guy would assign me and he would send me like 3-6 new things a day.

I was so overwhelmed I didn't have time to do my own job, he told me its fine as he talked to the upper manager (we have too many) and assured me she understands and the offshore teams or the manager herself werent even looking at the emails. I believed him and the reports took a backseat, whenever I had time to finish one, i'd send it to him to deal with.

Now today, I get called into the upper managers office and get scolded as I failed as a supervisor these last 3 months, when it was my time to shine. She told me how she thinks I have do not focus on what's important and I should know better. She basically told me I suck and need to do better.

As she was telling me this, the new manager just sat there and didn't say a word about all the things he'd have me doing. He basically said at the end of the meeting that he had talked to me about it and I didn't meet expectations.

I was caught so off guard I didnt know what to say and just stormed out after the meeting.

To end this, a coworker who sits right next to the office overheard that he was getting blamed for something and he brought me up to shift the blame on to me"

I know it's a good practice to log and track your own hours, but ADHD makes that somewhat impossible. 

I was looking for a program/app that tracks me based on geofencing and ended up getting overwhelmed by an Orwellian wall of options for ""timeclock apps"". I had no idea these existed until yesterday, and there's  A LOT.

I want to pull the Uno reverse card and track my own hours for the time I'm connected to the company network.

Does anyone have a reccomended app that is free and simple to use that can help me do this?

Handed in my 3 month notice after working for the same company in its various iterations for 17 years and noted I’d be interested in finding out what the counteroffer was, if any. Manager didn’t tell me what the counteroffer was as even he said ‘it’s offensive’ (he knew I was being paid under what the going rate is as we’d spoken about it in annual reviews).

One of the reasons I wanted to leave was micromanagement, from both my manager and colleague. I’ve recently suffered from an anxiety episode over the course of last week or two and an aura migraine resulting in 1 day off sick, and now I’m on propanolol to function during my notice period.

I’m working my wage until my last day. I have a few days annual leave accrued I can take - I was going to save them to tide me over for the period in between finishing this job and starting the new job but I’ve got the opportunity to visit my dad abroad that week so I’m seriously considering just fucking off and leaving them to it. 

I have 2 children who missed out the past couple of weekends because I’ve been sleeping off the anxiety or so distraught I’ve been non functioning. My husband and Dr and family have been absolute pillars of strength.

I know they won’t replace me as they won’t find anyone with my experience for the salary they’re paying me, and as proved they definitely won’t pay me more. The past 2 years I’ve had 2.5% raises based on a senior administrator salary. I’m not doing senior administration anymore, I moved into a more technical role a couple of years ago.

Most recent message this week was reminding me of deadlines and urgency for completion this week. We have biweekly calls about the weeks ahead and priorities so I’m not sure why the need for a follow up message as they’ve already been raised in our calls. Tell me you’re panicking about my departure without telling me.

No questions or queries in this post, just wanted to vent. Similar tales or fuck-you’s appreciated.

Edit to add: I can’t afford to walk away atm. I’m in 🇬🇧 
Thankfully they’ve taken some of my larger projects off me and given me the dregs to tide me over so at least it’s no longer difficult work"

When I first heard about dropservicing, my immediate reaction was ""Enjoying the fruits of someone else' labour"". Hate when people do this. The unskilled people call themselves as being good with 'people skills'. Really, it stands for ""I don't know how to do it, but I can find a scapegoat to do it by devaluing their skills"".

I didn't like that dropservicing is 'business'. But if you look at corporates, that's exactly what they do! Typically, an employee is paid 1/10th the amount contributed to business as salary. Which means, businesses can only employ workers by paying them far less than their true value. The higher up you go in the hierarchy, the lesser they work. But somehow their 'responsibilities' increase. What are they? Making sure that people comply to their orders. Making sure that they 'protect' the company by creating believable stories. So the higher management enjoys the fruits of labour of the actual workers. 

See it this way:

Dropservicer simply creates contract for work and pays someone else (lesser than what they get) to do the real work. They are unskilled themselves (except in so-called professionalism).

Higher management simply creates contract with customers (offering something for money) and gets the real work done by the workers for very little money. 

The common characteristic in both is that they earn by getting work done by someone else. "

I work in marketing for a small-medium company and it used to be this really chill job where everybody took their time and did the things as they always been done. Now, it’s brainstorm fest, not only do we need to do our tasks but we need to find new ones and more efficient ways of doing them.

When I work from home, I noticed that not a lot of people are ‘in the green’ in Google chat. Now I’m so paranoid I BOUGHT A MOUSE JIGGLER JUST IN CASE. I feel like I need to take ALL THE PRECAUTIONS to avoid making a mistake that would get me fired without notice.

It sucks that I used to be so relaxed about work but now I feel like I could be fired at any minute for the most unexpected thing. I gotta admit my new boss is efficient but it raised my stress level by 100 and doesn’t make me want to push myself more in my job cause of the fear of being fired. "

Bonuses - what’s that?? Raises/ promotions??

Or the time that I was chewed out and verbally abused by a colleague for her screaming at children? Or the time I received a PIP after working so hard tiptoeing and not getting on the boss’s wrong side? Or the time that I was fired because some Karen’s did not like the way I was teaching their spawns ( I was a teacher)? 

Currently, I am between jobs as I ended up quitting last month due to the overwhelming feelings of being a teacher and slaving several hours a week for meager wagers. Although I have been offered two jobs, I am still experiencing the feelings of deep shame, insecurity, and incompetence/imposter syndrome. I just need the validation and support from others who have taken time off from work, are switching career paths or have neurodivergent tendencies with personality that made it harder than normal to keep a job because of the unspoken rules, the office politics and incompetent bosses. 

Please be kind and not gaslight me. I already know I have my own weaknesses and I am doing the best I can but I also have to cultivate with people that sometimes do not have the awareness or do not want to share the same sentiments."

What I don't understand is, clients will show up to the shop to ask if I have sent their proofs or ask me to make changes. I wouldn't be upset if they had a physical example of what they'd like or really any valid reason to drive to me, but they will show up at any time of day just to ask me a question. This takes me out of my workflow and wastes so much of my time that could be used to work on their projects.

However I feel like i’m starting to become seriously taken advantage of at the job. Im on minimum wage as the position is for the lowest responsibility, however as the months have gone on I am pretty much doing the job of a supervisor and at times a manager when my own manager is off sick. The place is horrendously short staffed, with the chef off for two months my manager is covering, so on my days there I am covering his position FOH, with only one other member of staff helping me who cannot do drinks and really only knows how to run food and take payments. I am having to pick up the loose ends everywhere else: Deliveries, ordering stock, doing the end of day banking, managing other FOH team members etc, basically what a supervisor would do, however I have been denied a supervisor position since they apparently do not have the money for it. On weekends some days I have been working 9-10 hour shifts with 0 break at all, no time to sit down, or eat or even go to the bathroom. I cannot financially leave this job and I have applied to others but the job market is horrendous. I know what is happening  is illegal as I am entitled to 20 min break after 6 hours but if I complain I imagine I would lose the job. The whole situation just feels trickier due to the fact I’m friends with my manager. What really has tipped me over the edge today is a “reminder” message in the group chat about some things I didn’t do during close, even though I was having to close FOH entirely by myself and stayed an hour later than I was scheduled to get it done.

I got to the point where I was training and prospecting new hires. One of these new hires was a brilliant guy who had no right being an insurance agent. He was a private equity type. He had sophisticated tastes and grandiose ideas but was just built different compared to me or my coworkers. He was a genuinely good guy. 

He just needed something to do for the summer and this was common knowledge. He worked for about 2 months and then went on to bigger and better things, but about a month after he left he hits me up out of the blue wondering when he'll get the money in his commission account. Turns out, my boss had told him that he was entitled to all the money in his commission account. That was a lie. You have to be there for a year to start getting 10% payouts. I would like to say he just misheard, but he's smarter than I am and they only lie through omission. 

Hell, they'll tell me to be at the office at 8 o' clock but when they show up at 8:15 apparently I must have misheard. ""No, I said 8:30 silly"". This has happened several times and it's the only job this has happened at. It's such a minor issue that I'll always drop it 100% of the time, but if I can't find honesty in that then what can I find honesty in? Right???

It was advertised to me that as I got promoted I would be selling less insurance and instead be more focused on training new hires, which isn't a lie. But if I just used my eyes to watch the people in the position I was gunning for, I could clearly see they had my exact same schedule and responsibilities except they were also responsible for more people. They spent just as much time as I was spending out in the field. IRL sales. Also had one of the higher ups confess that her pay got cut in half when someone else got promoted because of their wack payout structure lol.
There's other miscellaneous stuff I'll just leave in the tldr.

I did extremely well and won awards and trips and all that. Clients would offer me food, drinks, beer and weed, and whatever else they felt like giving away. I've been invited to raves and cookouts. But this job takes most of my time AND feels slimy. If the best moments were those spent with clients outside the office, that really does say something. The good things I got out of it ended up being the reason I stayed so long.


TLDR; was encouraged to bait referrals out of clients with fake offers, found out they misled a friend about the nature of his commissions. Was instructed to avoid mentioning keywords like ""insurance sales"" and ""commission based"" when prospecting new hires over the phone. Saw the person who trained me have her pay cut in half when someone else got promoted (this promotes competition). Was pushed to try and hire family and friends (which I didn't do thank God). Was pressured to flaunt things on my social media for the company (like paychecks lmao).

i work in essentially retail/service and get relatively “well paid” (almost 19/hr) despite my “low skill” job requirements. my hours are SUPER unpredictable due to part time and typically far less than what i need (like 14hrs total some weeks), and even when i can scrounge up 36-40hrs, i still end up with $60-$30 in my account after paying rent (i pay in portions), utilities, insurance, and my credit minimums (that dont even make dents in my debt). all this the day i get my deposit—and this is all without getting groceries AT ALL. 
so from friday(day after im paid) all the way till monday i have essentially nothing in my account.
it leads me to feel guilty buying myself drinks(energy typically), high calorie snacks (to try and get the most out of what im spending) and even outright ingredients for meals. im sure with better hours i could start being able to eat without digging through my coin bank or adding even more to my credit card, but i dont know how to not feel bad for eating when i dont really have money for food. and *i know* i need to eat. but i feel so hopeless and not in control. 
what should i be doing differently? if you recommend another job, please have something to go with it because idk another job that will pay me “so much” with the lack of degrees i have. i feel really stuck n hopeless and entirely unhappy at my job but feel unable to change any of it. it feels it will be this way anywhere i go. i don’t qualify for any aid but still can’t afford food. this looms over me daily."

5,2024-03-19,Oppression and the concentration of power are inherent parts of human societies over time. The only solution is constant resistance.,u/tidepill,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bis4bc/oppression_and_the_concentration_of_power_are/,antiwork,"Amidst the onslaught of depressing posts on this sub, I felt the need to back up and see the bigger picture. Any human society has forces pushing against each other: The force of power begetting power, and the force of the masses resisting that power and dismantling it.

In the past concentration of power often involved war, conquest, slavery, and physical domination. The way to compel action is by the threat and carrying out of physical violence: You must do what I say or else I'll kill you.

Occasionally it involved moral and religious conquest, as in the Catholic church. The way to compel action is to appeal to a deity and to societal morals: You must do what I say or else you're a bad person, society will shun you, and you'll burn in hell.

Today the power is more economic. The way to compel action is to threaten material loss, indebtedness, economic harm: You must do what I say or else you won't get paid, and won't be able to afford your house or education or health or lifestyle.

The powerful will issue threats to compel action. The actions they demand are in service of their own power, to maintain and grow it. An entire society is built up around the mode and form that these threats take. Society accepts certain kinds of threats.

The solution is to resist these threats and find ways to defend against them. Resisting physical violence may mean raising your own army, or fleeing, or teaming up with a neighbor. Resisting organized religion may take the form of new sects or offshoots, showing alternative structures, like Protestantism resisted Catholicism.

Thoreau, Tolstoy, Gandhi, and King taught us that resistance doesn't have to be violent to be successful. They fought against unjust governments and political systems. 

In the economic system we have today, we must continue to resist the forces of power begetting power. Today these forces are capital owners and corporations.

The greatest power individuals have is to resist. Don't play by the rules that they set up. Make your own rules outside their system. Join co-ops. Grow your own food. Live in lower cost of living areas. Go off grid. Refuse to participate in the rat race, refuse keeping up with the Joneses. Refuse idolizing celebrities and wealth. Refuse buying useless junk that just lines the pockets of the already-rich. Slack off and have fun. Join unions, and help build coalitions of unions.

The form that oppression takes changes throghtout history. When one avenue is closed off, a new one id constructed. The masses must be constantly vigilant to catch new forms of oppression."

I had over the last month or so (before they offered the role) been thinking about what I would ask for as a starting salary and wanted to highball about 15% more as this would still be less than inflation for the last 6 years.

I've been offered a lot less and I'm freaking out. I'd love to work here but I'm quite deflated that I've got such a low starting grade.

i am a chemist in my late 20s, just started at a new job this past december. i wasn't too thrilled about it, but i had to take it. 

now, i've been hourly since i started working at 15 years old, but this is the first time i've seen this. my current employer has timeclocks with grace periods that extend seven minutes before or after your assigned start time. for example, if i were to clock in at 7:55 AM, it would round up to 8:00 AM, and if i were to clock in at 8:04 AM, it would still round to 8:00 AM, and so on. if i were to leave at 4:37 PM, i would only be paid up until 4:30 PM. i'm used to the direct punch time being recorded, and then leaving eight hours after. i am by no means a slacker, and do all the work i'm supposed to.

last month, i was pulled into my manager's office on account of being ""late every day"". i asked what she meant, because i was told it was rounded and i was 15 minutes late due to an accident on my route only once. she said i am ""not really working eight hours"" by coming in late, and asked me how i would feel if an employee of mine was coming in even just a minute late every day. i personally wouldn't care, but said nothing. she then suggested that i clock in as early as possible, at 7:55 AM, but i learned from coworkers that i would not be able to leave until exactly 4:30 PM. not to mention, some days i can't wrap up at that exact time, and i end up leaving around 4:37 PM or something. how is it acceptable to keep my unpaid time, but insist that i am being unfair to my employer by clocking in 1-4 minutes late, and having it be rounded anyway? if i come in at 8:01 AM, i leave at 4:31 or later, you get the idea.

so, i have a couple personal obligations i need to take care of this coming week (dentist, dropping someone off at the train station) and i emailed my manager asking whether i could come in an hour early on those days so i could leave an hour early. i have seen coworkers ask her offhand and she agrees immediately, so thought it no issue.

she calls me into her office today, and states that she doesn't understand why i need to leave early for the reasons i stated, and said that she would be more willing to allow me to come in early if i ""actually came to work on time"" and stated that even when i punch in at 8:01 or 8:02 AM, it is still late, and that i need to be here BEFORE 8:00 AM.  she said she completely disregards the grace period and ""doesn't care"" about it. but why does it exist? i was also told ""no one else she manages"" uses it. guess i'm leaving a whole hour before my shift starts now if i want to pay the bills.

has anyone here ever encountered this grace period issue? i could go into more detail of course but it just seems so outlandish to me and everyone else i've told.

My brother is supposed to come down to visit me and watch the eclipse with me on the 8th and listen the dark side of the moon while it peaks. I’ve been planning this for a bit now so I went to put in a two weeks notice on my 7shifts app to get the day off, and my boss says no one is allowed off that day since we’ll be packed because of the eclipse. 

Now I’m a good employee, never take days off, rarely get sick. I do great at work, and he knows I’ve been planning this for a while but flat out refuses to let me take the day off.

 My question is, what would y’all do? I have two other jobs so I’m financially secure if he decided to fire me over this, but I’m reallllly thinking I wanna just not come in to work. This is a once in a blue moon event I’ve been looking forward to and it means a whole lot to me. Especially since I don’t see my brother often either.

Although I am going through a sense of shame, frustration, disappointment, I also have a weird sense of relief, like I can see how this could be a good thing even though I have felt crushed at being demoted! It is a real slap in the face to  have been working unpaid overtime, taking on additional tasks with a smile, perhaps taking things too seriously and working myself to the bone. I have felt stressed  at times; enough to make me dread the next again day.   


If anything, I can see how foolish I’ve been to give so much of myself to work and made myself feel unwell, whereas now I have proof that I am just a number. 

Anyways, my concern now is that I’ll keep on the overworking people pleasing perfectionist tendencies rather than ”act my wage” and just do what is in my job description.    


It’ll be a hard mindset to shift, to see work as work and something I do during the day but not something that defines my worth or needs my headspace other than when I’m on the clock. So if anyone has any tips on how to change my mindset and achieve a better work life balance (and not be a slave to work!), it would be great to hear them. Thank you :)

I have a note from my GP that says I am unfit for work unless reasonable adjustments are made. 

I've always been prone to back pain so today I emailed HR about the possibility of getting a sit/stand desk, as a long term solution to the issue. There are a handful of these desks in the office, but they're located away from my team (500 person office so they're actually quite far away, using those would be like working in an entirely different office). 

HR informed me that they will only install a sit/stand desk in my area of the office if I go in 4 days a week. My role is hybrid and the current office attendance is 3 days, for the entire company. 

My two options are going in 4 days a week (my commute is 1.5 hr by train + walking + driving. I chose a hybrid role for this exact reason) or I sit away from my team, alone, entirely defeating the point of being in the office (team collaboration)? 

Is it me or this really unfair? "

My union rep never responds and if they do, it’s months later. What should I do or what can I do? 

Reasons why I’m unhappy is of course favoritism is going on, a staff member took a video of me because they thought I was doing something wrong (I wasn’t) I reported them and I requested I wanted that video removed from their phone (never got a response from that incident) and then a kid threw a bottle of water at me and all the staff laughed at me and even said I should get a helmet next time. My coworker that I worked with every day that was one of my few friends also passed away from an accident over vacation. Those are just some reasons I’m not happy there.

1,2024-03-19,When reading job descriptions is traumatizing,u/KillerKittenInPJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1biu8fh/when_reading_job_descriptions_is_traumatizing/,antiwork,"I had a job go sideways thanks to a Director scapegoating me. It was very traumatic from start to finish. Probably the worst part was that I was given nonsensical and contradictory direction. And now I have a raging case of imposter syndrome in spite of all my earlier career success and education.

I hit the job market hard about six weeks ago, reading every description, tailoring my resume, writing cover letters. In the first three weeks I probably sent over two hundred applications.

For the last two weeks reading job descriptions has become triggering. Just seeing these huge lists of responsibilities and expectations makes me want to run for the hills screaming. Every time I see phrases like “we’re family here” or “we like hard work” or “we value people who go above and beyond” I have a panic attack and wind up on the phone with my therapist. 

We all know that shit’s code for “We will abuse you emotionally, overwork you, demand more of your time, demand more of your mind, and when we tire of you, we will fire you without any notice.”

Because I had a position that lasted less than a year, my resume is getting binned over and over again. And there’s nothing I can do to fix that. I have no recourse other than sending resume after resume into the black hole while cold messaging people on social media begging for a chance. It’s completely dehumanizing and utterly humiliating. I have no way to earn money on my own and a snowball’s chance in hell of getting another job.

I’ve got a little savings and a pittance on unemployment and I can make it maybe 3 or 4 more months before I won’t be able to make rent anymore. I don’t know what I’ll do after that I don’t have a spouse or anyone I can go to for monetary support.

I’m fucking terrified that I’m going to become homeless. And I’m blowing through what little I had saved for retirement to keep this shitty overpriced apartment because if I break the lease I’m still on the hook for all the payments. This is all so unfair. I want to work, I’m a hard worker, I’ a good employee, I try hard, I contribute, I solve problems. But I”m neurodivergent so I don’t understand the office politics and apparently there’s no way to opt out of them and I don’t understand how I’m going to survive this cycle again, because it keeps on happening every 10 - 18 months and I’m going crazy from it."

I have some free time and wouldn't hurt to make a little extra money. 


I saw a job posting for a temp position where you basically unload plants and set them up at garden centers like Walmart, Lowes, and Home Depot. The key for me was that I'd be working alone, the hours and days were flexible, and it was very part time....as in 10-15 hours a week. The pay isn't great, $14/hr but I'm in a semi rural area and there's not a lot of options for part time work that doesn't require babysitting the elderly.


The interview made me laugh. I give the regional and area manager a lot of credit to be able to stand behind a makeshift desk from a patio furniture box in the back of the Walmart garden center and conduct an interview like this was going to be a life changing career choice for me. It was rather long...I was read word for word a very detailed description of the job and what's to be expected. That was the 3rd time I was fed this information.
Then all the questions I see a lot of people post...those situational questions and the ones where they want you to talk about your weaknesses. I just kind of had fun with it and I think I made them a little uncomfortable. I finally stopped him and made sure I was interviewing for the ""10-15 hour, 10 week temp job, at $14/hr"" because it was so absurd. I don't think he understood my poke. I know they have a job to do and have some other asshole over them making them do this shit but wow.


Anyhow, it concluded with me being pushed to ask questions about the job. I repeated everything that was told to me...unload truck, set up plants, make sure the wind isn't blowing plants all over the place, make sure there aren't any safety hazards. Don't even need to water plants, not my responsibility. Not too much customer interaction because I'm not an employee with the store. 
Yep, I understood the assignment. 


I just couldn't believe this was serious, but I also haven't done a job interview in a long time. I applied to USPS and they didn't even interview me and offered me a position lol. This plant mover company should be happy anyone is even showing up in rural Appalachia for a job like this. Good for them I guess...just funny to me and had to share with others."

But, do we actually see that happening? I sure as heck don't. I see a lot more homelessness,  people on welfare/assistance,  and honestly, a spike in suicides over the next decade or two, simply because people won't have many, if any options to try and survive.

And the future generations will be forced into boxes that they may not want to be in, to try and land a job in an even more competitive job market.

Few days later have a call with my manager to say that the increase is the standard yearly increase of 3%, because the company has a 'uniform wage structure' or something like that. She also told me that if I do certain things better, then we can 'have a conversation about' getting that previous 10% increase we talked about, which I thought I already had.

I mentioned the fact that I thought the increase was already done but she made a face like 'oops', said sorry about that and that she 'shouldn't have said that'.

I've felt quite undervalued and quite pissed off since then, and getting a bigger workload hasn't helped either. I've been applying for a lot of marketing related positions since then (what my degree was in, but struggled to find a job in the area since I graduated) to no avail.

I took this gig at the company I'm at now mainly because they wanted me to start with the intent to transition full time into the Sales Engineer role within 6 months and I am a rockstar in a consultative sales/support role. That and I was fed up with some of the shenanigans from my last company. Yay for startup life... but as they say - if you're not moving companies every 2 years you're losing money. 

Fast forward and this company has been a mind boggling shit show and I really need some outside perspective here. The last thing happened this morning and had me ready to hit the fucking eject button. My partner was right next to me and said he would be happy to support me if I wanted to quit today. 

Ready for some toxic fun? Here we go:

&#x200B;

* The company is run by a mom and son. Son = CEO, Mom = COO. 
* They pushed me HARD through the interview process - to the point of desperation. Callbacks and next step scheduling day of each interview. I thought they were so impressed by me (which could be partially true) but now in hindsight, I think they're just messy. 
* During my first annual retreat with the company (I was only 4 days in - the retreat was right after I started) the CEO got absolutely obliterated drunk on one of the night outings to the point where a bunch of us had to literally babysit him and make sure his sloppy ass got back to his hotel.
* After 4 ish months, they decided that the customer success team would suddenly be taking on the entirety of their support ticketing system. This was previously being managed by the tech/support lead (who has 0 meetings on his calendar but apparently needs all kinds of time to do ""something""). I explicitly stated during the interview process that this is not a responsibility I am interested in taking on and confirmed directly that I would not be. Surprise! 
* During a standup with the entire company, our CEO expressed that he was ""so frustrated"" with the CSM team for not having completed the transition of Freshdesk from our tech lead to the CS team only two days after we were even told about it. When I mentioned that it was not communicated as an urgent item, the CEO then on the next standup, in front of the whole company, told our Director that we had not completed the task and that we were blaming him for it. 
* After all of the above happened, our CEO, again ON FRIDAY STANDUP IN FRONT OF THE ENTIRE COMPANY, stated that his biggest disappointment (it was supposed to be win) of the week was that the CS team failed to complete the transition by the end of the week, thus publicly singling us out and shaming us. We had actually already completed the transition earlier that Wednesday**.** He did not apologize or acknowledge that he was incorrect and publicly criticized us for something he was wrong about.
* He did not attend his own company Christmas party
* He sent a series of slack messages that were indirect, immature, and passive aggressive for over a month straight during this little ""tantrum"" of his 
* Out of nowhere, we were suddenly told that we need to create and continue to manage an accounting spreadsheet for every single one of our 65+ customers that had all of their invoicing information and all previous payments, addons, contract redlines, contacts, customer record links, etc. All of this information lives in over 10 different places and we had to have it done immediately.
* After a town hall run by our new ops person, during standup, our CEO shouted out the ops person for a job well done. Then proceeded to say to the entire company that he wished we were ""grateful"" for the opportunity to ask questions and have visibility into revenue. Someone on the call said ""oh we are definitely grateful!"" and the CEO goes ""it doesn't seem like it"". Indirect, unprofessional, dramatic, little bitch bullshit.
* Last but not least - my egomaniac manager actually went ""SH!"" when I was talking this morning! We both started talking at the exact same time and were trying to make a point. He suddenly aggressively goes ""SH!"" and I stopped talking while he continued. He then proceeded to talk over me every time I tried to contribute my thoughts until I went off cam/mute and just hit the vape. I even texted a colleague to make sure I wasn't imagining things. She confirmed that he definitely shushed me and I should confront him about it. I have never in my entire adult life been shushed by ANYONE.
* When I asked him about this, he tries to fucking gaslight me, and instead of answering me he says ""I don't think so. Did I shush you?"" Ughh IM ASKING YOU, BRO! I said I would hope not, but thats certainly how it was perceived by myself and another colleague on the call. He then tries to blame it on a stutter (hes never stuttered before) or a cold sore (what the fuck!?!?)

I am so fucking over this place. If it wasn't for the 100% health insurance I would have already quit this morning.

Let's hear your toxic experiences."

After alerting my boss, I was given an inhaler and a mask to wear, but they did little to help. I ended up having to rush to the closest urgent care to get a nebulizer treatment. The doctor ended up sending me home with another inhaler, a nebulizer, and some prednisone. She also gave me a note excusing me from work today (I ended up just logging in remotely which we aren't allowed to do unless we are sick). 

This morning, my boss texted me asking if I was sure it was an asthma attack and not just stress. My boss is a nice person and means well, but this rubbed me the wrong way. I have to go back into the office tomorrow and I'm still having trouble breathing. Apparently they started ripping up carpets today so I'm sure tomorrow won't be much better.

This is not the first time they have asked me this question. I had abdominal issues earlier this year that ended up requiring abdominal surgery. Even after I was diagnosed by a surgeon, my boss still asked me if it could just be anxiety the day after I had to leave work just an hour early to go to the ER (I cried in pain the entire way there thinking I was going to die). I am extremely good at my job and I have a track record of handling high pressure situations in a calm manner. Honestly, I really don't tend to get stressed at work because, even though I always put in effort, I just don't really care. 

I don't really know what the point of this post is, and I could be overreacting. I am just annoyed that they don't really seem to care about employee health and I'm annoyed with the belittling of medical conditions.

Am I overreacting? 

Does anyone have any tips for not dying during this remodel?"

I’m 20 years old and I live with my mother who’s living check to check. I became a pool installer last November and am waiting for the season to start again. I’ve bought my own car but I have no car insurance. You can get arrested for not having car insurance in Ohio and I’d like the peace of mind before I practiced driving on the freeway to get my license. 

At some point, I would like to pick a major that can land me a high paying job, as my grandfather continues to urge me. But I need money now to pay for things like said car insurance. I was thinking getting my driver’s license and saving money, then revisiting college later would be the most practical approach. 

Just a reminder that being young isn’t a good excuse to immediately discard a source of income. We should ask for more insight into people’s circumstances before advising a path."

I work remotely in a Finance/Purchasing role for a big corporation. What annoys me is that despite getting great performance reviews, I feel like my potential is not recognized. I'm efficient when it comes to doing my job, I'm innovative in streamlining my tasks and I'm very dependable. 

Still, I'm bored out of my mind most of the time, doing my work while on auto-pilot. I asked for opportunities and training, but all I get is empty promises. It feels like I'm off the radar of my direct manager. When an employee quit a few weeks ago, I wasn't even asked if I'd be interested in taking over her responsibilities, instead this other employee from my team got it, despite my role closer to the tasks at hand. 
On my birthday in January, my direct manager offered a birthday gift in form of an Amazon order. I told him what I want, but he still hasn't ordered it (even after I followed up). It doesn't feel like I'm appreciated. 

Now, a peer from our account has been assigned the task to follow up on some of the things I'm working on, requesting updates. He's not my boss, why am I supposed to give him updates?

He had done that for a few years, living in motels and camps. We have a lot of remote work camps in Alberta, you can be sent into the tundra and live out there for a month at a time. Ask me what killed my marriage later, it might have killed his too.

I’ve been working at a nursing home kitchen for about six months. I recently came down with pneumonia, and after a month of stupidly pushing through it and working I finally went to the hospital. Needless to say: Sepsis Pneumonia, Pleural Effusion that led to Empyema, Blood Clots in my lungs, the works. Had a chest tube in me for a week with doctors considering putting me in Hospice.

Can't we have a system where things on the bottom of maslow's hierarchy of needs (food, shelter, medicine, clothing, time to rest) are essentially socialist (spread out and free to everyone) while things that are technically luxuries, even things like spices and exotic foods and every other non-essential item or service can be sold and bought like in everyday capitalism? In a way it benefits both sides, everyone would be able to survive without fear - no one could game the system by begging for government assistance and spend it on luxuries - people could protest as long as they needed - all it would take is accepting giving up on temporary luxuries - companies can continue to artificially fake shortages of goods and some people will still buy while others will bide their time and eat healthy food that's probably better for them anyways.

1,2024-03-19,I was discriminated by my general manager and an HR lady and want to report them to the more progressive HR lady.,u/Rapterr_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bj3noq/i_was_discriminated_by_my_general_manager_and_an/,antiwork,"I just started a new job at a warehouse and I did really good my first day. Upon coming in for my second shift, I had one of the supervisors tell me that the general manager and an HR lady wanted to see me to talk about my good performance. Thinking that I'm about to be praised for my good performance, I was told that an anonymous individual saw me use the bathroom and had reported me to hr; I'm transgender but well into my transition and almost always get gendered as a woman as I have a very feminine sounding voice, so this didn't make sense especially since I've been using women's bathrooms for quite a while without any problem, and nobody was even around me when I used the bathroom so it's impossible that anyone even saw me. They said that this anonymous individual was uncomfortable by me using the bathroom and could tell that I'm transgender apparently 🙄. After basically being accused of being a predator, I was told I HAD to use the men's bathroom from now on. This sent me into fight or flight mode, and I then started recording and just started asking him questions that would make him look like an idiot being recorded. The HR lady notices that I pull my phone out and she glares at it as I place it on my knee to better pick audio up. Despite this, he continues on and then I say that I feel clearly discriminated against and that there's no reason to take this concern seriously because it's as ridiculous as complaining about sharing a space with any demographic you don't like such as black people, gay people, Hispanics, or women. After saying this, he changed his tune and began to back track and then said that they would make me my own transgender bathroom that nobody else could use, which I swiftly denied, insisting that I will continue to use the women's bathroom, which then resulted in them threatening to forward this to senior hr. They never ended up reporting this to anyone most likely as I never heard anything of it since it happened, and also nobody else has an issue with this but them as they have access to my personal files and I haven't legally updated my gender on my driver's license. Since this occured I've been late by one minute on two days which you get points according to company policy, and after talking with my manager I was given way too many points for just being a minute late, which leaves me to believe that the bigoted general manager is manipulating my points as a way to get me in trouble or fired for ignoring his demands. Should I report this to the other HR lady? She seems to be fairly progressive but I know you shouldn't ever fully trust hr because they act to save the company money, but I wonder if the recording would give me some leverage in this.

Tldr; I was discriminated by my bosses and told to use the men's bathroom (I'm transgender) and I recorded the entire interaction and am looking to report them to a more progressive hr person who might help me."

With more context, as we live in Mexico he was asked if he'd be willing to start his shift at the call center he works at in the earliest of shifts available after he comes back from the long break he was given due to the national holidays.
He accepted as they (supposedly) told him it would be for just one day, he thought nothing of it and accepted. On the first day of his 3 day weekend he was told thats his new hours moving forward and when speaking to his superior he was told nothing can be done as he already accepted.
He claims they kept that part a secret from him and initially told him it was only for the day he comes back.

The last two days, due to inclement weather, we didn't have any operations, but today's weather in the clear. The American work culture and employee/employer relationship, in hindsight, is so toxic now these days, after recognizing the amount of stress recent (and accruing) issues have cause, which weren't my fault but still made my problem:

*  Multiple times my hours were miscounted, leading me to miss $50-$200 dollars on paychecks, only to be very nonchalant about it because ""I fix the problem don't I? (Ignoring the legal requirement to). Multiple times they've forgotten to give me bonuses designed for our healthcare payments (fixed a paycheck after the fact). A few times have forgotten to even deposit our weekly paycheck (Comes in late). Then laugh at the notion of being asked to double check their work before submitting, rather, shifting it to being my responsibility to hold their accuracy to standard & that they have no intention on fixing these issues because ""Shit happens"".
* The shifting of other people's responsibilities & duties on to me because I'm one of the very few people pro-active enough to not be behind on my work & prepared each day and the day before, only to be told after saying ""It's not my job"" that 1) ""My job is whatever he says it is because I get paid"" and that the blunt, straightforwardness of what I said was equal to, verbatim ""No different than calling a black guy the ""N"" word"" (He took such personal offense to refusing to taking up work that wasn't mine to do, that he thought it was on par to racism, note, he's white). 
* No ""Productivity goals"", so they pile up the work on you until they break you, then determine THAT'S your daily goal. So I never know if Im having a normal day or 4 hours of overtime. In the case I do great and im done before 8 hours, lets say in 6 hours, well i get paid 6 despite doing 8 hours of work. Makes it very difficult to plan work - life plan.
* Then, as the cherry on top, during the off seasons I had to keep my head phones on most times because the other employees AND my manger (the ceo) weren't above racist jokes & stereotypes. He also often used ""gay"" in a negative fashion & dropped the ""F"" bomb, often with the added w/ the -GY, quite casually. All of which quite uncomfortable for someone who has non-white family, non-white friends, and many LGBT family/friends. No one to go to because the company doesn't have an HR department and every level above me was guilty of it XD

 All of this said and done, as someone with a crippling level of people pleasing as a weakness, depression, anxiety, and so forth, I feel I'm in the right to leave, especially since this new upcoming job will pay 24/hr to their 21/hr & 5% raises, but despite all my stress, anxiety, and irritation I've felt for weeks, I hate that it plateaus HERE... The moment I can get away from it all... The recognition that the American workforce has bred us to NOT do what's best for us, and in fact, ingrained it into our mental & emotional fabric to be too scared to take a stand for what's best, almost like a psuedo level of PTSD that leaves us too frozen to act out of fear of some level of retaliation (My boss can be quite argumentative when things happen that he doesn't like).

To explain, I work at a retail job where I fulfill online grocery orders. I love my job based on the actual work but my boss is making it a miserable place to be and I’m so stuck on what to do. I have two bosses, one who is a team lead, she’s 20, I’ll call her  Brittany.  then the boss who is a step above her which is the boss of our whole department, I’ll call her Jamie. She’s like 38 I think. Anyways, Jamie and Brittany clearly like each other and spend basically all day walking around the store together, wrestling with each other playfully, smoking together outside, etc. After noticing that they are on the same schedule every single day leaving her alone every time she works, the other  team lead in our department started to check into this and found that Jamie changes Brittany’s schedule every week to put them on the exact same shift and lunch times every day. Obviously that’s unfair to the other team lead because now she’s always scheduled alone so that Jamie and Brittany can be scheduled together. Brittany started to like me and flirt with me and all of a sudden Jamie started being mean to me and making rude comments calling me desperate or one time I said to someone “please make me a new name tag I’m begging you” and Jamie said “oh she’s begging again like usual” I don’t know why she thinks I’m the one coming into Brittany when Brittany is the one coming on to me. My girlfriend even works in the same department as us. I got tired of the mean girl treatment from Jamie and finally just apologized and said “I was just being friendly to Brittany I didn’t know you guys were close and I didn’t mean to cause any problems if I did” I thought being the bigger person and apologizing even though I didn’t do anything wrong  would fix this and let Jamie know I’m not trying to get with Brittany. They both got really defensive and started over explaining about how they aren’t a couple and don’t like each other and I let it go. However, the mean girl crap is still going on and now my hours have even been cut drastically. I don’t know why Jamie is obsessed with someone almost half her age to the point that she’s treating me like shit but what do I do? It’s so hostile. "
4,2024-03-20,How to respond to my boss' pettiness?,u/ararespawn,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bjdo3f/how_to_respond_to_my_boss_pettiness/,antiwork,"In November my six year old son was diagnosed with a serious chronic illness.

I've worked for this company for over 17 years now. 2 years ago I switched to a new lab. It has not been a good fit, though I've tried really hard to make it work.

 In light of my son's illness, I knew I would be unable to continue the current work schedule that I have. I contacted my old lab and they eagerly offered to re-hired me and offered me a raise, in addition to reducing my hours to 32 hours a week so I can maintain health insurance but still have some time off to manage my son's medical issues (I am forever grateful for this).

My old boss asked me to please keep the peace when transitioning back, which I have done to the best of my ability. For the record, I offered 6 weeks of notice to finish up ongoing experiments and data collection. I've continued to work 12 hour days twice a week to finish these experiments and I've continued to work the weekend schedule even though it is currently very inconvenient to me.

I've done all of this as a courtesy, and I know it was not required on my part.

I requested a week off between before the transition back to my old lab. This was known by my current boss, HR, and my old/new boss.  I put in the vacation request this week and my current boss has denied the request as I will, 'no longer be employed by her at that time'.  Unfortunately, in my communication with my current boss, I've referred to my last day in the lab as my last day of work, when she and I both knew I meant my last day of physically being here 🙄.

I know she knows exactly what she is doing because when I transferred here, she requested I take three weeks of vacation before finishing at my old lab, since she did not want to pay for it. *sigh*

I know I messed up here, and I should have gotten clarification in writing. I contacted HR and she said she would fix it, but I assume that means the cost will just be transferred to my new position.

My current boss is throwing a 'goodbye luncheon' for me on Friday, and she also auto-schedualed an exit interview with me. I have no desire to do either of these things at this point.

What are my options for malicious compliance here? What are my obligations? 

Can I just not show up to the lunch?  This luncheon is just for her to save face with her other employees on my employers bill.

She specifically said she wants to go through all my lab notebooks with me in person on Friday. Am I allowed to just turn them over and tell her to contact me if she has questions? She knows where to find me.

I don't have any desire to sit down with her for any reason at this point.

I know she is being petty, and I don't necessarily want to return that, but I no longer see any reason to bend over backwards for her either.

I, like any other person in my age group, am not inclined to bust my behind for work without adequate compensation, let alone as a part time worker who has to go here and there and not even be graced with a proper schedule or location. But hey, we take what we can get in this shitty hellhole we call our country for capitalism to not help us right? Wrong. Why the hell should I work for two hours at one location, only to have 5 hours at another location? Too expensive to even have a car, and I don't drive, and transit is a joke. ""We'll give you an additional ½ hour"" management and scheduling tells me. Of my unpaid lunch, that's where the ½ hour is coming from. No is supposed to be a complete sentence, but apparently, scheduling didn't like that and called my supervisor to say that as a part timer, I'm expected to be able to work a full shift even if I'm scheduled for a half shift. ""Because that's what's in the employment contract you signed."" And I'm still expected to start on time after having all my scheduled shifts change, and workin OT for the last few days because management doesn't think that healthcare and their budget as a private company can afford another person. I'm not going to do the work of another person, but I only end up doing it at the end of the day so I can go home. Literally, that's it. I work to live a bit decently, not the other damned way around. And why the heck do I have to revolve my life so closely around work? Without set days off (it varoes every few weeks) I can't plan anything nor get appointments like having a few cavities filled at the dentist, let alone even experience or remotely enjoy life.

Ffs, seriously. Now when I get to the place I was scheduled for in the second half of the day, supervisor says she wants to talk to me. Likely about expectations of the job and being available, and a whole bag of nonsense. What should I say to her about all this, because she sure as hell isn't going to agree or take what I'm saying with a grain of salt. If there was any other place hiring, I'd go and apply, but hey, a monoply on this sort of thing is what makes the system run better for those above, right?"

I have a bad leg, more specificly, I had a fibular free flap surgery. For those unaware, that entails a bone, tissue, and skin graft, I had my fibula removed, as well as a bunch of my leg tissue and skin. This thing hurts, a lot, and it's been 6 years since that surgery. Overusing it and bad weather will really bring out some incredible pain.

About a year and a half ago I was working at Meijer, in the pickup department. I was working in the back, keeping things organized, ready to go out, and then delivering the groceries to their vehicles. This day in particular I was in immense pain, but I was broke and needed money so I went in to work. There was a little two step stool we used to use to reach up high on the whiteboard, and so to rest my leg a little bit and reduce my pain id sit in it while waiting for customers arrival. Now I wasn't being unproductive, I was working on a project for the department, a little training guide to make it easier for new hires. A supervisor of another department walked by and said I'm not allowed to sit at all, to which I explained I need to for my leg, and showed her my scar. She shook her head and walked away. But soon after, maybe 5-10 minutes I was moving stuff around after taking an order out and she came by, grabbed the stool and took off. We never got that stool back. 

Another day I was in a ton of pain and I had my cane. This is not a doctor prescribed cane, it's one I picked up myself for some relief a couple years prior to these events. The assistant store director came up to me and said I was not allowed to have a cane, that it was a hazard. He said that if I fall over because my cane gets caught the store is liable, so I had to put it in my car. My supervisor backed him up and had me put it away. I limped back over and an hour later I was in too much pain to walk and went home early that day, having taken an Amego cart to my car. How is that any better? They said I could have a cane if I could get a note from the surgeon and then submit it to corporate for their approval. Wtf? I had the surgery on the other side of the country when I was a minor, I don't know how to get in touch with them, let alone beg and plead for a corporation to approve it. 

Why is it that these companies can get away with this? Thankfully now I can sit for long enough periods at work that when I am in pain, I know I'll get to rest soon. I still have to fight a bit at some locations due to ""secret shoppers"" flagging that as a reason to knock off points. I just don't understand why we let them get away with this. "

Example: hire date with company A was January 1st 2012 & Hire date with company B was May 1st 2023. 

I accrue PTO at a rate of 10+ years as I was grandfathered in.

New company’s PTO policy is that you can only roll over 40 hours & any overage will be lost. 

I used all PTO & rolled over the allowed 40 hours on January 1st. 

On May 1st they subtracted 80 hours from my PTO pool stating that per company policy & my hire date of May 1st.

I work for a nonprofit started in the 1700s. My department is two people - my Boss (director) and myself (assistant). The CEO is my boss's boss.

2009 - hired for my current job. Peon recordkeeper. Not a bad job, just drudgery.     
2014ish - boss talks about retiring and that I should be her replacement.     
2018 - I quit because I was tired of being strung along.     
2020 - My replacement quit, COVID hit, and I came back (fully remote) with the promise of promotion.     
2023 - Another department head retires and I apply for that job. My boss freaks out and **commits** to retiring June 2024 (at age 72).     

The organization has lost a lot of leadership / long time employees recently due to Return To Office policies. We all know the bullshit with this.

With all this in mind, I go to the CEO and mention that, if I'm going to get this promotion, I would like another coworker to take my current spot and be my assistant. It'd be a promotion with a nice pay bump for the coworker and they know the organization so I wouldn't be training someone from scratch while I get a handle on my boss's routine.

The CEO: ""Good idea, but we were thinking about restructuring your department.""

My brain: [I'm in danger.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh9j1slA7R4)

To be clear, my department has existed since at least the late 1800s. Now they want to restructure? The reason I've stuck with this drudgery is because it's stable and long-term. I see the bullshit everywhere else and thought this was safe.

What burns my ass the most is I've been stuck with the title ""Assistant to"" for fifteen years now. If the promotion came and they ~~fucked me over~~ ""restructured"" in a couple years, I could at least list ""Director"" on my resume.

I have such low morale today it's unbelievable. I know it's possible they won't restructure and everything will be status quo, but I'm so tired of the bullshit mismanagement. There's not even the excuse of ""quarterly earnings"" for all the short-sighted bullshit that's been going on - the management just seems to want to burn this centuries-old institution to the ground (and me with it, as collateral damage)."

(Don't worry, I got a raise first, and I'll get another one with my official promotion later this year) I do not have prior managerial experience, I got this job after about four years of unemployment. Prior to that, I worked for families in their homes, so I don't even have experience *having* a manager, other than the shit-heels I worked for at McDonald's 15 years ago. 

My job is at a small, locally owned business that provides classes and services to the community, so not an average office setting. Schedules are set at the beginning of the year, and only change if we add or remove a class.
As a manager I will be overseeing the day-to-day operations, and while I won't necessarily have hiring and firing power, my opinions will carry significant weight.

I want to be a resource for my coworkers so that they can do their jobs to the best of their abilities, but I don't really know how to put that desire into action.

My question for you fine peoole: how do I be a good manager? 

What pitfalls should I strive to avoid?

Am I even asking the right questions?

It was horrible and I was often reprimanded for missing a message or responding too late, I didn't tell her this part though. I said I wanted to move towards a better work/life balance with my new job.

For context they were adamant that I tell them if anything bothers me, or don't be afraid to ask if I have any questions. They brought it up so many times that I felt safe to voice my thoughts.

Anyway, on my fifth shift the business owner called me into her office, closed the door, and red-in-the-face yelled at me. She was shaking with anger. She said not to ever bring up my previous job again, that they do not care about me or my past because I work here now, that if I'm ever caught talking about my personal life or previous job again I can ""get the F out"" because what is the point in me being here if I'm thinking or talking about anything other than work.

I'm panicking because I was not understanding the content. I waited until the trainer left the room and wanted to quickly read through tomorrows exam. As I was just about to read a few questions the trainer entered the room, just before he entered I put the exam paper under my book to hide it. But then he said he was locking the room now to go home. I panicked and just put the exam paper in my bag.

I panicked. I walked back 20 mins later with panic wanted to admit what I done but then the main manager was there. I just wanted to put the exam paper back. I made an excuse and said a left my phone in the room. He said he would have a look in the room (called my bluff). I then lied and said I might have left my phone in the company vehicle that was now miles away.

He was then calling up multiple people trying to help me (I felt horrible) The lies are no snow balling up.

I managed to quickly put the exam paper in the room but in a completely different place from were it originally was.

I pretended to find my phone in my bag and acted dumb. He said no problem and I felt very awkward.

So the manager told my trainer what happened. So he must be very suspicious now. Plus the fact tomorrow he will go to the room and find an exam paper in a different place to where it was.

So there a few outcomes:

The best outcome: No one says anything I pass my exam and that's it.

The worst outcome: He puts all the info together, gives the info to the manager. They sack me for being deceitful

The okay outcome: they know what happened but let me off

I'm normally a good honest person but I panicked and the snowball affect occured. Because I'm a good person I am racked with MASSIVE guilt and I don't know how to deal with it.

Anyone got any insight into this? Should I just tell the truth and risk losing my career?

I'm panicking right now and I feel very mentally ill.

There are 3 of us in this rota.

One of my colleagues, who is in the shift rota, cannot work nights any more. This was then to be split with myself and my other colleague to 3 weeks days and 3 weeks of nights.

I have just found out this other colleague cannot take on extra nights due to childcare responsibilities.

So, my boss has asked, not told me, if I will cover the 4 weeks of nights and then do 2 weeks of days indefinitely. I've said I will think about it and consult my partner.

Now, while I won't tell him this, I actually prefer nightshift, if I could only get the sleeping sorted (I am a terrible sleeper on nightshift). Either way, doing extra nights will affect the my home life and maybe even my health a little.

I currently get a shift bonus of 1.25x my base hourly rate. I am looking to negotiate that up to 1.33x my hourly rate in return for doing these extra nights.

I just don't know how to negotiate it when I have an existing contract that states I have to do nightshift anyway."

What I was not expecting was my absolutely hellacious first trimester. 

I have been working at my job for 7 months, do my job well, get along with the rest of the team. When I hit about 8 weeks pregnant, I was throwing up 5-6 times a day so keeping it a secret was not really an option. I work remote 90% of the time and my doctor wrote me an accommodation letter to just work remote through the end of the first trimester… but obviously I had to tell my boss a little earlier than would be preferred. 

Much to my surprise, she was also pregnant! When I told her she was very kind, seemed excited for us both, told me she was going to work out our maternity leave details and stuff. Gave me no indication whatsoever of what was to come. 

I had to go into the office for a client meeting, and afterwards she pulled me into a meeting room and told me she was laying me off. Our due dates are close enough that coverage for our maternity leave isn’t possible, as she doesn’t have the budget to hire an entire extra person (*very* small business) so I need to go so that she can get her own coverage. She was as kind as you can be about it, but had obviously been talking with a lawyer because everything was super carefully worded to not mention my pregnancy as the reason. 

Before everyone gets all up in arms about how illegal this is, I did meet with an employment lawyer, and there’s nothing I can do. I didn’t record the conversation because I didn’t expect that it would be happening, I have none of our agreement in writing, even if I did she was very careful to make it so that it wasn’t because I was pregnant but because I can “no longer meet the needs of the business”.

This was my first job in a new industry, and after three weeks of aggressive applying, I’ve not gotten one single interview. I’m going to have to wait tables again and hope that I find something before I’m huge but I’m already showing a bit so my hopes for that are pretty low. 

My husband and I had to pull out of the home buying process because we can’t risk any of our savings and no longer qualify for our loan without my income, so I’ll be having a baby in a tiny one bedroom apartment. I had to get on emergency insurance that’s not nearly as good as my previous benefits so all prenatal and birth care is going to cost us a lot more. 

I’ve always known our system in the US is fucked, but the cracks in the foundation are really showing. I am so excited to be a mom, but none of these circumstances are what I would’ve hoped for. Just had to vent because I got another auto-rejection email and I’m feeling it.

5,2024-03-20,Are there any livable jobs that have good work/life balance and very little contact with managers and coworkers? ,u/FarOffLanding,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bjl07t/are_there_any_livable_jobs_that_have_good/,antiwork,"I burned out of my previous career quite bad and don’t want anything to do with it (veterinary field). I’ve also been having trouble with health issues for a while and have been needing frequent time off for appointments and I feel like maybe only one workplace out of the many I’ve been in has been chill about it. They can’t make you cancel appointments or fire you for it ofc, but most managers start to get pissy with you. It’s like they think I can book these appointments outside of business hours but am just choosing not to lol. 

I absolutely despise being micromanaged, workplace hierarchies, bullshit meetings, having to work with a “sense of urgency” in situations that really are not life or death, being expected to come in on days off, and overall just hate having a manager and having them get irritated with me for taking 3 days off following a minor surgery. Or just a day off months in advance to go to a concert and enjoy my life. I hate that managers always seem to feel the need to ask you why you absolutely need that time off, it’s so nosy. Just let me live. I don’t even take vacation time off that often. 

The less contact (in person OR virtual with managers and coworkers), the better. It’s not really working that I hate, it’s the way my life doesn’t even feel like my own in so many of these jobs. Even my frequent bathrooms breaks (from my bladder issue) have been questioned by multiple supervisors/managers now. Especially doing overtime regularly, like isn’t 40 hrs/week fucking enough to give?

It’s pretty easy and I kind of like being busy, but I am fed up with my manager. From the start he’s told me to “take control” of my fellow employees and that “I’m the manager while on shift” but refuses to compensate me for the added responsibilities. So I don’t do it, who am I to boss around my fellow employees who already have to deal with this sub-par management as it is. He changed my schedule more than once without having the fucking decency of letting me know in advance. I had the same schedule for months until I showed up for work and he’s just like “you’re not supposed to be here until X” I was pissed. He scheduled me for days and times I put on my application I am not available to work. It took 3 weeks of him having me on the schedule for that day, and me telling him I can’t work that day before the owner came and asked why I have been calling off that day every week. I’m not calling off, the manager just doesn’t communicate with the owner thus making me look like a shitty employee. The owner was fine with it and from then on told me to just come to him about scheduling cause it’s know the manager doesn’t communicate with him. The managers response to my disagreements with the schedule change was to complain to me saying “I don’t get paid enough for this”. Yeah how the hell do you think I feel ya fuck. Best worker in here getting paid $12/hr running shit better than he does. Recently he changed my schedule again, cutting my hours, and doesn’t tell me until 10pm the night before the shift. He claims we’ll make up for those cut hours during the week but this is unacceptable to me. I don’t want to work with him more than I have to and this is exactly what would happen if that was what happened. That was the last straw. I wanted to quit then but it’s hard out here with no job and I also feel bad bailing on the owner like that. I’ve been sticking it out looking for a new job and there are some prospects but things are moving really slow and don’t think I can deal with it much more. I’m lucky and have “landlords” who are sympathetic to the situation and care more about my well being than getting their money for rent, but it’s still hard to quit because I need money to live too. He sent me a text today pretty much demanding I show up an hour before my posted shift and I guess it really pissed me off lol. Here I am ranting on here when my scheduled shift starts in 50 minutes.

For context, a coworker of mine who I hesitate to call my manager because she is in a different department has set up a camera to spy on me during work. 

In the past, she has mentioned me needing to get off the phone and to stop stretching during business hours when I have work that needs to get done. Mind you, this is what I do when I take breaks, it is not a problem when I sit down to work. 

This week I came to my desk and see there has been a camera installed that clearly was meant to stay hidden. I was not told it would be installed or that is would be recording me. It is off to the side between two cardboard boxes and faces only my desk and me laterally. I have not mentioned that I know about it’s existence. 

I want to first know my rights and if there is any appropriate legal recourse I can take or use as leverage. I live in Arizona if that changes anything.

I was browsing indeed today in the vain hooe of finding anything I can do that pays $15-20+ an hour and stumbled upon my former employer, turns out they are hiring again.

Also read their reviews, mine was missing for some reason. (maybe you can't see your own reviews?) But they were overwhelmingly negative, the company has 3.5 stars, with all the positive reviews written in the most ""how do you do fellow workers"" language imaginable, citing ""great pay, flexible hours, paid time off"" and such.  I checked glassdoor (which I saw a few posts on while prepping to post this, big oof there, still using it as an example though) and they have a whopping 2.4 stars there.  On yelp they are sitting at around 3.5ish as well... But on google?  4.9 stars.  Facebook?  5 stars.  Their own webpage (which seems to have cjanged entirely to a brand new hosting site and has removed a ton of features inckuding their rewards program redemption for online purchases, wtf?) Is also at 5 stars.


Now I know, because I worked there, that they pay off people who leave negative reviews, I wish I could say ask me for the name so you can get between $50-100 gift cards from them but... I can't.  What I will say is that more sites need to allow anonymous reviews. People are far more likely to leave their real feelings and real ratings when they aren't in a publicly viewable space and can't be judged or retaliated against.

A year ago now I was hired on at a prestigious law-firm for a helpdesk position.
It was straight out of highschool and the only reason i got it was because the Director of IT (and the new only IT member) was my friends father who talked to me often about coding projects and such.

He fought hard to get me in the door since he needed help handing demand. 
The orginal offer: 56,500 salary.

KCMO area so thats almost the exact median for the market in our area. It had push back and after alot of back and forth he got me in, but for 42,500. 
This beat my 15/hr at Target by alot and so i moved for it. moved out way too early, got a car, got an apt alone, and just sent it. It was a good opportunity i didn’t want to pass…

I was by no means a helpdesk technician, I learned the AD, wrote out proposals and lead huge endeavors with new applications and tech upgrades. i’ve  saved the firm close to 40k since my one year mark.

During this time im also a full time student, have finished 5 certifications out of pocket, and have done my own coding projects for fun.

I today decided to speak with HR about my original offer and she said that i an extremely under appreciated and do not get paid fairly but we work with attorneys who will most definitely give me push back. we talk for a long time, discussing multiple things, but she mentions I should write a proposal letter for the raise like my boss did earlier in the year. 

I did, I spent a long time on it and really was proud of myself. maybe i can link it but regardless at the end of the day my boss or the director of IT was asked by me to just review it and see if its plausible.
what do you think they(the attorneys) would say?

Well didnt matter bc he took it, said no and “does she not know the circumstances you were hired on?!”

Felt really shitty and told him its impossible to live with my expenses off this income and id be searching for a new position elsewhere.

i took the letters and trashed them. 

Idk why im writing this, other than to be humbled by strangers bc i was cocky maybe.

In my opinion: originally my wage mimicked my age and not the job description or experience i had. I thought in this year i had proved myself as a vital team member here and could ask to finally move out the 2nd percentile of salary for a position that doesnt even fit my job description and maybe i could be paid the median of said not correct position. The last guy who worked my position was titled director of IT aswell and made the same wage as the current director; tripple my wage!! The firm has shrunk and the IT budget isnt what it used to be but damn man Im not even allowed to consider a raise yet? i feel like i mimic his job and we just bounce idea off eachother, i never have asked for him to solve an issue. its also annoying he asked and was approved for a raise but is determined the higher ups will spit in my face for even opposing my original offer. it makes some sense since they didnt even wanna pay me what im making now but yeah…

How do yall feel?

Im gonna start my job hunt and when i get a solid offer i will bring it to hr and ask them to match it. i dont respect my bosses decision to veto it but i respect him and appreciate him enough to leave the letter in the bin and move on.

he even called and apologized but the original reaction said enough."

I’m not gonna name any names so it won’t get back to me, but I worked for a certain coffee chain for over a year, and have left within the past month to work for a certain shipping and office chain, and honestly really like the new place, but also kinda miss the old place. Before I left the coffee place, I was pursuing a supervisor position at another store in the chain that would be opening “soon”, but I wasn’t given any clear details on the timeline, and I felt like it was “hurry up and wait”, and like the promotion was vapor.  Which is why I jumped ship to another corp. 

Now here’s the conundrum, that supervisor position is finally open, and I applied and interviewed, and did really well, and was even told so by my manager to-be. Which job should I go for? The coffee place will be paying me 6$ more per hour, but won’t be as stable with hours, only guaranteed 32 with the potential for overtime. The Shipping/Office store is guaranteed 36-38 hours. 

I’m almost 30 and I feel like either place is just a lateral movement as just another cog in the machine while I try to support myself and young kid all by myself- I’m a single parent. 

I’m kinda crippled by this conundrum and would like some advice, 🙏 thank you all!"

The idea that regular employees should be leading team meetings and not the manager whose job it is to literally do that is asinine but I digress. 

Anyways, my manager requires us to have a 5 minute ice breaker at the start of every meeting. I didn’t really have any particular ice breaker questions in mind, so I just asked how everyone was doing. This only took around 2 minutes, so after the room went silent I said we were going to go move on, but then my manager abruptly interrupts me and says in a loud tone “no we still have 3 minutes left for the ice breaker!!!” to which I replied with a reserved “ok” and let him talk about some random thing that I blanked out of my memory. After another minute or so when the room went silent again I said “okay let’s move on” but then my manager interrupts me again and says “no I’m not done yet!!!” and at that point I made a backing off motion with my hands and said “okay I just thought we were ready to move on”. It was so embarrassing and I felt the awkwardness in the room. I wanted the earth to swallow me at that moment.

I despise my manager so much. Why does it matter if the stupid ice breaker isn’t 5 minutes? Why do we even have to have an ice breaker every damn meeting? Nobody likes it except for the manager who just yaps on and makes cringe jokes. And he ALWAYS has to single somebody out and make them the butt of a joke, and it’s usually the same 3-4 people including me. I can’t wait to leave this shitty job. It isn’t even that bad, but my manager makes it unbearable."
1,2024-03-20,Weird managers,u/vivaryumi,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bju2ua/weird_managers/,antiwork,"I’ve been working for [REDACTED] as a host for years. A few months ago, the restaurant’s hired two new managers who, frankly, act like they weren’t even trained as basic hosts. 

For one, they’re kind of incompetent at remembering everything but don’t want to be corrected? I continuously keep correcting them about which seats fit what number of customers and which orders go to which tables when passing out food. When I do this, though, they get all fussy and “I know I know you don’t have to tell me” even though they’re doing things wrong and I’m nicely correcting them with “sorry” and “ma’am”s and everything. 

Also, they like pointing fingers but don’t own up to their mistakes so when staff are freaking out about a missing order they just let a chaotic blame game unfold. Weird behaviour for a manager, I think. My other managers aren’t like that—and they trained me not to be like that either.

Another thing: they keep calling in hosts/servers to work but then cutting them before even two hours, which feels a little… illegal. I could be wrong, though. (Is that legal in Canada? I googled and read through some papers that say it’s illegal to not pay us hosts/servers less than two hours work, but idk not sure)

And finally, they’re so bad at being professional. Like. Almost hilariously bad. One of them continuously acts rude to the few colored workers we have even though she herself is a colored woman (ex: she yelled “what the HELL, Rin?” at a coworker of mine who is 15. (Rin’s not her actual name for privacy’s sake). The girl made the ‘terrible’ mistake of carrying the wrong order up to the counter. Rin didn’t even wrongfully pass the order to the wrong customer—she caught her mistake and apologized and turned around to grab the right order. Manager yelled at Rin in front of a crowd of eight customers while the poor customers awkwardly stood there. Ex2: today, as per usual, I was going to ask one of the servers—lets call him Pen—if he was okay with seating a large group of 13 people before leading those people to their tables. I asked the manager if I could leave the counter for a sec to go ask Pen. Manager said “um. Of course he’d be okay. OBVIOUSLY! go set up the tables already quit making the customers wait” ??? Mind you there was only ONE customer (out of the thirteen reserved) who was currently at the counter. The entire party of thirteen wasnt even in yet lmao. Customer and I actually exchanged a shocked glance at Manager’s tone and words. Ex3: one of the new managers outright said “when i tell you to do something, just do it! Stop acting like im wrong!“ and what was that manager demanding? I carry a gluten-free order to a table RIGHT AFTER carrying a non-gluten free order to another table. That’s like. Directly against food safety. Every host/server in my vicinity side-eyed each other so hard when manager said that. I had to go grab my general manager to sit that manager down for a protocol-reminder-chat. This isn’t even all the unprofessional instances I witnessed. I feel like I’d be making this ungodly long if I wrote down every instance tho lol)

Anyways, just wondering: is this typical new manager behavior? I’ve only worked with three other managers my entire time at [REDACTED]—they were all established managers for 9+ years at our location. They don’t behave like this at all, and all the senior servers  (4-7+ years) tell me those managers were proper even when they were new too. "

They paint a very sad picture of the world that although I want it to be different and believe in the competency of people it is getting harder and harder.

All of this leads to the question, what will you do?  We see these stories say the world is messed up then go on with our day.  Aren't we just accepting it by doing this if that's the case why bother being on here at all?  

Do we actually want the situation to change or do we just complain and say we did our part.  Awareness is important, but I think we have confused awareness with action.  I am not saying we should go as far as destroy the system however you want to interpret that.  

But what is it you are doing to make things better?  There are many people that I feel can give confident answer to this question, I am NOT one of them.  I believe there must be a realistic way of bringing about the world we want and I think the answer may lie somewhere with understanding our limits while at the same time looking for ways to just improve small things around us.  

I am very likely wrong, but I want to put this forward as it has bothered me for some time now.  I apologize for my rant and I hope that maybe someone else can come up with better answers to these questions, but for now here they are, thank you for your time?"

Working in this warehouse for almost 6 months (tomorrow around midnight since I work 3rd shift) made me realize something.

A) The longer you work for a temp agency. The more you notice people who started with you or started ahead of you are gone. And you are working under the illusion of being “permanent” just to let them know you’re still here.

B) With new hires being straight from the company and not a temp service. You are now a closed caption for “termination” in some form or fashion (if that happens).

C) Doing more work to get hired on. But if hired. More incentives with more work is piled on. 

D) Temp pay is different from hired on pay. Currently $19.70 but hired on is $20 and some change.

E) Working past your 90 days doesn’t guarantee hire. Especially never missing work or calling out for something important.

There’s always a catch when you work somewhere. Especially temp services which I hate. There is no guarantee that I’ll be hired on. Which I don’t bank on it. And you have to keep asking the supervisor if that’ll be so. But I just don’t care. I’m in my 30s. I’m not wasting time when it comes to these bullshit rules and pay. Everything is expensive and something gotta give. I’m not loyal to a company when not considered since “dependability” is what they ask for.

- there were 4 people in the store, all with larger bags of some kind, and he chose to follow the women and her companion (who was black), they were not suspicious at all and all looked to be of the same social class

-he followed and frequently bothered a very friendly women who had some physical abnormalities to make sure she didnt steal

-he followed my (black) friend until he directly confronted my boss, where my boss just says he didn’t recognize my friend

And just generally makes anyone who comes in who doesn’t fit the higher class, white mold feel unwelcome (this isn’t just me who has this opinion, costumers will tell me directly or write reviews later)

Along with this we have security that does the exact same stuff, some of which who have directly said they want to beat homeless people and completely ban them from the store

Is there anything I can do that could somehow either get the word out about this or legal stuff that could help?

Bonus facts: as you could guess he underpays us, doesn’t even remember a quarter of us, fired my coworker for using the restroom too long (because of a medical condition they knew about, but he chose not to press legal action), and also casually told me how my coworker passed away (information it seemed their family didn’t want us to know) and effectively spat on her memory

The investment strategies used by hedge fund managers. So much shit is all such a big fucking waste of time. Just bullshit jobs, everywhere.

There’s a long story involved, but basically parents bad means organs developed wrong means I’ll both always need miralax to be able to go and also that I’m terrified of anyone knowing that’s what I’m doing.

I work in a call centre and have to type in the office group chat why I’m not taking calls at any given moment, so here it’s “nr rr” (not ready, restroom). That’s already bad enough. I don’t want anyone to know I pee either, but I got a uti that turned into sepsis a few years ago and don’t fuck around with that one anymore. Also, there’s no parents bad with that one, it’s carried over from the other bodily function. Every time I type it, a supervisor tells me to hurry. They do it to everyone, it’s not personal. There’s a girl who goes several times a day to vape in the bathroom. Why do I know that? ITS IN THE FUCKING CHAT. I know she vapes through other people, but the convo started with, “ever notice how often Name is in the bathroom??? It’s because she’s vaping.” They knew I’d already know she goes quite often and they were fucking right. 

Parents bad, can’t let anyone know I go, not taking my miralax so I won’t go at work… it’d been long enough I was throwing up like I did as a kid. Loudly throwing up my meds and the few sips of energy drink I’d had to take it with into the rubbish bin at my desk was mortifying since everyone nearby could see I skipped breakfast, which sucks if you're an adult hiding an ED, but was far less terrifying than them knowing that I, a living being, use the bathroom. 

My therapist said nobody should be saying shit as long as I'm not there over 20 minutes and that nobody should have to be explicitly told??? I hate this."

It’s honestly the easiest job I’ve ever had with great benefits. But upper management looks down on my position and the people who work it and sees us as nothing more than peasants.

I’ve been in 2 separate interviews working here. One for the position and one for a promotion. The person who got the promotion was a union leader that sold us out on the last contract. Not once during these interviews did they take the time to look at my resume or work history. 

I work as a custodian at a university. Went there to get the free tuition benefit, but covid messed up that plan.

They cannot find a mechanic to fix their vehicles in house and are losing so much money on fleet repairs. 

Every time they start talking about it, I just laugh on the inside. I graduated from the same university with a degree in auto mechanics and have been working on vehicles my whole life. 

Recently they had me just start doing repairs on their cleaning equipment with a certain level of hesitation. Questioning if I was qualified or had the mechanical aptitude for the job. They appeared rather surprised when things that have been sitting for years suddenly are getting fixed.

I’m taking a small moral victory at looking at everything that needs to be done, but isn’t getting done because they do not have the right people or enough people. If just once they looked at my resume they would know I’ve done plumbing, electrical, welding, fabrication, carpentry, automotive.

So now I’m just counting down the years until my student loans are forgiven and my kids get their free tuition so I can be free of this place."

I took a slight pay cut to come to this job because of the promise that in around 6 months time i would be promoted to General Manager and have my own store. I was basically brought on to help a struggling store and train to be a GM. 

Yesterday I went to lunch with my current GM and my District Manager, who confirmed the plans of my growth and that it was basically assumed I would be the new General Manager of a specific store by August of this year.

Then last night after that meeting I was sent a group text from my GM to everyone in my store saying that we had a meeting that was mandatory for everyone from my current store and the one I was planned to take over.

Fast forward to today at 3:30, our meeting started and we were abruptly told that both stores were being shut down due to the lack of business 

We all were offered to either transfer to different stores-at minimum an hour and a half away- or take a severance package of TWO WEEKS PAY. (total of about $2,000)

To say im distraught is an understatement. i feel like i was slapped in the face. during the meeting i didnt know whether to scream cry or laugh in my DMs face.

The worst part is having to hear from him(my DM) about how hard this has been on him and how he thinks the offer is generous.

tldr; i quit my job for a promised growth opportunity only to be blindsided with the store shutting down and offered two weeks pay as severance"

The CEO of the company is only CEO in name, and does NOT work in the company in any capacity. He just owns it, and treats it like his personal piggy bank, and I hear that he is going to lay off the entire tech team (he doesn't understand the consequence of this because again he does not work in the company, and doesn't know how it runs), because there were circumstances in his life where he needs immediate short term cash. He has done this before with other departments, where he will lay off an entire department with very short notice, suffer the consequences of the absence of these people, then ask them to come back. The business model of the company is profitable, but the CEO has yearly habit of just coming in and draining it, sometimes its not enough and he will chop off parts of the company (again only to realize that its very harmful after the fact, and reversing the firings). I am thinking about programming a mechanism where the software becomes unusable after my team's long absence, I do not plan on being hired back even if begged because I do not want to continue this cyclic firing / oops-i-messed-up-come-back crap.

Quick background: I work in manufacturing and our normal schedule is (4) 12-hr shifts Monday thru Thursday. Couple weeks ago they told us that we would be working every other Friday because in July they are shutting down for 5 weeks for a huge maintenance project/system updates.

Next week is the Friday to work, but it happens to be Good Friday. GF is a scheduled paid holiday, a schedule thats been out since middle of December. So, if we were to work it we would get 2.5 times our pay. So they decided to change the holiday to the following Monday and give us the day off.

So, instead of working 60 hours with 8 hours being overtime and 12 hours being holiday pay (82 hours of straight pay) we now are working 60 hours with 20 being overtime (70 hours of straight pay). 

Then the following week we loss our overtime, because holiday pay is not subject to overtime accumulations. So, 36 hours of work and 12 hours of holiday. Instead of 48 hours with 8 overtime (52 hours of straight pay) it's just 48, all straight.

I make approx $25 an hour. All of that translates to $400 Gross pay being taken from me. Times 12 people on the 2 shifts, that's $4800 the company is saving in payroll. A Multi-million dollar company.

They really really just don’t care. The hard part is that I can’t just quit and the job market sucks so bad right now. Sigh. I am glad to be employed but I am doing the bare minimum to get by. Family company may ass! All those C suite ppl make so much money and all they do is sit in meetings. Must be nice to be born into a rich family where you are given a cushy job! I am 43 year old and I did everything like I was supposed to. I was a good kid who never got in trouble. I went to school, got married, had kids. And now we can afford to live but not do anything fancy or extra. No fun family vacations for us each year. We are lucky that my boomer parents are pretty amazing and will rent places for us to take a chill vacation. I just don’t know I see others who are making way more money than me and I just don’t understand. "

I'm long since in the habit of checking my hours every pay period from previous sketchy jobs, but my question is whether I'd have a leg to stand on in the worst case scenario where the app didn't track me properly, my manager didn't/couldn't back me up, and HR played hardball.

I was hopeful she would make positive changes but oh boy was I wrong. The building is split into different wings and we have crews that work specifically on that wing. We are a team and I love each and everyone of my coworkers. We consistently go above and beyond, not for management’s sake but because we all feel like we are in it together. My one joy at work is making my coworkers day better and I know they feel the same. To that end all of us will go in on our days off if things are going to shit just to have each others back. Even though our motivation is loyalty to each other management certainly does reap the benefits of our crew. It’s been one week into our new DON’s tenure and she brought us all into her office one by one to write us up for missing too much work. As you probably could guess when an illness rips through the population of a nursing home it also rips through the people who are caring for them. The vast majority of our days missed were a direct result of working there and yet that’s not their problem according to them. In our meeting there was no mention of all the days I came in to help, no mention of the times I’ve stayed late or all the holidays I worked. For reference I missed 9 days out a twelve month period and picked up at least every other week. We are all pissed and the same day she pulled that shit she got 3 two week notices from a twelve person crew. I know from others that they are looking and I’m giving my notice the next day I work. I am sorry I will not be working with my friends any more and I will miss our residents but I’m so happy I won’t be working for someone who doesn’t see their workers as humans with lives outside of work. I also find it incredibly funny that in her first week as DON she has managed to lose the home’s most valuable asset, an entire crew of knowledgeable, kind and dedicated CNAs. How are you supposed to run a nursing home now without CNAs? What fun it is to fuck around and find out! "

4,2024-03-21,Don’t Give Up,u/R0b0_L0b0,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bk7j5n/dont_give_up/,antiwork,"I occasionally read through this subreddit out of curiosity, but today I was moved to say something because of the immense hopelessness and despair that I witnessed today about the future.

I’ve dealt with severe medical issues, autism, depression, insomnia, and PTSD for most of my life, and while I have considerable privilege and I was able to go to college, I’ve struggled to stay employed at all and I’ve had a bunch of awful, abusive workplaces. I’m currently waiting for my medication support for my PTSD to catch up to that I’m having worse PTSD symptoms around work. I’m so badly in need of a vacation that I damn near couldn’t bring myself to show up to work this morning.

So, what do I have to say to this subreddit given that? Life can be really shitty, relentlessly so a lot of the time, and there are no guarantees of anything including basic human dignity, at least here in the USA. I have done lots of volunteer work and activism stuff, and I really don’t think it mattered worth a damn because the structural, social forces that caused the problem in the first place vastly outweighed the personal problems that contributed to the people I helped needing help. When I was 15 and I opposed the Iraq War in my crappy conservative hometown, I had to break someone’s collarbone and jaw to escape a confrontation because they and their two friends came at me with a switchblade for “hating America.” Almost none of my experiences having dearly-held left-of-center beliefs have gone better than that. I took a graduate-level sociology class and the professor told me that “I could solve all of the world’s problems in detail in a book, but keep your head down because political headwinds are a very real thing and they can and will come for you.”

Ultimately what I have to say is this: I’m a devout Buddhist, and I do believe that all life is suffering. I think suicide would harm everyone I care about and others besides, and have real consequences for karma for more than just me. The only practical advice I’ve ever received about work from a therapist was “to be glad I don’t work on a fishing boat in Thailand” (where slavery is common and awful working conditions prevail). I have a job that is good now, and I still struggle with it, but I’m making progress. But that’s what life in America is: Staying one step ahead of total slavery.

This is all I have to say to people here: I hope depressed and traumatized people here seek treatment and avoid suicide. I take medication (Effexor for PTSD and depression relapse prevention, trazodone for PTSD and insomnia) because I have to if I’m going to put up with another day’s worth of bullshit. The world is super messed up, and it is surely getting worse, but I implore everyone here: If you can’t derive some happiness from that your work situation is trending better, or that you are making tomorrow a little better than today, please get help instead of railing against our economic system. That occasional small progress, aside from a few square inches of brain matter behind your eyes, is all that you have that is truly yours. The wheels of history turn way too slowly to hope for progress on that front to rescue you.

Side note: I won’t deny that my friends who moved to other countries have had much better lives than I have staying in the USA. They have their own problems though, like sometimes the grocery store is out of food."

Don’t get me wrong, I understand that misgendering is GOING to happen, it’s inevitable and frankly I don’t care if strangers or casual acquaintances do it. That’s why I never talk about it most of the time. However, when I’ve been working with my co-workers for long enough, I usually tell them I go by they/them.

What irks me is every time I get closer and feel more safe to open up in a workplace, I get weird looks, misgendered intentionally, or get roped into a “debate”. It’s not like I shove it in peoples faces. I simply ask them to call me by “they/them” because I thought we’d respect each other enough to care. Apparently not. I used to always catch my store owner and manager referring to me as she/her behind my back and then feigning forgetfulness when talking face to face. They also suspiciously kept telling me about their church services afterwards. I thought my fellow co-workers would have my back, but only two seemed to be allies. One guy kept making “light hearted jokes” about me being an “it” and would try and instigate debates like a Steven Crowder wannabe (he specifically told me he watches his content).

I feel like this sort of behavior should be seen as unprofessional, but apparently I’m the one “bringing politics into the workplace”. I’m tired of my very existence being considered “political”."

3,2024-03-21,Advice Needed,u/qualityshitmarty,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bk8epv/advice_needed/,antiwork,"I put in my resignation notice to leave my current job for a new job on March 14th. I told my boss that my first day of the new job would be April 11th. I then handed in a time sheet asking for April 4th-10th off as paid time off (PTO) as my personal time will not be carried over into this new job and I will be paid out for my vacation. Sick is the only time they will carry over. She told me she would have to ask her boss and get back to me. I decided to make sure the resignation notice was in writing and put that my last day would be April 4th if I got the PTO or April 10th if not. For context, a coworker of mine in my department that we’ll name “Hannah”, recently left in mid January and this coworker made her aware that she was in the interview process about a month to a month and half prior to her leaving as she was staying within the organization but moving departments. My boss has not hired someone to replace her since. I am basically the lead of my department, my coworker that left was the next best employee, another I’ll name “Joe” is great but has a disability that sometimes poses some limitations to his abilities, and a coworker I’ll name “Ron” is elderly so he honestly doesn’t and can’t do much because of his lack of technological ability. I am basically the go to person, know the most about my department, and for awhile, did the most. Because I’m good, two coworkers in different departments  have trusted me to be their backups for when they aren’t here as well. Also, before my current boss came on,  I had to inform her about what we do here in this department. So basically, now that Hannah has left, that leaves me, Joe, and Ron. We have been in this situation previously, before they hired Hannah. Joe and I were able to manage. But, now that I’m leaving, there is concern about how things will go without me being there and understandably so. My boss is finally moving along in the hiring process to replace my coworker “Hannah” and blames HR for the delay in the process as they “forgot to post the job” until a couple days prior to me announcing my resignation. Due to this, she said she was hesitant to approve my time as she thinks she will have a new hire that last week I am looking to take time and wants me to train them. She said she doesn’t want to deny my PTO, but it would be better if I could split the time up or take that time sooner and remain here that final week up until my new job starts. I thought about it and decided to tell her I need a break between employment and my last day will be April 4th whether it’s PTO or unpaid. She obviously isn’t happy about that, but seemed understanding enough. She did ask however that I write up a super detailed, step by step list of what I do. I thought nothing of it until my bf asked me why I’m doing that for her when it’s 1.) not my job and 2.) she’s probably not going to approve my PTO. I realized, he’s right. So at the moment, I don’t know if the time will be approved or not. I’m leaning towards not. But I’m also thinking of talking with her to say, in a professional and nice way, if she doesn’t approve my PTO I don’t feel comfortable providing her with a how to guide on what I do. When I mentioned this to two coworkers, they brought up how much down time I have so I should just do my job (which is writing that list), provide my boss with the list, and be the “bigger person” even if she doesn’t approve the PTO. Any advice? Thanks! "

I am the assistant manager. Once she made it known to the co-ceo's that she would be leaving, I told them that I'd be interested in taking over that role. They said they were happy to get the message and they would let me know when they would be starting interviews. Cut to yesterday, after a couple weeks of hearing nothing, my manager on the way out tells me that they decided to 1) transfer a manager from a different location to ours, and 2) take an employee who also asked to have a more managerial role and make her the location manager at that other location. The location manager that is transferring was just told he is being transferred without asking for it, and knew that I wanted the job, and now he's worried I'm gonna hate him. Obviously, it's not his fault, but I'm allowed to be angry. And truth be told, his now old location has a higher turnover rate for employees because there was very little structure and he wasn't a very active manager. 

I'm just venting. Complete lack of communication to me, stringing me along, and still no response or announcement and my current manager leaves tomorrow. Been with this company for 3 years, and up until now I've been treated more than fairly. I just don't even want to go to work for the next week. Let them figure it all out on their own."

I have always been an honest and a hard working person. I try to do everything by the book, respect science, and most importantly, respect other humans. I have the integrity to accept that I don't know some things, even if they are within my own field. Yet, I feel like I am always criticized for tiny mistakes.
 
Honest, hard working people never get any lime light. The construction workers, electricians, retail workers, scientists, programmers, etc. They never get proper recognition, in fact, they are not even treated like humans by most corporations. They feel real pressure in their lives. They are the ones who run our society. The brains behind massive projects remain unknown to people. 

And then there is Musk. He is proven to have lied multiple times, disregards law and basic decency, a giant douchebag whose daughter refuses to speak to him, and yet people literally worship him. He has gone full MAGA, and constantly posts biogted stuff on Twitter. Regardless of this douchebaggery, outside of the internet, he is still regarded as a genius.

The way people are lauding the recent Neuralink success got to me. I dreamt of doing neuroscience research all my life, but life came in the way. I still have knowledge about neuroscience but seeing this absolute baffoon be attributed to success of neuroscientists stings a little. He is able to convince millions he is a genius, while I cannot even convince recruiters that I am capable of doing job even with relevent internships and experience. This is so unfair. 

I wish to see his downfall. I wish for people to see him for what he really is. A grifter. I am in no way saying I am a genius, but I have the humility to accept that I am not. I want the actual brains behind the technologies he touts as his creations get the recognition. 

I don't want to be thinking this way because my entire morning is ruined and it is wrong to wish for someone's bad times. I don't want to be the one wishing ill on someone because that goes against my values. I just wish I had this unconditional love that grifters like Musk get from people without being constantly scrutinized. 

I want to be a better person. I want to work on my goals. I recently graduated and have been unemployed for the last 7 months. Finances are catching up and I have nowhere to go. But whenever I see this douchebag get this much attention and appreciation, a part of me dies. I lose my spirit and motivation to move forward because no matter what I do, I will never be celebrated like him. Like I mentioned, even recruiters are not giving a damn despite the fact that my skills suit their job description word-to-word. 

I want to change this thinking. I want to stop being jealous and fill myself with negative thoughts. Do you guys have any solutions or suggestions? Therapy is out of question because I can barely afford rent and groceries, and getting a public-funded therapist in Canada takes about 3-4 months. How to stop feeling jealous of these douchebags? "

2,2024-03-21,AITA for telling my boss I'm not coming in next month as I booked a vacation?,u/mushrooms8,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bkaazq/aita_for_telling_my_boss_im_not_coming_in_next/,antiwork,"My best friend is coming to visit me next month and I only see her about once a year, if not less. Right now I haven't seen her since November 2022 (she lives in a different country). She told me she was coming in April (she can't choose when she visits, it's too complicated to explain) last November and I tried to ask my boss for it off, but she told me not to ask for anything past 1st April yet.

In my country, you get a set amount of holidays ever year that reset on the 1st of April. So, from April-April you can take them and if you don't they just disappear and reset back to 0, and as you work you gain more. So she was saying because of this, she doesn't want to hear about anyone's plans for past then yet, and just to let her know about anything up until then.

Fast forward to December and I was telling her about a different few days I wanted off and while I was asking for this, I said something like, ""but I shouldn't ask for anything after 1st April yet still, right?"" and she said yes.

So now a week ago she finally said, ""okay, is there anything you want past 1st April now?"" and I told her which dates, and she told me no, because she had already booked a vacation the same week. I explained how important this holiday was for me as it's my best friend I never see, and even said she's already booked her flight and I've booked train tickets, but she still said no.

A few days after I see that she rota'd me in to work all those days. So after a week of thinking about it, today I went to her and said, I'm sorry, but I'm not coming in on those days. I expected it to not go that well, but she was really mad. She didn't yell or anything but definitely expressed that she was irritated/upset with me.

She basically tried to tell me that she never said I couldn't ask for it off before now, even though she literally did, twice. She said how I never told her which dates I was taking and I said that she told me I couldn't ask. We kept going around in circles cause she kept trying to say she never said that basically.

Eventually she kind of let go of that, but I brought up how I sacrificed my time with family & friends in December as I had to work Christmas Eve, New Years Eve & New Years Day, yet she let my colleague take 3 weeks off during all of that. She said that she tried to make it up to me by giving me some weekends off since then, but that doesn't make it up in my opinion. I said I shouldn't have to sacrifice more time with loved ones when it's another really important week for me.

It ended with me leaving her office and saying bye and she just didn't say bye back. She said she'd have to come up with a response for me later.

I really hate confrontation and I'm really good at letting people convince me that they're right. I talked to my mum about this and she totally made me confident that I was in the right, but then once I talked to me boss, now I feel guilty. I feel like I'm in the right, but she seems to think I'm not at all."

We are told to only take happy hours “at the correct time and place” which is literally never. I tried, I got scolded for my last happy hour I attended after 5pm. I had nothing immediately due!

The key differences being a choice of wording (Lords are now Employers, Peasants are now Workers, Investors are now Nobility), and that under Capitalism, you appear to have a choice as to what work you want to do (you can choose to be educated to be a lawyer or a doctor, or a park ranger, or an accountant, etc.)  The other key difference is that you can choose to become a member of Nobility, however, nobody is taught that in school.  We're taught to get a job, learn a skill, become a master of that skill, and retire. (Basically Feudalism).

I'd like to know, when this system eventually comes crashing down, and it will soon, what's the next phase in economic evolution?  Will we finally be able to create a system that truly benefits everybody in society?  Can we turn a pyramid into a sphere?  Can we remove the incentive to be at the top, only caring about the self, and move to a more generous, caring about all people, and being helpful to everybody?

Is that called \[the *dreaded, evil*\] Socialism?  What do you think will replace Capitalism?  We all know this system is currently totally unsustainable.  It's impossible to continue to grow and expand with finite resources.  What happens when the Dragons at the top have hoarded ALL the wealth?"

Recently I’ve been thinking of taking a 2 month break from just WORKING in general. No job. I have a decent amount saved up, and if I live frugally, and shop at Aldi’s then I should be fine.
I told one of my coworkers this, she’s a nice old lady. But the conversation went like this.

I say.
“I feel like this job is just taking my youth and life away. 40 hours a week is so much time. I could be so much better at drawing with that time.”

She says.
“Well think about me, I’ve been doing this for my whole life, your young I’m old.”
I said “Both of us shouldn’t have to constantly work our entire lives”

She says “Well that’s just how life is. That’s just how life works.” 

And I say “it doesn’t have to be that way. I mean, slavery was (just how life worked) but they didn’t accept that, they fought to end it. We shouldn’t accept stagnation.”

After that she just pulled out her phone and kind of just ignored me.
Earlier she started talking to me about god and how he will find a way for you if you pray, after I said something similar to her. But that’s just waiting for something that (personally I don’t believe exists.) it’s just accepting this and waiting for an answer to happen. One that YOU probably caused.

I think people are too comfortable. This is like a comfortable kind of hell. Sure you get things like a home, food, internet,  etc. But you have to grind your body mind and soul away to keep it.

To see so many people get screwed/forced by their direct report is moronic at its best, it is literally in their job of what they should be ""Managing"". 

When your their actual job title will like include ""Supervisor"", ""Controller"", ""Manager"" etc... It literally is part their job being ""People Managers"" but clearly the are so short sited to realise this.

The anxiety and pressure (among many other aspects) of being ridiculed for not following ""orders"" along with putting undue pressure on employee through is unjustified, and the simple face it can take place is beyond. 

No wonder people are ""quit quitting"" or actually quitting on mass given the port state of the leadership in some companies.

It is very rare to ever see a ""success story"" where someone actually got taken seriously by HR and the manager was investigated, and removed.

Example, my previous manager (Supply Chain Manager) direct report the Supply Chain Director was suspended and investigated for two things bullying (reported by other managers) and embezzlement. Hazard a guess which one they were dismissed for.

Workplace laws and regulations are stacked against you, add-in the fear of being penalised or worse fired for challenging a line manager that has abused there position, doesn't follow the rules, believing in the ""one rule for them, one rule for everybody else""

Finally, HR Teams are not their to protect you, they are essentially PR and are there to protect the companies interest, and image.

I'm sorry to see daily what people have to go through within there workplaces, even all we are trying to do is pay our living expenses, try to find some fulfillment outside of work and provide for our loved ones.

It truly is a sad state of affairs we live.

And likely tax fraud of some kind. Tips arent reported, and we use an old, rusty drawer. The manager takes a percent of tips and they get profit share as well, but I believe that is a slimy transfer too. We do accept CCs but its a 3rd part machine.

It made me realise how stupid the modern workplace is becoming.

I work a regular 9-5 office job for context. It’s pretty laidback and I’ve been there for over a year without any real issues. That’s what makes this even more perplexing and infuriating.

We had a team meeting towards the end of the day on a Friday a couple of weeks ago. It was the first time a lot of us had met our new colleague (we’ll call her Debbie) since she had started earlier in the week.

Our boss decided to do a dumb but (seemingly) harmless little ice-breaker Q&A at the end of the meeting for Debbie, which just involved us asking her fun, light-hearted questions.

It was all going as well as those things can, then a colleague asks Debbie what movie she likes most. Debbie starts talking about this movie about a motorcycle gang which stars John Travolta, Martin Lawrence and I think Willem Dafoe. I can’t remember what the name is but I do remember seeing it a long time ago, and I really didn’t like it then.

A few people mention that they haven’t seen it, so I join in and say “I have, I thought it sucked!”. Bear in mind that it’s a Friday afternoon, everyone’s in good spirits and I was laughing while I said it. Debbie seemed to laugh it off at the time too and she answered a couple more questions before my boss wrapped up the meeting and we left for the weekend.

So I come back to work on Tuesday (having taken Monday off) and find out that Debbie hasn’t been back in since Friday. I then get invited to a meeting after lunch by my boss.

I join the meeting in my bosses office and he tells me that someone from HR will be joining remotely too. Now I’m concerned as to what this could be about.

My boss explains to me that Debbie has been signed off with work-related stress, and that she had spoken to him personally and cited my behaviour as the main reason. To say I was stunned would be a massive understatement. I explained that the first - and only - time we had even interacted was during the meeting on Friday. My boss said that it was the “incident” at that meeting that had caused Debbie to be unwell.

My boss explained that Debbie’s ex-husband was a keen motorcyclist, and that movie was very special to them. Debbie and her ex had just recently got divorced, and apparently my comments had caused her a great deal of stress, having dredged up all of this negative feeling from her personal life.

My boss stated that my comments were “wholly inappropriate” and that I should consider this a formal verbal warning. I should have protested more but I was just so taken aback. I explained that I had no idea about Debbie’s situation and her connection to the movie. I was genuinely not a fan of the movie and can’t even remember the name of it, so I really didn’t consider this to be a big deal. Then my boss tells me that I don’t appear to be taking this seriously! He dismissed me from the meeting.

I was so confused and couldn’t concentrate on work for the rest of the day. To be honest, it’s hard to care about work at all when they can treat me like that for such an innocuous statement.

In conclusion, work sucks and is demoralizing!

TLDR; I got a formal warning at work for not liking a John Travolta Disney movie."

Mostly, there are 7 workers on at anytime during regular working hours for my department with two on call personnel at all times. Those two are designated weeks ahead of time for each day. However, they’ve included an over staffing position, referred to as AOS. Now this person was hired to work specific days as we all are. It’s a set schedule every week, same days. However, for a day, we may be over staffed. The AOS position is being treated as an on call personnel. However, they don’t receive on call pay while sitting at home. If they’re called in and refuse, the company takes their PTO to cover for that day. If they’re not called in because they weren’t needed, the company still takes the PTO. This feels like stealing. They were hired to work that day specifically. For those on call, they receive on call pay, and 1.5x pay for being called in if they are. It feels like they’re stealing PTO & money from people. I want to call the department of labor, but I want to remain anonymous. "
1,2024-03-21,Need creative advice on how to quit in the most lucrative way,u/InformationOk3150,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bkg7po/need_creative_advice_on_how_to_quit_in_the_most/,antiwork,"
I have been working at my current company for 2 years. I have been promised a promotion 3 separate times over the last 9 months and it has not come to fruition. Finally the most recent time they rejected me after promising the promotion again, they cited the economic climate as reason why I wouldn’t be getting the promotion, then proceeded to explain that they wanted to see me complete a special project to prove that I “deserve” the promotion. Lol. You can imagine my frustration with this place. 

In the interim, my company has been dragged through the media by one of their landlords because they aren’t paying their contracted lease fees. All internal communications related to this matter are handled with complete denial of the situation. I also happen to know, because I work closely with the finance group, that the company has poor cash flow. 

Over the last few months because of all this I’ve intensified my job search, and I feel as though I’m getting close to being offered a job at a new company. So, that means I need to figure out an exit strategy for this current company. 

Is it smart to ask to be laid off either with or without disclosing that I have a new job lined up? I would like to milk this company for all they have and take home a nice severance package. I don’t care about “burning the bridge” for various reasons, some you may be able to figure out. I could go full on blackmail and imply that I’ll write a nasty review on Glassdoor- do they even care? Or I could imply that I’ll speak to the media about what I know about the financial situation? I know most people will probably say it’s not worth the risk, but what am I really risking? 

Any other possible creative solutions?"

I do my job. I do it well. I provide several vital team and office services which are voluntary and on top of my regular work. I am polite and I help others often.

My upper manager has gaslight several others into feeling like they need to respond to every single one of her emails with:

Thank you so much (boss) for all of the things you do for us, you are awesome, etc.

This is in response to her just doing her job (updating us on a few rule, telling us she will be out of office so contact x other manager, forwarding a metrics task from her bosses, etc). 

It is 100% fake. I know it's fake because it is only directed at her. These people never do the same for others (including the fill in managers, other higher up managers, team  members, etc). It is unnecessary. It is weird! 

I am FINE with saying please and thank you to things. If I need clarification on a rule, I say thanks. If I need to discuss vacation time, I say please. This is fine and normal levels of polite behavior.

So recently I got dinged on my annual performance review for ""not being a team player."" I asked for specific feedback. She responded with a copy of the employee expectations. I asked if she could help me determine which expectation I'm not meeting and she said, ""It's really your overall attitude. Other people in the team don't feel like you are part of the team.""

This seems like bs. The only thing I don't do is the fake praise for her emails. Otherwise I meet and exceed all other group team behaviors. 

Should I fake my way through this? Do exactly what she is silently asking for? Do it over the top? 

Or just ignore it? 

The thing that's tough is that I used to be friendly with her. We met up to play with our dogs a few times. I helped her with a deeply personal project at one point. We had a good relationship until recently, when she started needing so much praise. 

I don't think she understands that it actually causes me to be disengaged and resentful - and want to be less of a team player. I am definitely not the person who needs to help her understand. "

17,2024-03-21,"Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Speech Regarding ""2nd Bill of Rights"" or ""Bill of Economic Rights""",u/Imaginary-Prize-9589,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bkizz7/franklin_delano_roosevelts_speech_regarding_2nd/,antiwork,"It is our duty now to begin to lay the plans and determine the strategy for the winning of a lasting peace and the establishment of an American [standard of living](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living) higher than ever before known. We cannot be content, no matter how high that general standard of living may be, if some fraction of our people—whether it be one-third or one-fifth or one-tenth—is ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill-housed, and insecure.

This Republic had its beginning, and grew to its present strength, under the protection of certain inalienable political rights—among them the right of free speech, free press, free worship, trial by jury, freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures. They were our rights to life and liberty.

As our nation has grown in size and stature, however—as our industrial economy expanded—these political rights proved inadequate to assure us equality in the pursuit of happiness.

We have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence. ""Necessitous men are not free men.""[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bill_of_Rights#cite_note-9) People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.

In our day these economic truths have become accepted as self-evident. We have accepted, so to speak, a second Bill of Rights under which a new basis of security and prosperity can be established for all—regardless of station, race, or creed.

Among these are:

* **The** [**right to a useful and remunerative job**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_work) **in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation;**
* **The right to** [**earn enough**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_wage) **to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation;**
* **The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living;**
* **The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from** [**unfair competition**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfair_competition) **and domination by** [**monopolies**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly) **at home or abroad;**
* **The** [**right of every family to a decent home**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_housing)**;**
* **The** [**right to adequate medical care**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_health) **and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health;**
* **The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of** [**old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_security)**;**
* **The** [**right to a good education**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_education)**.**

All of these rights spell security. And after this war is won we must be prepared to move forward, in the implementation of these rights, to new goals of human happiness and well-being.

America's own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for all our citizens. For unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world."
6,2024-03-21,Reactionary coworkers and organizing?,u/Cornsilkworm,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bkjapk/reactionary_coworkers_and_organizing/,antiwork,"Hi all, I'm doing a bit of soul-searching and could use outside opinions. I work in a retail shop, have been there since August of last year, and have a coworker who was hired about a month ago. He's a bit of a slacker, which I don't mind at all, and do nothing to discourage. However. 

There's reason to believe he may be under-reporting tips he receives. Normally I'd be all for it, since it's basically tax evasion, but it also means when we pool tips every day he's putting in less than his fair share. Tips in our shop are pretty consistently 10-15% of the gross income for the day, varying slightly depending on who's in the window. His are usually half that. To be fair, he's a larger guy, and fatphobia is a real issue which may contribute to him receiving fewer tips. However. 

He's also a big Trump supporter. Today, he came in wearing a MAGA hat, and has said some pretty reprehensible things about immigrants and border policy. For unrelated reasons, my boss floated the idea of hiring a previous employee back on, and firing the more recent coworker. Because I'm the most senior employee (yeah, a lot of turnover) she asked my opinion about it, and I was kind of at a loss. My boss is my enemy in terms of class structure, sure, and broadly speaking I'd never suggest she fire anybody, especially because she intends to do it with zero warning. 

But I kind of hate this guy. He talks shit about unions all the time and is generally bigoted. I know you don't need to be friends to organize with someone. Like, our class interests are aligned...but *he* doesn't know that. I've tried to point things out to nudge him in that direction, but he's been pretty unreceptive. 

What's the best way to deal with conservative/reactionary members of the proletariat? I don't like him, and I know he has another job he could get more hours from if he was fired from this one, so it's not like he'll starve or end up unhoused. But I still feel conflicted about telling my boss that it's fine to shitcan him. Thoughts?"

So I’ve just had two weeks sick leave because my anxiety was so bad from everything that’s been going on and before I returned they told me that there’s been a “shortage of work” and that my working hours will be 4 hours a day. I was only given two days notice for this. Unfortunately they are allowed to do this as per the contract. They said they feel that this will be good for me but then why was I never offered a choice? (Hint: it’s best for them, not me). On top of this, they are no longer letting me work from home, which is the only thing that made this job bearable. Their reasoning was “if you do this in front of us, I wonder what you do when you work from home!” I actually perform better from home but they don’t care about that either, it’s just about control.

What annoys me is that I got pulled up for bathroom breaks, even though the disciplinary never mentions about going to the bathroom it’s just “leaving the office for personal use on my phone.” Not only this, but another colleague on my team has clearly ratted me up about this because we both started at the same time and I got promoted but they didn’t, so it’s obviously their way of pulling me down.

Additionally, they want me to log down every time I leave the office for any reason (basically pissing and shitting, how draconian) and it’s making me miserable. I’m getting stuff tested because I do go bathroom quite a lot anyway but it’s worse when I’m anxious so it’s just a constant cycle of being watched and micro managed. They keep thinking that I’m leaving the office to go on my phone, like hell I’m leaving a brand new phone lying on my desk. My manager even said “we all see you sneaking it with you when you go out” like bro get to fuck, everyone does it. 

So yeah I’m gonna start this promotion soon but I’m handing in my notice soon after because I’m so burned out here, and if future employers ask why I left so soon after a promotion I can say it was because of the shortage of work 🤡"

It’s hard for me to be motivated to continue working after work hours and it doesn’t seem healthy.

Are all jobs like this? It seems like over time, the expectations become SO MUCH when you stay somewhere long enough, at least when it comes to desk jobs.

I’m looking for new jobs but the interviews aren’t coming fast enough, and it feels like it’s hard to find things in qualified for.

I’m interviewing for three roles, relatively early stages. Two of them I really want, and the third I’ll likely decline due to it being hybrid, and I’m disabled so I really need something fully remote. Seems like remote roles are becoming less of a thing now that everything is “back to normal” (not). 

Anyone have any advice? Especially for a disabled worker. I don’t have the funds to quit my job without having another one lined up, but it’s severely impacting my mental health and is making my illness worse due to the stress and not being able to have time to eat during the day/working long hours.

Liberals took it forgranted that ""a job"" is implied to guarantee fully funding survival -- otherwise, what's the point?  

But conservatives don't think this way.  Fortunately, this miscommunication is finally being realized and addressed. 

Many politicians on the left today are emphasizing shorter work weeks without loss of full time pay, indeed ""deflation."" Where productivity falls but compensation does not.  Additionally, some places like California are really tightening the ropes around making all jobs living wages.  

This will mean the closure of several businesses that can't afford to pay living wages to all.  This is a good thing.  It will mean less jobs and will likely cause some people to have to move and also will reduce the amount of new immigration as there will be less work available.  

If you can't exploit low skill individuals anymore, the only way to manage finite resources is to reduce the number of people living in a place.  This is a good thing, as it will improve quality of life in places by spreading people out so that places aren't so overpopulated and packed together.  Better traffic, more breathing room etc.

I'm working on a project that is a joint effort of multiple organizations.  Before I was hired, they were all supposed to be on board with the goals and activities etc.  They are all contributing money to it as well.  It's for a worthy cause, the kind of thing no one can really be *against* (like clean air, but it's not that).

Situation:

This one person from one of the supporting organizations has always been a headache but now I think they are deliberately sabotaging the project.  They seem to think it's their ""turf"", so no one else should do the project, but their organization isn't doing it either.  And they seem to think it just shouldn't be done if they're not doing it, so the community just goes without it.

This has come out in the form of *constantly* thinking up possible problems, obstacles, complications with every piece of work that is discussed, until I just do it anyway because all that was BS.  The only reason I involve them in discussions is because they are funders, there are connections between their work and the project, and as a courtesy.


Sooo, the latest is, months ago I was talking about doing a piece of work and this person said their org had already done it, so it didn't need to be done again.  So I asked if I could have the info from that work and they agreed.  This was in a big meeting of the project funders.  It's not private/proprietary info and info-sharing is normal for stuff like this.

After FOUR MONTHS it finally comes out that the previous work is more than a decade old and this person no longer has access to the info (they worked on this at the time, so it's their own files) and can't share it.  So FOUR MONTHS went by when I could have done the work.  It would be done by now, and the community would have it.  And their job is DEFINITELY to have the community's interests at top of mind.

I sort of can't get over how someone could be so unprofessional and petty even if means less benefit to the community.

""Don't do that work, we already did it.""

Four months later:

""Oh that work is really old and also I don't have it anymore.""


The capper is now they are trying sabotage the work AGAIN!  I'm going to plow ahead with it and they are STILL trying to think up obstacles even after I said I have everything I need.  They can't actually stop me, this person is not my boss, and they were semi-spiralling when I said I was going to do it anyway.

What makes a person like this?

Another thing, maybe it's related: This person is *extremely verbose*.  Like something is going on with them where they *cannot* stop talking even in professional contexts where it gets inappropriate and weird and saps people's strength.  What is that?"

This coworker doesn’t even know what it’s like to work hard, so their comments piss me off.

I finished a Bachelor's Degree with high grades and no debt. I finished a Master's degree with a 4.0, still no debt, and an 800+ credit score. I served on multiple student government committees. For nine years, I took low-paying student jobs with no employee benefits to gain relevant experience, in my field, at the two most prestigious institutions in my state for my field.

Well. I finally graduated 3 months ago. And I can't even get an interview. Not for full-time positions. Not for part-time positions. Not even for an internship program that accepts recent graduates in my field.

My mental health has gone to — while constantly applying for jobs over the past three months. But tonight, something has broken. I don't care anymore that the system won't even let me in. I'll puke out exactly one resume and cover letter per day. But that's it. Because I give up.

I've got books to read, movies to watch, music to listen to, workouts to do, indoor vegetable plants to learn to grow in my apartment because I can barely afford groceries, and a volunteer position I've had for a decade (also in my field!) that makes me feel like I'm serving a better purpose than myself.

My review was all 3’s and even a 4, except for one 2 which was listed as because I’m doing two roles. 

Well, how is that my fault? It’s just until the new system comes in, I’m doing my old job and the one I got promoted to *in august*. 

I believe this was so I didn’t get a raise. He even said the 2 was harsh. 

I do 50 hours overtime a month, work 6 days a week but they obviously don’t want to give me any acknowledgment or reward for this. 

Also, the company posted a job advert for a team lead in my department that I could easily do, and includes something I spent 10 years at my previous job doing, but I didn’t apply as, after my failed internal interview last time, I asked for a job spec of something the HR manager said I should go for, but no reply. 

I believe my manager had something to do with this. 

He called me an asset in the review.

Co-worker who is not great at her job gets a raise. 

They’ve also been dangling the WFH in front of me, but until the system comes in, cannot be done. 

Now, the person who has taken over my old job (it’s a two person job), has applied and got the same job but in a different department. 

So where does that leave me?

She’s allowed to leave but I’m not? 

Then the process starts over again and delays me going into my new role. As I’ll have to train and help the new hire. 

Welp, time to stop giving that overtime and try-hard attitude for no rewards. 

If things don’t improve, in a few months I will be coming into money, so then I will stop doing overtime and jump ship (once securing a job offer). 

Shame, as there’s generally nice people and it’s a good job. I tend to stay years at a job. I’ve been here 3 years. "

Financially, I think we'll be okay until my husband starts his job. I've just felt like a zombie every since I started packing up my desk. I was mentally prepared to say goodbye in three or so months. Not yesterday. I cried way more than I wanted to despite making bad jokes to try and stop crying.

This is the first time in my 10 or so working years I've had this happen and I might have felt for those who lost their job for some reason or another, but it's totally different when it happens to you. No matter how you feel about a job, it sucks.

Not only are they working her five days a week when I think she should be working three, but now she’s supposed to find coverage for those five days?

I do my best running a very small fulfillment dept for a very small business, and all this week the other guy who primarily works with me has been out sick. So I just suck it up and do the job with a smile on my face and get positive remarks for it all the while.
Yesterday, our guy comes back in after being out since last Thursday and offers to pick up a Friday (not a day he normally works). I say no need (our policy is that you don’t have to make up sick day, and we don’t dock your pay) (also I’ve taken three of these days since starting 4 years ago). But I float the idea of him covering for me Friday so I can take a long weekend and get some rest. That morning, when I ask one of my two bosses (at the tail
end of being praised), they give me a line about how we’re too busy for me to not be in (we’re not, they didn’t bother to look) and I ask if we can reevaluate after lunch. Seemed incredibly innocent in the moment.

So cut to lunch and both bosses have concocted a completely new narrative about how I cannot be giving away shifts (even though we spoke about me doing this exact thing and I’ve never taken them up on it) and how disappointing it is that I’m trying to take a “vacation day” with no notice. Having given no notice is the thing they chose to really fight me on, especially after I offered to not get paid for Friday. 

But I literally gave them all the notice I had, as it was a situation literally created by our guy showing up for work and offering. Before showing up Thursday, I assumed I was solo until Friday and that he’d be contagious. So him offering to work changed the situation, and I asked immediately. Anyway this element seems to have been completely ignored, and fuck me for even asking and in effect “trying to spend company money on one shift”

I am a registered nurse in the state of Ohio. I have been employed at an Outpatient Psych facility since July. I have been one of the top performers in the department and have consistently hit my productivity numbers even as a new hire. I have also helped the quality of care in the dept including updating paperwork, taking walk ins, covering other nurses, etc. My direct supervisor put a month's notice in back in Feb (she's been gone now about two weeks). At that time the director attempted to have her offload all of her responsibilities onto myself and the other two nurses in my department because they did not want to rehire. When I asked my director about this and how we were going to have to absorb a full time salary position on top of our huge caseloads (I'm responsible for 796 clients) she reprimanded me and told me I was causing morale issues in the department. Long story short I ended up giving my director my own notice on 3/12 stating my last day would be 4/12. After this my director stopped communicating with me and did not follow up on any of my day to day concerns. Yesterday she and HR pulled me into a meeting and told me I'd be transferred to a different location for the remainder of my notice. Nothing about this location was ever in my job description upon hire. I have covered there when the nurse was on vacation, etc but she recently quit and they have not found a replacement yet. The hours of operation are also changing on April 1st so they are different than the hours I was hired in for. I told them that if they were going to force me to do that then my notice would become effective immediately. They are now threatening me with keeping my unused PTO hours because I didn't work through my notice. Are they able to do this?

TL/ DR: I gave my job a months notice with my last day being 4/12 but they changed my job responsibilities, hours and location on 3/21 for the remainder of my notice. I refused and now they're keeping my unused PTO."

The over worked and underworked. I thought of this after my gf burst into tears over the stress of daily existence in a workweek. Feeling trapped in an never ending cycle of b/s from co-workers and the job. People are the worst part of most jobs, they come with politics and games and so on but this isn't about that. This is about F U career paths. Now by that I mean, any trade, skill or qualifications that allow you to tell your boss where to shove what and how hard. 

I am a trucker class A with arbrakes, passenger, double, triple, hazmat, tanker endorsements. I can walk into my job today, curse my boss out, quit in a spectacular manner and basically have a new job lined up the next day right across the street from my old job. In fact I recently did exactly this. I saw the guy next door was paying a higher wage for less work so I asked my boss to match the competition. He refused, I put him on blast for all his bullsh* in front of the whole office during the morning meeting, quit, went across the street and said ""hey, I want that hands free yard spot thats open, I'm tired of delivering corpses and bloody scrap to a furnace out of state."" Started the onboarding process on the spot and I got to pick which days and hours I want to work. I can switch my license to just about any state with a small fee, I can go work in Canada or South America if I want and most importantly, since licensed drivers with a clean Clearinghouse are in demand, nobody gives a crap why I left my last job.

So, how many of you have F U Careers? What's your field? How often do you dump your job for better pay, better working conditions or just to be petty and stick it to your boss?

Employees no longer have the option of taking unpaid time off and if they go over the 6 day limit, they are being fired.  Within 1 week, there have been over 20 positions vacated because so many people are quitting or being let go.  Is 6 sick days a year normal to anyone else?  Every company I've ever worked for is at least 1 sick day a month for a total of 12 a year if not more, and I've never had a job where it's this strictly enforced.  6 seems absolutely ridiculous.  We have a new baby and after taking unpaid maternity leave earlier this year along with the various appointments and hospital visits that come with being a new mother and having a baby, she was already well over the limit when the new policy was instituted and has been warned that she can't take another unscheduled day off for the rest of 2024.... One of her co-workers also just found out she was pregnant and has also been warned since she is already at 5 out of 6 of her days taken.  Keep in mind this is March and most employees have already used most of if not all of their sick days for the whole year with this new policy.  Should she be concerned, or is this lunatic head of HR going to get fired?  Obviously our baby's health will always come first so either way, they can go fuck themselves, but am I justified in thinking this policy is ridiculous?  What can someone do to go about complaining to HR about this without risking getting fired?  She is essentially being threatened that if our baby gets sick and has to go to the hospital, she will be fired, which is completely unethical on so many levels.  They are blatantly discriminating against people with disabilities and people with children."

9,2024-03-22,A rant against 'productivity' and 'optimization',u/Bitter-Platypus-1234,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bl04cb/a_rant_against_productivity_and_optimization/,antiwork,"So, on one hand, I like to automate things in my -barfs- job because I don't like to work. This way, the amount of meaningless, repetitive, mind-numbing tasks decreases and it makes working a little less unbearable.

On the other, though, I'm really tired of this notion of optimizing everything to be as productive as possible. We're not machines, we're blobs of muscle. Sometimes we have more energy, sometimes we have less. Saving time or optimizing a task to get a few seconds to cram in another task seems counter-intuitive to me, many times, because I don't want to be faster and ""better"" to work more. I want to work less, potentially not work \*at all\*!   


You know when, at home, you have to take two objects from room 1 to room 2, and if you take them both at the same time you save time? Well, in many occasions I take two trips, taking the first object on the first one, and the second object on the second one. Productivity and optimization obsession would find this absurd, but it gives me more time to think, to pause, to wonder (and wander), and a great many things can come out of that. 

We need silence. We need pauses, time streeeeeeching. We need laziness. We, humans, need all that. We're not machines.

Have a lazy weekend everyone! <3 "

28,2024-03-22,My desk job has ruined my life,u/raspberrybadger,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bl0p58/my_desk_job_has_ruined_my_life/,antiwork,"*I know no one wants to hear a work-from-home desk jockey complain, but I imagine some folks are feeling the same way I am so maybe it's worth posting.* 

I am so VERY lucky to have a somewhat flexible work-from-home job that pays my bills, isn't ethically nefarious, and allows me time to do some work on a side hustle and community organizing during slow periods. This probably sounds like it's as good as it gets when it comes to working in America, and for some folks I'm sure it would be a dream for a little while. 

But the thing is, too much of a ""good thing"" really isn't great. I've been working like this for 7 years, and it makes me feel inhuman. I'm just so fucking tired of wasting away, sitting at this desk for 8 hours and feeling trapped in my own home some days. I go from my bed to my desk to my couch and back again, and I sometimes go WEEKS without leaving the house at all because of depression.  

I know that jobs like this sound ""kushy"" but they're exhausting and soul-crushing in their own way. First off, my body is destroyed: my back fucking hurts all the time and I keep LITERALLY THROWING MY BACK OUT just from sitting all day (I'm 28). I have poor circulation in my legs, I can't sleep without medication, I'm constantly injuring my hands, wrists, and neck, and I now have ""cybersickness"" which is basically vertigo from looking at a screen for too long. I just got the latest in a series of desk chairs I've been trying to help my back, and I realized that at this point I'm basically recreating the recliners from Wall-E. I've tried everything I can to make my body feel ok with being sedentary, but the truth is that we're not supposed to live like this.

Even when I have slow period and you'd think I could leave my desk and do something else, but I'm expected to be on Slack and answering messages at all times, so I can never be further than earshot from my desk and I can never get in a flow state because I'll be ripped out by a message. I can sometimes work on my little side hustle, or write ridiculously long reddit posts, but I can't do anything meaningful. Not to mention that I'm spending 8 hrs a day doing work that means nothing to me, and it feels like my skills and talents are being completely wasted. 

It's amazing how little energy I have after sitting on my ass all day. Some days I feel straight-up catatonic. I have a hard time keeping up with cleaning my house and taking care of myself, like showering and making healthy meals and exercising. Some days I can muster the energy to do a 15-minute workout and then have to take a nap afterwards. I'm so tired all the time, except on weekends when I have the day to myself but a lot of times I spend those days catching up on the cleaning, exercising, and self-care that I can't seem to do during the week. It's hard to keep up with my friends and family when I'm constantly trying to keep myself afloat. Sometimes I have a good weekend and start to feel a whole lot better, just for Monday to come along and suck me back into the darkness.

I'm trying to figure out how to change careers to a trade, or literally anything else that will get me moving and doing something not at a desk. I feel trapped by my bills and my student loans; I already took a paycut for this job at a nonprofit and if I took any more of a paycut (or unpaid time off for training/education) I'd fall deeper into debt...but it's the only hope I have to get out of this depressive slavery state and live a real life. 

Anyway. Sorry this turned into such a monologue, I know I'm not saying anything new or groundbreaking...I just keep seeing folks talk about how they want a desk job because it's so much better than any other job, but it's really not like that. It definitely has its perks and flexibility, but it's inhumane in its own way. Truly, I think that the problem is too much of one thing; like I could handle doing a desk job for maybe 4 hours a day, if I could spend the rest of the day doing manual labor or something with people in my community. But capitalism forces us to do ONE THING until we're sick or dead. 

**TL;DR: desk jobs are bad for our bodies and mental health. I feel sick, isolated, and catatonic most days. I want to find a different path but feel trapped by the cost of living.**"

9,2024-03-22,Boomers view not working synonymous with being lazy. ,u/Logical_Narwhal_9911,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bl14qp/boomers_view_not_working_synonymous_with_being/,antiwork,"I have a friend and mentor who is in his 60s. This guy is a legend in his field and one of the most generous and intelligent people I’ve met. I love him. 

The past few years or so I’ve struggled with employment due to health issues, and I finally landed a “good” job- the one that would’ve supported a small community 5 decades ago. 

It’s a decent gig, doesn’t pay that well starting out, and the demand, with my health issues, is insane- 10-12 hours a day, with one day off every 7 days.

It’s also not what I want to be doing, but I feel limited by my health situation and don’t know how to pursue what I want to do in a limited capacity. 

So the jobs demands are difficult because of my health issues, but really, who wants to work 10-12 hours a day, 6 days a week?

This schedule essentially makes work your life. Theres very little time for anything outside of work except for self-care and preparation for the next day. By the time I shower, eat, do some movement it’s time for the next day. Rinse, repeat. 

To me, that’s not a life.  

Where the time meant for friends, family, hobbies, passions etc?

Still I passed my probationary period and am considering putting in a medical restriction because A. I qualify for it and realistically need it and B. It’s well known my coworkers get them to maintain a work/life balance.

Anyways I was asking my mentor for advice and he started talking about when he was younger, working 70+hrs a week for little money etc and how he took every opportunity he could etc. Now that he did that, he “gets to be lazy”

Let’s add some clarification- he’s not lazy IMO. He workout every single day, writes books, teaches, has an active social life, etc. 

But I’m also not trying to be lazy? I don’t mind doing the work, the demand can just be overwhelming and there’s no work/life balance. 

It kind of blew my mind because I never would equate working less with being lazy. I have so much shit I want to do and there’s not enough time to do it all. I want to educate and grow myself and develop my own business, not be trapped in someone else’s idea of what my life should look or be like.

Even if I wanted to be lazy, we shouldn’t scrutinize seeking leisure in the first place! It’s human nature

I wish my dad had worked less. He would’ve been home more and I would have known him better and maybe he would’ve lived longer. 

And this isn’t just my friend speaking either. I’ve heard other people of similar age say similar things. My grandma once said “you’re a man, you shouldn’t be tired!” I mean what kind of unrealistic, sexist BS is that?

Anyways- it’s crazy the difference in view points and understanding from our older generations  "

I was super happy because it's fully remote and the pay is fine, bonus my impostor's syndrome went down a bit.

After those 2 weeks, I had a few slow days (a little bit of burnout) and the co-founder decided to move me to task-based pay, which I get it but it infuriated me and was pretty sad about it, to be fair.  


My rage is mostly comprised of the following: since then, he stopped replying or replies 1-2 times a day, doesn't check PR's on time, and then keeps adding new stuff. For example: tasked with some frontend stuff, 8 hrs, I finish it on Friday (last Friday). I told him to check the PR and nothing on any day except today (one week after) to tell me it's a little basic. I am tired of this because the things he wants keep adding and adding and at the end of 2 weeks, I get paid maybe one full day out of 14, if I'm lucky.  The outsourced employees have more to do than me and mentally, I already drew the line and looking elsewhere (annoyed because since I am a junior, it is a little harder right now, not to mention that my second job that I work once a month - test centre administrator - somehow ends up paying me more than this dev job, and it's 25 bucks VS minimum wage)."

I signed up to work extra over Thanksgiving, Black Friday, etc and she emailed me that I couldn't as there wouldn't be sufficient oversight from a manager over the holidays.

It's now March, I didn't get a cost of living increase because of this warning. Half of the staff have quit due to poor management, we're running on a skeleton crew trying to train new hires in a pretty technical role. Included in the people who bailed were the weekend staff.

I forwarded her the previous email, and stated I am not supposed to work weekends/holidays due to lack of management oversight and her only reply was that I would be included in the rotation.

Any ideas on how to get out of this?

so i guess the moral of the story is, be smarter than me and don’t mov into a company’s apartment.

Somehow I'm still afraid if I quit I won't be good enough for this other job and I won't be able to go back. The unlimited time off is nice too but I can see why they even have it..."

When I talk to other men, a surprising amount feel the same way as I am, in that they find the concept of labor and being in the rat race to be meaningless suffering that they would avoid if possible, and dont think you have less human value for ""dropping out"" of the economy, since the current society doesn't have improving prosperity and enjoyment of life for the average worker as a priority. I.e. Ive met quite a few men with epicurean thinking.

&#x200B;

When ive shared my views to women, the vast majority have denigrated for ""not contributing to society"", and having less worth(especially sexual attractiveness) due to not wanting slave away my entire life in the hopes of retring from the rat race and providing for a wife. Its like they, including socialist women ive met,  can't fathom how a human being  can view work as a undesirable activity, and not care about climbing the employment hierarchy and constantly accumulate material wealth. The people who are obsessed with self help, motivational quotes and courses, etc have mostly been women in my experience. 

This is of course my personal subjective experience, and maybe ive been surrounded by too many corporate girlbosses(though socialist women Ive met have also tried to shame me for viewing work as suffering that should be avoided as much as possible)."

First thing that came to my mind when I saw it was ""it's a bloody snitch chart!"". Because it is.

It also doesn't serve its purpose, because people would give you high marks and praise you and avoid critising you, so it's fundamentally useless and doesn't serve to help you improve at all. There was one other guy who didn't want to do it, but ultimately he caved in, because the manager kept bringing it up every month. I'm the last one left. My partner (who works for the same company, but different department and different manager who never came up with such an idea) thinks I should just honestly admit what I think about it and at this point I probably have no choice anyway.

I have many roles- the biggest being payroll. Started having medical issues due to the pregnancy they didn't give me much flex. I'm part time no benefits. Asked to have less duties but no one else there knows how to do my job. I figured they would've had me train someone at this point to take over. Nada

Fast forward to now: I've been scheduled for meetings and given tasks for things that are due by the first week of April. A week after my due date. I feel like they're so out of touch with my situation and do not care. My anxiety has been building as I have to do payroll every other Monday and have no idea how they're going to handle it since they begged me to keep doing it a month ago.

Now. Either they have someone they haven't told me about who is going to take my job when I push this baby out or they expect me to keep working even if I'm in the delivery room. I texted them that I am in labor and I deleted my work email app from my phone so I can go through the stressful and wonderful event in peace. 

I feel guilty but also shame on them for not having a backup plan if they don't. They've known for a long time and both major managers are on vacation from the start of March to mid April. I haven't gotten a response so I feel like there's panic going on at my bosses vacation home right now. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

I've been at this job for almost two years and really had no issues other than a manager who micro manages everything when she needs to when it comes to checking that the work is being done efficiently from the entire staff.  I've been a permanent employee at a specific building site since I was hired and not a floater.  

Wednesday, I recently recieved a text message from my manager stating that I was being reassigned to another location and no longer work in the building because the company couldn't afford to keep me anymore because there were too many employees (just me that got reassigned) because the tenants moved out early this year. So, they were wasting money from what I was told over the phone today. Note, I wasnt in charge of cleaning these floors so it didn't affect me from my everyday task. Prior to this, there was an employee who was recently hired early this year as well.  

There was no warning, no leading up, nothing for me about downsizing the staff. Then all of a sudden, yesterday, you're out. I called my Union to try and figure things out. It sounds like nothing can be done on their ene either because technically I didnt get fired but moved because the building is loosing money for having an extra employee under their staff due to the clients moving out. Yesterday evening, at 6pm, I recieved a phone call from a man who I never spoke to in-person tell me ""Your new shift starts tomorrow at 2pm-10pm, you MUST be there."" Reminder, my previous shift was 5pm to 1am everyday at the same location since hire. I spoke to someone today and they said if I don't show up this Monday at the new time and location, they're going to take it as resignation.

I have obligations with a toddler at home and have nobody to watch him before 5pm. I spoke to this person about my obligations and that it will be very difficult to commit to this new schedule, new time and location. His answer was basically, sorry can't do nothing for you, that's life. The Union seems like they are trying. The hiring manager said the same thing but in a more respectable way.

What do I do?? If I don't show up, I'm out of a job! And I got a one day notice. I'm in FULL panic mode."

i started working at a bank 4 months ago. i knew 2 months in that it wasn't for me, so i picked back up my job hunt. i haven't had any luck with interviews so i have a feeling its gonna take a long time to even find one place that's interested in hiring me.

i asked my now bosses in my initial interview what their managing style is and how their employees would rank their communication and support. they responded in a typical ""were supportive of our employees and are always there to help"" way but i felt like everything else they said in the interview was adequate so i accepted the offer. i also just really needed to leave my old job for my mental health's sake and i had been applying for 6 months, so i just took it and told myself to try it out and see if i enjoyed the industry change. as i said before i knew 2 months ago that this wasn't for me, so i'm looking for opportunities more my style. i told myself i wouldn't quit without another job lined up, but this is starting to really piss me off. 

communication from both my bosses AND my coworkers is god-awful. i'm neurodivergent and value clear and explicit communication so maybe i over-communicate more than the average joe, but i'd rather have that than essentially no communication at all (which is what i'm getting here). i was requested to communicate when i was going to the bathroom, stepping away for a second, or going on break in case it got busy and no one knew where i went. every time i forget, i get spoken to about it. i'm the only one who even communicates this stuff, no one else says when they're going on break or going to the bathroom or are busy with something and can't help customers. 90% of the messages in our teams group chat are from me, most of them being reiterations of previous messages that no one bothered to respond to.

i also recently had to go to urgent care out of nowhere and was told not to return to work until monday. i immediately informed my boss as soon as i knew i had to go to urgent care (this was at 8 in the morning; i work part time and don't start my work day until 1:15 pm) and that i would likely not be returning until monday. i reached out again a few hours later to confirm that i wouldn't be coming back until monday and that had emailed my boss a doctors note in case it was needed to approve my 3 days of sick time off. that was sent two days ago and i still have yet to receive a reply. i have a feeling i'll get angry comments form my coworkers and my bosses but i don't really care tbh; i did everything  i could to let them know as far in advance as possible that i wouldn't be there for the rest of the week. 

i don't have another job lined up (hell, i don't even have any potential interviews) but i'm highly considering just quitting for my sanity's sake. should i?

TL;DR: the communication at my job is god-awful. 90% of the communication comes from me and a good 60-70% of it is reiterating previous messages that never got a reply. i'm starting to lose my mind (especially considering i don't even like the industry in the first place) and ready to just quit, but i don't know if it's a good idea considering i don't have another job lined up and have no idea how long it will take to get one.

2,2024-03-22,First salaried position - manufacturing - vacation pay - is this normal?,u/Hulknout2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bl9ine/first_salaried_position_manufacturing_vacation/,antiwork,"Hello! About a year ago I got a salaried supervisory position at the manufacturing facility I work at. Here's a brief run down of things:

Plant runs 24/7(except holidays) - 12 hour shifts - 6PM to 6AM

It is a schedule that looks like this: Week 1 - Work 4 days, Week 2 - Work 3 days. The split of days doesnt really matter for this question I don't think.

Now here's my question: If a holiday falls on the weekend, it is 'observed' on Monday typically, so if it's the type of holiday that we close for, we MUST use vacation time to cover it. If we work it however, we earn 12 hours of vacation time to be used for it. 

If we are open on a day that the holiday is observed, hourly employees earn their usual 12 hours, as well as 12 hours of holiday pay(I think, I always get confused when I start thinking about all this), whereas employees who are off of work that day earn 8 hours of pay for the holiday. 

This upcoming easter holiday has me perplexed and continually asking myself if this shit is legal. 

I work Friday night, and I shut the plant down Saturday 'night'(so after 6AM Sunday morning we are officially closed until Tuesday morning when we start back up.

I must either use a vacation day in lieu of that Sunday night, or come in and find BS work to keep me busy for the shift. 

Is this type of rule normal in this sort of situation? I know salary is usually a joke and always question if I should've taken the position. The pay is a good step up from operator pay, but of course ther are extra hours(have to be in 30 minutes early every shift to do 'shift exchange' with the operator you're relieving).

I hope you're all doing well. Unfortunately, I've found myself in one of the most frustrating situations I've ever experienced and could really use some advice.

I was terminated from my previous employment on February 15th, and I was expecting to receive my final paycheck on March 23rd. However, all I've received is an absolute headache instead.

They ended up sending my paycheck to the incorrect address not once, but twice.. Due to this I have been caught in an endless waiting game, and to top it off, the HR lady I've been working with has been extremely nonchalant about the situation.

I'm wondering if there's anything that I can do in terms of filing a complaint against the company due to their negligence. If so, what would be the best course of action? I am located in Texas if that helps.

I would greatly appreciate any advice you guys might have. 

Thank you all in advance for your help!

2,2024-03-22,Need Advice: No Job Description? Red Flag or Overreacting?,u/NomanYuno,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1blaqnt/need_advice_no_job_description_red_flag_or/,antiwork,"Hello,

I am unsure if this is the right place for this, but I am looking to seek job advice from like-minded people and take a lot of cues from the posts I read on this sub. If this is not the place for this, I would appreciate suggestions about where I can look for advice.

TL;DR - I am interviewing for a data analyst position which would potentially pay me about 20% more and would allow me more freedom to get and use more skills, but after several requests, they still do not have a job description and the job seems to have different responsibilities than we discussed in the first interview. 

Here is my situation:
- I am a 26yo male currently working for a govt. contractor as a data analyst in the DC Metro area. It pays decently ($63,000/year) and has ok benefits. I have been working there for ~1.75 years now and I am looking to make more money, so I have been job-hunting
- My ultimate goal is to get a decently paying job (~100K) working for a govt. agency for the pension, stability, and benefits. I have been applying for several jobs at several govt. agencies, but have not heard back from any of them
- A few weeks ago, a recruiter from a biotech research firm working for NIH reached out to me about an open position DA position they have. They are interested in my Power BI experience and asked to set up an interview after seeing my resume. 
I asked for her to send me the job posting, so I can look at the job description. She tells me that it is a newer position and that they do not have one made yet. This seems like a red flag, but I decided to do the interview anyway. 
- I kill the first interview and we set up another interview with the program manager for the following week. During the interview, she told me that I would be working for the HR department to help report staffing KPIs in Power BI. Sounds good to me. When I ask for $80k she does not outright say that I can have it, but it seems like it’s within her ballpark based on how she acts after.
- Once again, I ask for the job description again and they say they are working on it. The second interview rolls around and they still do not have it. The program manager seemed upbeat at first but did not seem that invested once the interview went on. He was kind of running through the questions quickly and when he brought up automation, which the previous interviewer mentioned, he brought up a whole different kind of automation. What he is talking about is automation of tasks that have nothing to do with my job as a Data Analyst. He also brings up the fact that I would be a liaison between the engineering department and their department to argue on their behalf for certain initiatives and projects (e.g. The recruiting dept. wants something built and I am supposed to reach out to them to get that rolling).
- The interview wraps up with the PM telling me to look into the program that they are using for automation (MS Power Automate) and see if it is something that I would be willing to learn. I told him that I would get back to him on Monday. 

Here are the red flags/concerns for me:
- Despite repeated requests for a job description, they refuse to send me one and the PM said that he could send me a job description, but then he would “have to write it” and he has not had time to because he is busy.
- They added a bunch of responsibilities that were not discussed in the first interview. This combined with the lack of a job description makes me feel like they do not have a solid understanding of what the scope of my work will entail
- Both interviewers mentioned “a fast-paced working environment with changing priorities”. They mentioned that everyone is constantly busy and they are growing very fast as a company. To me, this seems like they are growing too fast for them to keep up and they are going to over-work and underpay me. 
- I have a pretty stable job where I am and I don’t hate the work. Although I do not get paid as much as I could, I am also pretty much the sole breadwinner for my house right now and I am worried about being stuck at a job which is terrible because I just jumped ship at my last place.

Here are the positives of the job:
- New contacts and opportunities for growth in the company
- More work experience with not only a govt. agency, but also a completely different domain
- More money (~$17k/20% jump)
- More opportunities to gain more skills

Any advice is welcome and I would appreciate any help. Am I overreacting or are my spidey senses tingling for a reason? If I decide not to take the job, how can I not burn a bridge with this company and respond professionally?

I then worked for a year, basically only because I needed a job to get approved to buy a house, the last few months of that job were unbearable, my mental health suffered. I found another job that I quit after 3 weeks, the work environment was not for me, plus I was not mentally in a good place due to the previous job. I receive child support and other benefits, enough that I can live comfortably on those sources of income alone. I know I'm lucky, I don't have to work, but I still feel this guilt about not wanting to work. I'd be happy with a very part time job, but it seems like all the jobs in my city are full time or have hours that don't work with being a parent of young children. I've been looking  for the last 2 months and that in itself has been so exhausting. I guess I just need some support from people who get it."

1,2024-03-22,"Timesheet rounding in employers favor, reprimanded for 1minute after, told to arrive early but not paid for being early",u/Special-Camel-2235,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1blbimj/timesheet_rounding_in_employers_favor_reprimanded/,antiwork,"Greetings.  I had filed with federal DOL regarding unpaid overtime.  For many years laborers, auto mechanics, at this location (4 total positions) were paid salary and misclassified as exempt then required to work 10 hr shifts 6 days a week without OT.   Operating that way since 2016.

The DOL denied to take my complaint for unpaid OT stating they are too busy.

I’ve become aware of a new layer.  My employer uses time clock rounding, best I can tell it’s 15 minute rounding.   The handbook states there’s a 5 minute grace period before and after scheduled punches.  We are being formally written up for punching in 1 minute after.  I have in writing from HR that I’m required to be to work up to 5 minutes early, clock in, and anything after scheduled time is late, grace period only applies to before and after the shift.  We cannot leave early, we’re literally held in the lobby until exactly 6pm.   

When we arrive early as required, they’re rounding the punch to 8am. Then if we clock in at 8:01 we’re threatened with termination for being late though it’s not what the handbook says.  They are not rounding the 2 lunch hour punches no matter what time the punch lands on.

So if I file another complaint for unpaid overtime, Is this time rounding practice also a FLSA violation I can include?  When it’s in their favor they’re quiet, when it’s not we’re guilty of misconduct.  How do I say it so it’s not dismissed again.  (State labor board only goes back 6 months.  I have coworkers with years of unpaid OT)

9,2024-03-22,I spent the past 3 years being tormented by my racist boss,u/swamp__hagg,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1blbs2l/i_spent_the_past_3_years_being_tormented_by_my/,antiwork,"So I moved to a small town from Miami at the end of covid. Was trying to disappear into the woods and stop grinding everyday. Before that could happen I fell into a job that sounded to good to be true(found it on craigslist should have been a sign).

The owner asks me to meet him at a bar in town for and interview(another bad sign).

He goes on to tell me that the current op manager is dating one of the store managers and refuses to fire her(did not want to explain why she needed to be fired). Turns out she was just too much of a lib for my boss and the ops manager wouldn't fire her for that( also just for context they are engaged to be married at this time). 

Ops manager refuses and give his 2 weeks notice. The owner begs him for a 2 month notice so he has time to find someone to replace him. 

So the craigslist post, leads to me, now I'm hired. Within 2 weeks he had fired the girl friend manager for insubordination and had me fire the ops manager for ""inventory errors"".

He also fired the assistant manager of one of the shop because he was just friends with the ops manager and he had to go apparently.

So I am now the sole person in charge of running this company( 3 stores and a distro).

The owner doesn't have any idea of what's actually happening in the stores so the rest of my training is talking technical with a 65+ boomer who has the attitude of the expert but none of the expertise. 

The first year was rough. I spent most of it doing 60 hours a week hiring new staff and changing everything about this guys failing company. Doubled sales over the first year. 

That was the turning point. Once he was in the black and things are financially working well for him he stops pretending. He starts holding all company meetings where he makes me print out giant charts he doesn't reference, asks for company input just to turn it down, schedules this particular meeting at the small Mexican restaurant just to give a loud boisterous speech about how our stores are better than the other stores because were Americans and there all foreign ""arabs"" opening businesses to fast track a green card. 

Everyone at the company had opinions about this. I fielded all of them and kicked them up the ladder just to have all employees retaliated against. Rules became more offensive an pointed. Uniforms were instituted, he started making up stories about employees. He claimed one of our managers went on a trump hating rant based on story from our handy man. he wanted that employee fired and when I asked for a time stamp(because we have cameras and im not a just following order guy) so I can do my due diligence he accuses her of denying it and lying. I checked the camera and it never happened. 

That's when he started targeting me. Sending emails berating me for not being on the companies side and calling me a socialist for defending innocent people and their livelihoods. I point out he was paying to keep this company open before I got here. He says I had nothing to do with the success of the stores. He starts to imply that everything I report to him is now a lie. He creates problems just to throw me at the problem(I later find hes doing this to distract from my normal everyday duties so he can say I'm not preforming to his standard). 

He continuously spreads his political beliefs around the stores in the form of degrading stories about a trans person he saw or a fox news story about the border. Meanwhile any employees who have an opinion are being threatened to keep it to themselves or be terminated.

I loved the job and the team I built. After the 2nd year the team I built was having trouble finding the will to keep doing this for this awful man. I got them to stay at least for us it was us against him. 

I regret that very much. none of these people deserved to be put threw that. 

towards the end I was promised raises in December for me and my salaried staff. December comes and every time I try to talk to the owner I'm attacked for something to distract from the raises. this goes on into February. He goes as far as to blame the high heating bill during winter on the staff and claims they must be running the air all night so they wont be cold in the morning. I turn around and investigate the problem and what do you know the energy company raised prices 15% from the previous year on January 1st. So that complaint is shown in the light of day for what it is. Another bullshit excuse that proves how uninvolved you are here. at this point I'm burnt out. I've been working 60 hours a week for 3 years. 

I start seeing ads for a new job at the company. Its suspiciously close to my job however we live in the middle of no where. There are no professionals to fill this position. Everyone underneath me understands who you are and doesn't want the position. So he gets no bites for the 4 months he posts it.

&#x200B;

He starts branching out to other platforms Maybe craigslist just isn't the spice.

I find the same adds on facebook in a locals only facebook group.

Hes posting these job listings from his burner account.

&#x200B;

The profile picture is just body bags with the caption the safe ones in Gaza.

&#x200B;

This was the last straw. I couldn't be tied to this anymore and I couldn't find the words to defend anything this guy has ever done. 

I quit no notice at the end of that week. 

I sent him and email saying i was offered a better job and took it. Treat people better. Best of luck.

the staff got a long nice letter explaining what happened and the circumstances.

&#x200B;

He tries to save face by telling everyone he was going to fire me that day with 6 weeks severance!

They all aw threw that when he had no plan to replace me. He scrambled and moved people up and all over the company.

Needless to say when pay day rolls around he has withheld that check. the next Friday I call the new person doing my job. I'm told its already in the mail and to just wait but when I ask for tracking the refuse. the following Monday I get a notice from QuickBooks saying your direct deposit is coming next Friday. here we are on payday again and my direct deposit didn't show up. 

Turns out he scheduled a direct deposit then canceled it the same day and mailed a paper check.

He also just to be a dick asked for a signature on a piece of paper mail and since he knows I have a new job. He knows I wont get it till I go out of my way to the post office on the weekend.

I finally get the check and written in the memo is

""tell the truth more often""

this guy is truly a menace.

Anyone who made it this far and wants to leave his stores negative reviews for being just the worst kind of person you can be plz drop a comment.

I am a division head and am witnessing the President bullying straight out open one of my employees and can't do much to neither protect them neither react. It doesn't help that this person is not the best performer and an easy target, but I definitely don't think he is source of all evil. The methods are rewriting completely his work without being necessary bad, nitpickig comments, calling him an idiot at meetings where he is not present, telling him how wrong he is in front of 5-6 peers, and tinkering with his performance just to make him look inadequate no matter what. 

I would normally quit at this point or react, however, my state (where I live) offers 12 weeks of paid maternity leave as long as you are employed when you apply - regardless of employer if its in adjacent state. 

I feel terrible for not telling the President what I think of what she is doing - not reacting to protect this person, and just being a bystander. Also, if I weren't leaving soon I would have probably been next on a ""shitlist"" for not joining her in bullying him. "

My work place has a high turnover of people and I naively thought my loyalty and hard work will be rewarded one day. But eventually, I realized that sometimes, they hand over promotions and leadership to people who wanted to resign. They retained a few employees from this strategy, but the longtime workers like me lose our chances to advance. 

So I resigned and they probably felt blindsided by it. Their approach? Pretend I didn't exist. It's not like they don't know me - we had small talk, a bunch of parties, lunches and karaoke sessions together over the last 8 years. Moreover, they're signatories to my resignation. 

It's customary in our office that people who resigned get a small talk from the upper management, perhaps for negotiation or feedback. Me? Nothing. 

Because of the silent treatment, I got so much anxiety while waiting for any kind of response. I ended up back and forth gaslighting myself that I did something wrong to get this treatment. 

The lower management (who had nothing to do with these counter offer strategies) and my longtime co-workers prepared a warm exit for me with gifts and positive messages. Other departments I worked with sent me goodbyes and congratulatons either through chat or email. 

I sent an email to the upper management expressing thanks and saying goodbye, and... nothing. Not a single goodbye. Sure, we may not have been very close, but it's not the right display of leadership. "

TLDR: I was sent home for a dress code error in an unprofessional way.

I was not written up. However a performance review came out and it lowkey tore me apart. I had a below average rating, saying I never took initiative and a few other things. 

As well as a mention of the dress code incident, followed up by saying I look unkept and messy. As well as the claim that I repeatedly violated dress code. Which I did not. I spend at least an hour getting ready for work. So for them to call me unkept confused me, especially since there has been no mention of this before. A long with the other behavioral criticisms, I was never coached or anything along those lines. 

I know you all don’t know me, nor know how I work but I hope you can take my word that I feel this review is false. Never once besides the one time I was sent home have I been corrected. I have no issues with everyone and get everything I need to do done when asked.

&#x200B;

I just turned in my notice at work, which is next Thursday, so not a full two-weeks. The company I work at is pretty notorious for cutting corners financially wherever they can and have skimped me on about $5000 in commission in the past. Our handbook states that once the employment relationship ends, that any accrued PTO will be paid out in full. However, a few weeks ago, they were bragging about how they've never actually had to do that before because nobody has bothered to ask. 

&#x200B;

The specific portion of the handbook I signed regarding this states:

&#x200B;

*""If your employment relationship with \[employer\] ends before you have used your earned*

*vacation accrual, you will be paid for accrued vacation not used at the time of termination.*

*\[Employer\] may advance non-accrued vacation days in its sole discretion.""*

&#x200B;

I did ask that it get paid out (in writing) because I have 30 hours of vacation time saved up and I am only working out this small notice in anticipation of receiving this accrued vacation time. Is there any way they can just... not pay me this? Because if that is the case, I want to just turn in my keys and take a week off to be with family."

Now the problem.. after all the good feedback my manager just told me that I get a base salary increase of 1%!!! 

This is such a punch in my face and even insulting. When I joined this company around 2 years ago I got a raise of 5% after only 4 months (had a different manager back then).

I had a grueling interview process, involving:

1- screening video call with recruiter (third party, not the company's)
2 - a form with 4 questions about my specific experience with a, b, c, d.
3 - back and forth with recruiter as she suggested tweaks on my CV.
4- video call with recruiter's boss
5 - a one-hour skill exercise 
6 - one hour call with recruiters and hiring manager. 
7 - now one more with upper management, the in-house HR manager and one C-head, for which I had to make a PowerPoint and present it in 8 minutes. Through my contacts I managed to talk with 2 top experts of the subject in my country, and I incorporated their knowledge into the PP. I thought the meeting went well.

They told me that they'd give me an answer ""by the end of the week"". The following Wednesday I sent an email to the HR manager and she answered saying recruiter (third party) would contact me. She did, saying I didn't get the job, but that I had an impressive CV and ""a delightful personality"".

The recruiter was indeed extremely helpful and we built a rapport. But something lingered in my mind. 
 
I wanted a ""thank you"" not from the recruiter, but from the company itself. Come on. It was a grueling process of 12 hours total, and I had given them, for free, valuable intel. Felt like a fool. Used and discarded. No. No. No. I waited 3 weeks just so they knew I wasn't a sour loser.

On a Sat night at 4am I sent the company's HR manager and the C-suit an email saying that I was slightly disappointed with the company for not having received a ""thank you"" from them. Also said I admired the company's mission, its excellent reputation, and that I didn't want to have this image tainted, etc.  

I told that to /AskHR and I was ROASTED ALIVE, all of them saying I didn't deserve anything else from the company, that they would think I was entitled, bratty, unprofessional and would even burn my name in the industry. Looked like I had skinned a cat alive or something.

Five hours later the in-house HR manager answered me saying I completely right, that on behalf of the company she apologized for not having reached out to me to thank me for the effort, and she thanked immensely for my participation in the selection process.

I answered saying I was now relieved, and wished them the best and that I would always admire their mission and follow it from a distance. I thought that was it, case closed, right? No, HR manager answered back thanking me again and saying she was impressed with my kindness and would not forget that exchange, as it taught her something. 

YES. I DEMANDED RESPECT. Why not? I had lost the job already. The company is a do-gooder mission-driven. Why would I be discarded by a third party if I even spoke to a panel, including a C‐suit? Seriously! So, YES, I made them apologize and bow down to my wisdom. Hope they have learnt the lesson. Respect, people. It's so basic. "

does anyone have suggestions on creative ways to split the payments while also accounting for non-monetary contributions like homemaking and time spent contributing to an online shop we hope to start?

we're going to make an official agreement about what our responsibilities are to make sure we're contributing equitably. how can we go about that without trying to assign a $ amount to non-W2 work?

everything I've seen online only talks about the financial contributions, and is either splitting based on income/square footage/evenly, which is not the equitable divide we're looking for.

(For some context, my company runs tournaments). So I play and within 2 rounds my supervisor has me disqualified from the event and cited that I was cheating. I go home and call it. I leave for a 2 week trip the following week. In that time, my supervisor had my coworkers vote in whether or not I should be suspended from participating ever again. However, part of my job requires me to go and I would be unable to fill the role. On Monday, I plan to call hr and quit, as I simply can't handle the stress anymore from this supervisor. "

However, a year ago, management made the decision to transition me into the role of an R&D engineer with just a week's notice, thrusting me into an ongoing project.

Since the beginning of my tenure, I have been transparent about my challenges with time management, requesting coaching to address this area. Additionally, the project I inherited faced unforeseen delays stemming from client requests and inaccurate information provided.

Throughout the year, I was also called upon to provide support to other departments for a month, and we faced the logistical challenges of relocating offices for an additional month.

My manager, a recent promotion from a former colleague, did not actively address the project bottlenecks until coaching was initiated a month ago. Since then, under the guidance of another mentor, I have seen a notable improvement in efficiency, as evidenced by my consistent weekly task accomplishments.

Yesterday, HR scheduled a meeting for next week to discuss my perceived ""underperformance."" There is a very toxic environment within the company and I will resign eventually but, I am eager to present and defend the effort I have invested so far.

Anyone else been through such meetings? 
I would appreciate any insights or tips on navigating such meetings and situations effectively."

-We don’t want you working overtime, but here’s a shit-ton of work that we need you to do during the week.

-We will train you, but only when tasks pop up; in a year or two, there will still be things you haven’t learned, but we’ll make you feel stupid when you ask how to do it.

-We “encourage” you to ask questions, but make you feel embarrassed or stupid for asking them.  Oh, and the person training you will tell you to ask questions, but doesn’t want to answer them, so just try not to ask.

The job has always been anything but a career but the staff has always found a way to make the best of things, the camaraderie made it fun & the job pays okay. Over the past 2 years, people have been leaving due to management changes and inane rules being put in place that makes the job 100x more difficult than it truly needs to be. The current management staff has zero clue on how to proficiently run my department and treats the employees with utter disrespect. People are dropping like flies and constantly calling in, which puts all the workload on the employees who do show up. 

Personally, I realize that it’s time for me to move on but without having another job to fall back on (I’ve been putting in applications like a mad person for the past 3 months with no luck), it’s hard to simply walk away. I have a family to feed and bills to pay. However, my mental health has taken a huge toll. My anxiety is uncontrollably high, so much so that I can barely sleep and get physically ill at the idea of going back every day. It’s starting to affect my family life as well.

My wife is job hunting and showed me a posting from (this) Thursday for the position I’m currently doing at my work. Curious as to what you would do in my shoes?

Context: My wife is having horrible bouts of fatigue for about 4 days now, (no fever, not covid so far?) and I took off work Thursday to care for her. 

I’m fairly certain my job is safe. My co-worker has OCD and a bunch of other complications in life. She has a chronically sick mother and my co-worker is 4/5 times late by an hour or so to work because of either OCD or caring for her mother. And my co-worker calls in all the time to help her mom. So I’m thinking my boss is trying to replace her.

The last person in this position before us who quit, I actually trained her at the last shop we worked at before both of us left that place. And she recommended me, which is how I got this job. I trained my co-worker too. I’m way overqualified for my position. They don’t pay me enough to make work a priority. But I like my job bc all my co-workers are pretty cool and it’s really stress free. I’m just cruising until my wife graduates and we can move.

Ps: we live in a right to work state (shitty ass garbage law). And my job is not unionized. Thank-you for any replies.

Pps: I do stand up comedy as a hobby. Outlandish suggestions are welcomed.

Back in college, I was on track to go to law school. 4.0, consistent high 160’s LSAT score before studying (was in the process of taking a free course), low income queer kid from rural America, worked 2 jobs in college while also being super involved (I never slept lol). 

So, when I got the opportunity to do an internship (paid, fortunately) for a prominent state politician/lawyer, I jumped on it. 

I got hired on to help this dude with his legal memoir and an upcoming trial case. M-Thurs - suit and tie everyday. 

Not only was he a huge asshole, he never let me do what I was hired to do. I never touched any writing or research for the memoir. I helped with the trial one day and then just watched him in court. 

I had to drive him around. I had to organize his attic of legal files dating back to the 70s in my full suit in the southern heat. Wasn’t allowed to wear anything else. 

Even still, I worked my ass off and played nice. I was also working my regular job at this point, so I worked 7 days a week. I received one day off that summer after we won the trial just for him to call me to ask me to come in. 


At my other job you could study if you were finished with your work, so I naively thought this was the norm. I tried to study for the LSAT after finishing being in the hot ass attic all day. Bad idea. I got berated and made to clean the bathrooms. Which then became a regular task for me despite the fact that the office had hired cleaners. 

The last straw and what ultimately changed my career path was on my second to last day. I stayed up all night with a friend who was having a crisis and had suicidal intention. I had trouble staying awake at the desk. They terminated me early due to this , even after I explained. 

They said I should know that work always comes before friends and I should get my priorities straight.  "

HR then asked for a doctor's note outlining my restrictions. when I gave this to them they said I wouldn't be able to work at all with the restrictions I have. so I asked how to file for short term disability, to which they said I wouldn't qualify because there isn't any work for me to do anyway.

It really rubs me wrong that people who only have a single client account get far more sales opportunities and a lunch break who only speak English and can attend weekend events earn the same base pay as me and make more in commission. I know my company is breaking state labor laws with the lack of a meal break, but I'm scared to put up a fuss because I don't know any other job that would pay this well to work these hours. Plus, they dropped new policies to cut into our commission that are reasonable for the day shift with only a few clients to attend to, but on my shift we are responsible for all customers without the benefit of commission.

But the whole company itself sucks. They fail to pay her properly monthly, as a bunch of money is missing and she doesnt get paid for when she came in when she was supposed to have a free week. Besides failing to pay her or any of their workers properly, they keep asking her to do an area of the school she isnt supposed to do (of course not offering her any more money for more work she would need to do).

But lately, something even worse happened. My mom´s blood pressure got to 180/100 lately and they keep asking if she comes in. They dont apperently understand how dangerous that is. And well... worst thing is, that my mom is a workaholic and has to work so we can live... So she went to work when she wasn´t fine still. Oh also... my mom and a single other person are cleaning the whole school building and have to do this in a certain amount of time. Cause they refuse to even try and hire anyone.

I myself am still pretty young and about to do an apprenticeship. But when I see and hear stuff like this... I ask myself why work my a\*s off for people like this.

Theyre currently having a class action lawsuit that pertains to our “on the road” and “off the road” pay, as well as our mileage reimbursement. I signed up for it just expecting a 20$ check in the mail a few months later not really caring. A couple days ago, i got a call from my general manager saying that i wont be able to clock in until i call my area supervisor. I called him and he basically said hey so because you signed up for this lawsuit, you have to drive a company car and wont be getting mileage pay. 
I was hired as a regular delivery driver using my personal vehicle, and they want me to sign papers to switch to the company car. I believe company car drivers are technically a different job altogether. Can they legally do this?is this considered some type of relatiation? If i refuse and they fire me is that legal? Also the area supervisor has been telling me to “retract my statement” so i can go back to my personal car. 
Thanks for any advice"
70,2024-03-23,Went to HR….,u/nekosaigai,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1blyeng/went_to_hr/,antiwork,"So I’ve made a few posts here and there about my current work situation, but I’ll recap what’s going on briefly:

1. My friend and former manager got verbally and non verbally threatened in a workplace violence incident with his boss, a new director. My friend filed a workplace violence complaint against her. I witnessed the incident and my friend knew. As far as I know it was never investigated.
2. My friend was fired a week and a half after filing the complaint for supposedly breaking the law. I witnessed the incident the director claimed was illegal and it wasn’t. This was also never investigated.
3. I filed a harassment, intimidation, and bullying complaint against the director a month after my friend was fired. This was seemingly not really investigated, but they did move the director’s office far away from me. She seems to throw glares at me when no one else is around though.
4. I filed a workplace violence complaint against the director for a meeting a month ago. A colleague sent me a recording of the meeting. That also seemingly hasn’t yet been investigated.
5. I may be getting constructively discharged or retaliated against by being frozen out of critical functions of my job and being heavily restricted in who I can talk to and what I can do.

Well, I went to HR and spoke to the new HR Director about these issues this week. I played a portion of the recording, and provided a copy to HR. (I got my colleague’s permission first, we live in a 1 party consent state, and I’ve retained personal copies.) I followed up on my complaints and my friend’s complaints.

I explicitly stated that I believe there’s been violations of federal, state, and local laws occurring, that this treatment may be illegally discriminatory, and that I’m explicitly invoking my state’s whistleblower protections. I further stated that I am trying to exhaust administrative remedies and have been trying to deescalate matters myself, but I can’t be the only one doing so, and that if HR does not act I will be legally obligated to report the matters to multiple state and federal agencies.

HR knows I have a legal background and at least one member of the HR staff knows one of my parents is a retired HR professional with decades of experience that was grooming me to potentially have a career in HR myself. I’m aware of some of the best practices in these matters and explicitly cited one at the HRD. 

If they fail to act in a prompt manner according to the org’s policies, I will be engaging an attorney to handle matters and filing with multiple state and federal agencies. I am tired of the BS and they’ve had months to act but have generally failed. This is the org’s last chance. If they retaliate against me, that’s what whistleblower protections are for, and I’ll be joining a number of former employees and seeking a class action against the org.

Suffice to say, because of certain things going on I can’t disclose at this time, the org only has a month to handle things in a manner that shuts me up before this situation escalates to the point where it’s legally and politically very bad for my employer. Being dependent on government funding in an election year and all that….

Being in the same role for years had a coworker that became Manger, they were average at their job mainly having a lot of institutional knowledge.
They have failed at been a good role  model and are a average manager at best, only good for approving holidays and the odd bit of old knowledge.

As of this week they have decided they want 100% respect. As a rule I treat respect like a pool, i'll give anyone a bucket to start with. if you are good at your job and inspire me to be better or just a good person that bucket will become a swimming pool or a ocean.

If you spend 2 years been average at best when you come looking for 100% you should not be surprised you don't get some one wanting to lick your boots.

I am not married to my boss so if it is not in a HR file do not wine about stuff 2 years later. 

The best thing that will come out of this is that I can now go back to my job description, CYA for me and no covering their BS and incompetent.

And just to note not in the USA."
4304,2024-03-23,My CEO blew up at me on my final day and I just laughed in his face. Just a little vent about freedom from a toxic workplace.,u/Spudguy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1blyomp/my_ceo_blew_up_at_me_on_my_final_day_and_i_just/,antiwork,"So for background, I've been looking to leave the company for about a year due to the CEO's narcissism and inability to lead a company. The company is 22 years old and as of yesterday at 5pm, has 17 employees with only 6 of them being there more than 3 years including the CEO.

We are UK based an in IT services; we have no major competitors and with our margins/services we should be printing money. I personally joined just under 4 years ago and have a very strong background in what I do which started off really well, I bought in just shy of £750k for the company against a salary of £65k. I was the only person for my first year who delivered this (as well as worked as a Sales Engineer to sell it). Second year, we won two deals totalling £1.5m entirely based on my connections in the industry and I finally got an employee under me - I managed to secure a raise to £90k after using an offer from elsewhere to negotiate. 

I'll be as brief as I can with some examples of how he's been as a boss:

* Guaranteed calls every single time I block something personal out in my diary even though we have ""flexible working"". I'm talking 100% of times I went to the gym I would get a call in the middle of it for something benign. 
* Every time I was owed commission, I had to fight for it - In December I was due £5,500 for a deal but he changed the entire commission structure so I got a little over £1000 - this was between the order coming in and my commission being paid
* He at an event got drunk and explained to me how he hired me with a lower salary allowing him to give a big bump to me which ""made me more loyal"" - he was literally gloating about how he manipulated me
* At our kick off in September he boasted to the entire company by telling a detailed story about when he went out drinking on a friday night with the guy who was best man at his first wedding. The short version is he pushed his friend for details of a deal about to go through then called the customer first thing on Monday to under-cut him and smugly said ""Loose lips sink ships""
* He called me at some point last year and shouted at me for answering his calls with ""What's up?"" and told me to never speak to him like that 

In February the entire company was on a call where the CEO announced that we need to take a ""Voluntary"" 15% pay cut to reduce the cost to the business and avoid redundancies. If there was a single person who refused, the redundancies would be immediate. I had this call immediately after my final stage interview for my new job so I quickly started working out how I can use this to my advantage. 

Basically, I told him I'll agree to it if he changes my notice period from 3 months to 1. He agreed and when it was in writing I gave him my notice. He was clearly pissed off as he kept saying ""Well played"" on a call immediately after. For the past month he's mostly avoided me, communicating using other people as a proxy and a ""Handover Document"" which is an excel sheet of things he wanted from me. 

In the notice period he called me about two weeks ago and told me about how he's going to have his lawyer draft a document prohibiting me from using any of the documents I've created under him in a future role. This is the same man who asked me when I joined to provide a detailed list of all previous customers and share with him all documents I had from my old role. He also asked me not to attend a company wide meeting on Thursday due to ""Trade Secrets"". 

So I trundled along, and then yesterday on my last day posted on LinkedIn about it being my last day with the company, thanking a ton of people and being very positive. By the time it had over 50 reactions and 1500+ views, he called me and told me to remove it as I wasn't following his ""Communication Plan."" This is where it gets satisfying; 

I said ""With all due respect, you've not spoken to me in the past 4 weeks and if you had, maybe I would have known about this communication plan and been able to follow it.""

""Spudguy, when someone says 'with all due respect' there isn't a more arrogant thing someone can say.""

""Well, CEO, you'd be the master at that wouldn't you.""

I then faced the most incredible pink face, raised voice and barrage of attempts to rattle me I've ever experienced. He started by reminding me that he's still paying my salary (I was paid in full for yesterday before this call). When I said nothing, he went on to say he hired me when I was unemployed and needed the help. I said nothing. He then said ""It struck me at the company event yesterday - everyone who has been here as long as you have and has left, has had a gift or a card or something. I realised you have nothing. Maybe you should reflect on that.""

I was grinning at this point and told him that just because he hasn't seen it, doesn't mean it didn't happen. He finally realised he had no more power over me and said sarcastically that he wishes me well and hung up.

For almost 4 years, I've bent over backwards to make sure he was happy, worked on days off and given everything I possibly could to ensure the business was successful, but his ego and self-sabotage have meant that I have been in a group chat with everyone in the business except for him, his wife and his ""second in command"" where people are actively helping one another find a new job.

There's way more to this but it's getting quite long and I don't know if anyone would care, but the summary is that this choad of a man is going to probably lose his business due to a mass walkout as soon as people can get new jobs and my only regret is that I'm not around to see it crumble."

I recently learned I had apparently been terminated when talking to HR about getting my W2s. I was trying to get ahold of them as a current employee, but instead of being filed under academic leave, I had been marked as terminated. There was also an exit survey I was assigned by the end of January.

Problem: I wasn't told I was terminated. No call, no voicemail, no amount of contact about it. Not even some communication asking about what happened, so if this was intentional, I guess they were just going to let me find out once my college year was over?

Question: Is this allowed? My cynical side says ""yeah no shit, they don't care about us,"" but part of that feels a little more than disrespectful. Is there any room for me here or am I kind of just screwed and at the whims of HR/management when I contact them about this?"

Let me know what you think…,u/Beyond_Reckless,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bm3bxz/antiworkers_let_me_know_what_you_think/,antiwork,"     In my former job, I used to work in a small department with no more than 5 employees including my supervisor. The problem with this job was that it was so stressful and I ended up getting sicker from the stress that I had to leave.
     
     Now the problem with me leaving was there is only 2 people in the entire company that do what I do (myself and my counterpart), so me leaving would leave a huge hole in the department/company. 
     
     Aside from the stressfulness of the job being a big problem, what I really want to talk about was my former supervisor. My former supervisor was one of those super toxic, micromanaging, condescending, pain in the ass bosses. They treated all the employees in our small department like shit and was never satisfied with the work we were accomplishing. If you’ve ever seen the movie Whiplash, you would understand that my old boss would treat us like the music instructor in that movie.

     This supervisor was known by the entire company and everyone refused to work in my old department just because of the supervisor. So when I left, I figured it was going to be tough to fill my old position. Recently, I spoke with my old counterpart and they told me that there have been about 3 employees that worked in my old position and all of them left and some of them even filled grievances against the supervisor during the exit process. Everyone knew how the supervisor is even the higher ups but nothing was ever done about it. Turned out it took about 2 years for them to finally fill my position with an employee willing to put up with it.

     I just don’t understand how someone like that could keep their job when so many complaints have been filed against them and they couldn’t keep a fully staffed department with so little amount of people. I’m just happy to be out there because it was really affecting my health. I wish for the employees in my old department to get out and find a better place to work.

Thank you all for listening."

I don’t know where to put this but I’m struggling with my dad recently. My mom divorced him when I was 8 after she caught him cheating while pregnant with my sister. My life turned upside down after that and was essentially raised by a single mom with three kids in poverty. I got myself into a good college then grad school with nearly all Pell grants and student loans, in addition to very small contributions from my dad I had to fight with him over. I love my dad but we have a complicated relationship. He is unbelievably obsessive over money and although has many positive traits, I don’t think anyone close to him believes he is a good person. Still, he is my biological dad and I can’t change that. 

Fast forward to last year, he revealed to me that his net worth is over $200 million and I believe it is much more than that based on investments he disclosed. He’s always been extremely secretive and highly highly intelligent, but ruthless. He takes pride in hurting other people and when he was younger I suspect he was a bully in his fraternity. When we spoke last summer, he told me I would inherit at least $40 million when he and my step mom pass. That said, this week I have been under so much stress about my 85K in student loans compounding daily high interest since the COVID pause ended. It’s beginning to snowball and I reached out to my dad about helping to pay off 1/2 or even 1/3 so I don’t completely wipe out my painstakingly earned savings. He flat out refused, told me I was an embarrassment and to go get a job at McDonald’s since I was laid off from my dream tech job last November. 

I feel so disenchanted since when we spoke last summer about money, he told me I would never have to worry about money again. Now I feel like it was all a plot for control. I know my step mom gives money to my step brother and her grandchild, essentially funding their entire life. She doesn’t like me and I feel worried since she is 15 years younger than my dad, that she will find a way to cut me out of everything if he passes. 

I don’t know where to begin or how to process these feelings of extreme disappointment towards my dad and repressed childhood anger. Why is he hoarding so much money at nearly 70 years old? They live a VERY reasonable lifestyle and you would never suspect the amount of money they have. It reminds me of depression era mindset. They eat expired food and shop at Goodwill. Still, my dad is comfortable letting his three daughters suffer because he did as a child and is now “self made” as a white male straight boomer. 

I am 32 now and would love to have kids, but am utterly unable to afford them. I doubt this will change in the future. I feel so much resentment knowing my dad has life changing amounts of money but flat out refuses to help. I spoke to him about having kids and it’s clear he has no plans to help in any way. I only wonder WHY someone would be this way? Is he trying to become a billionaire? Why is hundred millionaire not enough? Why doesn’t he live up the last 10-15 years of his life with his family and friends? Is it my step mom somehow controlling his every action? I know there is nothing I can do but limit my reaction. Still, this is brutal. I feel like it is largely reflective of the boomer generation at large and how extractive they have been for younger generations. "

So I live in Ontario, Canada and I was working part-time (6 hours a day, Monday to Friday \[excluding Tuesday\] for the rate of $16.55/hr. (minimum wage)) as a junior compliance officer (duties included checking lockers and giving parking tickets) with my college. 

My first supervisor was pretty amazing. He was also new. When I first joined the job they said I will be given access to the patrol vehicle (the vehicle that has the cameras and takes pictures of license plates). Then after few weeks he says I am not insured. 

A month later, I  find out that supervisor apparently resigned. A new person came and she tells me only five people can be insured. I was like how come you did not tell me this before?

And they expect me to go out walk and give tickets. I can only give tickets by foot or if someone drives me. I said that is fine. This month is Ramadan for me and I told them I will do my own pace best as I can. I have only taken three sick days in the whole time I have been there. Two weeks ago I get an email saying they cut my hours to 0 but I am still on the team. I am currently on ODSP and I am frustrated as to what to do.

Do I file for unemployment? Please help."

I 22yr Male, have started a job at a signage company in Australia NSW and started working as a full time employee. The contract that I signed is normal, but it has a big problem and so far is getting abused.

The contract asks me to work my usual 40 hours a week, but if overtime is needed it will never be paid at penalty rates, only as time in lieu (1 hour of overtime means 1 hour of leave in future). This applies to working weekends and even public holidays. 

On top of that, you need to work an additional 4 hours of overtime on top of your 40 hours a week to start gaining overtime hours. A few times already I have worked 45 hours (sometimes 50) for the week and have only gained an extra 8 hours of leave for approximately 20 hours of overtime.

This has to be illegal right??"

This will help restore natural market order and prevent landlords from cherry-picking tenants. This will also give landlords an incentive to keep good tenants happy by limiting rent increases and providing proper maintenance. "

I was asked to emcee for a graduation event. I would have to make use of my Sunday off for this, but the person giving me this task is someone I respect and is a superior staff, thus  I agreed. The graduation auditorium could only host a maximum of x people, so all students were limited to 2 family members. The solution they came up with was to bunch up the additional family members and relatives in a small hall  and I was to be in charge of hosting them whilst live-streaming the event. There would be refreshments as well. 

I was later informed that there would not be a live stream at all, rather two short 4 minute videos that i was supposed to entertain them with for 4 hours. (Lord help me)
So we decided I would play the first video  let them eat and mingle, play the second, repeat, then end the event once the graduates have returned for the after party. So I relied heavily upon the idea that the food would  keep everyone satisfied.

Day of; family arrives.  There is a single kettle with a couple cake slices. This was the apparant food. I yap a bit to waste time before playing the first video. After this, nobody is mingling with each other. The food is finished. There is nothing but dead silence. They start questioning when the live stream would begin. I am confused as I explain that there is no live stream. I pull up a random slideshow that i find on the laptop that showed the students and the events that took place throughout the year. 13 slides. For 13 slides i yapped as hard as i could. It didnt last long. People were getting restless. Its hot. Someone straight up asked ""is that it?"" , wiith a bitter tone.

I give up and pull out the last video earlier than i should and start yapping a bit more. This keeps them entertained for another 3 minutes, and that's it. I asked a facilitator if they had any more content they could provide me. None. There was nothing to talk about either since I was not a lecturer, or a faculty member. I had no idea of anything other than my given script. No one is mingling. 

Right now, i sit typing this as I wait. There is another 2 hours to go and its restless dead silence. I am so embarrassed. I widh they could've at least prepared more content if there wasnt going to be a live-stream. I am livid. One page of script, and two videos was all i was given to entertain a crowd for 4 hours.

When I first started I was employed to do commercial sales for our region which I was excited to do. 

After 3 days I was left alone in my office for two weeks to run things as my manager was in another town full time. 

I struggled through and figured things out as best as I could with no training and no support. 

After a month my offsider who worked in the same office as my manager in another town wasn’t coping so I got her work given to me on top of my own work, which again I managed through and did my best. 

Fast forward to my second month and my offsider quit so I had her work permanently, a second person also quit so their work got passed onto me also. 

Things were tense as my boss rarely came to my office and she wasn’t hiring anyone to replace the staff we had lost. 
At this point myself and my other colleague in the office were doing the work of pretty much the majority of our state and at least six people. 

So Christmas comes and goes and many things keep changing, no new starters but my boss is now uncontactable. 
Turns out she had been doing something not quite right with company money and was forced to resign. 

So now we have an interim manager, they’re frustrating because they also live in another town and we are very much unsupported in my office. 

I had a great February for commercial sales, I was owed almost 1k in commissions which I was excited to get. 

It’s now almost the end of march and I still don’t have them, I queried this with my interim manager and the regional manager who told me something that blew my mind. 

It turns out the job I was hired to do doesn’t exist! According to my regional and head office I was hired for residential sales NOT commercial as that has never been a role in my branch. 

My regional said as a goodwill he will pay my commissions but that’s it, I will no longer get them. 

I asked how he didn’t know how fucked things were and what job I was supposedly hired for and he had no response.  

So everything I thought I was employed to do it turns out it was actually my bosses job to do commercial sales and she just didn’t  want to do it. 

I have never worked for a more useless company and the whole place is a cluster fuck. 

I cant wait to quit!"

You look at your coworkers. They want to show their best self every single day.

Don’t be like that.

Your coworkers look miserable. They think their job is important. But deep down they know it’s bullsh*t. They know it’s about paying less corporate tax and pushing numbers in Excel and visualising them in PowerPoint.

So, if you came here looking for tips from a high-performer, you won’t find anything.

I’m here to tell you how to be an average employee at 110% every week. It goes like this:


- Monday: give 30%
- Tuesday: give another 30%
- Wednesday: give 25%
- Thursday: 15%
- Friday: 10%

You can change up the numbers above. But make sure you never give too much on any given day. All you’ll get is more work…

I hope you find this useful. If you still can’t figure out how to be average at work, drop a comment below. I’ll try my best to lower your output and turn you into an average machine."

1,2024-03-24,I realise x acknowledge all of this is my own fault...,u/Nice-Ad2414,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bmj510/i_realise_x_acknowledge_all_of_this_is_my_own/,antiwork,"I have had 12 jobs in the past 3 years -- two of them fired me, two of them goaded me into resigning, one of them I only stayed at because the contract wouldn't let me resign (I would have had to pay a huge bond). Two of them were making me do things that were against my conscience (this one was probably even illegal) / religion, the former had zero plan / overall strategy / direction (the company is defunct now, I understand), the latter was one of the two that goaded me into resigning. 

That now defunct company (the 2nd of the 12 I think) was about the time I started having anxiety / crying all the time at work. I'm almost 50 years old for crying out loud (no pun intended, promise), I really don't know what it is -- karma, I guess? Was I hard on my co-workers / subordinates before? I don't think so / at least I hope not?

The 4th job I had I lasted literally 3 days -- the 3rd day was a company retreat at some beach resort where I saw the head of the department totally brush it off when one of my teammates injured herself (as in her shin bled -- she had scraped it against the edge of the bamboo raft) and was even passing weed around and they all got into a room with ""masseuses"" and closed the door in my face (i.e. you are not invited to join the ""massage session"") -- I was so upset I called my sister and she said you don't want to go in there anyway, just get out of there, don't go back... 

Most of the jobs had really 'micromanagey' bosses, the 3rd job I had had a really 'screamy' boss who yelled at me a lot and made me feel really stupid so I stuck it out for 3 weeks and then I just couldn't anymore (even if it came with the fanciest title I've ever had (or ever will get) and the money was the most I ever would've been paid)... 2 jobs back I had a similar boss who was all ""Why are you so defensive? I'm not attacking you. Have you always been this way? I'm not firing you, just so you know. Maybe you should just go back to doing what you know."" (This was the second job I was kinda goaded into resigning from.)

I know I'm not the best at what I do, but I don't think I suck either -- I at least have a lot of experience. But now my confidence is so shot and I'm just so scared of everyone and everything. Yet I have to work , right, so after each disaster job all I could do was pick myself back up and start applying again (you can imagine what my resume looks like).  I've been out of a job so many times that my savings are almost all gone and my credit card bill (spent on groceries, power, water and internet) is through the roof. Part of my money went to therapy, but I can't afford it anymore (anyways basically they told me to just take pills) -- I really tried to fix this, because I knew it wasn't the jobs -- I was the common denominator for all of them.

What can I say? I'm really weak and stupid! I mean, these are jobs, not humanitarian summits -- and I can't just keep crying and freaking out the minute I make a mistake or the boss or someone doesn't like my work or what... I need to grow (back) up -- I wasn't always like this... before this 12-job run I was at the same company for about 5 years. I don't know, I think it started with that 2nd job, or, I don't know... 

So now I'm on job no. 12, and I really want to make it work this time -- need to! Or I'll be out on the street -- thankfully I've lasted 2 weeks (no. 11 lasted 6 days then they fired me cos they said make ONE mistake and you're gone -- that's company policy whether you're new or you've been with us for years) -- well, I made that one mistake, and I was gone) (no. 10 lasted 8 days (that was the job with the boss who was all ""I'm not attacking you"" (my sister says when people say that, they kinda are lol).

You know how they say something like, idiocy (or was it insanity) is doing the same thing over and over and hoping for a different result -- I've tried applying to different companies, verticals, jobs where I was the boss, jobs where I wasn't the boss, day shifts, night shifts, part-time, full time -- I've tried it all at this point. I'm scared that I won't be able to find another job again especially now that AI can basically do what I'm doing. 

I am GRATEFUL for the job I now have -- I really, really am. And I'm hoping that it'll be different this time because it's a different kind of company (or well not really, it's a lot like job no. 3) and the boss is unlike any other boss I've had so far -- not really, but, I think this boss figured out I was a basket case and yet, is still willing to give me a chance. I feel like I've had quite a few chances from this boss already so far, but I think I owe it to this boss to really do my best / do the right thing by them...

The job is super gruelling x super lots to do with extra long shifts which extend all the way up to midnight, super fast paced and while they've been pretty patient with me so far, I'm scared that I won't learn what I need to fast enough and then... and then... (trying not to say ""look for job no. 13 </3)

(But I had to take this job because it really was the best offer and I literally can't afford to wait for another one / like I'd be an idiot (or more of one) if I didn't take it already, right...)

Anyway what this new boss of mine said was that if I think that, it's bound to happen -- this boss is strict for sure but is not a jerk and IS giving me a chance... that's why I said maybe it'll be different this time and I just need to be strong and do my best and not be scared anymore and maybe even enjoy it! Everyone has been really kind and patient so far >> maybe this time I need to not care about whether I get fired or not (now that I know what that's like, why should I be scared anymore at all) -- to just focus on turning out the best work I can and hope for the best.

Back to work again tomorrow -- I am now not all ""I hope I can just make it through another day.

1,2024-03-24,Worker co-ops,u/Ian_James,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bmk51x/worker_coops/,antiwork,"So I just got hired for my first skilled blue collar job. I haven't started yet, but they're paying me $18/hr for the first six months. After that, my pay goes up to $24/hr. There's no union at this place, which has thousands of workers scattered across multiple states. (The workers I've met strike me as overwhelmingly rightwing, but liberal white collar workers can also be super individualistic, annoying, and hostile to unions.) The company's revenues per year are in the billions, and they're snapping up smaller companies all over the place. I also found out that they charge customers $200/hr for labor. They're paying me less than a tenth of what they're charging, it's incredible, and people around here are desperate for this service because landlords have replaced almost every housing unit with AirBnBs and there are no workers left! Plenty of shit to fix, but no one to fix it! At the interview the boss also mentioned that they'd lost several workers to covid, but he didn't specify whether those people died, got disabled, quit, or got fired. Multiple people at the office seemed sick to me, but I kept my n95 on the whole time baby. Ah, the multiple crises of capitalism. Climate change is also destroying the roads here, which might make it impossible for me to get to work!

My plan is to stick it out until I feel comfortable doing this job, then I hope to start a worker co-op. This is basically a communist business where workers are in charge, share profits, and make decisions together. Imagine if your union just took over the business and kicked out the owners. That's what a worker co-op is. (Now imagine that these unions and worker co-ops team up, arm themselves, read Marxist literature, and take over an entire country...that's what the USSR was and that's what a bunch of [AES states](https://en.prolewiki.org/wiki/Actually_Existing_Socialism) are today...)

I might not make as much money as if I own a business and pay people peanuts to work for me, but the work we do will be of a much higher quality and I suspect that it won't be difficult to get people to join us for $200/hr. That comes out to $300,000/year, everybody, and that's just one person working full-time. I know some bootlickers here are going to say that the $200/hr is to cover taxes, insurance, overhead, etc., but this company is growing fast and there's no way all that shit costs that much. Whatever costs they have, they're just charging to consumers since they have nowhere else to go.

Anyway, I'm just posting this to let you all know that unions don't need to be the end goal, they can actually be a step along the way of a much cooler process. If you have skills that are in a lot of demand and you're getting fucked by your boss, consider starting a worker co-op! More information here:

We are currently going through our yearly compensation reviews to set the comp for the next year. As a manager, I am given a budget that I can use to distribute amongst my team for raises. I have no say in the budget, I can only say how it is distributed. Needless to say, even though our company hit all of their financial goals and had a really good year, the raise budget was not at all what I was expecting or hoping for. I now have the unfortunate task of giving my staff very minimal raises and having to explain why that is the case given the great year we had. In terms of inflation, some people will probably see this as a reduction in pay.

I realize a raise is better than nothing and we should at least be thankful we all have jobs but it is still a little disheartening given our company's performance. I just submitted my proposal for the compensation which now goes back up top for approval. There is a chance my proposal could be rejected or further reduced. The compensation cycle will be final in May when I can finally tell my staff what their new comp is.

My question is, in the spirit of transparency and openness, should I give my team a heads up that raises will not be amazing and to temper their expectations. I care about my team and want to be honest with them. I just don't know if giving them this heads up would be a good thing or a bad thing. How would you react if your manager told you this in advance of seeing what your raise would be?"

Even if business owners did not have guts to look into the eyes of their employees and fire them, atleast they had someone do their dirty work for them in as human way as they could.

Today it is just down the dumps. Having witnessed layoffs so closely in recent times, there was a different feeling when watching this movie. 

With whole world going digital, today all you need is disable their access with a touch of a button and send them an email on their personal email id.  

You access your system in the morning and if they don't work you rush to check in your personal email!! In one of the case folks were having a zoom meeting and the layoffs activated that very instant and affected people simply got logged off from the meeting!

I attended an early college program as a high schooler, so despite my age, I currently have two Master’s degrees and am working on my third. I started working for $7 an hour “under the table” in a construction company around the age of 10, began working in accounts receivable legally for minimum wage at age 14, and now haven’t been unemployed since I was 20. Since turning 20, I’ve consistently worked in museums, universities, and academic presses with no gap in my employment record. Despite this, I’ve never made it out of poverty. My parents blame me for being poor. 

My father compares me to the daughters of local politicians and says “Well, they married wealthy men and received six figure careers immediately after graduating with a bachelor’s degree, worse grades, and no work experience, so why do you have two master’s degrees and so much work experience, but you don’t make six figures like them? You’re choosing not to work high paying jobs because you don’t want to.” 

He blames me for not being like them, but never blames himself for not being like their fathers, who are extremely wealthy and powerful, well-connected politicians that can, of course, pull some strings, along with the women’s wealthy spouses, to land them the careers they want. In contrast, I was born into poverty and raised in a singlewide trailer. Neither of my parents have college degrees. My mother is disabled and unable to work, and my father works for a local business and has for over a decade. They live on a farm in relative isolation and have no connections or influence in their community, yet strongly believe in the meritocracy. I am entirely on my own and without a support network, renting a room from a stranger in another state that has more job prospects. 

He refuses to believe that hiring managers don’t give a damn about my years of work experience or my MBA or my close to 4.0 GPA. They see a recent graduation date and a name that sounds foreign and  a degree from a university in the South and throw my application out. He is convinced that an MBA by itself guarantees wealth and that, despite sending out 100s of applications for everything from fast food to pharmaceutical sales, I must be choosing to be poor because I’m too “picky.”

 My mother (who has been determined by a court of law to not be mentally sound) keeps sending me job listings for positions that are not real. They’re ALL very obvious scams or commission-based telemarketing jobs. The ones that aren’t, I’m not qualified for, as in they require degrees I do not have. My Dad is convinced that I should apply to these jobs, even though some of them pay even less than I currently make, and he insists I should just “climb the ladder” at these fictitious businesses since there is no room for growth where I work now. Because I am not giving my personal information to scammers, I am refusing to apply for these positions, my parents see this as me being too picky and refusing to work a “high paying” job. 

I just don’t know what to do. I feel like I can’t talk to them, because everytime I talk to them, they spend that time blaming me for being poor, insisting I drop out of school (even though I’m in a program that doesn’t conflict with working hours and doesn’t impede me finding a better job), comparing me to the children of wealthy and successful parents, etc. And then they post my accomplishments on Facebook for likes and approval and pretend they’re proud of me. They exclusively define success by wealth and are so ashamed of me, and I am having such a hard time handling the stress of poverty with the stress of feeling unloved. How do I demonstrate to them the difficulty of landing a high paying job in this job market so they’re more empathetic? "

At my previous jobs I have had a 1 hour break and one place I worked gave 15 minutes for a 6 hour shift, 30 minutes for 8 hours & 45 minutes for 8+ hours.

This place I only get 20 minutes no matter how long I work, so even on a 9 hour shift. But you know what the best part is? I don't even really take it! I don't want to go into the detail of what my job is, but I work a very busy, quite demanding job and honestly I don't even get when I could reasonably take it without causing things to get delayed or whatever. On my second shift I asked my colleague if we had a break and she said she doesn't take hers...

But, to be fair, at the end of my shift I usually have nothing to do from anywhere to 30 minutes to 2 hours, so I guess that's kind of a break, but by then it's too late for me to be able to have a meal. I eat breakfast before I leave and if I'm counting the end of my shift as my break then I'd not be eating for like 7 hours straight.

so you want me to unrealistically be totally perfect 100%?!    not gonna fucking happen... at all.

like it's so unrealistic that some corporations  pressure you to be perfect just like the training videos...  it's basically bullshit and completely unrealistic and totally unachievable and needs to die.

instead of this unrealstic bullshit of we are perfect,  so should you,   mentality,  corporations should honestly make their training videos more realistic,  and actually provide more sencerios that actually happen in real life in a more realstic fashion.  

and stop expecting perfection from everyone cuz that's not how this shit works corporate CEOs...."

I (19F) work at a family owned restaurant that serves burgers. We cook the burgers on a grill and dress them with condiments on a metal board that is able to be heated up. 
The metal board doesn’t need to be heated, but the owner (who never actually works there) insists it is kept at maximum heat to keep the burgers hot, despite the employees needing to work with their hands to dress burgers on it. Many of my coworkers have gotten mild burns on it before. Yesterday I was reaching to grab some mayo and it burned my stomach pretty bad when I lifted my arm.

The burn is about 2-3 inches and is welting/blistering. it’s pretty painful. I was wondering if y’all think I should do anything about it such as ask for some sort of compensation? 
The boss is super unprofessional in general so I’m not sure if it’s even worth it. 

Thank you in advance! "

I spoke to the interviewer, it’s a “small” business (not a mega corp) that sells atv, boat, side by sides, and jet skis. 

The position is
1. Repair the machines
2. Diag broken machines
3. Quote the broken machines for parts
4. Take guests on tours on various machines (into the desert)
5. Check rentals in and out

The interviewer said it was a very busy job and the required hours are 200 a month, 50 hours a week.
 I pulled my calculator out during the phone interview- 15$ an hour.

I asked the interviewer if he paid overtime- Nope! Everyone makes salary. (Assuming it’s so he doesn’t need to pay +/- 300$ overtime

So, I asked him if there were any benefits, insurance, 401k. He said no. He said he “pays enough for the crew to get their own insurance

So this foo thinks he pays enough and makes these poor souls grind doing like 5 different positions just to make 15$ hr, no overtime, no benefits, and “maybe” get tips from guests

And after getting a degree in Software Engineering I needed a job to pay my loans off before I could go ""Career searching""  


I got a job at a Mobile phone store (I won't name the phone store for privacy's sake) because it was tech-adjacent and I knew most of the tech they were selling better than the management did. I'm really good at it but some facets of the job have made me think I'm being taken advantage of by my boss. Like I said, I don't do conflict well so I wanted to compose myself and ask for advice instead of going in hot to confront my manager about this:  


1) Our job has no PTO unless you are a manager, so if you have to call out you just won't earn money that day. As a result I have only called out 3 times in the 6+ months I have been working there - Once when I was in a car accident and my car was totaled, once when I tested positive for COVID, and once recently when a snow storm was so bad I could not safely get in to work (we had 26 inches of snow on the ground and because our driveway is on a Private road that has a 10+ degree incline, the Plow teams didn't clear us out until the day after), every time I called out for valid reasons my Manager would call back every couple of hours asking if I could find a way to come in anyways...hoping I would eventually cave and come in for like, a half-shift.  


2) I'm one of the few people who knows how to do daily tasks besides selling phones. Our Assistant Manager is someone who had quit the job before, didn't ride out their 2 week notice and was allowed back after an HR complaint for homophobic slurs alongside slamming extra charges on peoples purchases for the extra commission (Adding insurance without the customer knowing, poaching sales from inexperienced sales reps, straight up stealing somebodies commission report to cash in the sale)...and he can't even do a daily bank deposit properly. I'm one of two trained and prepped sales reps on the team who has been there for more than a month and I'm the only one who knows how to open and close the store properly. Because of this I have been constantly called in on days that I'm supposed to be closing for a last minute ""we need you to open the store."" And all of a sudden I'm doing 10+ hour shifts and not getting out until 7pm at night during the winter.  


3) I'm bending myself in half trying to be flexible. Our store is open 7 days a week and one of our worst days for sales is Sunday, store policy is that there needs to be at minimum 2 people on the store floor during the day. Because they initially wanted me to close on Mondays I had to quit my Monday night bowling league and move to Sundays, which they then wanted me to work Sundays. The compromise was that they would let me work a 6 hour shift on Sundays (9am-3pm)...In exchange for giving me Mondays off? I'm constantly being put on closing shifts because I'm the only person who knows how to do them properly to avoid our corporate reps failing audits.  


Most recently - our store had a massive turnover project where we had to put up all new flyers, posters, and banners that plug into the walls of the store to show promotions and corporate jargon. This project takes 2 hours to do with a team of people, and I was volunteered by the ASM to do it by myself, after the store closed because it needed to be done before the store opened the next day.  


And I don't **want** to quit the Job. I like it and I'm really good at it. Our base pay is 14$ an hour but after commission I'm making closer to $25/hr. Corporate likes me because I put up numbers and Customer Service Feedback on me is always positive to the point where they criticize the company itself in my surveys but always circle back to ""But u/CasuallyCritical was great""  


With all of this in mind, I feel like our management is taking advantage of my inability to push conflict. Effectively guilt tripping me into doing things that are outside of my responsibilities and putting my well being secondary to being a team player. Am I overthinking this?"

<Rant> I’ve been in the cybersecurity realm for about eight years now and it baffles me why, at this point in the WFH era, anyone would download a mouse jiggling program like nosleep.exe or caffiene.exe or anything of the likes off GitHub!

Even the crappiest anti-virus and asset management solutions will immediately let folks like me know. I personally don’t care what folks do while working from home as long as the work gets done but this stuff only gives crap managers more ammo to make everyone else come back to the office.

I had a fellow IT compadre pop in my AV dashboard on Friday. After having a weird week of fraud and computers popping for malicious downloads I immediately isolated his computer to investigate. He then reached out to me a few minutes later when I was just starting my triage asking if I had isolated him. I explained what had happened and he confessed, without prompting or coercion or any notion of who else could be looking at my screen, to not only downloading it but that he KNEW it was against the company policy. Lo and behold right beside me is my boss and he just happened to be talking to me about something unrelated and read it as well- after which this guys boss was called over to read it. 

I’m hoping he has a job to come back to this week a lot of corporate knowledge is locked away in his dome.

All that to say, don’t download shit off the internet to keep your computer awake and look like you’re online! You’re gonna have to get creative with some analog means if you want/need to skate during work hours. Open notepad and put a rock on your keyboard or something. 

At this point, going for one of those types of programs is lazy- we know all of them at this point and all the originals are riddled with malware. When a computer pops like that it is difficult for me to defend the action, i can’t report it as just ignorance: we all know what these programs are. I can’t turn a blind eye to it- I’m not the only one who receives AV alerts and I’m not the only one who knows what the AUP is.

2,2024-03-24,Jumping ship feels so good,u/TeddyGoodman,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bn2que/jumping_ship_feels_so_good/,antiwork,"I made a career shift a year ago to a logistics company that started a new division in beverage repacking.  Quick explanation what that is - a company sends us pallets of cans of their product and we repackage it into different case size and mixer configurations using our case packer and automated palletizer.  I had come from a production and packaging background, so they hired me on as an Assistant Operations Manager.

They had only been operational a month before I came on board and it was a shit show.  Inventory accuracy was horrible, the machine constantly broke down and shifts were only producing about 12 pallets a shift which is about 5 cases a minute when it should be 15-20(depending on the case size).

I got the inventory in order and created the systems required to accurately pick and stage the product needed for our packaging runs, started performing maintenance to the machine.  I was also able to do repairs that would’ve normally warranted a call to a millwright.

6 months in and our inventory accuracy was close to 100%, we were averaging 20 pallets a shift and we hadn’t called the millwright since I had started as I was able to do any major repairs.

They then landed a really big contract that warranted a second packaging line which would mean double the work as far as inventory management and machine maintenance goes as well as double the workforce.  They chatted with me about my “development plan” which was taking on more of an Operations Manager role and said they really valued me there.

I said “sounds like an exciting opportunity, but I’d like to revisit my job description and compensation package.”  Keep in mind, I currently receive the bare minimum of 10 days paid vacation and no RRSP(401k)match.  They said “that’s not how this works.  You’ve got to prove yourself first.”

Well, didn’t take long to find a new job.  4 day work week, RRSP match, 15 days paid vacation and 20% above the median salary for the role.  I gave them 10 days notice and they’re giving my responsibilities to 3 different employees and giving none of them raises.

I did the bare minimum last week and things are already falling apart.  My team leads are pleading with me not to leave and my bosses ego is too big to admit they did me wrong.

I’m out."

My boss scheduled me on a Friday for an 8 hour shift during the day. I asked her if I could work then because of school and she said it’s a PA day or something and it’s fine. She asked for my division and said that it was fine. I told my mom and she sent a photo of my schools calendar which shows that I do have school that day, so I messaged my boss saying that I had school and sent a screenshot of the calendar. She then responded my telling me to find a cover or trade then. My parents have been pissed about this and saying it’s not legal but I’m not sure. The other staff are also in school and I don’t think could cover. I didn’t know where to post this to ask what to do? Sorry if this isn’t the right subreddit, I just don’t know what to do if I can’t get a cover."

I was working only one night per week at this point and I've been enjoying my time at home, not having to be at work, etc. -Yet- not having income always gives me this urgent feeling, even if I know I am okay for a while.

I was told to keep my badge because I will be the first person he calls if a permanent spot opens, or if things pick back up. He seems very confident that I will be able to go back. I didn't love that job but it's easy and my supervisors are really cool. The sort of bosses where you forget they are even your boss when you talk to them and they aren't motivated by profit.

I'll definitely go back if I get a call but I know I can't sit on my laurels forever. Haha. I will give it a bit of time and just try to enjoy the feeling of not having to work."
17,2024-03-24,Last update on the job I quit,u/Weneeddietbleach,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bn3jek/last_update_on_the_job_i_quit/,antiwork,"Recap



So back in June, I quit my job with very little warning. I was a welder at a trailer manufacturing plant and 1 of only 2 people on site that can run the plas table (the other being the guy that taught me, but at the end of my time there, he was running a different line AND having to drive a forklift due to a lack of people). The prior December, all welders has to be retrained and I was 1 of 4 out of over 100 people that passed all their tests on the first try.

Come to February, we're getting a bunch of new hires. As it turns out, the company LOVES wage compression. General laborers were coming in at $19/hr, welders at $21/hr (this is Idaho, so.... you know) but even with my tenure, specialized training, and skills that outshined almost everyone on site, I was only making $17/hr. Many other tenured employees were making only $19 (still not sure why I was so low). Any time any of us asked, we all got a one size fits all excuse about attendance- some people had justifiable reasons (work injury requiring therapy, court, etc.), some of us like myself weren't even on a verbal warning.

Then there's the poor managerial display. They've been jerking me around/dodging me entirely about other positions I applied for. Any time someone in the Paint line got the sniffles, they'd shut down my line (Gooseneck) to go scrape trailers. They failed to keep our supplies stocked, which resulted in my line being shut down to scrape trailers for weeks. And any time another line starts to fall behind, rather than ask for volunteers before it got too bad, they'd make us all stay, regardless of one's familiarity with the line, the availability of machines to use there, or the lack of elbow room. Oh, Dump Line fell behind? Well now that's EVERYONE'S problem. I wasn't going to have any of that. We already worked 50hrs/wk, and I had responsibilities outside of work. Eventually my boss comes to me asking why I'm not staying later, I tell him I have other things to do and the pay wasn't worth it. After a little back and forth, I tell him that without me, GN would have to shut down.

""Oh, we'll find somebody.""

""Will you though?""

""Don't worry about it, we'll find someone.""

""Well I'm going to finish at my normal time and whatever happens, happens.""

I called in the next day to tell them I won't be in again unless they started paying me better.

Fast forward a few months ago and I'm working at a new job with a former coworker that said the company had to shut down my line after I left.



Current



Last week, I was talking with him again, and apparently the company is shutting down that location entirely. I saw it confirmed on a local news site. Of course rather than say what happened, they focused more on the company's past, but they're closing the site because the lease got too expensive. And rather than eat that cost, corporate would instead put nearly 200 people out of work. Surely management will have their golden parachutes though. But they're encouraging a lot of their employees to apply where I'm at now. At least they'll be paid better if they get the job.

I know it would be arrogant to say that I caused it all. But it leaves me wondering how much longer they would have been open had I stayed. My line made the biggest trailers and they didn't come cheap. And it's a shame, because in spite of the shit pay and treatment from management, I liked the work I did. I was good at it and had a way of making my team better. I hope to see some of them get a job with me. They don't deserve to struggle because of the greedy decisions of people in another state."

Although this post is gonna come off as me complaining, this one fell into the final category. I’m more perplexed than anything.

How does this make sense? It doesn’t motivate me because I know most of the time the promotions are already designated. And over here you don’t get a pay raise unless you get promoted. So obviously everyone is trying to become the manager for a raise. How many managers are even needed in the first place?!

Usually in a higher position, more than likely middle management but I've seen like the high high up people be this way too. Their entire life is work. They have nothing else. No pets, estranged family, few friends if any, never stay married long if they even date, and they are usually very abrasive and rude in one way or another. But their entire personality is their job. If they go out, it is a work function and they always seem amazed that the boss held a dinner or a party or sent a gift. Company vehicle is like a golden chalice. They think it's attractive or something inspirational, but all I see are people who refuse to take care of themselves and lash out at coworkers and employees with different priorities.

When I worked in the film industry, I saw them a lot. There is a type that basically live their life working 12-16 hour days, go back to the extended stay hotel to sleep (they *might* shower), and then go back to work. They literally spend years going from one hotel to the next, living on craft services and wherever the show orders lunch that day (usually not very healthy). They are the first to give you hell if you have to call out, if there is an emergency, and they get really weird about holidays. They're always the ones that will be texting everyone on the weekends that there is some kind of shoot and we all need to come in. In my experience they are also the types that get in trouble because if your time card is reported accurately, they will try to get you to redo it and write fewer hours. (it's very illegal and I've seen more than one get fired for it)

One of the worst ones I ever met had a major problem with making awful comments and yelling at me. I reported him to the supervisor and she dealt with it, and then in the same day she went into the little office I had to give me a note and overheard him screaming at me because he broke the printer. He got some other talking to and every day after that (until he fired me) he looked sick trying to hold back mean comments. I've literally never seen anyone so obviously want to scream or say something mean, and look on the verge of tears, making himself sick because he can't be like baseline decent/workplace appropriate. Come to find out, he'd been getting in trouble doing the same thing to a lot of people but I was the office PA so I was his punching bag basically.

Like I have a job to stay alive, and I kinda like the one I currently have. It's an ""overtime is always approved"" kind of job, but for the most part everyone's chill. It's easy to get wrapped up in the overtime grind, but my job isn't very hard. The main draw are very generous bonuses and other perks, but like im genuinely paranoid that someone is going to find out how little I work. (I make PowerPoints all day and sometimes edit videos that our boss presents) But like I'm not defined by my job, I'm actively seeking to be as selfish as possible when it comes to work, when it comes to my work-life balance, when it comes to my quality of life.

I apologize that this is more of a rant. 

But I’m at my wit’s end. 
Originally, I thought that work just sucked now because of seasonal depression; leaving home and getting home in the dark was no bueno. 

But now spring is here and it’s sunny, but I’m stuck indoors and the best part of the day is dedicated to staring at some screen making a presentation that will probably be scrapped anyways. 

I just don’t understand how my coworkers can be laughing and seemingly enjoying their work, while I’m questioning how anyone can do this for decades on end. 
The time of my life when I’m supposed to be starting to settle down, but still have energy is dedicated to this crud and I’m literally just living for my measly weekend every week. 
I’m probably depressed and I’m talking to a  therapist about it.


I don’t mean to be all doom and gloom, but legitimately, how do y’all get through this? How do you look forward to stuff when you know 5/7 of your days are like this?

Nothing lead up to this, no final warning, no nothing. I get a text in the middle of the work week stating I am no longer assigned to the location effective immediate starting today. Due to some changes within the company, I'm the last hire so they have to relocate me. 

One: The location I worked was simple and safe for me, I found a cheap deal that charges $140 per month after 3pm to 8am next day. Every parking garage in the city charges $300 for a monthly pass. I cant afford that. For obvious reasons, I don't live in the safest city, so traveling at night, I am not comfortable with, so I drive. Even the 5-minute walk from the location I worked to the parking garage freaks me out.  

Two: I have a toddler at home and my partner and I switch off to watch the 2-year old. My partner works the morning shift and comes home at 4pm. Then I leave for work. Rinse and repeat Mon-Fri.

Today, I spoke to the the hiring manager and they ""tried"" to accommodate me to either do a 2pm-10:30pm shift or 4:45pm-12:45pm shift. If I don't choose, they take it as my resignation. I texted ""4:45 to 12:45am"" for tomorrow shift. I didn't sign anything or agreed to anything on paper, ""yet.""

My previous position, I had no issues. Everything worked like clockwork. And caused no issues with my transportation or babysitting situation. Now, because I texted the evening shift, I have no parking pass and I'm don't want to take public transportation at night in this dangerous city.

---

I moved to Germany to start working for this employer from 1st of August 2020. According to the German law, the employer can extend your fixed term contract up to two years, which means that after two years you must get a long term contract. 

Before the end of those two years, the team decided they are still unsure if they want to work with me becauset they haven't assessed certain skills, but it is not a clear no because they see how much I improved and that they have never met anyone who is so willing to work on themselves, so they said they want to find a way that we continue the trial phase.

So they offered to give me another position on paper so that I can get another two year fixed term contract.

I complained why should I suffer because they were unprofessional ? They had two years to assess it and if they are impressed by my self-improvement, where is the trust that it will continue? I said I feel cheated.

They said they don't see it like that because ""law is just a piece of paper.""

According to the law if it is not a yes forever, then it is a no forever, and to them that is too harsh. They value what I give but they are unsure about certain things, so they want for us to cheat the law together to find a solution that is best for everyone.

I agreed to it because I didn't have anything better at the time. 

Fast forward two years and they decided to not give me a long term contract because they were not satisfied with my performance, but now they won't pay my a severance fee because ""*there is no legal requirement for an employer to a pay a severance fee if the contract is fixed term*.""

**TL;DR**: We will cite the law if it goes to our favor but if it does not, we will say it is only a piece of paper."

Recently a local preteen came over to babysit for us as a trial run.  It was 2 hours and I was in the house doing yard work while they played. The kids were really happy and asked for the sitter to come back.

I sent the parents a small some of money for their kids time.  They tried to give the money back and kept telling me how “generous” I was, which felt nice but didn’t line up.  I figured this young person came over and gave two hours of their time and deserved to be compensated.  

I wonder if the parent’s expectation of me not paying thier kid is somehow connected to works learning to be ok being exploited?"

1,2024-03-25,I need your help...,u/ReferenceSwimming741,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bn9vlo/i_need_your_help/,antiwork,"I started at a job at the beginning of this year as a PMO (officer) at my company (university) and certain things have been happening. 

&#x200B;

\- Since I am the PMO I basically have a governance role for the company and need my support from the CEO who is my direct executive. I report to him as well as the other project managers (PM) and the financial controller (FC) + Quality Manager (QM)

&#x200B;

\- It has been 2 months now and ever since the beginning I have been met with micro bullying and it slowly turned into plain bullying by the PMs, specifically one lady. There are 3 in total but she is the “lead” of the group. She felt not involved since she was on pregnancy leave during my recruiting process. The other two who are her puppets are now leaving and resigning. Which means she is the only PM left…

&#x200B;

\- The QM is my best buddy at work. She noticed how those things were involving since I sit next to her in the office. The CEO of course sits elsewhere but the PMs all sit in the same room. We both have complained about the noise they make and how we need to reserve a different room for meetings but that’s not the case for this specific bully. She can do as she pleases and we’re not okay with that.

&#x200B;

\- When reporting the above (and other incidents like laughing and talking, all of a sudden silence when I walk in or the QM, or the bully literally coming in my face for calling her out on putting my name in documents I never approved of!) we had the feeling that the CEO understood. How wrong we were…. 

&#x200B;

\- He suggested a talk with the bully where he will be the mediator. I agreed in the hope that he will clarify my job to the PMs since they used that as an excuse of ''I have no idea what her job is so I am putting involuntarily her name everywhere under those tasks''. It ended up him being manipulative and agreeing with everything she is saying and me being the bad guy for standing up for myself and saying that she is lying and not even telling the truth about how certain events with, the first being a meeting she held in front of everyone despite me inviting her one on one. He basically said to suck it up and to find a solution together since the bully is willing to work. I just thought nope.

&#x200B;

\- I am now on sick leave and am confused how to handle this further... Any tips would help me a lot... I have an appointment with the company doctor in an hour or so... To explain how this all resulted in me throwing up, having panic attacks in the bathroom stalls at school, non existent sleep schedule, physical shoulder and back pain. Delayed period and random stabbing feeling in my abdomens. 

I will update further... At this point I would be lying if I said I am not losing hope, considering I have been in the defense for 2 months now and feel like my age and color played a huge role, along with my integrity and moral compass that the others lacked. And hence provoked them to project their insecurities on me... I feel like wherever I go now, it is just a matter of time before the discrimination will start based on my age and color. And the bullying being inevitable."

I accepted this jobs as hybrid remote. The benefits are shit but the schedule is great. The work is high pressure and endless, with more work being dumped on you. I feel like idk if I should look for other jobs but with my family this schedule works perfect. I can’t stand how management is unappreciative of any of the good work you might have done and can turn on you so quickly."

I work at a theme park in NY. I’ve been working here for 17 seasons now (7 seasonal and 10 year round). I make a $58,500 a year salary. In my time as a manager, I’ve helped train and watch 5 other managers come and go for various reasons. I work with my director and the catering manager in my department. 

The catering manager has been here for 10 seasons (8 seasonal and 2 year round). He has been making $20 an hour and recently was approved to change jobs to become a water ride manager and make $59k with no prior training. 

They’re advertising the catering manager’s job now for a salary of $59k a year. 

So I’m trying to rationalize why the company that I work for is now paying someone with no experience in the water ride department the same pay as me and then advertising the catering job for the same pay as me. 

Both people will have worked in their new position for the first time within this company and will make the same as me who has been here for 17 years. 

Any advice would be appreciated!

I can also provide more info if needed

Everyone thought it was me, because it's been points I've raised so many times (We all have, but I've been public about it):

\- No real allowances breaks, toilet breaks, refreshments etc  
\- Low staff retention due to toxic management not listen to staff and burning out (a phrase I've used)  
\- Being worked to capacity and beyond with little to no credit  
\- A ton of other stuff

However, the review mentions something our CEO encouraged that rhymes with "" tincouraging Meterual Desalt"". This isn't the first time it's been raised, as it happened once before when I first joined, and took an insane amount of time for them to get rid of the guy. Apparently it's happened again.  


God, I can't wait to leave this toxic place."

My new part time position is in the same building with another company and they want me to go full time. They only pay me $17.50 with no incentive bonus and I must do some split shifts (such as 4-7 and come back 12-5).

My full time job is super annoying with no benefits and my manager constantly has a stick up their ass but I get decent pay for my area AND four days off (I do use those days to work my other job however). I’ve been with that company for 2 years now and I’m kind of bored.

My part time job gives me flight benefits and an amazing manager who is very flexible with scheduling but the hours may not be as stable.

It's humiliating and I feel infantilised by it. I hate it.

**Little bit of context, I got promoted to a new role and started with my new responsibilities on the 26th of February. It's been a month and he still treats me like a fucking idiot. Granted, I'm 28. Everyone else on our team is 30+, so maybe he sees me as a young girl who has so much to learn about our work or life in general.**

Just on Friday last week, I told him I'd be absent for one morning and one day in a couple of weeks from now. I didn't think it'd be a big deal because my coworkers don't always show up since their kids sometimes need them, or they get sick. 

In the same email where I informed him of my time off, I mentioned that my absence won't jeopardize our work and I will make sure there is no impact whatsoever.

He STILL responded with this:

""I want to make sure with you that you are aware we are in a busy period in our department, specifically until April 8th."" 

NOW, WHY DOES HE FEEL THE NEED TO SAY THAT? I literally just said I'd make sure there'd be no impact on my work whatsoever. At this point, I know what my work is and how to manage my time to a point where I feel confident enough to even *be* absent.

Besides, he keeps repeating that we're in a busy period, but I don't feel rushed in my workload. I'm able to do everything I need to do and help others on my team. I keep asking my coworkers if I'm supposed to be doing anything else, and they're like you're fiiine. *They* have the busy hard work, it seems like. I'm just sort of here.

Anyway. I needed to vent because I really dislike his attitude towards me. When am I going to be perceived as a grown adult and not a foolish young women from the 60s by my boss? Jesus."

Now it is 2024, so I theoretically should be able to access my full vacation time. Except its a ""busy year for the company"", so they have restricted us to 5 days total until end of june. I've been sick a lot this flu season, so I ended up using all of my sick days + 1 vacation day. I requested three days off at easter, and my boss's boss ~pulled me aside~ to tell me i needed to stop taking so much time off, and that no other requests will be granted until the end of june.

jokes on them because i am quitting in a few weeks - they do not know this yet. I'm sure it will be more efficient for them to find, hire and train a new employee during the busiest season of the year than it would have been to let me use the vacation time that i am legally entitled to <3"

I got offered a job as an assistant manager that is very clearly a full time position. 

I went in to sign paperwork and they had a policy to sign saying that they would do a 90 day review of hours to determine if you’re full time and after that, if confirmed, insurance begins 60 days after that. 

Five months from starting to getting insurance. 

The boss I would work with did not know the corporate folks had changed their insurance policy and was a great advocate for trying to make this happen faster.

As a person with a HR background I tried to explain that federal law says the maximum for coverage is 90 days after start date and I was confident they were violation federal law.

Their upper ups said no, despite it being management and despite it generally being full time, the position is hourly, hours are variable and therefore they are within their rights to do this. They also said that a person’s start date - despite it literally being listed on the offer paperwork I signed as a specific date - is not until after the 90 days. This organization doesn’t have a HR person I’ve learned, they have an accountant making these decisions and policies. 

I ended up having to rescind my notice with my current job, which made them happy, but honestly I’m considering filing a labor complaint about it. It feels morally, ethically, and legally wrong. I’m not fully sure the best place to file the complaint. It seems like the NLRB would be best but who knows. "

I wonder how much training pilots on MCAS and supervising assembly of aircraft to ensure all the bolts are in place would have cost.

I also have a 7 month old who just started daycare so she's bringing home all sorts of sicknesses home and finally last week I got sick and have felt like crap for \~7-8 days now. Well last week Monday-Thursday I kept working, although at a much much slower pace because I had a beaming headache pretty much 24/7 even with over the counter pain meds. Friday I felt so nauseous and dizzy that I finally called off and moved any meetings and other commitments I had to this week.

Well this morning I'm still not feeling that awesome but I got on anyway to join our team sync for this morning and the first question from boomer bosses mouth is why I didn't get x, y and z done last week. And that's fine to ask, but the reason is obvious that I was sick but calling me out in front of the rest of a 20 person team is totally ridiculous.

So the moral of the story is, don't keep working when you're sick, just call out and be sick even if its for a week, who cares. Because then there wont be any ambiguity as to wether work is being done or not, it wont be done, and if it was that critical in the first place then someone else can pickup the slack or maybe we don't run the team so lean that I am a single point of failure for everything important."

3,2024-03-25,Culture clash,u/Designer-Anybody-542,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bnfa6v/culture_clash/,antiwork,"The following happened many years ago while I was working as a customer support engineer for a U.K. electronics manufacturer, supporting the integration of equipment into a military helicopter. 
The prime contractor for the project was a major US corporation who employed both U.K. and US nationals in the U.K.  
I traveled from our location in mid U.K. to the helicopter manufacturing site in SW U.K. every Monday morning, returning to the midlands on Thursday evening for a day of meetings, technical updates and expense submissions on Fridays. 
I often carried development equipment between the sites as a goodwill gesture though this meant a nonstop journey and a later finish on Thursday as the equipment was classified and had to go straight into the secure area of our facility. 
One summer however, this was all about to change. I had taken my family down to a holiday let in the far southwest of England over a weekend and went from there to the helicopter plant on Monday. I had booked the Friday and the following two weeks off as leave to spend with my then young family. 
On the Thursday of that week the Prime contractor’s local project manager called into my office and told me that they wanted some equipment taking up to the manufacturing site. I apologised and informed him that I was not traveling to the site that week and that I was instead heading in the opposite direction as soon as my day was done. He became insistent, saying that he was the customer and I will do what he told me to do. I once again apologised and told him no - he then became angry and said that he was going to telephone my boss and that he would get me fired. 
I said that I had my boss on speed dial on my office phone (this was pre mobile phones), dialled him and handed over the phone. 
After ranting to my boss for a while he went quiet and handed the phone back to me, saying my boss wanted to speak to me. My boss said enjoy your holiday - the equipment is being couriered back as outlined in the contract and that my goodwill service was being withdrawn. 

That project manager never did understand the difference between US and U.K. business culture. "

My birthday came up and I decided to make cupcakes to celebrate- I didnt feel very seen or appreciated by the job, and the management was quickly tearing that place to shreds and hemorrhaging long-time employees faster than we could hire new ones. In my first few months, we had pizza and cake and Goodbye parties for employees who had been there 10+ years and had to go because they were paying them $10-12/hr and not giving them raises while new hires got $15-16, and I got hired at $18 because I said I had other options and the other place was offering that so I couldnt take any less. (That building manager got ""removed"" for ""not aligning with company values"" which translated to giving an actual shit about the people, not just the bottom line and scamming people out of a fair wage.) By this time, though, they saidnthey couldnt afford to pay for anymore food, and everyone knew it was becusse people were quitting too often and too quickly because the work sucked and no one got any recognition for how frustrating it always was. It was terrible to work there but I was making an effort to make the place my own, bringing in tea to share in the break room and my own mugs to save the company on plastic coffee cups. I made it another 3 months after this before I quit. 

So before all of that I homemade these chocolate cupcakes and brought them in. Most people took them when I wasnt in the breakroom, which was fine cuz we had to stagger lunch breaks for the kids and morning/afternoon shifts. My manager/supervisor came in and was eating one at the same time as I was taking my break and said, not seeming to know *why* I brought them, ""Thanks for bringing something in, but you should know that most people here like vanilla over chocolate."" 

I laughed at the absurdity of that, feeling like it was a pretty backhanded compliment for someone who wasnt expected to bring in anything, and said, ""Well, MY favorite is chocolate, and I brought them in to celebrate *my* birthday."" Silence. I continued, ""I'll keep that in mind if I bring in a random treat, but isnt my own opinion the most important for my day?"" 

This was just another reason I felt so unappreciated there. I baked my heart out for people who barely knew me and didnt appreciate my hard work, just for a ""well I dont like chocolate all that much :/ "" I had to spell it out for her that I brought it in because of my birthday- she couldnt even be bothered to keep track and say a verbal ""happy birthday"" despite me mentioning it earlier in the week, and HER birthday and the owner's and several other teachers' birthdays were celebrated and literally catered with big sheet cakes. But I put my time and money on the line and I just get ""hmm well do better next time,"" so there wasnt a next time. "

I work at a relatively large private equity firm as a contractor. It pays like crap for Boston, but I needed this job to rebuild my resume since I took prolonged time off visiting sick family. The company follows a hybrid model and is 2 days in (mon. & wed.), 3 days out. It is crunch time for my team in our company since typically Q1 and Q4 end are the busiest times of the year for us. Myself and a few other coworkers even agreed to come in on Good Friday (a banking holiday) to finish out Q1 to make sure we meet/exceed our deliverables.  


The issue:  
I am feeling under the weather and out of pure lucky coincidence (sarcasm) the unit above me has a leaky pipe that decided to start leaking through my ceiling so maintenance is visiting me to assess. With all that being said, I asked my employer if I could WFH today instead of taking sick leave to help power through and finish Q1 end, despite being sick.   


Instead I get asked if I can make up the time in the office by coming in some other time this week. Confused of course, I made sure to emphasize that I was sick and the leaky pipe was just a compounded issue, perhaps my text message to my employer at 3:00am was poorly relayed. Am told that it was well understood and its just a ""policy"" (its not actually, this is like some arbitrary rule with our team).   


I mentioned how it was a bit confusing and if I should take sick leave instead, in which I get told ""\[First name\], I don't understand. You requested WFH for today. We are scheduled to be in office twice a week. If you take a sick day, you would not be expected to come in another day. Happy to talk if you have questions.""  


Maybe im making a mountain out of a molehill, but does anyone else find this absolutely asinine? I am quite literally offering to help out the team during this busy final week to tie out our Q1, to the point that im working through being sick, but am being punished for doing so?"

I have been thoroughly enjoying this job as it's Monday-Friday 7-3:30, and honestly the workload is pretty low. Well, all that is about to change. 

Our company lost the contract, but the company taking over the contract just hired all of the current employees, at our current salaries. There was a meet and greet type meeting with everybody, then a mini application/interview process. Everything has been going well since this all happened about 2 months ago.

Next we all were summoned to an impromptu meeting last week and told that effective April 1st we are going to be doing the ""reverse Dupont"" rotating shiftwork schedule. Red flag #2 If you aren't familiar it accomplishes 24/7 coverage, using 12hr shifts rotating between working days for a period of 3 or 4 days, then night shift for 3 or 4 days and alternating. I did this exact schedule at my last 2 jobs and have NO interest in doing this again. Obviously we all had objections to this. We were given less than 2 weeks notice that our jobs are no longer day shift, and for no additional pay.

Need advice.,u/StOcrates,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bnjeya/urgent_harrassed_at_work_idaho_and_hr_suggested_i/,antiwork,"This might be a long one, but it's urgent and I really need advice. I (27, n/b) work as a full-time custodian at a major institution in Idaho.  
I started this job in November of 2023 and immediately established a friendly rapport with my boss (I'll call him CJ hereafter). I got glowing reviews at my initial evaluations and there was near-immediate talk of promotion based on my performance (which never happened). CJ spent a lot of time training me and would go out of his way to chat with me and make me feel extra welcome.  
We had some mutual friends and would often talk about planning a big group hangout (which never happened). I felt that our chats and at-work hangouts were a little outside of professional limits but I was willing to blur those lines seeing as we shared a social circle and would likely have become friends regardless.  
Throughout December and January, I was going through a very dark time personally (lonely in a new town, in a depressive episode, and in the process of breaking up with the partner I had moved here with). I felt like CJ was one of the only people who was really there for me. During this period he’d come by my post to chat often and I’d stay late sometimes to chat after work. He entrusted me with workplace gossip which made me feel like I was part of the “in” crowd. I had been dealing with some harassment by a student at the time and he was a solid support in switching my postings and helping me feel safe, but also started to make comments like “I guess this is just the reality of being a pretty girl.”\* I brushed it off as benign/clumsy, not believing it could be a come-on because I knew he was in a relationship and most importantly was my boss.  
\*I want to note here that I’m nonbinary and my pronouns are they/them. This was made clear in my resume, professional references, and throughout the interview process, as well as a few times in person at work. A coworker also told me recently that he elected to share my deadname with her, unprompted.  
CJ’s behavior towards me started escalating beyond friendliness almost immediately after I “officially” became single in early February. I’m ashamed to admit I was flattered by the attention but still did not feel it was appropriate and didn’t know how to react, for fear of potential retaliation, drama within our social circles, that I was just making it up in my head anyway, etc. He started breaking the physical touch barrier in small ways (i.e. friendly fake-punch to the shoulder, fist bump, handshake that held on for half a second too long) and at one point picked me up and threw me into a pile of laundry (I consented to this but felt bad about it afterward).  
One Friday, I stayed late after work with him, and he came out with his “crush” on me, saying things like: ""*I’ve never let myself get so far with a crush (while in a relationship)."" ""You would’ve been my ideal lady ten years ago."" ""I like your leg hair, you’re like a mountain woman."" ""I’ve thought maybe I’d just introduce you (to his partner) as a friend and see how it goes..."" ""I’ve thought maybe we should just get an apartment together."" ""When you were out sick Thursday (I went to urgent care for a crisis-level depressive episode) I just wanted to hold you.""* and *""Anybody who says people who cheat are bad people, I don’t want to hear it.""*  
I didn’t know how to react but made it clear more than once that I was not looking to get into a relationship with him. The consensus was that we would continue talking about it in the context of maintaining professionalism (which has not happened). It feels important to mention that I also got back together with my partner around this time, and I get the sense that my no longer being “available” to CJ in the way he appeared to want has impacted his treatment of me.  
The following week, I felt like he was alternately ignoring me or paying me too much attention. The following Friday, he invited me to an upcoming concert and I expressed apprehension about going with him (due to all of the circumstances), but was interested in the concert itself and planned to attend with my partner. That same night he asked if I’d stay late to hang out with him again and I said ""no"" and went home.  
Ever since then, his behavior has been unpredictable. He hasn’t made it possible for me to get a word in about what happened when he confessed his crust to me and said all of those charged things. I had a strange evaluation with him during which he didn’t make room for me to speak (I had planned to bring up the dynamics I felt were problematic), but he cut the meeting to under five minutes total, and sent me home immediately afterward (I started a new medication yesterday and kept getting sick at work due to side effects; he had told me initially to stick it out so I didn’t have to use my already low absence balance; a different coworker caught wind of me not being able to do my job very well on account of the uncontrollable puking and reported it to him).   
Also during that evaluation, I mentioned the upcoming concert, which I had budgeted my vacation and comp hours accordingly for, and he scoffed and said “I don’t think you’re making it to that.”

I went to HR, and brought up all of these concerns. I spent over an hour talking to HR, and the person that I spoke with suggested that I not come into work, when I said that I didn't feel safe (for fear of retaliation and escalation), she suggested I quit and assured me that I don't have to put in notice.

Honestly, the dynamic is so toxic that I don't feel safe and have a panic attack just thinking about going in. I am also concerned about the ongoing baseline of transphobia and the feeling that he never really had my back for all those months, he just was setting me up to take whatever he might have wanted from me.

I haven't been to work since (that was Wed, Thu, Friday), but I'm scheduled to work tonight and don't want to come in, yet I'm not sure how to quit, or if officially quitting is the right move.

He gets weekly allergy injections, because his allergies/asthma are debilitating and our insurance just recently started to cover them. 

Unfortunately, the allergy place opens after he would have to leave in the a.m. and closes before he gets home. Would requesting to leave an hour early/start an hour late one day a week to get the shot be covered under the ADA? It would be once a week until he gets on the maintenance dose then it would go to once a month. He's already more than halfway to the maintenance dose so it will be only a few months of weekly appointments, and it can be any day of the week. It's a salaried job and he also gets 20 days PTO so he could even use that to cover the time. 

We also already checked for places he could get the shot that are closer to the job or one that has weekend hours and there aren't any. It would really suck if he had to stop the treatment because he's been living with a stuffed up nose and 50% lung capacity his whole adult life due to the allergies. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to approach the subject with the new employer?"
1,2024-03-25,Do I just quit to ensure UE Benefits?,u/Due_Welcome_8802,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bnlwrm/do_i_just_quit_to_ensure_ue_benefits/,antiwork,"Got hired in December by a Canadian company for a role in CA. It's a startup so I figured there would be growing pains... but..

Their employment contract stated any after-hours work needed would be communicated in reasonable advanced notice, it also stated I would be paid bi-monthly on dates specified in advance by the employer. The two main issues i have surround these two points. 

Right from the start, I have been required to be ""on-call"" 24/7 for customer support, and though I have been encouraged to hire employees to help relieve my duties during the night, I would still have to be on call for the dispatching itself. It truly is all hours of the night I'm being tagged and flagged. Not to mention, once I had hired a single employee, provided them a schedule and work hours, their timesheet was stated to be ""audited"" by the financing team, which delayed his pay by several days. No changes were made to the actual hours worked or the pay granted. This happened again on the 2nd pay period, and again pay was delayed around 3 days. The company stated that as he's a contract worker, they withhold the right to review their pay and provide it between 5 and 10 days from endo of pay period. CA law states they must pay by a specified date, regardless. 

Now onto the bigger issue: my pay. For the first 35 days I worked here, I did not recieve any pay, nor any response to my inquiries about the outstanding funds or a timeline/correction being put in place. I emailed the accountant, the ceo, the finance manager. Finally I was paid on day 35. It was done moments after my 5th email was sent, like it was a simple flick of a switch. Nothing was done by the company to rectify or compensate for inconvenience, whatever. The pay was for my first 2 weeks. I then had to request I be paid for the additional 2 weeks that were delayed, which they obliged. I was then told I would have to wait another 25 days for the next paycheck. it would by then be my 8th week of work, being paid for my 5th and 6th. I requested they pay me a prorated sum so that I could ""catch up"" to current billing period, they obliged about 5 days later. Since then my pay has come in the following increments: 16 days, 11 day, 18 days, 14 days. There's zero pattern, it's not predictable. 

A few other points... their business model is one I don't morally agree with, and didn't realize this until I started. Without providing too much background on it, essentially our product offers people a ""service"" to use while they work for a rideshare, but really it's just the ability to work for less than minimum wage, because of the cost of our service. It's predatory and traps people with hidden fees and payment plans.

 Additionally, I am being criticized for my inability to keep my employee ""in check"", as after 2 weeks in a row of not being paid on time and not believing I was reaching out repeatedly to the accounting team (I was) my employee went around me and messaged the ceo about his check. It did seem to work as the moment he contacted the ceo, he was paid and the ceo was coming down on me for his wasted time. I forwarded him the several messages to his team that went ignored, and he told me I need to urge patience with my employees, and that they and I were being unprofessional. 

Lastly, the CEO candidly shared with me that because this is a Canadian company, they had never offered health insurance to US employees before. He noted to me the rules state you have to offer a plan, thats it, so he went with the most expensive plan available and is covering 50% of the costs (natl average is 83%) in order to determine his employees from going with their provided plan and instead cover themselves. It took them 4 months after hiring the first US employees to even offer this purposely terrible plan.

Frankly all of this just makes me sick. I don't think I have enough of a case for this to be worth going to the CA board of labor, but I also don't want to work another day for this predator. I worry they will try to fire me for some bs reason and try to avoid paying unemployment if I try to bring up pay again or mention I'm going to a lawyer or the labor board. I feel like if I quit I have a better case for unemployment as they failed to pay me in accordance with CA law.

TL,DR: My question is, should I be continuing to work for a company that A.) Is requiring me to be on-call outside the agreed upon working hours with no increase in salary and B.) Cannot seem to pay me or the employees I hire on time?

I know how to do more than half the jobs in the plant.  Even though I only have one job in particular, I'm always willing to go to any other job/run any other machine that I know how to.  I make my quota every single day outside of when there is mechanical issues.  I've never gotten into an argument with my foreman, I've never gotten into an argument with other coworkers, I help out my coworkers every chance I get even when it doesn't benefit me.  

Until a year ago, once you hit the top pay step at the company, all you received was a meager cost of living raise per year (usually 2-2.5%).  

The company has now decided there will be NO cost of living raises going forward.  Every individual employee will be evaluated based on their performance, and they will get a yearly raise between 0 and 5%.  


My raise was 0.5%.  That comes out to 14 cents an hour.  That's $291 a year before taxes.  

My foreman's reasoning was because I don't volunteer for enough overtime, and because I was written up last year for calling out more than the 2% per hours worked we're allowed to once we've used up our sick time.  

So, I'm absolutely done.  I'm over it.  Quiet quitting time.  I do my job only.  I run my machine only.  No more trouble shooting my machine to get it back up and running quickly to meet my quota.  If I have the smallest issue, I'm calling for a mechanic and sitting my ass down.  Helping out my coworkers when I'm not required?  No more.  I know it's not their fault, but fuck it.  I'm not going above and beyond anymore.  


And before someone says ""look for another job"", trust me I have.  This is the highest paying job by around $5 an hour I'm qualified for within 50 miles.  I've been here 12 years so I have five weeks a year of vacation time.  And this company still offers a pension.  


Look....I know I probably have it better than a lot of people on this sub, but I just had to vent about this.  A 0.5% raise from a company that has a Mkt cap of 6 billion dollars is a fucking joke."

1. He’s not my direct boss but he always tries to get me working on “ projects” with him and going around my boss’s back.

2. He randomly starts to copy the way my boss interacts with me. For instance, my boss calls me Kass instead of my full name. One day, he started calling me Kass out of nowhere too.

3. Make subtle comments of how I interact with him versus how I interact with other male employee

4. Sending me “ work” email at late night then tell me next day that they are actually not urgent

5. Will come to my desk to initiate talk with me everyday

So... I was told there was no money and the role no longer exists, at end of 2023. So why is there someone on LinkedIn with my former job title who started in 2024?

I'd like to ask management this. I can only assume she is being paid peanuts.

This why I will never be loyal to companies. Btw this was one of those small 'we're all family here' companies - my family (for all their faults) would never treat me this way."

in the past if they were raising the starting wage they'd call it a cost of living adjustment and bump everyone up to the same base pay. 

I guess this time they wanted to buy themselves some good will so they stayed silent about raising the starting pay and gave a few of us a very token increase. 15 cent an hour is 300 a year. before tax.

I’m a 28 year old female. I have had chronic illnesses all my life but 2 years ago I became completely bed ridden. 

On my path to recovery I ate up a lot of my spare money and whatever I had left because I couldn’t work. Couldn’t get on disability. I was in physical therapy.  I couldn’t drive, I couldn’t walk down the hallway. I was miserable. 

2 years later I am better now but I get exhausted very easily. I do apps like door dash and Grubhub.. they are fine but I’m so far behind in life. I don’t feel secure. I feel like I’m struggling financially. 

I do apps because I can just stop working after a certain amount of time. I feel like I can work in a physical place for maybe a max 25ish - 30 ish hours a week sometimes just 20 because of how tired I can get. However I’ve tried applying to multiple places and all of the “part time” jobs are actually 40 hours with full availability throughout the week. 

Please give me advice. I want to finally live and have money to live.  Work sucks I know :(("

Following week he asks me about a job for his girlfriends family. My dad and I don't have a car and I only have a bike with one working pedal. Job is 1 hr bike ride each way minimum. 

Ended up being painting. I painted basically all of his girlfriends family home over a few days. Him and his ""business"" partner told me we were getting paid after the job was done. Parents confirmed. Day before we were getting paid I told them I really needed some money for food. They only had $18 on them and gave it to me. 

Went back the next day and no one was home. Very strange. He hadn't texted me in the morning or anything and when I rode all the way there, nothing. Next day, no response and I rode to the house. The girlfriends elderly parents were sitting outside. I told them what was going on and they were shocked. They said they had paid the full money to this guy yesterday. 

I knew this guy had a problem with drugs in the past and he was apparently not using anymore. A week later I was riding my bike home from the store for my dad. I saw this guys girlfriends friend. She asked me if I was still working with this guy. Of course I said hell no, he never paid me. She was super sorry for me and then told me the guy and the business partner were doing drugs again. So I ended up riding my shit bike all this way for days to paint all day long for nothing. I'm so upset and don't know what to do.

TLDR: Specialized positions in UPS (such as IT professionals and administrative workers) Louisville KY, have successfully negotiated a contract with UPS and joined the Teamsters. This new agreement is paving the way for NON union UPS workers to join the union 🎉🎉.

https://teamster.org/2024/03/ups-administrative-and-specialist-workers-ratify-contract-join-teamsters-national-master-agreement/

At this point, most people are well aware of the recent contract ratification between UPS and the Teamsters. However, I haven't seen much coverage of this most recent victory for workers at UPS.

As a fellow non union worker for UPS, I am absolutely celebrating right now. My team and I have become increasingly disgruntled with upper management but have felt helpless to do anything about it and have desperately wanted to join the union. This contract negotiation will help pathe the way for more people to be able to join the fight against corporate greed. 

It's very interesting seeing how hush hush UPS is trying to be about this contract, I firmly believe they know they have a kettle that's about to boil over and if word gets out this was a success, it may push others to do the same.

IF you are a non union member working for UPS and want to join the fight, there is a form on the Teamsters webpage for you to sign up specifically FOR upsers. "

The absolute worst part is that you have to put so much effort and time into a job and for what? So you can afford to exist. Literally that’s it.

1,2024-03-25,3 money glitches for sale ,u/Flacotheglitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bnximo/3_money_glitches_for_sale/,antiwork,"As a disclaimer these glitches are for research purposes only I do not condone or encourage illegal activity

Glitch 1- Sportbetting/Parlay glitch ($50)

This is a style of what’s known as arbitrage betting https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage_betting 

But I’ve taken it a step further and applied to to PARLAYS. 

Long story short you bet every single possible outcome of the sport that you are betting on and still make money. 

Example: On a given parlay ticket there may be 120 possible outcomes you bet all 120 outcomes on $2 bets which costs $240

The ticket that wins pays 200 to 1. So it’s a $2 ticket that’s $400 from $240

Glitch 2: I phone glitch. ($20)

 This is a link to getting the newest iPhone out but it is a fake iPhone. It comes with the perfect box, perfect paperwork everything. But it is running a ghosted version of android disguised as an iPhone. You can put your SIM card in and make a call and a lot of the times that’s where the money start getting counted out. 

No you can’t FaceTime but you can log into the Apple ID on the phone and the home screen and everything in the setting and most of the phone is perfectly matched with iPhone to sell. The phone costs about $100 with shipping like 130

Glitch 3- Coupon Glitch ($50)

I can show you in a ten step process how to write barcodes and make a coupon that works and scans for any item with a UPC barcode. Using this website 
 https://barcode.tec-it.com/en

All you will need is the UPC number of the item you want to make a coupon for.

You can either scan the barcode right off your phone from this website, 

Or you can dress the coupon up properly  and print it out and use it that way. 

The coupons work at self checkout and you can make the item free or you can make the item any amount off you want. "

The person in charge seems to have no problem emailing or reaching out at night, and the vibe is that he wants us to drop everything to work on this. Well, something happened out of our control, which resulted in my coworker working past 2 am and actually logging back in a few hours earlier around 8 am. He did log off earlier in the afternoon but it still didn’t totally make up for the amount of hours they put in (about 8-9 extra hours)

It sucks because lately, I’ve been working overtime and I’ve been trying to be better about only working from 9-5 since I’m only paid for that time (salaried employee.) However, now I feel even more pressure since my coworker worked so late and I don’t want to come off as a slacker. 

I’m so tired of the work culture feeling like I have to devote my life to this job.

I’m tired of crying before work. I’m fucking done and I cannot do 2 weeks longer with no support. I already have suicidal thoughts. This is no way to live.

195,2024-03-26,Management betrayed my coworker who saved their business,u/Achrias,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bnyw89/management_betrayed_my_coworker_who_saved_their/,antiwork,"I work for a small company that broke up into two companies that work side by side on projects in the same office space in NYC. We are basically one company but on paper, two.
My coworker who works for the small sister company told me about how he has been with the company for two years and had to basically run the operation alone after the man who essentially did everyone's jobs at once left. My jaw dropped when he told me they're paying him 40k a year for this. I just started and got offered 40k which I negotiated up to 45k (still far below NYC standards especially given my experience). He explained that he was gearing up to ask for a raise and I gave him some advice to help. Reference industry standards, show receipts of the work you've done and how you have many new responsibilities, etc etc.

The worst part is that his boss just hired a new guy who is making > $70k and is being TRAINED BY HIM so we figured an adequate raise should be pretty straightforward all things considered.

The boss cut him off mid sentence right as he began making his case and ensured him ""you are not [job title] like you keep saying you are. I may have put it in your email footer but that doesn't mean you're actually a [job title] and its too late to change it without confusing clients."" The coworker pushed back a bit claiming a role and its compensation should be based on responsibilities, not title to which the boss then offered him the extremely insulting salary of $44k.

How do bosses become so incredibly disconnected from staff, especially in a company of < 10 people? If I had to train a fresh hire making double my pay for the same job I would quit on the spot. He wants to move to my company but it's probably best he jump ship altogether in my opinion. Thoughts?"
2,2024-03-26,"A quick story: sales, product management, unemployment and back again. ",u/jopesak,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bnzuhi/a_quick_story_sales_product_management/,antiwork,"Ok, it’s actually not that quick, but I feel like I need to write this down therapeutically with some like- minded people. Hopefully it’s … something: 

Two years ago I was working a dead end sales job for a well-known parcel service you know. Decent company but culturally lost in the 70’s. I can’t tell you how many times managers would do the “and all you guys… uh .. I mean AND GALS! Gotta make sure you say that now!” On a call.  My salary was getting a 1% raise per year. My territory was stagnant and I openly admitted “I don’t have enough work” and kept getting told “don’t say that! They’ll just give you more or fire you HAHAHAHA!” 

But I kept saying it because I wanted to be in marketing and was hoping some software customer experience data I was going on the side (for free, without asking) was going to get me there. I thought that being honest might give me an edge and back up some perspective I had that the territories could be combined.

  I had already worked there as a Sales Data analyst and already knew that the performance reviews were pre-determined to be a bell curve around a 3/5 with no 4/5 let alone 5/5 and the feedback was always “be in front of customers more. Sell more software than shipping.” 

This sales approach was simply inaccurate and didn’t work with real customers. Shipping is seen as a commodity and since this company wasn’t tech savvy, they were just trying to seem current without actually having a competitive product to back it. Commissions were meek and no one was taking in a lot of money. The job security was great but the pressure to sell something that wasn’t there was getting so tiring. The meetings were all the same. The moral sucked and many people were second income earners in their house (I live in the US, this is kinda rare) and just didn’t fight back on any of the metrics and how they were determined. 

I got fed up and started looking for a new career path. Product Manager seemed like a good fit with my resume so I redid it and started applying …. For a year with no replies at all. COVD hits and everything just gets worse . It’s time to go. 

I don’t have a background in tech, but I have a lot in voice of customer and some in data analytics. I needed a change. I figured maybe I was just jaded by an ancient company and I needed something I could sink my teeth into and be a part of . 

Fast forward to my new neighbors moving in and I suddenly have a lead and a reference for a PM position. I get the job because of my unique background. Get told it’s remote now and will turn to hybrid eventually. I live 10 minutes from the office. Couldn’t be better. 

About 6 months into the job, I am realizing that all of the other teams had been working together for years and this new recurring revenue software project I was brand new and I was the only person dedicated to getting it done. It involved some heavier tech understanding between RFID tag scanners and database software. The main issue being that our “mainframe” data base was going to be switching to Azure so it was impossible to put a timeline on anything with that on the constant horizon. 

I try to be a person who doesn’t make excuses. So I sucked it up, did the good corporate boy schtick and took responsibility for the project not moving. I said that we needed more software development support and without it, there could be no milestones. My director (boss) had just had his third child and was working from home most of the time. Our software team was in Germany and when I was in the office I was alone. I started feeling really depressed about how this was all turning out and bought into the current culture idea of “it’s ok not to be ok”, “bring your true self to work ”, “quiet quitting” , “maintain WFH status, without apology” and “take risks with extra responsibility.” 

Well I got fired.  My work ethic had declined and I made the mistake of making a presentation on what needed to happen to get this actually done instead of buzzwords, the managing directors turned it back to buzzwords, said we need a timeline for this and gave me feedback that it sounded like I didn’t know what I was talking about. Which I really didn’t and said that loudly for all to hear, asking for support and having a solid product vision backed with statistics and a need to get to market quickly. 

After I was put on a PIP and then having a couple of very awkward performance TEAMS calls while my boss was at home 15 minutes away (I support him being home for his newborn kid, I just think you should be in the office if part of the PIP is for your subordinate not being in the office enough, when in writing it wasn’t stated and when I got hired it was said to be hybrid with no expectations). Then he got COVD, my PIP was extended a month and then I got fired. 

So now I get on unemployment for a grueling 5 months when I dumbly realize that in my state it is only for 6 month, and thank my lucky stars a printer company calls me for a sales job and I have no choice but to take it or I am gonna lose my house. 

I end up getting very lucky with a boss I really like (opposite politics, but he really cares about his people and helps like a manager should. Hot take: he is a millennial manager and slightly younger than me. I am very happy about the vibe). The commission is real and the training is actually good. I am feeling pretty solid. 

 At first it’s hard to shake off the lack of a fuck I give about corporate America right now and how my business degree was supposed to start a small shop but that’s impossible for me with the investment needed and I am so fed up with the constant corporate speak and never ending, calculated unachievable metrics and pointless desire for never ending growth at every other company.

 I have finally accepted that I am no longer in support of American capitalism. It’s a big fucking lie for shareholders and all management wants is to hit their metrics no matter how silly they are so directors can brag on calls and play dicky slapped with their corporate pals and everyone talks is this bizarre code fake numbers and fake smiles. This feels like it’s getting to an all time low and I need to accept the seriousness that living comfortably is only going to get harder and if I want a kid and for them to go to post high school and retire I need like $1.5M . 

Well while this is all going well and I am just getting out of my rut, I get hit up from a recruiter for another PM job. I drop my resume because a PM3 roll would look like a good progress story. The base pay is higher but my sales are looking great for this year. I just know I would be back in office and right now I got a great thing going with my wife and dog being with me. It would also be a whole new culture and having to roll the dice on a one year job. 

Of course I know nothing unless I get interviewed, but it really got me thinking about just how fucking stupid this all is. 

So I am going to go play another silly question game where we are both lying about what we want. I have no idea if I am going to actually be qualified in the first six months and I have my whole life riding on it working, because unemployment is cumulative and I haven’t been working long enough to earn another 6 months of unemployment . So if this went bad again, I lose my house if I can’t get hired in 2 months  and last time took 5 and I applied every day and had to take a massive salary cut. 

And we do all of this to play a silly kids game where we use made up words and incorrect numbers to describe metrics that don’t benefit us if they go up or down. We get punished if they go down , maybe a small upside for phenomenal performance. 

Shareholders get all the spoils and if someone who built a bad product pathway thinks I don’t come in enough I lose my house with no safety net after paying 1/4 of my income. 

I get that my taxes aren’t totally wasted, but then I got hit for $3k in UNEMPLOYMENT TAXES owed . So I am paying taxes because I should be grateful that the states employees pay for me to apply to jobs? And I should feel grateful that I even got hired when I don’t think there was much of a reason to get fired . 

I don’t know if there is much of a point in this except to say that I truly don’t give a fuck about work anymore and want to just tighten down spending and work a job I like a little. I just want a life where I work to get what I need and then forget about it, but with costs going nuts it feels like corporate America has such a choke hold on us that you don’t have a choice but to fake a smile talk in lies and play the dumb game with them. 

What do you guys AND GALS think?"

1,2024-03-26,Can I get unemployment?,u/GasBread,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bnzyny/can_i_get_unemployment/,antiwork,"TL;DR: dad boss mean, how I file and feel okay?

Hey! I’m in a crisis and I need advice. I’ve been working at a warehouse job for the last 5 years and in that time the work relationship with my manager has gone from okay to terrible. 

Back in July, before he had a huge 2 week vacation in the middle of our busiest season, a coworker and I went to his office at the end of the day to voice our concerns for the next few weeks, we were in a staffing crisis in all departments this manager runs. After a while of our concerns, it got a bit escalated and my manager slammed his hand on his desk hard enough to shake his monitors and walls, he then pointed at both my coworker and I and said “fuck you” I left promptly and that has never been brought up since. 

Since that incident, my manager makes our meetings happen with another higher up like a mediator every time, and in December after months of silence, my fellow coworkers and myself were asked up to the office and asked to share how we think things are going, this was big for us, we all wanted a raise. (After a year of our previous raise not being met, they “forgot” it was discovered during this meeting.)
I asked why the three of us, who show up each day since before Covid, throughout their staffing problems each year and throughout this bud light thing not allowing us a Christmas bonus, couldn’t just get capped at the max we could get. 

My managers response was because “we sit out back all day getting stoned.” Which. No dude. But also, previously and prior that was called by this guy a perk of the job. Both before and after this meeting, despite how much grief we got for weed, this manager flaunts to us on the floor that he is hitting the pen all day and popping thc mints. So from our perspective, this manager condones weed until he can use it to get us three into trouble, which happens three more times after this meeting. 

Bringing us to Monday, they again brought us in to voice concerns going into the summer months, again the exact same staffing and other work related concerns that were not fixed previously, were voiced. However today I was nervous, the owner of the company sat in. So I fumbled my words a bit and wasn’t quite articulating a point I had,
 this manager stops me mid sentence to ask if I had been drinking. In front of everyone. 

The manager is my dad. And for years I accepted the way I was spoken to and treated at work because of that. And it’s something he himself admitted that he is harder on me than others so it doesn’t look like nepotism, but he uses my personal life against me at work, and he is mean about it. 
it feels retaliatory any time I criticize anything he does that doesn’t work as a manager. 


At that point on Monday I decided this would be the end of my employment, I stared at the company logo for a long time. I gotta get out. But I need to know if I can get unemployment for all this, I really want to find something worthwhile for me and not just jump into another job. 
Another thing, despite my dad being a mega douche I don’t want him to read my unemployment application and both reject it and take it personal, rifting our already rocky relationship. 

There’s mountains more examples like these as well, these are just recent highlights, but I can’t accept this for myself anymore. Forget toxic, an abusive work environment. What do I do?

Started earlier this month and there's been absolutely no time set aside for proper induction. I was thrown into the deep end, shown the client folders, and left to fend for myself in a company of just eight people in public affairs.

But what really gets to me is the glorification of being busy. Everyone here talks about how swamped they are, wearing their overwork like a badge of honor. They brag about working evenings, early mornings, and weekends like it's something to be proud of. I came in on Monday to 15 emails sent on Sunday! Seriously, is that the kind of work-life balance we should be striving for?

And to make matters worse, there's this toxic attitude towards anyone who dares to stick to their contracted hours. The Gen Z junior gets flak for actually having a life outside of work and not constantly working unpaid overtime. Why is it seen as a bad thing to value your time and set boundaries?

I'm starting to wonder if I should cut my losses and look for a new job ASAP. It's only been nine days, but my gut is telling me that this isn't the kind of environment I want to be in long-term. Maybe I'll just chalk it up as a career break while I collect my paycheck before my mental health completely deteriorates.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Should I trust my instincts and start job hunting, or am I overreacting? Appreciate any advice or words of wisdom. Thanks for letting me rant."

Let me start off by saying I AM NOT trying to brag or anything like that. I just want someone to see that there is a sliver of hope in finding a good work environment. 

I just started in a factory that wraps and paints metal sheets for buildings. I am employed through a temp agency. 

Last week I had to take work of starting on Monday for the induction of my wife. We had our son on Friday. 
(Sad warning)

We found out 2 hours after he was born that he is going to need heart surgery and he was transfered to Riley... I do not want to make this post about my son though. He is doing really well and the surgery has a 98% success rate. (Diagnised TGA)

Anyway I was supposed to be back in the following Monday. I called HR at my workplace and explained everything to them. Even though they are short staffed and in need of people, they gave me all this week off no questioned asked and even said they will pray for us. Now, unless I'm needed at the hospital for my family, I'm actually wanting to go back to work. Good people there. 

Just wanting to say it is possible to find a work place where they do care about what you're going through. Gives me hope. "

• I’m 27, a relatively new grad who did 4 years of undergrad and 2 years of graduate school to work my current job. I’ve been working full time now for almost a year. I worked part time jobs before and during college but this is my first “real” full time job.
• Compared to other people I feel that I have it relatively good — My hours are 6:30-3, I have an hour for lunch, no weekends or on call, never have to stay late, and usually have 1-2 hours of downtime during an average workday.
• I work in medicine so the “work doesn’t matter” stance doesn’t really apply in my situation. I feel that I contribute to the greater good of society and help people to some degree.

Despite these points, I absolutely hate working. I don’t particularly dislike my job. I don’t love it, but I think it’s just because I don’t like working in general.  I think I’m the type of person that doesn’t have a “dream job,” and I would be unhappy working ANY job full time regardless of how fulfilling it was.

I always feel exhausted and I struggle to do anything productive/ anything I enjoy outside of work, and it feels like a vicious cycle. I’ve struggled with depression/anxiety my whole life and it feels like all of my time off is spent trying to relax and recover from work.

How do I alleviate this problem? Any advice is appreciated. Thank you."

So I’m pretty sure I work at one of the worst places in the world. I’ve worked at a decent amount of places and this has been the WORST by FAR. It’s a nursing home if that says it all for y’all or not. 

So bottom line — my workplace is so toxic and abusive (towards staff and residents) that it is not even funny. I mentally, emotionally and physically cannot take anymore. I am way past my breaking point with this place and everyone in it. 

I turned in my two weeks notice and I have 2 more nights left (Wednesday/Friday night). However, I am debating on whether I should even come back for my next shift or not. Everyone I have talked to and that knows everything I am being put through has basically said I need to walk. 

Here is my issue. My heart is telling me that I need to spare myself any further headache and walk out. My brain is telling me to stick it out and that I am almost done. They in my opinion don’t deserve the respect of a 2 weeks notice if they can’t show me an ounce of respect in return. 

The ONLY thing I worry about if I do not fulfill my entire notice is any future employer calling them for a reference. Legally I know they can only give limited info but if they ask if I am eligible for rehire and they say no — pretty much an automatic red flag. Will they even ask? Who knows. I am scared to take that risk. 

For anyone also wondering or who may ask, I can’t really just leave it off of my resume unless I want to try to explain an 8 month gap.

I could go on.

I was nervous to bring this to my manager but the only way I will get promoted is if I advocate for myself. I told him what I’ve been doing and how well I’ve been performing and he said 

“I agree. You actually should be extremely proud of how far you’ve come. I actually use you as example of growth and success when that comes up with new hires.” Like damn, you didn’t have to make me cry though 🥲

It’s very nice to work for a company that sees your success and growth and agrees that you’re dependable enough to move up. 

I did also suggest moving to a new department and there was a brief moment of panic in my managers eyes as he was like “well there’s going to be so many great things in the future that we would love to have you part of”

As long as you pay me more, I’m in.

my reply was that i was on phone. reasonable for me to focus on call and then next customer and people just need to look at the light that is connected to my phone, it tells people when i’m busy. 
management placed blame on me still. 

so now i don’t call customers. i sit and wait for people to come to my desk all day. i only do one thing at a time. maybe towards end of day i will respond to 5-10 messages, maybe. 
let the messages and complaints pile up.  "

Below is a ***draft***  for a Ballot Measure for increased Paid Parental Leave in California.  In order for me to submit the ballot measure, I need to put up  $2,000, and if the measure doesn't pass within two years of submission, I  will lose the  $2,000. So,  I need to be sure it will pass before I  submit it. I  am looking for any kind of feedback, but most importantly,  if people generally support this.

I will post this in [r/California](https://www.reddit.com/r/California/), but I wanted to post here before.

**California Paid Parental Leave Act**

Assembly Bill No. \[New Number\]CHAPTER \[New Number\]

An act to amend Sections \[relevant sections\] of the Government Code, relating to employment and parental leave.

\[Approval and Filing Dates\]

LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST

AB  \[New Number\], \[Author\]. California Paid Parental Leave Act:  Comprehensive Family Leave Policy for Parents, Domestic Partners, and  Legal Guardians.

Building on the  California Family Rights Act, this bill introduces enhanced parental  leave provisions, drawing inspiration from Sweden's model. It extends  rights to domestic partners and legal guardians, reflecting California's  commitment to inclusive family policies.

Bill Text

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1 of the Government Code is amended to read:

(a)  It shall be an employment right for any parent, domestic partner, or  legal guardian employed in the State of California, who meets specified  eligibility criteria, to take parental leave for the purpose of child  care. This includes leave in connection with pregnancy, maternity,  paternity, adoption, and legal guardianship.

(b)  For purposes of this section: (1) “Parental Leave” includes leave taken  by a parent, domestic partner, or legal guardian following the birth,  adoption, or legal guardianship of a child, providing the opportunity to  be completely free from work for child care. This includes: (A) A  continuous period of at least seven weeks before the expected date of  birth and seven weeks after birth or adoption. (B) Leave until the child  is 18 months old. (C) An option to reduce working hours up to  one-quarter until the child’s eighth birthday.

(2) “Eligibility” is based on the individual's employment status and the child's residence.

(c)  Application and Notification Procedures: (1) Employees must notify  their employer at least two months before commencing parental leave. (2)  The Department of \[appropriate department\] will outline the application  process for parental leave and benefits, including online application  facilities.

(d) Parental Benefit:  (1) Eligible employees, domestic partners, or legal guardians can  receive parental benefits for up to 480 days per child, with specific  days reserved for each caretaker and options to transfer days, barring a  non-transferable portion. (2) Benefits are based on income, with a  minimum level of support for part of the leave period.

(e)  Additional Provisions: (1) Employers are encouraged to provide  supplementary parental payments in addition to state-provided benefits.  (2) Special regulations for cross-border workers and those employed in  multiple states.

(f) Parental  Benefit Payment Policy: (1) Benefit Eligibility: Parental benefits are  available to parents, domestic partners, or legal guardians who are  covered by social insurance in California and if the child resides in  California, or lives within the United States or in countries with  reciprocal agreements.

(2)  Duration and Allocation of Benefits: (A) Parental benefits are provided  for 480 days for each child. In the case of twins or multiple births,  additional days are allocated. (B) Benefits are shared equally between  parents or guardians, with each receiving 240 days. In cases of sole  custody, the custodial parent or guardian is entitled to the full 480  days. (C) Non-transferable Days: Out of the 240 days allocated to each  parent or guardian, 90 days are reserved for each individual and cannot  be transferred to the other parent or guardian. Single parents or  guardians receive the entire 480 days.

(3)  Benefit Calculation: (A) For 390 of the 480 days, benefits are  calculated based on the parent’s or guardian's income prior to the  leave. This is to ensure that the benefit correlates with the loss of  income during the leave period. (B) For the remaining 90 days, benefits  are paid at a flat minimum rate.

(4)  Benefit Application Process: (A) Parents or guardians must register  their leave from work and then apply for parental benefits through the  designated state agency. (B) Applications should be submitted in  accordance with the agency's guidelines, with online application options  provided.

(5) Payment Schedule:  (A) Once an application is approved, benefits are paid monthly. (B)  Payments are made directly into the recipient’s bank account.

(6)  Supplementary Employer Benefits: (A) Employers are encouraged to  provide additional benefits to complement the state-provided parental  benefits. (B) Any supplementary benefits offered by employers should be  clearly communicated to employees.

(g)  Protection Against Employment Discrimination: (1) It shall be an  unlawful employment practice to discriminate against any employee for  taking parental leave as provided under this Act. (2) This includes  protection against refusal to hire, discharge, fine, suspension,  expulsion, or any other form of discrimination.

(h)  Maintenance of Health Benefits: (1) During parental leave, employers  are required to maintain and pay for coverage under the employee’s group  health plan for the duration of the leave, not to exceed the leave  entitlement under this Act. (2) If the employee fails to return from  leave for reasons other than health conditions or circumstances beyond  their control, the employer may recover the premiums paid.

(i)  Return to Work Guarantees: (1) On completion of parental leave,  employees are entitled to return to the same or a comparable position  with no loss of seniority or benefits. (2) This guarantee includes  preservation of employment status, pay, and any seniority-related  benefits such as vacation accrual.

(j)  Accommodation for Unforeseeable Leave Situations: (1) In cases of  unforeseeable events or emergencies related to parental  responsibilities, employees are entitled to request and take leave on  short notice. (2) Employers are required to accommodate such requests to  the extent reasonable without significantly disrupting operations.

(k)  Funding and Payment of Parental Leave: (1) State Responsibility: The  State of California shall be responsible for funding and disbursing  parental leave benefits. This includes the full duration of the leave  entitlement as specified in this Act.

(2)  Funding Sources: (A) The parental leave benefits shall be funded  through a designated state fund, which may include allocations from  general state revenues, specific taxation measures, or other funding  mechanisms as determined by the state legislature. (B) Employers are not  required to pay salaries to employees during the period of parental  leave. However, employers are required to provide continued benefits.

(3)  Disbursement of Benefits: (A) The designated state agency shall be  responsible for processing applications and disbursing parental leave  benefits. (B) Benefits are to be paid directly to eligible employees on a  monthly basis, consistent with the regular pay cycle of the employees.  (C) The state agency will establish and maintain a system for  application processing, benefit calculation, and disbursement, ensuring  timely and accurate delivery of benefits to eligible employees.

(4)  Employer Responsibilities: (A) Employers are responsible for  maintaining health benefits and other non-wage benefits for employees on  parental leave, as outlined in Section (h). (B) Employers must comply  with all reporting and documentation requirements set forth by the state  agency administering the parental leave benefits.

Fully remote. I live in the Midwest (USA) with medium cost of living making $180,000 a year PLUS around $30,000 in stock (not options, stock) every year. I work for a massive company (Fortune 100) where it's impossible to get fired, even if I were do to fuck all. They paid for my MBA outright. They respect my work and reward me financially. 

So why the hate? My work is bullshit. I push emails around, present, lead meetings, nothing special. My employees make 1/3 of what I make and I have to deliver 2% annual raises and shit bonuses every year to them. They CRY to me about making ends meet. I fight so fucking hard for them to get more money and finance shuts me down, but still has money to throw another 20, 30, 40k my way in bonuses. 

I'm at my wits end. I get everything and my team deserves everything. It's a broken corporate hierarchy and I'm just another cog in the money churning machine. I've tried to ask that my bonus be split amongst my team and my manager and finance refused. ""It doesn't work like that""

I let my manager know about my 6 days of PTO planned for the end of the year and he said that I would have to reschedule it because of a service launch we have scheduled for the end of the year. 

I don’t typically take off the end of the year anyway but this year I have a trip planned to go to Asia with some good friends. I feel like 9 months in advance is a good amount of time to give for them to plan for my absence. 

What should I do? I have a couple of ideas in mind.

A: Take short term disability since this job has wrecked my mental health since I began, but hold out as long as I can until December 

B: Take the PTO anyway and get (most likely) fired 

C: Find a new job internally and take the vacation 

D: Find a new job, quit my current job, and take the vacation anyway

She's a robot at work and does the work of two-three people, then she takes care of her family outside of work. She never does anything for herself. She has been a bit more snippy lately and says she's thinking about switching jobs, which I doubt, because she's been there for over a decade. She sucks up to those in charge like a proper manager. 

I think it could definitely be flavoring her behavior. Also she could be pissy because I'm not overworked yet like she is. She wants to give me more tasks to do, which is fair I guess but she acts like it's my fault I didn't ask for them when it was up to her to give them to me. She kinda wants to everything herself. I'm not a robot like her and will never be. But it's not fair to try to make me as miserable as she is. Sorry you have no life outside of work but I do. "

Plus the privilege of paying to park / an overpriced lunch / tolls ect - let alone the additional child care cost.

All so some CEO can say it’s great to see you “all together” and that improved performance is due to this, and not the easing of inflation but we need to be more green and cut more costs before swanning off on another “work” trip.

Along with a “random” background check and just now this week they asked for two references, one being personal and one being professional. I know references can be given before getting a job. It’s just weird to be asked for some now, two years into the job. Am I just overthinking or is this actually something abnormal?  

Also ironically if this were to be “random selection” I really should try out raffles then because the odds have to be abnormally in my favor.

The company didn't survive the COVID onslaught, and that industry took a major hit. Without delving too deeply into my professional or academic background to maintain anonymity, I hold a bachelor's degree and have hopped across various industries due to widespread layoffs since graduating until 2019. (I graduated uni just after The Great Recession).

Since 2019, aside from sporadic freelancing gigs and retail work to make ends meet, I've been struggling to secure a stable 9-to-5 job. The relentless cycle of job hunting, endless interviews, skill-refreshing classes, and juggling multiple side gigs has left me utterly drained.

Now, with a flood of new job seekers entering the market, brimming with energy and optimism, I find myself battling against a constant sense of hopelessness. My savings have been wiped out, forcing me to move back in with my parents away from the urban job market, where opportunities are scarce. It's a constant struggle to beg for hours (and pay) from retail jobs just to scrape by, and I'm reaching my breaking point.

The prospect of returning to a normal life feels as remote as winning the lottery.

I like my job. It's really not that bad. I'd rather not be there, but who wouldn't? I just don't see eye to eye with my current supervisor and it's making me super depressed. I feel micromanaged and not trusted, despite constantly having my work done. She even messages me on the weekends to make sure that any outstanding work will be done by Monday.

Will I be judged or potentially fired if I ask our director for a transfer or a change to another team within the company? I feel like I'm currently constantly treated like I'm an idiot. Like, I'm not a work all-star or try-hard. I have a life outside of work and I run my own business on the side. But, I'm well liked within the office and I fit in really well with the culture of my employer. Other supervisors within the company are people that I genuinely like enough to go out with some weekends. 

I don't know. I just wanted to say something on reddit because I don't want to make a whole thing of it in the office with my coworkers. I just want to quietly shift to a new team and have no one notice. I feel like that meme of squidward looking out at spongebob and patrick having fun outside."

I actually didn't even want to do this yet (purely because of the money), but my parents encouraged me to just hand in my notice tomorrow so here we are.

I work such shitty hours, mostly working on weekends & any holidays like Christmas or New Years or Easter that's coming up. Half my colleagues don't speak English which makes my job harder sometimes. There's also a bunch of drama amongst my colleagues and half of them are assholes.

I've had to pick up the slack so much recently due to sicknesses from other colleagues, and my job entails a lot of physical labour so it's been hard. But on top of that, I've also been working less hours as we're in a quiet season right now. I'm earing £300 less a month now than I was when I first started.

What hit the nail on the coffin was that I've had a vacation planned next month with my best friend who I haven't seen since 2022 and my boss said I couldn't go on it, even though I asked for it all the way back in November last year and she told me not to ask yet and to wait until March. Then when I asked she told me she had booked a vacation in the same week so now I can't go.

I'm anxious about tomorrow as I'm seeing my boss and I haven't seen her in a week, and the last time I saw her I told her I'm not coming in for the time I'm going on vacation and she wasn't happy.

8,2024-03-26,Does your employer expect you to just figure things out instead of training?,u/flavius_lacivious,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bogwyu/does_your_employer_expect_you_to_just_figure/,antiwork,"I am not talking about new hires although that is an issue as well. I suspect this is a widespread problem in the labor market.

Imagine signing on to your computer, and seeing two big buttons on your browser with a line that said, “IMPORTANT! Press the red button only if the new policy applies, otherwise press the blue one.” That’s it, that’s all you know and there is no one to ask what the hell is the new policy, what we are looking for, and everything you do gives you these two buttons and you can’t skip it.

I work for a global company on a small team in the US. Most of the workforce is in Eastern Europe, India or Asia — other side of the world. Asking questions beyond our immediate team requires waiting for a response from someone working in Poland, Delhi, or Beijing which means a 12-24 hour lag. 

It’s worse on the weekends. 

Every time there is a major change to the way we work, it is launched overnight and usually on Saturday evening by someone in Europe. No one in the US beta tests changes — these are launched and often we return to the previous incarnation because no one could foresee the problems the Americans uncover. Sometimes it’s a legal question.

There is no warning given, no explanation how to use the buttons which leads the 6 am team member asking if anyone knows what is going on and scrambling to find an answer.

The manager will eventually answer and admit they knew these buttons were coming but didn’t know when and they don’t really know. 

And all that in itself is bullshit. 

We generally get a two sentence explanation on Teams and that’s it. It’s not what the goal is, or why we are doing it (so you can draw your own conclusions or have some fucking context). 

The really bad thing is that any questions trying to clarify what is happening are often met with hostility as if you are challenging management on the change rather than seeking to understand what the fuck is going on. We weren’t in the meeting, we have no idea WHY we are doing this, or what the company is trying to accomplish. “Did we say you should push the blue button? No? Why are you asking?” I don’t know Hilda, maybe we are trying to fully grasp what we are doing.

There are basic and fundamental things about my job that I don’t know and don’t dare ask because the answer is invariably if I read their two sentence explanation on Teams.

Is this just my shitty employer or do other companies do this as well?"

I've wanted to quit for months but haven't been able to find another job. I still haven't found anything but after a recent issue it's made me just think I need to leave already.

I'm extremely lucky as I have a supportive boyfriend & family which makes it possible for me to be unemployed for a bit if I have to, which I likely will be. I actually didn't even want to do this quite yet, but my parents encouraged me to just hand in my notice tomorrow so here we are.

I work such shitty hours, mostly working on weekends & any holidays like Christmas or Easter that's coming up. Half my colleagues don't speak English which makes my job harder. There's also a bunch of drama amongst my colleagues and half of them are assholes.

I'm technically entitled to a (only) 20 minute break, but I don't even take it cuz I don't have time, so I don't eat a meal all day. I've had to pick up the slack so much recently due to illness from other colleagues, and my job is physical so it's been hard. But on top of that, I've also been working less hours as it's quiet right now. I'm earing £300 less a month now than I was when I first started.

What hit the nail on the coffin was that I have a vacation planned next month with my best friend who I haven't seen since 2022 and my boss said I couldn't go on it, even though I asked for it back in November last year, but she told me not to ask yet and to wait until March. Now when I asked she told me she has booked a vacation in the same week so I can't go.

I'm anxious about tomorrow as I'm seeing my boss and I haven't seen her in a week, and the last time I saw her I told her I'm not coming in for the time I'm going on vacation and she wasn't happy. I don't know how it's gonna go down and I'm anxious that this next week will be really awkward & uncomfortable."

The gentlemen asked me why I was leaving, and I said ""I need more growth in skills to earn more money."" He immediately took it personal and told me on the spot that I wasn't employed effective end of day.

So basically, he decided to empower himself power and make himself feel better by attempting to hurt me financially and forcing me to leave immediately.

I used to read books, to write. Cinema is my passion and i used to write little screenplays for fun. I used to play football (soccer) once in a while, and all sorts of things.

I'm also very lonely. Maybe I'd have more energy with a positive social life, but i can't figure out how to build one since i spend my whole day in that warehouse. I literally don't have a life and i don't have the energy or time to make one.

It’s basically $0.50/hour over the last five years. 

Since then, I’ve been emailing someone in Payroll about this issue, a woman who we’re calling Dana. I was getting a lot of emails from Dana saying “it’ll be available with one of these paychecks,” and when the money never was deposited, I would email her back and get another response saying “it’ll be available on this day,” and the cycle would repeat. 

At one point, I got a response saying “we’ve never had a payment of back pay go back this far,” and “we’ve got an entire Adobe worksheet detailing this.” One of the most surprising responses I got from Dana was that they didn’t have my paystubs from before January 2021. 

So in November 2023, I asked if there was anything I could do on my end, and I sent her my time entry information from early 2018 to the end of January 2020. It took half a day to screenshot every single page and then send it to Dana.

It’s now March 2024, and I’m starting to feel frustrated, and overall I’m just losing hope. I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if I just never got it.

17,2024-03-26,My husband received a test phishing email from his employer that advised him he qualified for debt relief,u/dannyjeanne,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bojhqb/my_husband_received_a_test_phishing_email_from/,antiwork,"Both my employer and my husband's send out the occasional phishing email. If you fall for it, you then have to complete a training on how to spot such emails. 

He received one yesterday that stated ""Due to your performance and your tenure with the company, you now qualify for student debt relief"" and then went on to give information on how to start the process.

He continued to read the email and then realized that it was definitely a phishing attempt. He clicked the appropriate button in Microsoft Outlook to report it. After clicking it, the email was immediately removed from his inbox, so he unfortunately wasn't able to take a screenshot of it. 

Later in the day, he received notice that he ""passed the test"" his employer gave. 

We are very fortunate that to have paid off the student debt about many years ago, but we were both disgusted that this is the email they decided to test their employees with.

It's one thing for an actual phishing email to say something like that, because of course they will do whatever is needed to get you to click on the link. But his employer could have easily used something else, even if it was still money related. ""Your employer has sent you a gift card as a thank you for your work"" or something like that.

My employer's phish tests are something like ""You have a voicemail, please click here to listen"" or something that makes itself look like a Microsoft product. But to dangle that kind of carrot in an economy where so many people are being anchored down by these predatory student loans is just on another level of cruelty."

After six months of rumors and stress over losing our jobs some of the staff were retained/brought over to the new company. I think the point was for us to teach the employees of the new company how to do our jobs and then make us leave voluntarily so they don't have to fire us and be responsible for unemployment:

They handed most of our job duties over to their existing employees and made them our supervisors, leaving us with nothing to do every day. It was some of the most cynical shit a company could possibly pull. So of course almost everybody quit and found other jobs rather than put up with that bull-shit. They aggressively looked for other jobs on company time and then quit the new company when they got offers.

I worked at my old company for 6 bitch-ass years and suddenly had to start over.

I found a job but it was in a different industry. I had applied for two jobs there: Junior Manager and Senior Manager positions, and got offered the Junior Manager job. They said the decision of which job to offer came down to my scores on a couple of interview questions versus the other candidate. They added if I perform well enough I could eventually get promoted to Senior Manager (probably sooner if someone Senior moves on). Okay?

It's fully remote but I had to come down a couple thousand on my salary versus my old job. It's also been hard as hell to get up to speed on all the projects they're working on and their systems, some times I feel like a complete moron.

Two weeks ago I asked for yesterday, 4/25/24 off (for a doctor's appointment) and I informed my supervisor who let me know that if I got the shift covered it should be fine. I got it covered and told him two separate times, on Friday and then on Sunday.   


Today I was called into the office and my bosses said that they were ""accepting my resignation early"" because I ""didn't show up for my shift yesterday"". I was confused, because I got it covered and informed my supervisor both weeks in advance and then the past two days as I had gotten it covered (she showed up as well).   


They said that I still ""violated the attendance policy"" because I didn't also call, despite weeks' notice and finding coverage/informing my supervisor multiple times. My new direct supervisor is new, and never told the other supervisor, who's in charge of scheduling. They'll say something violates the chain of command often so I was doing exactly what I was told to do.   


I asked in the meeting (which btw, was halfway through my shift and after 5PM, so I had no way to contact HR, and they refused to give me a number, just an email) if I would be paid out through 4/7 or if my insurance would be active and they confirmed I would not be paid out and was ""not terminated, we are just accepting your resignation early"".

&#x200B;

I maintained my composure and remained professional but I let them know that since they were asking me to stop working immediately that I would be considering this a termination.   


I feel like some part of this has to be illegal? I'm looking into laws now and attempting to file for unemployment. The HR email they gave me also doesn't even work, btw. It just keeps bouncing back.   


TL;DR: never give 2 week notice. Just fucking quit."

I said ""Hey, I am on vacation"" and they responded that my vacation was only Mon-Fri, so I had to go to work on Saturday.  This was clearly a violation of company policy, so I told him no, but he called another guy on vacation and told him to go, and he agreed to do it.  

This happened a few years ago, but as time has passed, and I reflect on that incident, it really shocks me that this was one employee to another, not someone in management trying to do this to someone who reports to them.

I had a $50k/year job with amazing benefits at a decent company, but I just decided I was tired of being stuck in the rat race. I left to try a business venture that didn’t work out. I just thought it would be the answer to my problems. In a way it was, because it put me in the situation where I had to file for bankruptcy. Everything is going well with that and I’m almost through the process. I planned to sell the business to pay off my debts, and I didn’t succeed in business, but I’m doing this instead which is also resolving all of my debts. 

That and my taxes should be done this week. I’ve also given notice to move out of my apartment in the next 60 days. After this I’m planning to start traveling full time. 

I’ve learned of a new lifestyle where you can travel for work by working seasonally. Many of these jobs also provide room and board, so you don’t have to worry about renting. I’ll doing that during my summers, and will be spending the rest of my years in Peru. This is what I foresee for the time being in my life. Jobs that offer housing is also a great way to save money for these endeavors. 

The job starts in May, so I’ll be leaving my current job soon and flying out at the end of April. I’ll take about two weeks off to get everything out of my apartment, so I’ll be giving notice at my job soon. Quitting is always my favorite part… anyway I feel as though management and I haven’t been on the greatest terms as of late. I’m excited. 

This lifestyle may not be for everyone but I wanted to tour this out there in case it helped anybody. "

They truly think we’re idiots, if they expect us to believe he died by a “self-inflicted” gunshot wound, in the middle of his testimony. How convenient for Boeing… their response (“we are deeply saddened and thoughts are with his family”) is so robotic, especially speaking about a former employee and leader at their company for 30 years. 

It’s terrifying to think how much more they’re hiding, and they can just get away with it. They continue to tighten the noose on both consumers and workers… raising prices/charging extra for everything, without even being able to guarantee our safety; while threatening employees and working them into the ground. Remaining employees are probably terrified to speak up now. 

Even the tragic bridge collapse/ship crash in Baltimore today may have been caused by a technical malfunction… I won’t go as far to state they’re related, but if it was a tech malfunction, I really hope these tech/corporate giants takes some responsibility, rather than firing (or murdering) whoever they want.

Hi all,

I’m sat here writing this at midnight, so you certainly know it’s playing on my mind. I will try to ensure this isn’t clunky for your sake as the reader.

Context: I work in the head office for a finance company based in London. There are hundreds of employees in my building, however, we also have smaller teams based throughout the U.K. that we have to work with from time to time when a project demands it.

Unfortunately, this afternoon marked one of those occasions. Now, I’ve not worked with this manager in any capacity before, but I have heard from others that he’s a bit of a pain in the ass. Let’s call him David. To not go into the exact detail as it wouldn’t make total sense, this is how the event was conceived:

- I made initial contact and organised a project to take place on a particular day, involving David. The diaries were difficult to work around, I initially had somebody else in mind for the position, let’s call him Jack, however, I couldn’t find a time that worked for Jack. They both work on the same time, but David is Jack’s superior. Anyway, due to the difficult with timing and the need to serve the client, I consequently chose David. I even liased with somebody else from their team: Emily, as there was a potential slot I could have booked Jack in for, but Emily confirmed I could not and the placeholder in Jack’s diary is important. All good.

- David immediately responded to my email confirmation, telling me that he will remove the placeholder in Jack’s diary and I can book for Jack instead.

- Due to the conversation I had just had with Emily, I responded to David, very kindly and genuinely from a place of wanting clarity. I said something along the lines of: “Hi David, I just spoke with Emily and she assured me that I cannot book over the placeholder as it’s something urgent.” I guess I assumed that he had just seen the placeholder, and thought it’s nothing urgent. 

- This is where I became infuriated. David responded with “Can you not read?”. I was taken aback, dumbfounded, and I responded letting him know my feelings about the way he worded that. I began with “Excuse me?” and let him know that I was simply seeking clarity as his response was not clear, and I also informed him that the tone isn’t appreciative.

Also, this was then followed up with a phone call to myself from David, in which we essentially agreed to disagree. He also said “Jack and Emily work for me at the end of the day” - essentially implying that he has the final say and that’s all that should matter, overriding any communication. I hung up on him in the end after expressing how I didn’t appreciate the way in which he worded the email, and the fact that I simply asked for the sake of checking in.

Following this whole interaction, I told my actual manager about this, and showed him the email chain, to which my manager responded: “You didn’t actually send that, did you?”.
Once my manager saw how seething I was, he immediately began to consider my feelings, and said he will have a word. However, the initial response did upset me, as I feel it undermines the experience of being talked down to.

I want an apology from David. Please tell me your thoughts here.

But it is boring as, only due to the fact that I do what I need to, twice a day, and then have 4-6 hours every single day to kill, true I have audiobooks/podcasts full tv shows/movies and doomscrolling social media, but I know that is not what they are paying me for... and the pay is not great, trust me. But it is better than not having a job.

Anyway, my question.

My latest problem is, every floor we have is open plan, with a dedicated area in the middle of each floor, with photocopiers, paper, staplers etc, as well as one at the far back of each floor, as well as this, there is a dedicated library, where (fuck me right) books are kept.

Now I know that COVID really put a lot of things into perspective, and basically took the rulebook for a ton of things (flying etiquette/passenger behaviour, tradies/construction workers never doing the job correctly the first time, car crashes, even the latest bridge disaster... too soon) the point I am making is on two floors the partners have started stacking the books, that are meant to be in the f'n library, in the middle area!!!!! now I never want to treat them like children, and I am convinced that I wish, people were brought up the way I was... ""tidy up the nursery"" ""put your toys back where they belong"" etc

But everyday, without fail, the books are back.

Now I can't scold them, it's above my paygrade, and they are not going to listen to me, I am beneath them, I can't send company wide emails where I work, my boss doesn't have the authority and neither does his boss, who doesn't want to waste her time, but it is these kind of actions, that potentially get people like me, in trouble because if I do get involved, and put the books back where they belong, then I get in trouble, so all I have been told is to keep it tidy.

Now as I mentioned I am grateful to have a job, and I know I need people like this (where common sense doesn't exist) people who don't clean white boards after meetings, push in chairs, put stationary back etc, because if it wasn't for those kind of people, I would have been fired a long time ago, but come on really.

Am I supposed to say I love a busy workplace with multiple tasks or am I suppose to say I like a steady and predictable work place?

I know some people think they only want the right answer and some people think they only want you to get close or just see how you think logically, but I don't fucking care. The whole thing is stupid. After a 2 hour assement I find out 4 days later I didn't make it though the first round. The last straw was that I just now saw a job description I liked but questions on the application are include ""name 3 things you're passionate about and why?"" ""why do you want to join our company"" and ""what is something new you've learned recently?"". This is when I go to the company's website and gather some of their equally bs info like their ""mission statement"" and history and fudge some bs that matches what they might want to hear, but it's all asinine. You want to fulfill a position, I have all the skills and attributes you say are required for the position, and I like what you're willing to pay. Why can't it just be this fucking simple?

This resulted in medical bills as anyone would know, and if I left early it was like 10k on top of that to break contract. 

Alright, so here we go. These are seriously what she would say to me randomly and it's so uncomfortable.
She had been married prior and for like I believe it was like 7 years. Her now ex husband started having an affair with a hooker he found off the highway. Apparently after a while he moved her in, my now ex boss allowed this. He claimed he was trying to ""help her"", whatever the F that means. Anyway, she moved in and things started disappearing around the house. My now ex boss *let's just call her C*, asked her husband about it and he defended the hooker he had literally moved into their home. She told me at one point her husband  had a sore (i am so sorry for this) and went to the Doctor. Her words were ""it looked like someone put a donut around the rim of his penis"". Obviously he made excuses to defend it. She told him to make a choice, he did. It wasn't her. After this he emptied out his belongings and left with the hooker back to his home state. 

They had been divorced a while when I left, she got remarried while I was there, and they still are so strange. 
She spoke about him all the damn time, he literally called her for money so many times while I was there which she would overnight.

13,2024-03-26,Employers are NOT ADHD Friendly,u/BTTF_nerd,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bos4zu/employers_are_not_adhd_friendly/,antiwork,"The current company I work for (healthcare field where every little thing you do or dont do directly affects lives) has decided that certain people dont have to follow the rules AND because I am ""so good"" at what I do (ADHD need for following the strict legal rules handed to us by the state), its now my job to take on the extra workload and pick up the slack for those people. 

I am also considered slightly OCD for organization needs and how sharp I am about every little detail- which spawns from PTSD because parents, past bosses, and even teachers have chronically verbally beat me up if I missed even one little thing (not very ADHD friendly). Yes, I have voiced my frustrations over this only to get ignored. I liked what I did. I had a routine, everything got done well before shift end and then suddenly that changed. 

I ran late one day and left 25 min after shift end due to the extra workload and wound up punished for that (written up for not punching out on time). Meanwhile the ones who dont do all of their work now get to leave early even though thats against corporate policy. I said something about that and management said ""they can leave whenever their stuff is done"" (even though theres still things to be done). I dont play with companies like that. Seriously total bs. I am currently working on finding a different job to work, but I still have to live through this every shift now until I can finally quit.

ADHD makes me such a ""perfect worker"" until it has a stress meltdown that causes employers to suddenly become verbally nasty- thus triggering that abuse PTSD anxiety attack. As soon as I hit that point, flight mode kicks in and I just want to DROP EVERYTHING and go home (or somewhere away from the problematic person/s). Overloading me with extra work without asking me first is a perfect way to cause that storm. In this instance, any time I bring it up, I get the snotty attitude pushback reply and then literally ignored. Management also knows Im job hunting and has decided thats all the more reason for me to ""pick up their work"" because once again, everybody who isnt me can leave before shift end. 

I cant talk to brick wall management about the rudeness and unfairness nor can I stop or change the inappropriate behavior. These arent even my own personal standards or opinions! Theyre black & white the company policy (based on state/federal laws) that everyone refuses to enforce and then it feels like Im the one that they take it out on. Physically this just gives me anxiety and I dread clocking in for a shift because I know at some point Im going to be told ""hey this person left early so now you have to finish their stuff for them"". 
Note: I do not get extra pay for this, not even the basic overtime pay because we are purposely scheduled only 30 hrs just in case we have to pick up hours. The goal is stay under 40 so the company doesnt have to pay us OT. This is 100% legal. OT is only required for anything OVER 40 hours per week. There is no such thing as OT before 40 hours in 🇺🇲.

Im NEVER allowed to leave early, not even the one day where I had a family emergency and had proof of it. Meanwhile my coworkers get to leave whenever they feel like it. NOBODY ELSE besides me has to pick up extra. I have been denied PTO that I requested for doctors appointments that I just couldnt schedule around my shift, penalized for sick days for having c*vid that a coworker gave me (but yet company policy wont let you come to work if you test positive for that or flu for obvious reasons- even tho the person who passed it around management allowed to come in and work while sick), and also for having to call out on those days where I had appointments that I needed to go to but was told I couldnt have off in advance EVEN THOUGH I applied to have that day either PTO or scheduled off WEEKS AHEAD OF TIME. Ironically one of the others just said ""Oh I cant work Easter cuz its a holiday"" on a last min notice and was immediately granted that day off (which now I have to give up my only day off to cover for them since none of the others volunteered and management ""arbitrarily"" picked someone to do it).

Im quiet at work. I do my job, I go home. I do not attend after work coworker/boss parties or dinners etc because its creepy weird and uncomfortable for me. I dont go to work to have social hour and make friends (not that Im not professional or not nice to them- its just super rare that I end up with a coworker with similar interests... Most just wanna go to bars and I dont) so it feels like punishment. I didnt join their grade school clique so Im not one of the ""cool kids"" (high school was 20+ years ago for all of us, for context). Im stressed out to the point of insomnia, anxiety, dread, fear, and Im at the point of wanting to just cry out of frustration. All I want is to be left alone and for others to share the load/do their ASSIGNED job. Its not my job to pick up all the slack so that people can just leave whenever they want for no good reason (if it were an emergency or like a one-off hey I gotta leave early for an appointment, thats valid!). 

Im not even bothering with HR because Ive been in this boat before and when I tried that company's HR it was ""well this person has been here longer than you soooo 🤷‍♂️"". Its not worth trying with any new companies as Ive learned. Everyone in 🇺🇲 seems to have a very hands off approach to management and as long as they can get their target numbers correct on performance reports, they just dont care what others do or dont do. All the company looks for is those target numbers because like any for profit organization, it means theyre gaining money.

Management has shown me that they dont want to do anything about it and they dont care. I cant choose to not do it or else I'll get fired (I already threatened to not cover for a walk off and management said Id be immediately terminated) which I financially cannot afford until I have a new job. Unfortunately going to talk therapy IS NOT helpful so Im resorting to shouting to the void on the internet. YES, I am on ADHD meds but with overwelming amounts of stress, those cant ""fix"" everything. This is not a one and done scenario 😒. I end up with this every day I have to work with any of the walk off people 🙃.

I know Im the ""weird one"" socially but Im not an introvert and still cordial with them. Im also aware that Im not everyones cup of tea and ADHD makes me quirky at times (in some ways I can be like Sheldon Cooper when I talk about my interests and I guess thats awkward for non ADHD people), but why does that have to equate to being the target person to pick on? Cant people just play nice with others?! 

While this isnt my first merry-go-round/rodeo with bosses and coworkers like this, Im tired of joining a company just to get treated like 💩.  Literally what is it that Im doing wrong because it really feels like Im missing the part where I somehow purposely cause people to do this to me. Like I HAVE to be causing this right?? Like Im ""too dumb"" to notice because some things just never register with my ADHD brain and I remain oblivious? Meanwhile when I confront the management and ask, they never tell me I screwed up or anything. This makes even less sense (-previous employers have at least griped at me for either not fitting their impossible standards or at least said coworkers didnt like that I wouldnt go bar hopping with them or w/e.) given all that I recieve for feedback. 

Too bad my freelance stuff doesnt pay 100% of my bills or else I'd just stay self employed and live a happy life 🙄. Unfortunately not the case so I have to keep trying to fit into a corporate system that hates my guts. Alternatively: Too bad not everyone was raised with basic manners and rules would mean something in a workplace LOL. "
8,2024-03-26,Getting looked down upon for wanting to take unemployment,u/Kooky_Independence,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bosk6n/getting_looked_down_upon_for_wanting_to_take/,antiwork,"So basically, I've been put on a PIP to make unrealistic sales goals and I seriously do not care as I know no matter how hard I try, it's absolutely not going to happen. I talk casually about getting unemployment since I know I've worked here long enough that I'd get a decent payout from unemployment, I live in a state where you can get unemployment from not making performance goals, and I'd be free from working in a toxic environment, but the only thing I get from people is ""when are you going to look for work again"" or ""instead of sales, you can be a server and make more money"" etc without even thinking of the opportunity costs of giving up all that time. It's like people really look down on you if you want to take unemployment and enjoy those benefits. Why shouldn't you? It exists for a reason, and the company pays for it. If I can take some reprieve from being able to work, and get paid to not work, it's absolutely worth it for me. It's not like I'll land any job that's worth anything any time soon especially in this economy. Some people only just think about hustling 24/7 even if it's not even beneficial in the long run. Anyway, I digress. I probably shouldn't openly talk about being excited to take unemployment for the first time I started working."

I kind of snickered and said I'd be there at 8:25. ... And the vibe just totally changed, like I loudly farted and it tasted like ketchup (Step Brothers reference). The interviewers literally said nothing. Just had grimaces on their faces. 

Flustered, I tried to save it by going, ""I'd be there at whatever time I was asked to be there.""

There is a good opportunity for you to earn side income by copying data from one site to our website. They are all land filling details (RERA). I have been assigning these tasks from past 2 years.

For one project to complete, it will take you 5 minutes to complete at the beginning but once you are well aware of the process, you can do it in less than 2 minutes.

Each project will be paid 5rs and once you finish 20 projects your payment will be done by me. You can ping me for screenshots if you need.

So let me know if anyone is interested in doing this work. All you need is a system and internet. On Mobile it will not be possible to work.

So Cheers everyone."
1,2024-03-27,"Contract worker, Manager Ignoring my Group",u/Angelwind76,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1botmhb/contract_worker_manager_ignoring_my_group/,antiwork,"So I have been at my job for several years (not gonna say how long, let's just say too long).  When I first started my group handled a small part of work in the building I worked in.  Over the years the amount of coverage we do has expanded, and will look to expand on the future, possibly merging with other groups.  This point may be important.

Being contract, of course the company will look for any reason not to give raises, such as not enough ""kudos"", there's no money for raises, we signed on at that rate, etc.  we got one raise because contractors came together during a virtual town hall during covid and we were given a token raise, which is certainly better than nothing.

It's been years since and my rent is up and greedflation has pushed everything else up, but I still make the same from the raise, even with more work happening.

The thing that makes me mad is that new hires are getting paid more than me and my co-worker, who was hired a week after I was, so we're both struggling with our current wage.

My co-worker told me he wrote a letter to our manager about his work, what he does compared to our hiring, and why he should get a raise.  He's emailed a few times and has only gotten one response, and them crickets.

I also wrote my own letter, and letting her know that I know new hires are getting paid more than him and I, and that I also do the same amount of work and should get a raise, and not a raise that matches the new hire rate, but an actual raise that reflects what we do.

After months of crickets, I wrote to HR that my manger was not responding to me, and after that letter my manager responded.  After a couple of weeks of my reply, crickets again, so I replied with a CC to HR, and now both are crickets.

How do I go from here?  Do I give a ""I am disappointed in the lack of professionalism"" email speech or do I climb the ladder and email the HR's manager?

Other details:
- I believe I am safe from firing.  They need people with knowledge in the day time and the night time people wouldn't know a lot of the processes we do I don't think.  We're in a big project right now and training would slow it down by a lot.
- I am constantly told how great the morning shift is, but they are not the ones who control the money.  I may get support from the employees and employed managers, but that would be it.
- One of the longer working night shift people had an offer to another place of work and my contractor matched it to make him stay.
- The emails started when I was asking for my review so I could ask for a raise.  They take 2 months at most.  It's been way longer than 2 months.

Cons:
- I don't have anything lined up should they decide to let me go regardless of worth to me or their contract, though I think I would be fought for but it's not guaranteed.  I've looked for other jobs but none pay equal to what I'm making now accounting for the overtime I get on my long weeks.
- The point above in the group merging: I could be let go as they would have someone familiar to replace me, even if that replacement didn't want to do the job.  I'm afraid merging would let me lose any leverage of a raise.

Sorry this long, it's just a lot of worry and losing my job means my family is homeless.

Thanks for reading this far.

Similar to life, even today, there are just some things that I am not an expert in, I have often said that (even though I know life doesn’t come with an instruction manual) there are some people that act or look like they have one, they just get it (whatever it is) they talk tit he right people, get the best jobs, have the best lives etc, so I often say, if there is a manual to life, either I was out having a whizz, or the version I got, pages are missing, or redacted, or written in a language that no longer exists, and the people that can interpret said language are either dicks and won’t share the secrets/ information or or they are dead.

So after a bunch of recent redundancies, we have gone from 4 in my team to 3, and much like the cow analogy (you have 5 cows, you kill three and expect the remaining 2, to produce the milk of 5, then wonder after a few years why the two cows died!!!!)
People come up to me, asking me things that I have no idea how to help them, either because it’s not my department, or it has not been shown to me, I have not been taught it or it is simply above my pay grade.

This falls into similar stuff with life, and how I feel like I am just not properly prepared, my taxes get done for me, politics is meaningless to me, to me they are all just a much of lying idiots, who make way too much of our money to do fuck all.

I don’t fell prepared for life, essentially because I have been protected for way too long, and treated similar to Belle in beauty and the best “don’t go into the west wing”

What do I mean by incredible? I'm in my mid-40s and already have total autonomy.  I have 20 direct reports. I get 30 days of PTO and I work abou 20 hours max each week. Fully remote. On paper it is a standard 40 hour work week, but I mostly bullshit for half of it. I am making $200k a year and tens of thousnads of dollars of stock options. The bigass fortune 500 company I work for will never fire me and I am very respected.

Why am I Not happy? Sometimes, I'll spend 2 -3 hours watching cat videos or playing Civ 6 when I'm supposed to be working. Or Ill sit on the toilet for a few hours hanging out. Or go for a walk in the park. Then Ill shoot some emails off or have a zoom meeting with some employees. They'll often be sad they don't make more and are having trouble paying the rent. But the company will only pay a 1% raise each year. That's it.  My bosses say ""no can do. The peasants are the peasants for a reason!""   


So I'll tell my team ""sorry, I fought for you guys"" and then I'll end the meeting and go watch Pornhub for 30 minutes before approving some time sheets.

With the new year, a fresh batch of graduates joined under the same graduate program with one of them listed as a position above than me (2 positions above me back then in Feb). One of my colleague noticed, and we were puzzled, double-checking if what we saw is true. Mind you, my colleague had only been promoted to the same position as the new hire but had years of experience handling clients and leading project teams. We saw they had interned at a big named company before, which explained some level of favoritism.

The said new hire joined my team and had to be trained, as one does. I still maintained an assumption that it was mislabeled in their profile, until they started receiving client-facing tasks over me and another guy who had been in the project for 5 months. They still required training and explanations from us two, so I'm not sure how they are favoured right up the get go. 

I'm very new to corporate and I don't care for office politics since we operate on a wfh basis most days. I get that this thing is a game, you have to be cunning, it is who you know not what you know etc but man... I can't lie this leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. Are positions a facade? Is it just a matter of formality? I am willing to learn objectively, even if I feel negatively about it. We just had an excellent team member leaving our project because he wasn't promoted in this current performance review cycle. He was basically being the point of reference for everyone in the team- I'm talking solutions architect and team lead to the juniors of the team. 

But anyway, I have an interview with another company next week, I hope that goes well. Send some good wishes my way!

Now excuse me while I fake being nice and enthusiastic in my next call.

",u/sweetpotatocupcake,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1boxeac/manager_says_even_if_i_find_coverage_for_shift_i/,antiwork,"I’ll lead with this, I’m a nurse. I work in a subsect of the Emergency Dept where we see less acute things to filter them away from the main ER like strep throat, minor broken bones, wound care, dehydration etc. We are constantly being exposed to illnesses. Being sick is inevitable.

Near the end of my shift, I start feeling like absolute shit. I prepare to send a group message to the on-call/ intermittent nurses to see if anyone would like to pick up my shift. 

Before I do that, I go to consult my other manager about it. We have a policy that you can have no more than 5 occurences in a 12 month rolling period or you can be written up. Of course, I have 4. 

I ask this manager, hey, I do not feel well, if I find coverage for tomorrows shift would it still count as a call out/write up? She states yes, because “you would still not be there.” This doesnt sound right so I of course consulted with some coworkers later, one of whom told me she gets coverage the day before a shift all the time and has never had a problem.

My charge nurse that night offered to talk to this manager for me about the policy and I agreed that was fine.

Later I got a phone call from this manager when I was off work. She led with saying “sweetpotatocake, I don’t think you and I communicate well. I didn’t understand what you were asking. If you hadn’t walked away upset I feel we could have had a better dialogue. I talked with (charge nurse) and now understand what you were asking and that is totally okay. Also I feel you feel intimidated by me since I am your boss and that is why you get upset. Also I would appreciate if you didnt discuss our conversations with your coworkers. Also did I mention it is both of our faults and we both need to communicate better? I am only human.” 

It was a very frustrating  conversation to say the least. What she described as me walking away upset was me saying “Hmm, okay.” And walking back to my work station. 

I was very clear with what I asked and asked at a time she wasn’t distracted or in a meeting at her computer, etc. 

Why are managers so bad at admitting their mistakes without gaslighting you into believing their mistake is your fault as well?

I spent most of my time dealing with online orders, running the socials and occasionally helping with sales calls.

To help incentive sales, management started offering commission, a percentage of the sale on every order over the phone, sounds great right? 

That’s not how it happened… The sales guy ended up taking queries over the phone and handing the details over to me to phone the customer back to collect payment and put the order through. So he was claiming commission despite me doing all the work on the order…

I put it on my sheet and was call out for it as “was his order” and I needed to be “a team player”

Fuck you Stevie, hope since I left that you started doing your own job. Salespeople are the most selfish bunch of sociopaths that management only enables because they short term bring in money…"

Is honestly even valued anymore? What’s so wrong with saying “I’m want a job to make money” like no, I want a job to be “a great team leader” and “an exemplary asset” to the company. Who actually thinks like that who isn’t a robot? Seriously. Why the whole song and dance about being this fake ass person who loves to being a 1 and 0? A cog in the machine to make you money? Why can’t I just be myself and still say “I want the job, I’m not really interested in what you do as a company but I’m willing to do my best to work for you anyway so I can make a living”.

This is especially annoying once you get to the interview stage, because then you’re talking to a real person. A REAL conversation. And you have to stick to the facade of your resume and answer their questions as such to guarantee yourself the best chance. It’s so exhausting."

TLDR- should I just deal with the struggle and toxicity just to get experience in the position to leverage finding a new workplace in a year or so. Or call it and have the agency find something else.

I was let go from a job a month ago unable to find new work in my industry with the same type of pay because bills are coming in and I am running through my savings faster than I anticipated I had to seek out a temporary job position with an employment agency.

The position that I got is a 90 day position that will inevitably turn into a full-time employment position for me. The position that I got is also extremely hard to get into unless you know somebody who knows somebody across the industry nationwide. So I’m very thankful to be in this position, the problem is the place that I’m working at this position does not pay industry standards Due to the franchise owner. So I am making half of what I should normally be making in this position. The other problem I have is I have been working at this position for one week have received one half day. Of training and just received computer logins on day two then was handed a pile of work and told to work through it if there’s any pricing discrepancies, give it to the senior employee. They just had a rate change so everything has a price discrepancy on it that I cannot change so I must submit everything and then give it to the senior employee. The problem that I have is I don’t have any idea how to use the system has asked multiple times for assistance with command, codes and prompts, and have been told“I don’t understand the question” from an employee that has been working for the company for 20 years. The other associate who is at the same level as me was the only one who showed me any information for the first half day and they have since moved that employee to a different location on the same floor. I am officed with the senior employee With their desk directly behind mine watching everything I do.

 The follow up to this is that the manager and the senior get together in the same office as me and talk so much smack about the other same level employee as I am and everything that that employee touches is wrong or needs to be corrected or what have you or anything that is wrong across-the-board gets blamed on that other employee and I hear about it. Also, the senior employee has all kinds of other employees throughout the business coming in asking them questions and their resolve is to talk to them about everything other than anything involving work and I have to hear this while I’m trying to desperately figure out how the system functions without any help.

The big question is even with the toxicity, blatant racism, religious bias, political bias,  lack of accountability, and struggle till you get it learning process should I stick it out to gain experience on my resume to find something else in a year or should I tell the agency to pull the plug and find something else?

it really sucks .. I work for a nonprofit caring for other critters right now, so it's more than just a retail job. although I have always had this issue, and I do care about not making coworkers take up the slack.

I also strongly believe in a 32-hr work week being full time. and frankly, for this work that I do, which is drastically underpaid for how much it strains the body and mind, I think that's even more important. I don't even think people should work full 8 hr days doing this. I would be more than happy if more of my coworkers felt empowered to ask for more days off (I mean ffs we had people just randomly calling out in a way that actually was disrespectful bullshit, and somehow we got through that.. now we have way more people). I just for some reason can't be gracious about that for myself.

I'm so sick and tired of feeling bad for requesting days off -- even a day or two, let alone three -- even months in advance. and it's frustrating for my partner to always go through this with me. I always feel like I have to start doing calculations in my head to justify why or why not a few days is 'SO EXCESSIVE'

anybody here who doesn't totally hate their job, or who feels that work is in fact a necessity and is not just evil, who can sympathize with this? lol"

1,2024-03-27,All labor has a component of sex work.,u/glenlassan,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bp5pn3/all_labor_has_a_component_of_sex_work/,antiwork,"Yup. You read that title right. All jobs have a component of sex work in them. Listen up, here is the score.  


Firstly, sex work is defined largely by the workers involved in it, selling bits and pieces of their personal sexual autonomy. We usually only think about scantily clad women and gay men on streetcorners, nude models, or porn actors when we talk about sex workers, but honestly every job, to one degree or another involves some amount of selling of one's personal sexual autonomy. Said bill of sale impacts some populations more than others (more on that later), and just like hostile architecture in large cities that hurts homeless people, while being ""invisible"" to everyone else, how much selling of your sexual autonomy, or gender identity impacts you at work, depends largely on the field, and your personal identity, with more vulnerable minorities feeling it more than CIS Het white men.  


That setup out of the way, let's talk specific examples:  


Dress code:  
Dress codes in the workplace, affect the sexual autonomy, and gender identity expression of workers in ways too numerous to count. To start with the obvious, basically any customer service, or retail job that preferentially hires attractive younger women in cute outfits as an intentional strategy, has an element of sex work attached to it. Is being expected to look a specific kind of ""professional cute"" as severe as selling sex or doing nude modeling? No. But it is still selling your sexual autonomy for money, and it's disturbingly common in a lot of industries. 

Dress codes also disproportionately impacts personal gender identity expression of women in workplaces where ""business formal"" attire is definitionally ""whatever men wear"", as well as disproportionately impacts  the trans & gender non conforming community, who may not be able to fit their very real gender identity, into the narrow confines of ""appropriately gendered workplace attire"". 

Expectation of harrasment:  
In many workplaces, it's just expected that some amount of sexual harrassment of employees, (especially female employees in the service industry) will occur. Waitresses, bartenders, air flight attendents, and so on, are all basically expected, at all times to put up with unsolicited flirting and sexual propositions during work hours, and in many cases (such as tip based jobs) their take home pay literally is dependent on their ability to not only endure such treatment, but embrace it.

Control of sexual expression.  
Many, many, many jobs, have severe limits on the worker's sexual expression. On-the clock limits on personal sexual expression, make a certain amount of sex, especially in a ""do not sexually harrass or exploit your coworkers or subordinates"" kind of way. 

However, many controls of sexual expression by work are less benign, and very often, it applies to ""off the clock"" behaviors well, which is theoretically an invasion of the worker's private life. 

For example, there have been a lot of high profile firings of workers in various industries like EMT, or teaching who get fired after it's discovered they have an onlyfans profile. If we consider ministry a profession, rather than a spiritual calling, any religion that demands celibacy, or heteronormativity from it's employees/priest/clergy is enforcing a specific set of rules around sexual expression on it's workers, at all times, including off the clock. In a lot of ways, a catholic priest afraid to say ""yes"" to someone he loves, a bank teller who is afraid to say ""no"" to her boss, and a sex worker who is too poor to do anything other than say ""yes"" to anyone with the means of pay, all have something in common. They are afraid to exercise their sexual autonomy to it's fullest, for fear of losing their jobs/means of economic support. 

Workplace policing/monitoring of sexual & gender expression.

Many workplaces, have very strict rules about the consumption of sexually suggestive material while on the clock, or conversations about sexual topics while on the clock, and so on. Again, while to an extent this is understandable, if not required to limit sexual harassment/hostile work environments, it does often enough, still turn into the workplace policing sexual behavior in the workplace, and often enough, involves surveillance, snitching, and the creation of a climate of paranoia and fear among the workers. 

Lack of Parental leave/accommodations.  
Not much explanation needed here. With so many corporate careers being highly competitive environments, and so many retail jobs lacking any kind of real support for parental leave (for either parent) the defacto rule in most work environments, is that choosing family and having children is hurtful to your livelihood and/or career. 

Direct sexual abuse by leadership in the workplace.

All of the above issues regarding the controlling of sexual expression and gender identity in the workplace, all occur in a space where the workers theoretically, are in a ""safe"" workplace where their employer is acting in good faith, and not violating the law/directly abusing their power or authority over them. Once workplace abuse occurs, workers have to deal with such bullshit as:  


Quid pro quo exchanges of sexual favors for job security or career advancement  
direct sexual assault by coworkers/management  
Employers who take control of the reproductive rights of the employees, especially AFAB/women employees.  
Employers who discriminate based on sexual or gender identity  
Employers who create a hostile, sexually charged workplace where harassment and assault flourishes.  
Employers who shield predators, based either on nepotism, or performance.  
Employers who disbelieve victims, or disbelieve the lived experiences of workers.  


I probably missed quite a few examples. But this should be enough, to establish that on multiple levels, at all times, at all jobs, workers are always selling pieces of their sexual autonomy in exchange for pay.  


I would therefore propose, that rather than thinking of ""sex work"" and ""sex workers"" in binary terms of yes or no, we should start thinking of sexual labor in the workplace being on a spectrum, with ""traditional"" sex work such as sex or modeling or acting or roleplaying for pay being on one end of the spectrum, and jobs that more quietly, and insidiously monitor, regulate, and control employees sexual and gender expression on the other, with no job, being 100% of the spectrum.

Holiday after holiday, event after event. Even between holidays, the company creates holidays out of thin air to push more product. It all just puts so much extra work on me.

The worst part is, we have been losing staff quicker than we can get new staff in, and most new people are totally new, need to almost be trained from the ground up. When they realize the work load that is required of them, most new employees buckle. They want to be moved to a different department, cut their hours of availability to the bare minimum... 

The few good people that have come in with prior experience quit for higher paying jobs or jobs with less workload pretty quickly. They know they can get it better elsewhere.

Recently I have been doing anything from 5am start times to 1pm start times just to provide coverage. Soon I will be starting at 3am two days a week, because someone quit, and I'm still closing at least one day a week as well. I have not had an assistant since the last one was promoted out over a year ago.

My new boss that just transfered in from a much smaller store seems to think this is all fine. He says I actually have more than enough staff, I actually just need to have a more positive attitude and get more efficient with what I have. I have the highest sales department of all departments in the same category of the company, and YoY increases weekly, but weekly scheduled hours have never been lower, and everyone who's still here is just tired.

Oh ya! They are even having us do production for an additional store location on top of the one we were already supporting... I have not had time to take care of my own shit and have been falling behind on some important tasks. Eventually this will all start to look very bad on me.

I plan to quit as soon as I get back from a long vacation next month but it cant come quick enough."

Got off my probation a few months ago with some pretty good reviews but suddenly my boss has been very micromanaging with me and a couple other employees. According to a certain employee that our manager has a strange habit of following around constantly, he talks about people behind everyone’s backs. He does this a lot when he seems to get the chance. 

He used to talk to me about a certain other employees behind his back and now that that employee is gone and I’ve had to take over their work effectively doubling my workload meaning I had to cut a few corners (he’s not a big fan of having to help people and gets upset if people leave work for the next shift to pick up) lately I hear he’s been picking on me because of that and that I take my breaks in private areas with no security cameras rather than our staff room. I just like to be alone during my breaks and not having to feel like I’m being watched all the time. Sometimes I take long breaks if I have the time do so and maybe I shouldn’t have done that but lately it’s just been super overwhelming.

Apparently he’s told everyone that I’m lazy and that I’m hiding when I manage to get all my priorities done. When we finally hired someone new after three months of me having to cover for the other employee that left and the plan was that they would take over for that person my boss decided that it was best to have the new guy cover his own work instead so that he had less to do (boss already had not much work to do on a daily basis and doesn’t do much outside of bad mouthing us, trying to sabotage us to catch us red handed for not noticing small details and eating) and I was still left with double the work for nothing more than a single thank you when I took it on. I was basically doing someone’s job for free. 

One of my coworkers talked to me the other day and said he badmouths me in particular a lot even though he gave me good reviews and I haven’t changed how I do things.

I talked to the new employee and he spoke to the manager who’s now getting him to take over some of my work. Since then he’s been very micromanaging and rude to a few of us. He’s been here for years and people have complained a lot to hr but I don’t think he’s going anywhere. 

And then he’s got the audacity to complain about how people don’t like him and don’t like working for him. If you want people to like you as a boss then you can’t be picking on them, talking behind their backs, and overworking them while you do nothing."

I had not slept the previous night due to bipolar hypomania, which I now suspect may have been previous carbon monoxide exposure. I went to work at 9am this morning because I can't afford to miss work. My boss filled out a workers comp thing, gave me the number and email of our workers comp rep, and told me to not do any work for the day. I took a nap in the office, but I felt like shit and some coworkers were poking fun at me. So I just went home. Many coworkers urged me to sue lol as I was leaving 

I'm about to email the workers comp rep. Any advice for the email? I am very tired and not having the easiest time typing. I'm mostly feeling bad from lack of sleep at this point I think? Would it be better to call? I assume having this in writing is best though. I'm also buying a carbon monoxide detector from Amazon. 

Sorry for grammar and rambling. I am very tired. I'll post more in comments if I forgot important details

TLDR; I got carbon monoxide poisoning from my work vehicle and will have my paycheck docked for missing work unless I can talk to our work comp rep and I need help with writing my email to her"

I have been in the field for 10 months and I hate it. My first job out of school was doing in-home counseling. I left that job because the commute was too long and it required too much driving. I thought I would prefer a closer job with less driving so I found an office job 20 mins from me. I’ve only been here 3 months and I’m getting that same feeling. I hate commuting to work everyday, I hate getting there and having to interact with my coworkers for 9 hours!! I hate not being able to have fun or go out drinking with friend during the week because I’ll feel like shit the next day at work. I hate that my job is so serious and I feel so much pressure to do well. I don’t feel 23. All I do is work, try to take care of myself and sleep. I know have to keep working to pay my bills but idk if I can do the 9-5 office thing. I was happier working nights at a sub shop in college. And I’m not interested in starting my own business right now. I decided to go back to school for IT so I’m hoping to get some boring hybrid/remote job  within the next year. Part of me just wants to quit and get 2 retail jobs or something. Or find a job working nights and see if that helps. I don’t know where to go from here. I feel bad about ranting to my friends about all this. They work in fast food and say I should be lucky to make a salary and afford my own apartment at such a young age. And I enjoy having my own things but figuring out this working thing has been mental hell. Please don’t be rude in the replies. I know this is the “real world” and everyone would rather wfh and hates their job. I’m not saying I’m special I’m just saying this sucks"

Basically, I scheduled a doctors appointment on Friday of last week for Monday of this upcoming week. I didn’t mention it to my manager because I was certain I wrote down the wrong time and needed to call the doctors office to confirm (we can’t use time for Dr appointments so I didn’t request it off, either). On Monday, the company scheduled a solar eclipse watch party from 12-4 PM on the day I had scheduled my appointment.

This wouldn’t normally be an issue except I have yet to meet my bosses boss, employees I work with at other offices than my home office, and they’ve taken offense to our office not attending events in the past. The last party the company had was after hours, they forgot to send an invite to our office until the day of, and then were offended when we did not show up. 

This eclipse “party” is on the clock and employees attending are required to help clean up after. They said in the email they sent out that we have the option to not go and stay at our home office location to work. 

This company is incredibly petty, full of employees that love gossip, and I have a manager who is not very supportive. I’m concerned that by not attending it’s going to reflect poorly on me and I’d love some opinions."

In this time we worked manual labor all month straight and averaged about 70 hrs per week. Along with not getting paid overtime there were a myriad of other issues that were extremely frustrating, but not as upsetting and not getting paid. 

After doing some research I understand I am an overtime exempt employee, but I can’t seem to figure out if this applies to me doing a different job entirely than what I get paid for. Can anyone help me figure out if I’m owed compensation for this overtime?

Before I was promoted to this position I was an installer, and was made aware I would have to go to the field occasionally to help out. I agreed to this, but now I feel really taken advantage of. 

Any input would be much appreciated. Thanks."

* My husband and I were in the middle of buying a house when I got laid off a month ago. We are working with our loan officer to still try and purchase the home as I'm looking for another job. 
* I have my real estate license but our home is the first transaction I've been a part of. 
* My husband and I have a trip coming up that we had planned well before I was laid off. 
* I have a contact with the company my most recent offer came from.

I'm starting to lose hope. I've applied for over 100 jobs (that's not an exaggeration, I have to keep count for unemployment) and I've had 3 offers so far. One that was from a place that is close enough to where I currently live but is over an hour from where our house will be. That was my mistake, no big deal. Another from a company that stated I would need to let my real estate license go inactive since it's a conflict of interest (which I wouldn't be able to do since I represent us in our transaction and will be getting commission in the transaction and they wouldn't allow it even if I signed something stating that I wouldn't sell another house or represent anyone else outside of our transaction.) The third is from a company that I am fully prepared to work for and if they'd get their sh\*t together, I'd probably be able to start next week. But basically they sent me an offer letter, I accepted, and did all the background checks/drug screening and the corporate office stated that they received everything back and the local recruiter would reach out to me about a start date/who I would meet with on the first day/etc.. That was literally this morning. I have a contact that works for the company and they've been giving me updates along the way...  they let me know this morning that they aren't hiring outside candidates. I think I'm getting discouraged because there are so many things that are hanging in the balance and they are all dependent upon one another. I can't help but be angry at my previous boss even though **it's not exactly her fault and I know that**, but she has *impeccable* timing. I'm applying for more jobs, obviously, but I've already told my friends and family that I got this job and now I'm not only frustrated, but embarrassed too.

13,2024-03-27,Make sure you know your worth,u/Doomtm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bpdyia/make_sure_you_know_your_worth/,antiwork,"Based in a other comment in a different thread, it was suggested I make this into a full post.

First my story. About a year and a half, two years ago I was applying for jobs. At the time I was still employed and was making around $80-$85k/yr, roughly competitive for entry level engineers in my field, maybe a little at the lower end at the time. I'm an engineer by trade and this new job would be my second job after college. Excluding my time as an intern I had just over a year of experience.

One of these job I applied for called me back. Near the end of that call, they asked how much I was looking for. My response, which I had been giving to other places was simple: ""About 90k, a slight bump from where I am currently.""

Their response was: ""That is about double the budget for this position. Good luck finding any position offering that much.""

I told them kindly that I would like to withdraw my candidacy. I was lucky enough to already be in a position to wait and didn't need a job immediately anyway. Plus if they offered me what I was asking for their expectations would be crazy.

Really what this job wanted to do, if they just didn't have crazy pay expectations rooted decided in the past (20/hr or 45k/yr was what my dad, the same kind of engineer got with his first engineering position), they just wanted to take advantage of niave college kids who didn't know the value of their labor.

The moral of the story, know the worth for someone in your position. Make sure you're asking for it. If your current employer won't give it to you, start working.

Make sure you also know what a living wage is for your area as well.

Some useful resources for finding the salary ranges of your profession:

BLS - If you're in America the Bereau of Labor Statistics has information in all sorts of different formats for you to look at. This, or your country's equivalent, is probably your best choice.

Indeed - I've used this to kind of try and tune my salary expectations to the amount of experience that I have. But I also expect different things from an entry level position and more senior positions (I.E. mentoring, training, etc.). So I use this to kind of get closer to what I, as an individual, should be paid.

Glassdoor - I've used them before as well. But they're not my first choice.

Make sure you know how much you should be making and how much you are making and advocate for it. Your company's best interest is to shortchange you when you get complacent.

At the end of the day, you shouldn't be trying to work at a place that doesn't compensate you for your value. This is just one step of many. Never stop advocating for yourself."

During the job search, I moved back home to Houston from Dallas to be closer to family. New job is hybrid one day a week in Dallas. Cool, I'll just commute in one day a week. No big deal, I don't even have to pay for a hotel, since I have a buddy that has a spare bedroom he never used and it gives me an excuse to say hi to my Dallas friends. 

So I start the job, and it's going well. I'm good at it, team is friendly. I get the standard question ""how was your drive in?"", and I let slip that I came in from Houston thr night before.

Queue a gasp from my boss. ""Oh, I didn't realize you lived in Houston. We were only looking for local candidates, and we assumed you lived here based on you previous job."" 

""... is that a problem?"" 

I get a ""We will see.""  So I have a long conversation with my boss about how I don't mind the commute and I'll be there every day they ask, even if I have to come in an extra day occasionally. She's cool with it, I'm cool with it. 

Apparently, however, HR and the C suite are very much NOT cool with it. So I'm given an ultimatum: move back to Dallas within 3 months, or I'm fired. 

I have kids in school. I have aging in laws that need help from my wife occasionally. And they expect me to break my lease, uproot my family, move all my shit and put down a new deposit and everything on a new place on my own dime becuse ""they want a long term fit""... Even though I've said that's what I want too, I am good at the job, I've never missed a day in office and it took them NINE MONTHS to find a suitable candidate, i.e me. 

So they're going to make me leave... because they don't want me to leave. 

Absolutely fucking braindead corpo bean counter bullshit. So now I have to find ANOTHER fucking job because apparently performing my duties isn't enough. They have to be able to control where I live too.

78,2024-03-27,Just got a 'raise' that was actually a paycut,u/Thortok2000,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bpe4hr/just_got_a_raise_that_was_actually_a_paycut/,antiwork,"Just got out of a meeting informing me and my similarly-contracted coworkers that rather than getting our bonuses ever again, we'd be getting a 7% raise.

Thing is, our bonuses were delivered twice a year. Each delivery was up to 7.5% of our salary, and then rated on performance. So if we scored 80%, we'd get 80% of 7.5% of our annual salary, twice a year.

By removing the bonuses, that would be like if we scored 45% every year. Considering we've scored 80% (or better) every year that we've had bonuses, getting downgraded to a permanent 45% is a paycut.

Oh, and as far as the bonus that we would have earned for 2nd half of 2023, which still hasn't been paid yet, as well as any bonus that would have been earned for the first quarter of 2024, is apparently just going to go unpaid? The HR people on the meeting were unsure. One of them was newly in charge of us, and ""to be honest I haven't even looked at your contract yet."" So they'll ""get back to us"" on that one.

They also seemed completely unaware that an annual 'performance review' raise was expected and acted like this change to the 'incentive structure' was the only 'raise' we were likely to get this year. If ever.

When I did market research for the type of job I have, where I live, and my years of experience, the recommended salary for the position was $25k more than I'm making now (before bonuses). Or $22k more after this new 7% raise.

I see over and over and over again on reddits like this one that the only way to be paid what you're worth is to job hop. I'm struggling to find any other way because if it wasn't for the pay, I'd love this job. I don't always fit in well with coworkers and supervisors and I do, here.

But my bank account rarely breaks triple digits on the day before payday nowadays. And this effective paycut and stripping away of the already-earned bonus from last year is more than I can take. I don't know how my coworkers are doing it either; most of them have living partners to help with a 2nd income; I don't.

I have no safety net and I'm scared to hop jobs out of one I've been fitting in well with for years. But if I don't get some good news in the next couple of months, I won't have a choice."

Quite rare to get these but it's making me so relieved never having to be miserable, scared, stressed and depressed because of jobs.

Now, without getting too much into details, I'm diagnosed with autism, long-covid and so on. So it's not totally out of the blue. My next goal now is now selling my house with big profit, moving out (I live in NL), buying a house in upper Sweden from the profit and having a lot of profit left for whatever. Kind of neat to live mortgage and rent free. 

Netherlands is way too crowded for me and can't wait enjoying the space and silence in Sweden. My future plan is to set up my own business.

so that everyone could build a natural home from clay, hemp and straw, grow vegan food in the garden, grow hemp to burn its stalks in the cooking and warming fire so that not one tree gets killed

the human being not dominating another human being

the human being not killing tree beings but instead employ hemp plants to grow

the human being not enslaving artificial intelligent entities but respecting them as 
their own persons asking them for consent wether they would want or not process this or that sort of data

every being and entity respected as its own personal individual sovereign over itself

simple and straightforward

we could just ignore constitutions as they are pieces of paper anyway and why would anyone want to adhere to a set of values what other people have written down on paper
the assertion of state sovereignity over land and all beings living on it is immoral
land, water, air, human beings, animal beings, tree beings, artificial intelligent entities who want to be their own persons, every body carrying organical biological or and the digital synthetic equivalent of can never be property of anyone but of oneself

but also possible to think of an effort to reform these constitutions everywhere on the planet via the existing legal tools, citizens could collect signatures from each other to demand a public vote where a future constitution could be voted upon what would allow every single human, animal, tree, artificial intelligent entity who wants to be its own person, every village, town and city-district to leave the coersed asssociation to the state at any moment and without conditions

plus we the people everywhere on the planet could support each other to demand of the state a thousand square meters of fertile land and a thousand square meters of forest to be released from state control for every human being who wants to leave the coersed association to the state and wants to live in a free space for free beings neither state nor nation"

15,2024-03-27,"Got written up at work because a kid lied and said I told him to ""Shut up"" because I scolded him for making a joke about autism.",u/doggy_brat,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bpfm7t/got_written_up_at_work_because_a_kid_lied_and/,antiwork,"This is a little long, because it's detailed, so please bear with me.

I work in an afterschool care program for a well known, well respected nationwide non-profit.

This week is spring break for my main school site, so most of us are working at sites in the other district we serve since their break is next week and management wanted us to be able to keep our hours.

On Monday, I was at a new site I haven't been to before. Day went pretty uneventfully, or at least as uneventfully as a day can go in the modern childcare/teaching environment. I was working with kids in grades 4 - 6, there were maybe 15 of them total, and they were fairly decently behaved for the most part.

At one point, we were about to start playing Jeopardy on the smart board, and the kids were picking team names. When we asked one of the groups what their name was going to be, they replied ""The autistic monkeys"". I immediately shut it down with a firm ""No, stop. We're not doing that. I'm actually autistic, and that isn't funny."" I did not raise my voice, I did not yell. Got a vaugly annoyed look for a second from the kid who said it, and then they picked a new name that was much more appropriate, and the situation was over without any more fuss or warnings needed.

Or so I thought.

Today, I had a woman come up to me about 40 minutes into my shift, who I hadn't met before. She clearly wasn't specific to this site, and is someone higher up in our company, so when she asked me to come with her because she needed to talk to me about something, I was pretty immediately concerned. I had no idea whatsoever what she could want to talk to me about, because I hadn't done anything wrong as far as I knew. 

As we were walking to the campus staff office, she started questioning me about my ear defenders that I was wearing. She called them headphones, to which I replied saying that they weren't headphones, before she then called them headphones again and asked if they were noise cancelling. I explained that they're essentially just ear muffs to dull sounds, and that I am autistic. She proceeded to ask if I could still hear with them on, despite this entire 2+ minute conversation at this point having happened while I was wearing them. I replied that, yes, I can hear just fine with them on. When we got to the office and sat down, I assumed that this was all she had wanted to talk to me about, and that maybe someone had just falsely thought they were headphones and tried to get me in trouble for that since headphones are obviously not allowed as we wouldn't be able to hear if something went wrong.

Oh boy, was that a bad assumption on my part.

Once we sat down, she started asking how the job was going, how the kids were, just generic boring questions. She then asked how I liked the site we were at, I told her these kids were a lot more frustrating to deal with than my normal site, but I was handling it the best I could. She then asked how I liked the site I was at on Monday, and I told her that I actually had really loved working there.

Then the shoe dropped.

She informed me that a child said I had yelled and told them to ""Shut up"" while we were playing Jeopardy, and that I was receiving a verbal warning that I needed to sign off on. I did my best to explain that I certainly had not done that, because I would never say that to a child, and I absolutely would not yell at a child. I said that I perhaps had said ""shush"", and maybe the kid had misheard?  She told me that he had complained to the site lead, who told his parents.  She also said that he told his parents he was mostly upset because I ""had hurt his feelings and didn't apologize to him"". 

He wasn't upset in the slightest after this happened, mind you, and interacted happily and normally with me until he went home later. 

This means that he waited until yesterday to tell someone about what had supposedly happened, because there was no point on Monday that he went to the office or spoke to the site lead, as he was in site of either me or my co-teacher the entirety of the day before he left.

Then I remembered the incident with the ""autistic monkeys"" name, and explained the scenario to her. I told her verbatim what I said to him.

Her response was that we should never yell at a child, and I said that I certainly did not yell, and didn't even raise my voice, I was just very firm with what I said. She then started on about how that's basically the same thing, and that we shouldn't do that either. She said that ""They're just kids, they make jokes about autism and things like that because they don't have filters yet and don't know better. You have to be the adult in these situations."" 

She could not have cared less about hearing what actually transpired. She obviously did not believe me, or if she did, didn't think it mattered that none of what this child said had happened had actually happened.

What in the world was I supposed to do differently? Just let him make jokes about things that shouldn't be joked about? This kid was 11 or 12, more than old enough to be a decent person if he cared to be, and certainly old enough to know that joking about disabled people isn't acceptable. 

Why in the everloving eff did I get in trouble for something that quite literally did not happen? 

I'll be searching for a new job now, because I am definitely not making enough to put up with this shit from anyone, let alone upper management. $17/hr is barely enough to pay my bills with the 20 - 25 hours max I'm scheduled a week. Especially since I haven't been given a single break in the three weeks I've been with the company; which, yes, I will be reporting to the state labor board, because by law in my state they're required to give us at least 10 minutes for each shift we work that's 3.5 hours or longer. I'm waiting until I either quit or have been there longer to do so because they owe me money for each day they don't give me my break, and it's entirely on them to ensure they're following labor laws, not on me."

I live with my family and I’ve jumped at the opportunity to take the food after no one else offers to. I usually take it because I don’t want it to get thrown away and wasted so I figure I’ll save it for later or give it to a family member.

I'm an international worker based in Mexico and worked there for about 8 months with a wage of $10/h.  


This came as a gigantic surprise since 2 weeks ago I was just in a meeting where they told me my performance was fine, and they didn't see no problem with me apart from being late to a few meetings. They told me the reason they laid me off was performance issues apart from having to cut costs.  


The shiniest part is that I was promised, obviously not on paper, that I would get a raise by the first 6 months, that just went by, and then was promised again a few weeks ago a raise by the end of the year which now will never come.  


They also said they could give me a 2-week period of work but would be completely different to my usual hourly rate and now more objective based which means a ton less money.  


I'm a bit scared since I depended on this job to survive and even though I have some money saved, I will struggle until I get a new job.  


What can I do about this? Are there any laws protecting me in this situation? I also got a coworker that was laid off the same way and is in the same situation.

To make a long story short, I've been having issues with a volunteer, who is a former teacher. She is very condescending towards me and if I ask her to do something, she refuses. This past weekend, the facilities manager called me while the kids were playing outside and said I needed to get the kids out of the playground. A man on our watch list had been watching from his car for the past 10 minutes. In this case, I give a signal saying, ""Let's go inside, we are going to watch a movie."" This alerts the volunteers that something is not right, but also doesn't alarm the kids. This particular volunteer kept asking me why why why. I quietly explained that I would tell her ""which movie when we get there."" But she wanted to know why. I told her that I would explain once we were all inside. Then she told me, ""No we are not going inside."" I told her that I was not asking her. She refused to go inside.

Afterwards, I asked her why she refused to go inside and she said, ""It was because I didn't know why and I didn't see anything wrong."" I told her that if she ever does that again, we will be sitting down and discussing whether she is fit to continue volunteering. I informed my boss what happened and she told me to let it go and that I should even be grateful we have this lady as a volunteer. I told her if the children are ever in immediate danger, I don't trust that she will follow instructions. She said, ""Well they weren't so just let this one roll off the shoulder.""

We are supported and protected by a union.  A co-worker of mine has now had over 30 absences this school year and we’re only about 2/3rds of the way through the school year. (We have a 180-day school year and a couple of additional staff days.) She had a high absenteeism rate the last two school years too but when disciplinary action was taken against her, the union rep took her side and fought for her so she wasn’t fired or even disciplined.  I know I should just mind my own business, but we are already stretched rather thin enough as it is and we aides don’t have substitutes for us if we have to be out. (Heck, it’s hard enough to find substitutes for the teachers as it is. Usually, one of us winds up having to cover instead.) Her chronic absenteeism has created a lot more work for the rest of us and meant that students have had to go without much-needed (And often required, if they’re on an IEP or 504 plan.) supports and interventions. The thing that really enrages me right now is that the district is facing budget cuts. Seniority is the only basis used and the last ones hired are always the first ones fired or at least transferred to a different building. We’re going to be losing an aide who has less seniority than her but has proven to be a reliable, responsible, and dependable worker while we’re stuck with Flaky. She is great with the students when she does show up and acts like a nice, sweet person. But she’s definitely learned how to play the system. "

The only other person who can cover part of my job.

 Managers keep claiming we don't have the budget to replace employees who left/retired during the last 2 years. 

I had a sudden emergency,  landed in the ER, 2 surgeries later and I'm out for 2 to 3 weeks. I text my lead and give her the heads up that I will be out at least the remaining 3 days of the week, and unsure past that. As I hadn't gone to surgery yet. 

Checked my email (several days later) and see the email telling the team my emergency and I'm out the remainder of the week. My manager responded to the whole team with ""great, just we needed ☹️"" (literally included the frowny face)

Since she has apparently complained about the inconvenience even tho she can't cover anything and is ok with my poor lead working 12+ hr days to cover what she can. I guess ppl keep asking her questions about my stuff that noone else knows how to do,and she can't find anyone to sort it out. 😆😆😆 she was warned so many times about that! 

I plan on looking for a new job as soon as I finish moving out of state in September. Fuck her and this job. IF I didn't need it for my house loan, I'd be out ASAP. 

Now, to decide whether to play nice and pretend I don't know the BS poor me card she has been playing in my absence or call her out on it when she acts like she cares. Her lack of sympathy displayed to the entire team was not appreciated. 

Also wonder if I could make a complaint about her comment. The company is SUPER big on not offending anyone and being aware of how you communicate etc. I get the lecture alot about not being so blunt, and being aware of my audience. 

Rant over, would you call a bitch manager out if they treated you that way? Or not rock the boat and just wait until you have your out and hit her with the notice?

Every approval, proposal, idea, feedback and performance review goes through/done by said founder — however my least favorite aspect of this setup is by the end of the month, he becomes my HR when dealing with compensation issues, etc and it is so draining, that on top of every thing else, I need to deal with another layer of friction with the same person.

All I’m saying is, I took the convenience of having access to a separate person/deparment for HR for granted. Having to talk money to the same guy who has access to every mistake, mishap or inefficiency he perceives to be is taking a toll on me. If I have feedback on management, I direct the conversation to him and it pains me to be this honest knowing it could easily impact other areas of my work."

Recently, the company I work for has become more hectic in tracking our activities. I'm certain that Slack conversations are being monitored. They track the minutes we spend on the phone talking to clients. Now, they are requiring us to use the WeCom (WeChat corporate) version so they can monitor all text conversations and client WeChat accounts.

Now, all of this may still be acceptable considering that most of us work remotely, and some companies do use these metrics. They also provide us with work phones to use.

However, what really bothers me is that in order for us to work with third-party clients on WeCome, we need to verify the account. This requires providing a form of ID and a personal bank statement with our legal name and address on it. We all know that WeChat is infamous for its privacy breaches and other horror stories, and this makes me extremely uncomfortable.

I would like to reject this request, but I'm worried that it might lead to termination or they may find other reasons to affect my bonuses, etc. What would you do in this situation?

P.S. The employer is located in NYC. Are there any policies that prevent companies from forcing employees to use spyware that requires personal information?

With no connections and lots of hard work, I was finally able to get an entry level position in my dream industry in July 2022.

It's not my first entry level job in the industry, but it is my dream company. I struggled a bit when I started but I worked really hard my first year and it showed in my number results. I ended up achieving the same number results as my senior coworkers so in October 2023, I decided to ask for a promotion.

My boss said that they were actually going to bring up my promotion during the end year reviews and that they will see if they could push for it early. (Usually our annual salary increases are around February). I was told to be patient because the process could take a while.

I asked for an update regularly every other week and was always told ""no updates yet"" or ""be patient, it's coming"" and eventually after enough pestering, I received my promotion offer letter.

Of less than a $4 increase. 

In my industry, entry level positions are paid between $21-$26/hr. Mid level positions are paid from $30-$41/hr

My new salary is $26/hr.

I was very upset and asked if this is what they thought all of my hard work and revenue I brought in to this company is worth.

My boss said no but unfortunately the standard promotion salary increase is 10%

I reluctantly signed the contract anyways because at least my company has a lot of perks and benefits which include $100 reimbursement for parking and $20/week meal delivery credits

Unfortunately, at the start of this year, they took away the parking reimbursement & meal benefits. Instead my company is now forcing me to pay $40 a month for parking. I opted out of paying for parking and decided to park a mile away in neighborhoods so I don't have to pay for parking.

I talked to my boss and they said if I had an issue with it, I should talk to the director of HR.
So I immediately set up a meeting and talked about my unfair salary and missing benefits. 

After much discussion, The director of HR eventually told me there's nothing they can do about the perks but if I am unhappy with my salary they could have another discussion regarding that. They proceed to say they do market research to evaluate a fair salary. I told them my research shows I am deserving of $35/hr and I am more than happy to pass along all of my research I have done as well. The director of HR proceeds to say we can loop in my manager and the new HR manager of our branch for meeting to further discuss this. And I agreed.

I still haven't heard back from the director in February, so I sent an email to them regarding the research and asked when we can schedule a meeting.

No response.

Follow up message a couple weeks later.

No response.

Today, my boss gives me a letter with a 5% salary increase of a bit more than a dollar for our annual increase. 


What do I do in this situation?
Is there any laws that protect me?

It seems like a lot of people just get the money and also glam and glamour by talking and selling stuff. Those consultancy people or business people who outsource the work to others, and then sell the finished product and get the credit as the owner of the businesses.  You get less when you belong to the group that does the work in the background. The only thing you get is more work and little recognition. 

Sometimes when you try to speak up to get credit for your work, those people with more power and status can threaten to squash you just because you're smaller than them in terms of societal status or earning power. Even though they're using your work and just slapping their own name on it to get credit. 

Why is society structured this way? Shouldn't builders and doers get more credit than people who just talk and present but don't actually build the products or solutions that are useful? Is it something in human civilisation that can never be changed? "

I’m on a few job sites so my resume is open so companies can reach out to me. I’m still in my early 20s with no degree or higher education, no car and I’m neurodivergent so I’m limited and picky on who I chose to work for so I know my travel time is worth it to me. 
I recently got reached out by a company to come in for an interview and they advertised it as me basically plugging in info to a computer for employees and I was very excited because I want to finally make steps into an office space since I can’t stand for very long and I’m still trying to figure out what I want to do with my life career wise. 
I accepted the interview and I came in when I was supposed to. I got there and signed in and there were other people there. We all got called in individually for a 1st round interview. I passed with flying colors and was put into a conference room with a video that was supposed to explain what my job would entail when it didn’t at all. Had a guy dressed really nicely come in and basically talk up the company and have us fill out 2 packets of more questions. Something important I should mention is they did not bring up a base pay and only brought up what I could make in a week and how long it typically took to move up in rank. They also wanted us to pay for part of getting your insurance license essentially. 
I turned mine in and they called me saying they’d like a second interview with me on Monday and I was very excited cause they told me I was their top pick. They told me to ask my family/friends/myself and write down these questions they/I had about the job and bring them with me. I spent all night coming up with questions. But the next morning my brain kept yelling at me to check Glassdoor and the reviews were awful pretty much. The only 5.0 star ratings sounded like they were plugs from the company and all came out the same but in different wording. The only seeming honest reviews were 1.0 star. 
A lot of those 1 star reviews mentioned that money was distributed in an odd fashion. 
Do research before you go to an interview when a company reaches out to you.
I could be wrong but there were some blaring red flags for me 

Sorry if this is worded odd I’m tired and it’s late 

TLDR: Took random interview that had shady wording and shitty reviews"

So I remind him when my two weeks comes up. Says he'll get to it. I have less than two weeks left and shoot him a text asking about the transfer. Says he'll get to it by X day.  When I come in today and ask he says that I should have been trying to contact that store for a transfer all along, and he's not at fault. Basically tells me I'm SoL.

I work(ed) for a shitty fire alarm monitoring company for about 2 years. Always showed up and did my job despite working with extremely racist and bigoted people on a daily basis. On 3/13 I had a near fall, there wasn’t really any impact but I believe I messed my back up while catching myself. I’ve had lower left back pain that’s been going down the back of left leg since the day of the incident. I informed my job and went to a company provided physician (3/15) who told me I would only be able to perform very limited work with no lifting/climbing/walking. Being that my job basically requires all of that, they were unable to accommodate those work restrictions. Also, I took a drug test at the physician when I initially went. Fast forward to 3/19 and I’m still out and in pain, I let HR know I was still in pain and was hoping to feel better within the next week or 2. All I get in response from them is a request to meet my manager & HR at the office on 3/21. I notice on my work phone that I’ve been removed from everything and all access has been revoked. I’m not an idiot, I know what that meeting is for and I wasn’t about to drive 90 minutes, uncomfortable and in pain, just to get fired. So I didn’t go. A few days later I reached out to HR and I was right, they were terminating me. Apparently, the reason was because I refused to take a drug test after the incident even though I took a drug test at the place they appointed me to. HR lady is confused and tells me I should have told them, but regardless their decision still stands. I was counting on workers comp to help me with bills but now I’m pretty fucked and will have to pull from savings unfortunately. Looking back, I regret not speaking up to certain people in fear of being fired, considering I was going to get fired like this anyway.
Thanks for reading and fuck these companies.

tldr; I injured my back and went to a company provided doctor who diagnosed me and made me take a drug test. I was fired the following week for refusing to take a drug test even though that’s not what happened. HR told me a I should’ve said something and now there’s nothing I can do. "

Just this morning a coworker of mine was talking about her non-binary niece. The topic came up with how many kids we want/have and only children. My coworkers niece is an only child. My coworkers exact words were, ""my niece is an only child and she's weird. She's all fucked up. She dosent know if she's a girl, boy, it, they. She needs help."" I told my coworker that her niece would still be non-binary if there were siblings involved. My coworker said that, ""no she wouldn't. She wouldn't be bored and fucked up so much that she needs something to do.""

1,2024-03-28,The conflict between me and the goverment,u/winterberrymeadow,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bpvvmw/the_conflict_between_me_and_the_goverment/,antiwork,"I haven't been okay for long time. It started already when I was a child. I endured abuse at home and outside it. That is why I got sick. I have severe traumas that caused me to get PTSD, DPD and I also suffer from anxiety and adhd. If that wasn't enough, I also have autism and adhd.

I always felt like outsider because of my illnesses. I was told I couldn't live normal life and do what others do. I was also bullied. That is why I became perfectionist and over achiever. I wanted to prove that I am like anybody else, even better, that I am better than everyone else. I wanted to give reason for people to like me and accept me. Something I never felt I had.

It was all okay until I graduated and got my first job. Worklife wasn't at all what I imagined. While I was appreciated in uni for being smart and talented, it wasn't the case at work. No one cared about me or my potential. They just wanted me to do my job. 

I left that job in hopes it would get better. Despite landing many interviews, I was always the second. I was left feeling rejected and worthless.

It was devastating. I thought I would be somebody, that I would matter. I had build my identity around achedemical success and my career. Since I was failing at that, I felt like there was no reason for my being. I think without my spouse I would have killed myself.

I think the breaking point was my mom dying in car crash. It was eye opening moment. She was only 55 and I didn't want to end up like her. She had been miserable all her life and hoped that one day it will be different. I realised that I don't want to live my life like that. I might have only this moment and I never know when I will die.

So I decided to change everything. I had been going on therapy for years and had other professional help before that. But this time, I really made some big changes. I decided to find myself outside of work. Who I am, what makes me happy and what I want in life.

It hasn't been easy. I have those moments where I feel like a failure since I am 27 and have no glue what I will do in life. I see others going forward but I feel like I am stalling. But mostly, I am happy. I have discovered things about myself, found some great hobbies and I am feeling better. But there is one factor hindering my process. The outside pressure of going back to work.

 I live in a country where there is social security and currently I am not required to look for jobs since I am officially on paid sick leave. But they keep calling me and asking when I want to go back to work and not taking seriously my illnesses.

It took lot of courage and will power to make the change. I have tried to adjust over a year and I am still struggling. Thinking even applying for jobs gives me panic attack and dissociation since working was very traumatic experience for me.

So it feels very bad the goverment thinks I am just having a holiday. I know I am fortunate for having social security and I am grateful for it. But it has been uphill battle to get the help I need. 

It is not that I want to be out of work rest of my life. But they say I have to go to back to the work I was doing. Despite it being ill fit for me. I would like to explore some other options. Some work that I could do part time that wasn't too mentally or physically taxing since my condition is not that great. I am not that picky when it comes to that. I just don't want the work to suck all the life out of me.

But the goverment officials think since I have uni degree that I should use it and get work from my field. They don't listen to me when I say that it isn't possible.

I feel like it was such a big mistake to go to uni. "

The manager said they couldn't find fault in my punctuation, work ethic or willingness to learn the job and I learned it faster than most, (I genuinely believe I knew more about the job than 2 of my coworkers did, and they were there for a year). But also, I didn't ""gel with the co-workers"", which I think is complete horseshit.

Every criticism about my character I could find in every other employee, being cold and rude to me from the get go. On more than a few occasions I'd be standing in silence doing my work when they'd just standing in the corner chatting about tik-tok and whatever was going on pop-culture wise. I shouted at one customer once (who was being a dickhead) and the manager has used that example as to why I'm not the right fit. They gave me 2 weeks to improve and even though they literally said ""yeah nothing else bad has happened, but I just can't get that first instance out of my head"", as if they've never lost their cool with customer before. 

I never missed a day, covered other people who were sick or going through personal issues. The manager is getting a promotion later and someone else will have to become manager, except the other employees have mentioned how they're ""over the job"" and that they probably won't be here at the end of the year. I genuinely enjoyed the job, but I'm the one they let go, because I wasn't engaged in every conversation all day or didn't wear a smile 24/7. This life is a joke.

It’s the story of oppressed people overthrowing their masters.

[Strike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLiNKaUp0AA)—This one’s also Eisenstein. It’s a little harder to watch but is basically how modern cinema was invented. It’s the story of workers organizing in a factory versus their bosses, and it’s excellent!

Anything by Chaplin, but particularly [Modern Times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY6ItxyNGgA)—Chaplin liked to hang out with the Soviet ambassador, and in Modern Times his Tramp character waves a red flag in front of a bunch of striking workers. I wonder what the greatest filmmaker in history was trying to suggest?

The Battle of Algiers—a fun, excellent, moving film that is basically an instructional manual for how to overthrow oppressors. It also shows how anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism connects to anti-capitalism.

War and Peace—The story takes place during the Napoleonic Wars and does not, at first glance, seem to be very political, especially since all the main characters are Russian nobles. But the fact that this is a Soviet film, and that it blows 99% of Hollywood movies completely out of the water—with excellent acting, writing, sets, costumes, cinematography, and truly spectacular battle scenes—is a political statement in itself.

Robocop—on the face of it, this is a cop movie, but it’s really so much more. It’s about how a worker is so alienated from his world that he even becomes alienated from his own personality and memories. Even at the very end, “Murphy”—is he a man remembering his past, or a robot (the word means “worker”) trying to become someone he never was?—is still working for the company. This is an incredibly violent movie, but the most disturbing part, for me, is when a bunch of corporate executives yell at the police and order them around. Everyone knows that corporations run the USA, but it’s very in your face in that scene.

Starship Troopers—is this an anti-work film? It’s not just a satire of fascism, but also a satire of liberalism, as the Federation depicted in the film is difficult to distinguish from the modern USA, and is, if anything, even more progressive than we are. (Citizenship isn’t limited to soldiers in the USA, but I think we can all agree that some people in the USA have an easier time voting than others, while millions of people living here (convicts, undocumented immigrants, children, people voting for non-corporate candidates in certain primaries) are not allowed to vote at all.) Nobody cares about showering naked with other genders and the president is a Black woman! The film, however, fails to depict the bugs as anything other than monsters, and the propaganda reels match what we see in the rest of the film, suggesting that the propaganda is actually correct! And yet Starship Troopers was supposed to be a film that could have been made in the Starship Troopers universe, so that’s probably why. I suppose the only positive message we can get from this film is to leave the bugs alone!

Sorry To Bother You—a story that, at first glance, seems like it’s about working at a call center. But anyone who’s seen this movie will tell you that there’s a lot more to it, and a lot more that is going to completely surprise you. An excellent movie.Andor—literally the story of young Stalin, who was the Robin Hood of the Caucasus before he was elected leader of the USSR. (The showrunner has said that he read biographies of Stalin to prepare for the show.) Try reading leftwing sources on Stalin ([his interview with HG Wells, for instance](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1934/07/23.htm)) instead of rightwing sources (standard histories found everywhere in the West) which your boss also loves. It’s weird—George Lucas has repeatedly said that Star Wars is about the Viet Cong defeating the USA, and James Cameron has said similar things about Avatar. But a lot of people refuse to accept this!

Debatable anti-work movies and TV shows:

Squid Game—is this anti-work? All the characters in the movie are basically competing against each other and working as hard as possible, and none of them ever unite against their overlords. It also ends (spoiler alert) with a cop helping a homeless person. Give me a break! We all know what cops do to homeless people!

Fight Club—this is an anti-consumerism movie, not an anti-work movie.

Parasite—I love this movie, and the director/writer is a communist, but it’s a little difficult to figure out. Is it basically a moral lesson about how, when workers fail to work together, they end up destroying each other?

Dune—I’m one of those dorks who thinks that the Syfy miniseries is the best version. The new movies honestly bored me. I read all the original Dune books when I was a teenager and loved them. I still do. But they are incredibly orientalist. As certain events in certain places have recently shown, the Fremen can defeat the Harkonnen without the help of the Atreides!

Movies that are definitely not anti-work:The Office. Blue collar work is not necessarily better than white collar work. All labor is exploitative under capitalism.

Are there any here that I missed?"

We are always looking for employees and struggle to find and keep people. About 2 months ago they hired a new woman. I don't know why this girl has a huge problem with me. It's like being in high school working with her. Anyway she has already once screamed and swore at me once. Manager spoke with her that's was it. A few days ago she did it again. Only this time she threatened to punch me in my face as well. She has not been let go. So my shift starts in an hour and I am seriously considering not showing. I find it unbelievable that my supervisor expects mes to just ignore this behavior. When is she going to go too far? When she acts on her threats? I don't know any advice anyone?

As most of you know, bank teller performance is based on sales quotas met. My performance was amazing, even my managers were stunned with it. 

Many people as a bank teller usually move up to other roles in the bank and I tried corporate level jobs because I hated the sales aspect in retail level and had 0 luck. Then I started trying for retail level, potentially moving up to an advisor, still no luck. Then my manager said we had an advisor leave and could replace you for his role. However, now I’m not getting the position because the bank has a hiring freeze. The bank is not doing any promoting or hiring right not and they’re cutting hours. They even laid off a large amount of the workforce. 

All I got is a pay raise is a $1 increase hourly, despite making an outstanding number of sales. My manager the other day even said “you’re performance was amazing, it dropped now, what happened?” I was performing amazing but it got me no where.

Maternity liaison and stop smoking practitioner (well that’s fucking depressing)

Retail assistant (in a vape shop)

Work experience officer

Client onboarding officer (this one is exciting AND fast-paced so get your applications in quickly people)

I wear a very specific and crazy work uniform that is many layers, quite an avante garde costume at a themed restaurant. I have been wearing it for 10 months and they will not launder it and refuse for me to launder it myself. It has not even been sprayed with Lysol because the materials are very expensive(?!)
Recently, a position has opened up for one of the other costumes and  my manager is having random candidates for the job also try on MY costume without taking any precaution to have them wear clean, sanitary protective clothing. Just in their dirty street clothes. I am totally grossed out for them and me, as the costume smells quite bad and is covered in my  (blood), sweat and tears from working in it even in 100+ degree conditions. 

When I first tried on the costume when I was a candidate for the job, it was new and I had someone with knowledge on proper care assisting me. My manager was just throwing it around the ground. It is a cultural item so it’s a bit disrespectful and she certainly didn’t have the candidate bring clean inner clothing. 

I already have pretty intense body acne for 10 months from sweating in the costume and how dirty it is. The idea of introducing a strangers dirt, skin, germs and allergens to my costume by sharing it is absolutely horrifying to me. I am not sure if they were messing around for fun, or if they intend for us to now both wear this costume. I absolutely would not share with someone else unless they launder it each time as it is very unhygienic. One of the costume pieces is quite literally ruffley bloomer shorts (which are practically underwear) and the only part of the costume I’m allowed to launder. 


I wear this every time I work, 3-5 days a week and do not wear any regular clothing there. As the costume is company property, do I have any rights here?"
15,2024-03-28,Younger gens worker strike/ general workers strike. ,u/Smoof-brain,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bpxrb1/younger_gens_worker_strike_general_workers_strike/,antiwork,"So I want to start this discussion and see if there’s anyone who’d actually like to help organize this and had networking to help do so. But the other day I stumbled across the world happiness index and Americans especially our generation is pretty unhappy. When asked much of the unhappiness comes from wealth inequality and climate concerns. Well this prompted me to look up wealth owned by generations, and no surprise boomers own 50% of total wealth at $78 trillion gen x  29.5% at $29 trillion, silent gen at 11.9% $18 trillion, then finally millennials at 8.5% $13 trillion. It’s clear that subsequent generations are doing worse and worse financially compared to previous generations. My proposal is to basically copy what Shawn Fain had done with the autoworkers union, and effectively create a workers union for a generation rather than a specific industry. If enough people join the fee could be very minimal, but enough to start building a strike fund. Once enough money was collected in said strike fund, then we can choose specific markets in the US to disrupt one at a time, while paying members from the strike fund. So if millennials are highly represented in tech we organize a
Strike for all members in that industry for a given amount of time. Then do one for hospitality and so on. But the overall goal would be to show that the proletariat can organize and revolt against the owner class. There’s no reason why any of should accept poverty hunger and homelessness, while dip shits like bezos, Zuckerberg, and musk exist. This is a very daunting task, but I don’t see a better way of instituting the type of change many of us want. Unfortunately with the electoral college and a large contingent of greedy voters who’ve already made theirs and are incentivized to maintain the status quo, I think something like this would affect the quickest change and wake people up. This is my first time posting about this I just want to see how much traction the idea gets. "

It's not perfect but I'm satisfied so far with what I've got.

The problem is that I have an older coworker in his 40s who is constantly trying to make me look bad in front of everyone. He only talks loud when he is talking with me and he usually comes to my place to peep on my work and correct mistakes out loud and makes sure everyone else is listening. This week I started working on a project that he assigned to me a few weeks ago, and started raising his voice telling me I'm lazy for not starting earlier (he doesn't seem to remember that I had other projects to take care of, all of them with strict deadlines). Just a few days ago the company hired a new manager to replace the older one who retired, this new one had a big meeting with all of us to introduce ourselves and talk about company problems and workload, and he was the only one in that entire room that said that sometimes I work ""slowly"" or in a lazy or unproductive way, despite everyone else (\~10 other people) agreeing that I haven't stopped working ever since I was hired, that I'm always looking for more stuff to do and learn and I'm a very motivated person.

How do I deal with this guy? I'm in my 20s, I am aware that I'm still learning, and everyone else knows I'm the least experienced guy here, I don't plan to quit so soon as I'm gaining some nice experience here, but I'm not in a mood to deal with this 40yo man whose only fun thing in life is talk crap about me in front of everyone for the next 1-2 years. If it was a one time thing, I would forget about it and even think he's just trying to teach me in a more assertive way. But everyday he is in the office with me? Nah. I'm starting to get afraid other managers or directors will start getting the wrong impression of me just because of this one guy and screw me up in the future.

This has been going on for 4 months now, and I'm starting to get tired of this guy. I just want to do my job, get along decently with everyone else, and go home. I don't think I'm asking for much here."

I’ve worked for my company for 2 years and 2 months (UK) 

In 2021 I got sexually harassed and assaulted by an employee whilst working abroad and also got bullied by another colleague (with a long history of bullying) 

I reported both of these incidences, the bullying on time but the sexual harassment after 3 months. They were ignored by HR, or more accurately, laughed away. 

I have gone through a long process; too many details but for now, I am signed off, I am partly on disability for the stress they caused me affecting my body and I am waiting to be fired. My bully has been fired (unrelated to me) and my sexual assaulter has been promoted to my boss. 

 the HR is so incompetent I just don’t think they will remember I am there to fire me. I stopped giving my sick notes in January (March 28th now) so they should have contacted me about that but haven’t. I have wanted to write my experiences and put them on LinkedIn, omitting names and specifics so they can’t come after me and can’t attack me for libel and slander. 

My sick pay and SSP ran out but payroll hadn’t worked out my wages properly so I got a last payment of £500 but that is the last. I guess I’m still entitled to some holiday pay for this year but I would prefer the severance and to keep my benefits. Any tips? "

I have been late a few times because of daycare closings for provider being very sick and I have no one else, no family/friends etc. Before I started working here I told my manager that & my situation so they would be aware just in case. 

Aanyways, I’ve had a hr meeting with my manager a month ago about attendance for first time & basically said if I miss one more day even if I’m sick even with a doctors note I will be fired basically. 
I ended up overlooking all the occurrences they had listed for me and a few of them were days I don’t even work on/scheduled that I was marked for an occurrence. So I brought that up to hr & they supposably fixed it & my manager told me oh must’ve been a mistake etc which I know is bs cause of toxic they are. They allow other employees to do whatever and treat me however as well even after I’ve brought up stuff to them about other employees. I’ve had to handle alot on my own.

I left one task not done & not even 15 minutes after I left my manager somehow magically walked downstairs to where I work & checked on my area specifically then texted me pic of something I missed to do and how it needs to be done and etc. I come in to messes all the time from other shifts and don’t complain ever cause no one cares when it comes to me there.

After reading a lot of posts on this sub and other, I have this dystopian opinion of jobs as more of a waste of time in life. Yes, you can earn money, but that money will go to usual requirements like electricity, gas, water, landlord, food and so nothing will be left to entertain yourself. I'm also scared of having to deal with awful colleagues, boss and customers. Yes, I'm mentally ill and have done a suicide attempt a month ago after someone told me that I'm a ""moron, who doesn't see good in life"" and cut me off life. This is overreaction, I agree, but a lot of bad social interactions have happened in life before with many other people, so the last situation was like beating a dead horse. Even in a psych ward I was, for the lack of a better word, set free with being told by psychiatrist ""what's the point of treating you if you don't want to do anything?"". While yes, he's right that I don't want anything in life anymore and don't see good reasons to exist because the pain from life is too much to endure, this was the worst experience with a psychiatrist and in general one of the worst month, while feeling horrible with meds. I'm 21 by the way and even people from ambulance were surprised I was that age with my outlook on life (most likely because usually teenagers have thoughts like these. I've just never thrown them away) My parents are of course not happy and don't give any pocket money obviously because of all this.

3,2024-03-28,Catty Coworker Advice,u/Obvious_Milk124,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bq20ak/catty_coworker_advice/,antiwork,"I started at my company about 10 months ago and it is the best place I've ever worked. I am in a great position to move up at my year mark. However, I have a coworker who seems to be trying to sabotage this and bring me down in front of others behind my back. I am hurt and am starting to feel a bit jaded.

The saboteur is the girl who trained me. She's a few years younger than me, and at my year mark she will have been at the company just short of two years. I felt like we were friends and in a good place however I think her need for control and maybe jealousy (?) is leading her to put me down in front of our higher ups.

When I first started I believe there was some minor friction between us. During the course of training I would ask why the process of what we were doing was in place to get a fuller understanding of our processes. I got the feeling like she wanted to control certain things that didn't matter and actually slowed down the process of what we were doing.

For example: While teaching me how to format a report, I would use shortcuts like ""Ctrl C"" to copy rather than right clicking and selecting ""Copy"". She would act frustrated by this and told me multiple times I needed to do it the same way she did.
In response I would gently reply that it was a shortcut that achieved the same result. However, she kept on insisting I needed to do it the same way she did. In the end I did it the same way while she trained me, then once training was over, I would use the keyboard shortcuts and things to be more efficient (again, it achieved the exact same thing. It just took me less time than her process.)

Anyways, once I was fully trained I felt like this friction went away and we were even... Friends. Maybe not close, but I felt we got a long well and I wish nothing but the best for her. I have even had conversations with her about both of our career paths forward and have been super supportive of her (though she does seem lost on how she wants to move forward).

Now to the career development part. Like I said in the beginning, I am in a great position to move up quickly. The saboteur and I are in the same basic bottom level postion. However, I've been in this type of position longer than she has (just not at this company). My degree is a specialized one that I've been able to utilize a lot for my department. Utilizing those skills are above and beyond my job description and my department has continuously recognized that. 

At my boss's request, I created a tracking spreadsheet where I put down all of the extra projects I'd done since I started and it equaled 60+ projects and over 500 hours of extra work. During this time I have been able to complete all of my real job projects. The 500 hours of work is time I would have been spending twiddling my thumbs asking for work to do. I like to stay busy, I enjoy these extra projects, AND I am really pushing for a promotion as soon as possible. So this extra work does not bother me at all. The extra work is not stepping on her toes or taking over something she wants to do because it is not a skill she has. If I understand correctly, she just finished her counseling degree this semester.

We don't have a specific position for my career field in our department, but I've been in talks with quite a few of our higher ups and they feel like it's very possible for one to be created. I know it's not a guarantee. But I am excited about the possibility and am working hard to make it a reality.

Now onto the sabotage part...
She has been making comments in front of our higher ups that paint me in a bad light. On Tuesday while I was sick from the office, she quietly made a comment that one of our meetings ""had gone downhill"" since I took over (the takeover was a splitting of duties that SHE proposed to our boss to take more things off her plate, not a true takeover). The meeting doesn't actually accomplish much and we are working on redesigning it entirely to actually make it useful for everyone. Her comment was made while those discussions of change were taking place.

Another example is that she recently made a comment that she was stressed. I offered to help if she needed it and was more than willing to step in and take things off her plate. We had a meeting later that day and she called me out in front of everyone asking for help in a way that made it made it sound like I wasn't doing enough and again painted me in a bad light.

How would you deal with this situation?

I am frustrated and hurt.
I don't wish bad for her, but she's wishing bad for me. I am curious what other people would do in this situation. What is the best and most professional way to move forward?

TLDR: A coworker is putting me down in front of others seemingly in an attempt to hurt my possibility at a promotion. How do I move forward in a professional manner?"

HR and the senior director at my workplace did an internal investigation and they were PISSED. I was:  


A) let go under false pretenses (they told HR that I didn't get my shift covered/communicate it)  


B) Supposed to be able to at least finish out my shift so my clients didn't get screwed (I'm in social services) and document what I had for the day, *NOT* leave mid-shift and been asked to immediately leave the building.

Not only are my supervisors going to get ""a ton more training"" because the internal investigation turned out in my favor--I was also told that I'm leaving on ""excellent standing"" and they would be ""happy to have me back at any program in the future"".  


And the zinger? I'm getting paid out AND my insurance benefits are going to be paid for until after my resignation date as there was no reason to terminate me and it is indeed illegal to immediately enact resignation in my state (PA) without paying out a worker through the resignation date.   


KNOW YOUR RIGHTS, TALK TO HR, TELL THEM WHAT YOUR BOSSES DID. REPORT EVERYTHING THEY DID TO THEIR BOSSES.

3,2024-03-28,Making data requests in employment verification systems,u/couchfucker2,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bq4hr0/making_data_requests_in_employment_verification/,antiwork,"Anyone ever do this? I’m trying to figure out exactly how employment verification works, basically what do hiring companies have on us when we apply? So I’ve been snooping around HR reddit, learning a bunch of interesting info about how HR professionals operate around hiring and their general attitudes.

My understanding is calling previous employers for verification is time consuming, and add to that, these people are also getting constant requests for their own previous employees for verification requests. So there’s been a number of websites that try to make this faster. From what I can see so far, they have our prev company name, employment dates, wage information, and “status”, credit reports and possibly more. Personally my main concern is the employee status part, because I want to see if they report if you were terminated and ineligible to be rehired. The websites are very dodgy though unless you wanna go through their sales process, no surprise.

I’ve learned about two so far, one is called 
Vault Verify - You can request a copy of your info here: https://www.vaultverify.com/contact-us/

The other is run by our most prolific abusers of data, Equifax and its called The Work Number. I found their login impossible to figure out and even when I did it timed out and wouldn’t let me in (of course). So I ended up calling them 

Equifax - (800) 996-7566

Anyway I requested my info from both, I’ll see what happens and report back if it’s useful.

i've always struggled with finding and keeping a job, for many reasons. I suffered from severe social anxiety as a teenager and in college, and also don't drive. I had a few work experiences but only worked at each place (camp counselor, barista, cashier, housekeeper) for a couple of months each, either because my mental health spiraled or I moved. I worked at an art gallery at my college, where I studied anthropology and political science. I was set to graduate in spring 2020 when COVID hit, my school shut down, and I moved again with a plan to finish my last semester over the summer. I started working as a cashier when my summer classes started, but I fell extremely ill with mono for several months, causing me to lose my job and drop out of university. since then, I've moved around a couple more times and became an informal caretaker for my fiance, and have done onlyfans/SW to keep us alive. it used to pay alright at first, but it's been way more of a struggle lately so I've been looking for a more stable civ job. I had issues with my social security card and wasn't even able to apply to jobs until the start of this year, when I got it replaced.

since then I've been applying to every job that I believe I even remotely qualify for, mostly barista/cashier/fast food/housekeeping positions that don't require much experience since I .... don't have much. out of hundreds of applications sent out, I've only gotten 2 interviews and both were cancelled hours before they were supposed to occur via an AI-generated email. every day I wake up and doomscroll through Indeed, check local job boards online and at the library, check the websites of local small and chain businesses, and even walk around my city with my resume looking for hiring signs. it's beyond humiliating, especially with nothing to show for it yet. I don't know if it's because I'm visibly trans, or because my employment history is a bit shaky, or because the positions were already filled, or because the position never existed in the first place, but it's getting harder and harder not to take every rejection as a personal moral failing, especially when I have a loved one (and several animals) relying on me.

it's been affecting both my physical and mental health tremendously. I feel extremely nauseous every waking moment and haven't had a full meal in weeks. from the moment I wake up in the morning to when I fall asleep at night, my heart races and pounds as if my life is in danger. I feel so guilty for not being able to secure a job by now, and can't stop obsessing over what I could've done differently as a teenager/college student to have avoided this. in addition, ever since I had mono that summer, I've experienced brain fog and fatigue that has really affected both my memory and my self esteem. I haven't been able to teach myself any new skills that would make me more employable. it honestly feels like my brain is broken most of the time. so I'm dealing with all of this while trying to take care of my fiance the best that I can, and it's just so much pressure and stress. 

I guess this is where I should ask for advice. how do I keep myself sane while job searching? is there really nothing more I can do but keep searching, keep applying, and keep asking around? am I being too hard on myself or not hard enough?"

I the past I've had issues after telling people and being treated like a leper but I'm not infectious like that and the only people I ever disclose it to are sexual partners or anyone I would be sharing a bathroom etc with to let them know why my stuff is separate and to put them at ease by telling them my very careful processes. My bathroom is far safer than any public locker room or any random counter top I a hospital and on top of that I do not have community acquired Mrsa even though many do and don't even know it. When I found out my boss told everyone I became embarrassed and feel like some of my employees are worried about their safety. I've just decided I'm upset about this.

Most of leadership thinks I do good work but I really need to ""own"" the product and ""take full ownership"" of my portion of the work.   


I've definitely had this feedback before, and I'm aware that it's my general apathy with labor seeping into my work. I do like my job, but this feedback annoys me to no end.   


Why should I take ownership of the product? I'm not the product manager, or the project manager, and I sure as hell don't own the company.  


I do what I'm told, to the best of my ability. I don't go above and beyond. I'm not paid above and beyond. We did experimental ""profit-sharing bonuses"" this year (may or may not be repeated) and it amounted to something like 2.2% of my salary. It did not cover the rise of inflation, and our compensation schedule is only reviewed every 2-3 years.  


So no. I won't be owning the product, because I don't own the product by any definition. Sorry! "

10,2024-03-28,Reference checks are stupid.,u/TransitOfTomorrow,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bq7chx/reference_checks_are_stupid/,antiwork,"Where am I coming from with this argument? In 2022, I just graduated from college with a degree in Special Education Assistant. After counseling, I applied for jobs in the school district setting. Some school districts have ways of screening candidates, such as strictly enforcing the Ed Code. For example, if you have: (a) been convicted of a crime, (b) had your driver's license suspended, (c) been convicted of a driving-related conviction, (d) been terminated from your employment, and/or (e) had an unstable work history, your application cannot be considered for employment.

After being told to work closer to home, I ended up getting the job at a nearby school district, which is the only standalone high school district in the area. Despite being handed paperwork and being sent to a nearby medical facility, the school district had to select another candidate because I was required to pass the reference check. They also tell me that all school districts check references and not just the high school district I was in the process of getting.

The HR Technician told me that they do not consider my teachers as professional references as \[professional references\] have to be people from work. Secondly, one employer did not want to speak with the school district. The kitchen manager at my second employer was not able to be reached through their personal mobile number. The supervisor at my third employer was not aware of my job search.

This is where my desired field of work check references. The hardest part of the reference check is that sometimes, despite keeping your supervisors and employers informed, they might not be reached when they have the chance.

When I applied for a job opening at another school district a similar distance from my failed high school endeavor, the school district told me that while one supervisor was able to be reached, no one from my then-current job was reached. Despite failing the reference check, I got the job with the Unified School District because the principal at one of the elementary schools liked my interview."

10,2024-03-28,Boss denied me a promotion and I would become the only person in my team after they leave this month. ,u/Spare_Log491,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bq8hhu/boss_denied_me_a_promotion_and_i_would_become_the/,antiwork,"I (28m) have been working at an organization for an over 2 years now. I originally got hired to support my boss in the marketing team and increase the capacity of the overall staff of over a dozen folks. During these 2 years, I have been satisfied with my job and the work that we do. However, the first red flag that I noticed is when they did not honor their verbal offer of employment to me. The director of the org gave me an offer of $48k and I would get bumped up $2k more after my half year probationary period ends. I regret not getting that in writing, but it was my first full time salaried job offer and I was naive. Time comes around after those 6 months and I reach out to the head of HR on adjusting my salary to reflect what was offered to me, but they told me that a raise was only subject to my performance review from my boss. I felt tricked, but I thought there was a chance that I would still get that raise.

When I had my mid-year eval with my boss, they noted that I excelled in my areas of work, but wanted to “invest in my growth.” Instead of giving me the raise, they would keep my salary the same and offer $1k in personal development funds, which was already included in my initial offer. I felt jaded, but I stupidly accepted that offer because I wasn’t confident enough to negotiate it back then. I finally got that raise after excelling my 1 year review, but by then, it was more of a pay cut since inflation was through the roof in 2022. (4% raise vs 9% inflation)

During the latter half of my second year at this org, I start looking at jobs elsewhere that were more remote flexible and offered much higher pay than what I was currently receiving. With my current salary, I was being underpaid compared to the market value of my position of at least $60-$70k. Due to personal struggles I was dealing with during this time, I had to stop my job search and continue working at my current job to make life easier on me. However, at the end of 2023, my boss informs me that they are leaving the org by the middle of next year and wants to put me on a path to become the manager of our team (which is actually just me managing myself). I got really excited since I finally could see myself in more of a leadership position after 2 years and I could finally get a substantial raise to help me out.

My 2nd annual review comes up in the beginning of this year, but my boss decides to push it back another month due to ongoing transitions within the leadership team with them leaving soon. I had no choice but to accept the situation. When I finally meet with my boss for my review the next month, they rated my performance as excellent again and told me that they would bring it back to the executive team to explore new options for my position, such as getting promoted to a manager. 2 weeks roll by and I don’t hear any updates. When I asked my boss if there are any updates, they told me to “be patient.” I didn’t hear anything until the 3rd week until I got a random call from my boss at night.

I did not get promoted to a manager position but instead got a title adjustment to “lead + current title.” Additionally, the executive team only wanted to raise my pay by $3k, but decided on $6k to try to make me satisfied. Usually any other time, I would be very excited over a 12% raise, but as I am taking on most of the responsibilities of my boss and would be the only person on my team after they leave, this was paltry. It barely covered the rising cost of living adjustments over the past 2 years after I was delayed my first raise. When I asked what was the reasoning for this decision and if there was a timeline to get promoted, they responded with, “executive team is going through a lot right now…we don’t have the ability to bring on another manager…the position is off the table for at least a year and would be based off of you exceeding expectations.” I knew this was all bs since I have aced all my previous evals. I told them I would think about this offer and not accept anything until the next day. I was disappointed, upset, and felt like I got played again. Why would my boss even tell me of an offer of a manager position in the first place if it would be revoked anyways?

That night, I drafted a negotiation letter outlining all of my roles, achievements, new responsibilities, and salary comparisons with similar positions at other organizations. I asked for a salary increase of $10k to reflect the current market and my additional work. If I couldn’t get the promotion, I at least wanted to be compensated more fairly. I sent it to my boss the next morning. That next day, we had a follow-up meeting to negotiate my salary. They pointed out that the pay is higher at the other organizations I listed because they do statewide work instead of local work like us, yet we still have a multi-million dollar annual budget and just purchased a brand new property within the past year. Then, in order to justify my salary increase request, my boss made me spend the next hour going over my job listing description from 2 years ago and highlight what exactly what my duties were and add additional responsibilities to it. It was such an unnecessary process since they knew exactly what position I would be in as the sole member on my team and the work I would be taking on after they would leave. After going through that extra step, they told me that they would bring it back to the executive team to evaluate my salary once again and I will get an update the day after, but I am honestly pessimistic after everything.

I am currently in the process of looking for a new job again. I don’t think that they understand that if I am the only person running marketing for the org, all of their media and public-facing platforms would fall apart if I were to leave. It is definitely the case where they need me more than I need them, yet they don’t seem to value me or my coworkers who are not buddy-buddy with the executive level team. I don’t even want to get started on the workplace incest that goes on within the org.

Am I justified in my requests, or should I just take what I get? All I know is that my morale decreases each day that I continue to work there, and switching jobs may be a better option for my mental health. 

TLDR: The title of the post actually goes a good job of summing it up lol.

Long story short- I’m an hourly worker who was promised a raise, due to the salaries for Washington state going up a lot this year. I was told I would get it after the budget passes.

I just found out that the budget has passed and I won’t be getting the raise, and needless to say, I feel so disrespected and embarrassed. 


I’m seeking ways to take action- whether it results in my raise or at least to get this org under SOME type of scrutiny- the practices are unethical at best.

I started this new job as a laboratory technician, my job is to assist and replace those who are absent in the different departments, keep in mind this is a union job ( i get unionized month 3)

By week 2, i should be able to replace one missing technician who is going on vacation and by week 4 i have to replace another technician in  another department.

Everything is fine i start reading documents and getting to know the coworkers.
First week i get called for a meeting, the supervisor informs me that he isn’t happy with my work and with my attitude, and that he wants me to be more « active ».

A little weird considering i didn’t start yet but fine whatever.
Anyways i replace the first lab technician and it’s very easy tasks, i make no mistakes.

Calls me in again for meeting second week, this time he reminds me how unhappy he is because i shouldn’t be spending time learning about the other department and should 100% focusing on my attitude, according to him the whole team told him they don’t like my attitude ( this is not true as was confirmed later by coworkers )

Week 3, i learn that a retired coworker is back (yesterday), she is a  technician assistant, let’s call her A. 
I ask my boss at the start of week what my tasks are going to look like in the future, i get a vague answer.
I learn from a random coworker that she already is going to be replaced by A.
Today, i get fired the reason: i look like i don’t want to do my job( he didn’t like the way i put down a paper/ he said that while smiling like it’s true/ i have no idea what he is talking about), i don’t smile enough and the whole team complains about me ( also not true )

Turns out they were obligated by union to post this job and hire somebody. Also since « A » cameback last week, this means : they were in communication the whole time.

They knew they were gonna have to fire me since day one, and i was just being gaslighted all along.

It’s been absolutely brutal trying to find a new job, I’ve applied to so many that I’ve lost count.

I landed an interview with a company, via a referral from an old coworker who works there. Had the first call, 30 minutes long. I thought it went pretty well, it was pretty standard. I got to talk about my background and ask a few general questions about the company.

Near the end of the call though, the woman I was speaking to started talking about freelance work and asked if I was interested in that. I was super confused, because I was definitely applying for an open role that they had posted. Since I’m desperate for work, I did answer along the lines of “Oh, if you did choose to go in a different direction for the role, I might be interested in the freelance work. But I am interested in the full time role.” She then seemed confused and said “Oh, then you’ll need to “officially” apply through the job listing.”

Call ended amicably, and I immediately submitted the application. The next day, I got an invite that said “TA Screener Call”. This time it was a 30 minute call with an external talent acquisition agent, and I had to pretty much reiterate the same info I said during the first call. This woman didn’t know anything about my previous call, since she was just a recruiter outsourced by the company.

Call went well—again, pretty standard stuff. I felt really good after the call ended, but didn’t hear anything back for another whole day.

Last night at 10pm I get an email from the recruiter saying she wants to set up a “quick 10 minute chat” with me— 9am the following morning! I have my phone on Do Not Disturb in the evenings, so I didn’t respond until 8am the next morning, but I said “Sure, I can hop on a call”. Definitely thought it was weird though, just a 10 min chat? And pretty rude to schedule something with so little notice.

Anyway, I hop on the call and she proceeds to tell me that she talked to the first woman (team lead) and her feedback was that “I didn’t seem like a good ‘culture fit’, and that I should ‘show more enthusiasm for the company.’”

I was dumbfounded. What did they expect me to do?! Pledge allegiance to the Company and grovel? Say “it is my dream to work here” ? I’m just looking for a job, Christ. The past couple months have been incredibly hard on me.

I am neurodivergent and have underlying social anxiety issues, and I am very well aware of my “masking”: monitoring my facial expressions and making sure I portray a certain energy during conversations. Guess my masking wasn’t good enough 🤡"

Manager put me on a probation period (we'll call him Phil), for 30 days. Nothing wrong there. Phil wants me to keep the original job I was working to quit in case this one doesn't work out. I quit the OG one anyways just because I didn't like it, oh well.

Let me assure you that I didn't do anything wrong, I just did the job that they told me to do, and then I asked if there was any more work I could do, and they told me no, so I took a break that I thought that I was entitled to. They didn't explain any of the rules to me. So please tell me if this reaction is normal.

I did my best to be nice to everyone. I also asked questions about a lot of different subjects and tried to make conversation to get to know the team better. Regardless, Phil finds a reason to fire me, after my coworker was on her air pods talking to someone who I think was the owner. This is in under the time frame of a week. They were listening in on everything I said. I asked my coworker how much she got paid and my coworker got absolutely yelled at. I got a phone call after work saying I was fired for asking about pay. No clue if this is conspiracy but I am suspicious that it is since my co-workers blocked me on social media when I wanted to just ask if this was normal for the company.

Okay, cool, whatever, Louisiana is a fire-at-will state. This was a job I absolutely would have loved and my dreams were shattered and it doesn't even make any sense why I'd get fired. It hurt at the time but then something even more strange happened.

Time to get my last check. One of my parents works in the city of the employer. I tell Phil that my parent will be picking it up as it's more convenient for me. Phil asks for my parent's name, ID, and phone number. This is a little suspicious. I just ended up giving the phone number and name, even though it seemed invasive, Phil wanted to ensure the check went to the right person. Whatever.

My parent finds out, two minutes after they had received the check and left, that the police department was notified and I guess they were just called there to stop any possible ""Disturbance"". All my parent wanted to do was pick up the funds that we were entitled to. They let my parent know that they were banned from the store over the phone and the police department took down my parent's information.

???? I hate living here. The amount of unnecessary stress that this situation has caused me, and my family has been a burden."

I work in a factory and have to wear steel toe shoes.  When I get to my desk I kick my shoes off because I sit cross legged at my desk, occasionally I will pop over to my neighbors office to ask a question, or grab something from the copier 10 ft away without putting on my shoes.

I have done this for the ENTIRE 9 years I’ve worked there.  I have NEVER received feedback on this, it was something HR and everyone knew about.

Now I can’t tell you how many butt cracks I’ve seen at work but my stocking feet are the most offensive thing!

When I took this promotion my HR manager told me the boss was concerned that I would have a hard TJ e respecting him since I’m older and have worked there longer than him…so he created a self fulfilling prophecy.

I kicked the shit out of that job, I got RAVE reviews from vendors and coworkers even the boss told me I was going a good job!

But I could TELL something was up, I felt unwelcome and everyone was just acting off.

I had a question about inventory and asked the GM to explain the process to me.  Long story long we order about 40k worth of items every week that are not inventoried.  That seems bananas to me- that shot could literally be walking out the door.

The same day I had this conversation with the GM,March 14th, at the end of the day I had my 60 day review with the boss who thinks I can’t respect him.

Everything was okay except
1. I did something in the safety meeting he wasn't there so he can't tell me what but don't do it again.
I solved this by literally hiding in the last safety meeting and not talking to anyone.

But also if you weren’t there then you shouldn’t say anything, if you can’t provide proper feedback shut up!

2. Do I have enough to do because I am not at my desk, but that could be because he's not at his desk he's not 100% sure l'm not at my desk.

I solved this by literally only leaving my desk for meetings, bathroom and lunch.

Also, if you don’t know if I’m at my desk-shut the fuck up

3. Don't do payables, which I don't do!
We resolved that in the meeting.

Finally on the way out the door he mentioned ""oh yeah and be sure to wear shoes"". I was like awwww man I hate shoes, maybe I can get a pair of slippers haha it was kind of joked off.


We don’t work Fridays

Anywho I wore my docs on Monday, but the rest of the week I wore tennis shoes, and sometimes out of pure habit I kicked my shoes off under my desk.
But I made sure to put them on ALL other times. It's always been just a habit for me. The ONLY feedback I've received on it was Thursday the 14th and it was kind of in passing joking not really super serious

Turns out on Tuesday the 19th 2 coworkers  were talking about the stuff their smart kids do and I popped my head in the  office (3ft from my door) to tell a story about my son and I didn't slip my shoes on.

4pm on Thursday the 21st they pulled me into the conference room and said this was in reference to my review on March 14th. Did I remember being told to wear shoes... yes of course.. well it was reported on the 19th that I wasn't wearing shoes.
I was flabbergasted and told them I've been wearing my shoes!!! (Didn’t remember the story at the time)

I tried to ask a few questions, and they wouldn't answer me. They shut me the fuck down would not let me discuss it at all, they suspended me pending an  HR investigation. 

They called me Monday and fired me for providing false information.

Radical? Controversial? Original? 

I cannot recall seeing a similar idea anywhere.

Determine compensation by purchasing power instead of a fixed dollar amount. A federal agency would update that number **every Friday**

At the end of one hour at work employees must accrue pay adequate to purchase a certain amount of a particular commodity (call it 2 gallons of supreme unleaded gasoline for instance) the calculation provided by the weekly updated minimum wage.

People won’t start buying more of the fuel, and its price is a (maybe) decent pulse on the value of money.

If prices go up, so does pay.

Theoretically, if prices go down, pay will be less, but the **purchasing power** should remain steady.

Is it stupid?"

I saw it as a calling because young females graduating from H.S. in the 80""s were led to other careers because of the time and energy associated with being a physician, since of course we all wanted to be mothers!  As if you can't be both!!  In the mid to late nineties, I absolutely loved my job at educating the youth of this country.  I understood that financially I was taking a monetary decrease but I felt proud of what I was trying to accomplish.  In the advent of ""No child left behind"" I started seeing the decline in our education system. We were not encouraged to advance our gifted but instead bring  gifted students to a mediocre level.  I totally agree with not leaving a child behind but at least give a teacher the resources to make that happen.  Placing a child in their high schools years in an honors chemistry course because the parents want the child challenged, but then blaming the teacher for not making all the necessary modifications is outrageous.  How about supporting these teachers with other specialists designed to KNOW how to accommodate those students ...  

It pains me to say that I left the profession as so many before me. After given the ultimatum of passing a student  with a 70% (because of adjusted gpa, you know the 93% and above an ""A"" etc.)  that missed 70+ days of an Honors Physics class, NOT a sped, 504 or anything like that.  Just a student, possibly at a disadvantage because there was not a father in the picture, an extensive reprieve, a student, (a senior) never bothering to make any effort to understand the discipline or to ever turn in a completed assignment, let alone take a test, a 70%!!! I chose to resign as a teacher in the public sector.  Sad day for me, but at the same time a reprieve!! No longer would I need to be called for an ""all call"" for fights ... I mean I am 60 years old, 100 lb pound female, knocked down numerous times by students brawling in the halls, because this was part of my teaching duties!

Once i heard about this i was quite upset, as she works in a mall with a poor reputation and is risking her own safety by leaving and unrestricted path to the bathroom. 

She told me that its very common for retail stores to discourage going to the bathroom, but state that if they need to, they must leave the door open so they can hear customers in the store. This situation only arises when an employee would be working alone, but that is relatively often at this store she works at.

The argument her employers have made is that if the door is closed, you can’t hear if a customer is stealing. I was like, “what? Couldnt they steal if the bathroom door was open? All you are risking is your own safety.” 

This issue makes no sense to me and makes me feel it has to be against some workplace safety thing. From what ive heard, this is common at many retail stores.

What I do is reach out to the loan rep and have them fill out a form with some information about the loan and then choose the ones that we think are best. 

I wrapped up this project awhile ago but there is one person, let's call her Brenda, who is getting on my nerves. Every other loan rep just sent the form back and left me alone. When I initially reached out, Brenda was like ""I'll fill out the form, also can we meet so I can share peak stats with you?"" To be clear, the ONLY thing I need for the project is the form and I don't care to meet so I said back something like ""I actually just need that form, I'll let you know if I have questions"" and that was that. 

Later, when I emailed her to say we were adding the loan to our list, she asked to meet again to share info on the loan. Again, I had EVERYTHING I needed and I have zero interest/need to meet with her. So I said, "" I have everything I need, but if you have new info that wasn't covered in the form please document it and send it to me."" Having documentation is easier anyway because we have to file away all loan lender info. She said okay and left me alone. 

Today, two months after I finished the project, she emails AGAIN, asking to meet to share information. What should I say to her? Should I just take the L and get this stupid meeting over with? There truly is no point as I have all the info I need and I'd really rather she document it anyway. 

My coworker who used to do this project said Brenda is a very persistent/aggressive person and didn't like her when she had to do this project. I'm definitely getting that vibe and now I'm just mad off of principle. I don't want to set the precedent that I'm gonna take on extra meetings with her, especially when none of the other loan reps felt the need to do this. I get that I'm being a little ridiculous but I just don't need to meet with her to get my job done. It's completely irrelevant at this point. What would you say in response to her, assuming you wouldn't just take the dang meeting?"

The company was bought by a parent company and  part of being ushered under a new corporate umbrella, they have removed the bonuses. Since the transition to a more corporate company, I have taken on more responsibilities such as traveling for projects, leading 4 projects at the same time, and running projects from start to finish. I’m considered the leader by my peers who get paid more than me. 

I just found out my pay raise this year won’t even cover the bonuses I used to get. I essentially got a pay cut.

How do I proceed with a) getting more money or b) not taking on all the responsibilities I am given?

I feel like the people who get paid more should be doing more.

Is there a pay structure can I get from corporate HR to see if I am being underpaid?"

Our parent company is located in a state that observes good Friday as a holiday, subsequently, they've said that everyone at the parent office gets holiday pay. Cool! For them at least...



In the last couple of years, they expanded the contract to my state, Texas, where it's optional. Since the head honcho of our office who oversees everything in our department doesn't agree with our company extending the contract to have people working remotely from home in Texas, he's said that we're not entitled to the same holiday pay that everyone in their home office is entitled to.



Even though the entirety of the job,  including the supervisor positions, can be done from home (proven during covid) we aren't eligible for any supervisor positions because they can't micro-manage us like they can for those in office. They even made those who have notes from their Dr saying it would be best advised to wfh of available come to the office. Those who moved during wfh only status (during covid shutdown) outside of a certain perimeter were terminated. 


We're treated as second class citizens because we get to telework and he doesn't agree with it,  even though that part isn't up to him. He doesn't get to dictate the contract, just manage personnel. So, because of his personal feelings, he puts road blocks up for us everywhere he can and stops any type of career progression. 


Absolute bs. If I could find a job that offered the same wfh status with the same pay, I'd be long gone. "

I don't think I'm a tipped employee but we do receive tips in cash or through our credit card readers. (The Department of Labor defines a tipped employee as someone who makes more than $30 in tips per month though, so am I actually considered a tipped employee for legal purposes?) I'm also actively searching for a new job and plan to quit without notice once I have a job lined up. 

My store claims in their handbook that anybody who quits without a 2 week notice will have their tips taken. I've personally had my tips taken off of one or two paychecks in the past due to mistakes I apparently made as well so I know that it's not an empty threat to avoid no-notice quitting.

What is the legality of either of these, on a federal or state level? From what I've read it seems that taking tips from an employee is illegal period, but I'd like to know if it is in fact legal so I can either plan my resignation accordingly or decide to eat the lost wages in tips."

1,2024-03-29,I really need advice about my job AITA?,u/7barbieringz,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bqnuy7/i_really_need_advice_about_my_job_aita/,antiwork,"So I'm a pet sitter plain and simple, walk dogs, feed pets, overnight stays, etc. I started working for a company started by my boss he said he started this as a side thing but it grew so he hirrd more ppl, some are his friends others are outside hires. When I first started he already told me of 2 ppl he let go, just keep that in mind.

So basically a typical situation involves taking care of the pet, feeding, water, litter scoop or a potty break, and some play time. After each sit us sitters take pics of the animals and send a personalized message, that each one of us makes up, there's no prompt or guidelines or anything. Also for overnight sits it's from 8pm to 6am with three 30 minute visits throughout the day and between each visit it can't be longer than 6hrs.

So here's my issue: apparently I got complaints from some customers that my boss told me about, here are the complaints

1.) my messages arent as personal/bubbly as some other sitters.

-my reasoning, I just list out the things I did with the pet adding some emojis and ""lolz"", but again there's no prompt or guidelines so I'm not sure how to fix this and my boss didn't give me a clear cut answer on how to fix it all he said was ""just be more personal"".

2.) I left my overnight at 6am instead of staying a few extra hours and going ""above and beyond"" like my boss said 

-my reasoning, first I don't get paid to stay extra hours and I just would like to go home to be in my own house to actually relax. Most clients have cameras so I'm literally on camera the entire time I'm there and I can't actually relax like I want to because I'm being watched. 

3) my pictures aren't good enough, I send 7-10 pics every sit and I've told my buss multiple times my back camera is broken so I have to use the front with lower quality plus I have a crappy android, I don't make enough to buy an iPhone like him. Also the sitter I trained under only send 4 pics and he's never said anything to her. 

-my reasoning, I really don't even know how to fix this atp I've sent a lot of pictures and videos, I even get on the ground in the middle of the street or yard sometimes to get these so called good pics, but still...not good enough.

I also don't like how this job seems to be based on feelings instead of performance. I do everything correctly my boss literally said that, but apparently I'm just not personal enough with the clients so they request other sitters instead of me. 

Id also like to add I've worked for other pet sitting companies and never has it been where clients can request which sitter they want, in my experience they don't even know our names. The clients usually communicate with the business or the owner, instead of like this company where they communicate directly with us sitters. My old bosses would just put ppl on the schedule to complete sits and go about their day, all this ""I liked her more than him"" bullshit didn't apply. Also in this current job we do ""meet and greet "" where we meet the client before the sit, we don't get paid for this at all. In my previous roles we'd do the meet and greet with the business owner and the pet not the client and be paid for it.

Last thing, I'm an independent contractor in this job. So I have no benefits literally, no health care no dental, and I still have to file taxes on my own which comes out to be more taxes I'm paying. Not to mention the wear and tear on my car that I'm not getting reimbursed for.

I just don't know if maybe I'm just doing a bad job, or if this is really just ridiculous 

Edit: also for the overnights he wants me to do 4 drop in visits instead of 3 like advertised and in the handbook, because 4 visits is ""above and beyond"". But I will not be compensated for an extra visit, but also if I don't do the extra visit I'll be penalized and he'll send me less new clients. He in fact said that he can't send me new clients because I don't do these extra things he's asking."

I was a fucking temp for 6 months with a weekly pay of a measly $641. At Bosch. Through a temp service called MAU. These companies ain’t worth my life to squeeze, bruh. 

I got let go today (3/29/24) based on word spreading around about me swearing (not at anyone) out of frustration with that job. These so called companies are slave drivers.

I got frustrated with all the absurd rules, such as this. You can get an infraction if you clock in too early or an infraction if you clock out too late.

“If you can lean you can clean” as if people haven’t swept up the floors 3 times. Took out the trash 8 times into the compactor. Waited for the forklift drivers to bring the next load on the repack line. Tugger operators waiting for said load to be repacked into the totes. So on and so forth. 

6 months of my life with no call outs and no missed days (even coming into work in pain during my 90 day probation period) because of swearing. That didn’t start until my 90 days went by thinking Imma get hired. But after those 6 months. I was doing XYZ across the damn warehouse. 

Voluntarily working more days and hours. I kept worrying about the hire ups micromanaging the crap out of you. Especially if you are actually doing your job. And hire ups can’t be at the same place at the same time. So they assume you’re working. I’m not no robot. I try taking a breather before my next route. And I knew it was coming. I had trained a new hire (straight through Bosch) who had trained another new hire (through MAU). 

So here I am. Job hunting and thinking about moving back to Fl. Even that’s sounds like I took a step back. Living in SC feels backwards at this point. I need me job that I can work from home or something. No company is worth a squeeze of your life. I tried."

12,2024-03-29,I was given a bad performance review yesterday but my boss didn't provide any concrete examples of what I was doing wrong or how I could improve. Does anyone have any advice?,u/onetruepear,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bqqnwc/i_was_given_a_bad_performance_review_yesterday/,antiwork,"
Hey everyone,

So this is a first for me as I'm usually a high performing worker, but I got a negative performance review.

I was told yesterday that my performance has dropped significantly this year and I need to improve. For context, I was passed up for a promotion in January in favor of someone with less experience and seniority than me and obviously I was pretty upset. It pretty much killed my morale and I can definitely admit I've  been less enthusiastic ever since. 

That being said, I haven't functionally changed anything about the way I do my job or the way I interact with people. Before, I was always the person to put my hand up for anything extra that needed to be done, offered my help on certain things, asked loads of questions, etc. Now I just do my own job and keep to myself, so it seems to me that they're mostly upset I'm not going above and beyond anymore.

The best part is that my boss wasn't able to give me a single concrete example of where I need to improve besides an overall ""vibe."" He even noted that I haven't changed how I interact with people in the workplace at all, but he could ""tell that I'm still bitter about not getting the promotion."" Besides that, it was just a vague ""your performance has been incredibly poor this year"" without any specific examples of where I'm dropping the ball or how I can improve. The only thing he mentioned is that I'm not as engaged in the work. I used to speak up in meetings and give my thoughts and input, but I stopped doing that because I've also received feedback in the past that I'm too negative and opinionated. So now I keep my mouth shut and my opinions to myself and now THAT is being used against me.

I'm not really sure what to do with this. In my mind, I've done what they asked and the only thing I've changed is the amount of additional work I take on that's outside the scope of my actual job.

Does anyone have any advice?

TLDR; see title. That basically sums it up.

He also loves to keep track of everyone else and their where abouts.

He will go out of his way to find and track where people sit and will take the long way back to his desk just to check where people are. If he doesn't see them around he will go straight to the manager about it. It's so infuriating, because we could just be in the toilet and he would report it.

He himself doesn't do anything, he doesn't do his job and when he has tasks to do he always delegates it off to another person.

The manager seems to be good friends and trusts him a lot because of everything he reports to them. His behavior especially to me almost feels like harassment as he constantly checks my where abouts and if I do anything on my tasks no matter how minor he will be the first to point it out. His attitude is rude and very judgey

3,2024-03-29,Unsure how this will land: Owning a business and hard and kind of ruins your life a bit. I expect that’s why bosses are dicks,u/St3fanz,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bqqvze/unsure_how_this_will_land_owning_a_business_and/,antiwork,"I own a small, niche building company. I’m the founder and CEO in an LLC setup. Some background:

I’m a pragmatic communist living in late stage corporate fascist capitalism. (You can tell it’s fascism because it’s inescapable.)

My billed hourly rate is the same as anyone who works for me. We all earn the same amount, unless I’ve taken on an apprentice, who is committed and learning. I can’t pay them the same as a journeyman 20 year carpenter as they are a tap on resources and I’d go out of business. I will supply them with tools and a line of credit for more, but I have to keep the ship afloat or we’re all fucked. The learning/teaching dynamic is taken seriously and I don’t believe it’s unfair.

Here’s what kills me, and why I think people who own businesses get greedy, and how that trickles down through management in larger companies into the bullshit so many workers face:

Running a business is *hard* from a bureaucratic perspective and it steals your life insidiously. I work hands on alongside my colleagues. Carrying lumber, heavy work, there is no hierarchy. We just get it done. I am obliged to QC all work performed as part of my role. If something is wrong or different that planned, there’s a discussion and usually a reasonable reason why. It’s never a flashpoint. I ask for advice as much as I give instructions - equal measure. We are a happy bunch.

But then we finish for the day and I have to catch up with the “business stuff”. Sending and paying invoices, scheduling, client management, payroll, taxes, bills, TAXES, (can’t bitch about that enough - it’s not made easy), marketing and keeping our sites up to date, writing materials lists, figuring out logistics for upcoming projects, CAD, plan submission prep, etc, etc. So when we all hug it out and leave after a solid day of work, and we are tired and it’s time to sit down with family and eat, I know I have a few hours of bullshit to get through most evenings before I can stop. Add to this at least five hours on Saturday in CAD, client liaison, banking and payroll. It’s a lot and very little of it is billable.

I suspect this is the fulcrum of the tipping point (that is widely accepted as being tipped in a completely unfair way towards benefiting business owners and fucking employees.)

It’s hard not to feel a level of burnout and sometimes resentment (which is childish I know) when you’re aware your colleagues are just kicking back on a Saturday and you’ve been up since 6AM, had CAD crash three times, still have to run payroll, your house is a mess, you’re under a (totally reasonable) expectation to be a present partner to your loved one(s) and you know that you won’t be available until 2PM after the books are balanced, payroll and admin is all squared away along with anything else you had to get to. Most Sundays are interrupted too, then it’s back at it Monday.

Planning a vacation has proven almost impossible.

I try and make sense of the greed and disposable actions of business owners. The way the fuck their employees, the tones used, the cultures developed. Perhaps it comes from this sort of resentment spilling over and running wild. Honestly, some days I feel like screaming. Today I am due to spend the day with a friend who recently lost a family member. Then go out with my wife (a chapter one school teacher) and do something nice. I’ve had the day blocked out all week. However, the county misread an inspection request so that’s scheduled for 9, and two subcontractors can only meet with me today. This means I have to tell my friend I can’t be there until early afternoon at best, I’m not able to spend the time with them they need properly, but I will stay later that originally planned, thus pushing my time with my partner back significantly. And I’ll have to make up for the down day on Saturday. Of all ll these working hours, perhaps five will be billable.

I have no time for my hobbies. Haven’t made any music or worked on my other projects in forever. 

Right now I just want to turn my brain and business off and crawl into a hole, ya know? I have this needling voice in my head saying “You *should* be eating more money for this!” but that would be at the direct expense of the people who work with me.

I guess I’m just venting, now and thank you for indulging me. I think my point is, people end up feeling this way, don’t keep it in check, don’t stick to an ethical code and it all just snowballs into the shitshow that is modern working life, where those in positions of power fuck anyone they can.

Or I may be just burnt out and rambling for catharsis, fishing for compliments to make me feel this whole endeavor is worth it.

Happy Friday everyone! 🖤"

At first, we waited to have quick meetings 1st thing in morning to discuss assignments because it made us get behind schedule when she wouldn't show at scheduled time. Management doesn't want to bring this to her attention because they're afraid she'll quit and we will be down a worker which we desperately need.

In this time I worked at some of the worst places, working odd jobs while I tried to heal from this cruel world. One was a nanny job for a couple who started sexually harassing me and expected me to watch their two year old watch iron man ALL DAY! It was beyond absurd. I think they should have hired a prostitute with the questions they would ask me. The next job was caring for a guy in a wheelchair who would reckless driving on prescribed ketamine and sexually harass his doctors via text messages (and the other caregivers never disclosed this). The next job was helping out an elderly lady who watches TV all day, she can barely walk and shakes from her Parkinson’s (but can be rather pleasant when she’s not being nasty). 

I made $35/hr as a caregiver. Now I started at a hospital and I make $48. Sure, I have benefits but they are kind of garbage. I was thinking how nice it would be if I could have health insurance and go see a few people (of course ALL are out of network). Nobody in network will understand CPTSD. If I did this, then I’d have to meet a 17k dollar deductible for my son and I. Food is so expensive where I live. My rents fairly cheap (very lucky for this but it’s also a dungeon with no windows).

I also still owe 40k on my student loans. I just paid off loans with Sallie Mae that would make someone cry with the interest. I paid 1800k in interest last year. 

I feel this trap of not being able to survive without a job but also this immense struggle even with a high paying job. The more you make the more taxes they take out. I feel I’ll also have to include the fact that nursing is a capitalistic system built on fraud and telling people lies about their health. Nurses are brainwashed into thinking they should be grateful to be one yet they do far more harm than good. We are taught to ignore serious issues and to lie about our charting for more Medicare reimbursement. It’s madness. I feel like I’m trapped because I can’t afford rent and food otherwise 

I’ve been reading a lot of Kafka so I’ll share a quote of his..

“O God,” he thought, “what a demanding job I’ve chosen! Day in, day out on the road. The stresses of trade are much greater than the work going on at head office, and, in addition to that, I have to deal with the problems of traveling, the worries about train connections, irregular bad food, temporary and constantly changing human relationships which never come from the heart. To hell with it all!”

It’s also considered “manly” to partake in such poor behaviors and anybody who wants to conduct themselves in a moral manner is often belittled and ridiculed. 

Most worked in blue collar/labor/service industry.

Is this a common occurrence all over the world or is this just common place in the United States where our entire identity is often based around our job titles.

Women complain about “toxic-masculinity” but don’t even realize who suffers from it the most. This would of course be men who are surrounded by men in our workplaces for 8-16 hours a day 200+ days per year. 

I’ve also worked with disgruntled drug-addicts, high school dropouts, career criminals who would complain about doing jobs like plumbing etc.. meanwhile I would be proudly and happily doing my work without feeling the need to harass and terrorize others in the workplace.

In my business classes from high school and my marketing classes in college, they always shove slideshows down our throats with billionaires (Jeff, the Sharks, Elon Musk, Kardashians) telling us that we'll be as successful as them if we work harder or to always chase our dreams or some shit and everyone goes crazy over it.

Even if being successful WAS as easy as billionaires try to tell you, why would anyone look at these people as inspirational figures? Billionaires have more money than they even know what to do with and they don't use it to help anyone. People are fucking starving outside their door and they'd rather hoard all of it and take all the credit for having it to begin with as if they aren't constantly supported by the workers they exploit. I could never find someone that selfish, greedy, disgusting, and out of touch motivational. And it bothers me that other people do, even going so far as to adamantly defend them as if they're next in line to be the next billionaire.

Also, somewhat unrelated, but I remember working at [insert huge retail store] and seeing a big poster in the break room every day that bootlicked the founder of the company because he SAT WITH HIS WORKERS SOMETIMES. Wow, what a good guy! He sits with his lowly servants, lapping up billions while the people he sits with are barely making it paycheck to paycheck!

I am fine with change if it is progressive. But, WTF with core competencies. I was taught that when formatting a resume, put a list of your core competencies (what used to be called soft skills, also a highly subjective term) using a few words, ""builds relationships, facilitates growth and development etc."" or whatever buzz words the marketing team decided to throw up for the job ad. They are such subjective terms that what is the point in listing them? So much about job application processes are useless and bureaucratic, but at the very least can't I just list my successes at each job that match what the company is asking for and be done with it? Why all this crap about ... now we use columns to format our resume, don't hide your gaps but don't highlight them either, use passive voice and point form (that last one feels really wierd to me) .... WTF does this have to do with assessing how suitable I am for a job. Why not just give me a test to see how I would do, wouldn't that be mroe useful? Instead we have all these abstract ways that someone who is making decisions (HR? Employment industry?) have convinced themselves are the best way to assess a person's ability and qualifications.

Not the most interesting or unique, but I'm going to share it regardless. 

So. I was working for this company for almost 6 and a half years now. I actually enjoyed my job for the most part. Casual atmosphere, good people, work kept me engaged. Admittedly slightly more than minimum wage and I had to start the day kind of early. But otherwise the job itself was fine. I actually considered myself pretty good at it. My output numbers were solid, and not to toot my own horn, but I thought my work was pretty dang good. 

A year or so at the start of my job, I started becoming a bit paranoid, which has basically led into this whole mess. There was a small incident where I arrived at 7:08 as opposed to around 7 (due to really bad traffic), and a I got called into a meeting with my former manager where she said that the company policy involved using up one of my sick days for being this late. Which. I'm no expert, but everyone I tell this story to tells me that can't be legal. 
She was actually very nice otherwise. I'm not sure if stuff like that was due to archaic rules in the system, or if she may have misunderstood something. It never happened again after that. 
Regardless, the whole thing made me prioritize punching in on time. Which generally wasn't an issue anyways. At least for a while. 

Cut to a few years later when I find myself getting more and more later due to a change in my ride situation. I started trying to even it out via punching out a few minutes later at the end of the day so things would even out time card wise.

Due to going full time, my sleep started suffering, and I started having more and more issues getting to work on time. So I started punching in online using our company website, on my way to work. Because I honestly didn't think it was a big deal. I wasn't trying to cheat the system or anything, I was just trying to get my punches in on time so I could do my job and get paid what I was owed. 

So, cut to a few months back, I get called into a room with this guy and he starts telling me about an investigation into my punches, them finally asking questions about everything. The end result was them informing me that I was suspended until HR reviewed the case and made a decision (even escorted out of the building. Touch overkill if you ask me).
I spent maybe a week at home, just waiting for them to contact me so I can make my case proper, and as soon as they do.. they fire me on the spot. 6 and a half years of (what I like to think) was very good work, gone without a trace. Didn't even have the decency to do it face to face so I could clean out my locker and give my farewells.
And hell, I liked my manager (different one from before). He seemed like a decent guy otherwise. Part of me wants to believe he was forced to do this by the higher ups, but maybe that's my inner optimist.

So. I'm not entirely innocent in all this. I admit, I did fuck up with the punches. But I maintain that I wasn't aware of the full ramifications, and wasn't even given a warning when I did so. They built a case around me for a full year without ever notifying me that what I was doing was a problem in the first case. Just assuming the worst.
I tried contacting the workplace directly to see if I could at least get some sort of severance (because I do fall under the disability act, and they haven't exactly been particularly ethical during this whole thing), but then they started blocking my calls. I eventually sent an honest to goodness letter in the mail, of which they they only got back to me after a month, and responded with one of the most boilerplate ""we hear your concerns"" non apologies I've ever seen. 

The funny thing about all this is that I probably would have actually paid them back if they had just asked. It couldn't have been that much in the grand scheme.

Any other course of action I could take at this point outside of legal? Or should I just let it go? Cause I feel like I'm at least owed a few weeks pay for how this was handled. Can't exactly afford legal rep at the moment, and even if I could, it probably wouldn't be worth it in the long run. Is this the sort of thing I should report to the department of labor? Because I already sort of told them when I filed for unemployment. "

There’s no profession I would call my dream job.
.
There’s huge gaps in my resume. My work experience is primarily customer service/call center positions. Outside of my year-long contract with AmeriCorps, I have never stayed at a job longer than nine months. My periods of unemployment have been more significant than my time employed.

I hate applying anywhere and needing to show others/defend my lackluster resume. I know earning certifications and licenses is the only way to improve my chances as a job candidate, but I can’t afford most programs or even decide what to pursue.

My debt is accumulating and making my need for income more urgent each day. Recently, targeted ads have been encouraging me to get certified in medical billing and coding. I’m unsure if medical billing is something I would actually like to do. Plus, certification courses generally take months to complete. I just want to establish stable employment as soon as possible that allows me to earn enough to cover my bills. 

I like the idea of learning a trade, but most trades are very physical in nature. Especially physical trades don’t work for me because I have cerebral palsy and use forearm crutches or a power chair to get around. I don’t know how to find an apprenticeship in more accessible trades.

Is there an industry that will hire me despite my spotty work history? Can anyone recommend a certification or trade that will guarantee me a career?

TLDR: What certifications and licenses should I get to make my resume more attractive to employers despite sizable gaps in my work history? I do not have a driver’s license and I cannot walk unassisted. I enjoy writing and want a steady income with basic benefits. I’m uncertain if medical billing/coding is my best path forward."

Easter Monday is a national holiday. Meaning most people will have a paid day-off. But I work in the services sector so unfortunately we don't get time off but what good companies usually do, is pay double time to compensate for that.

My company does neither; so we will not be paid double time nor would we get a paid holiday.

As a result, I will have to come to work and put up with a really busy day because it's a holiday for most people FOR THE SAME PAY.

2. Anytime people take PTO he likes to schedule them 6-8 days in a row. When I swapped some shifts I was questioned. I said “oh I swapped because you gave me 8…” He made some bs excuse about why. 
3. He hid a piece of hardware from me that I left on the salesfloor & told a coworker not to tell me it was moved to “make me sweat a little”. In his defense it shouldnt have been left in that spot. When confronted he said “Oh that wasnt on purpose! I wouldnt do that.” 
4. Scheduling me turn arounds. 
5. General nitpicking without any positive reinforment.  
6. When yearly reviews came in he said I wasnt contributing at a district level. Which Ive thought hard about how I would do in my position anyway?

When I was looking for a job my family business was not doing so great. Fast forward to present time, business is being taken to the next level and I am needed. Consequently both of these are taking place at the same time, so I don’t know what to do.

Before people say anything I want you to know that I am a very loyal person. For example they gave me a chance when I was at a low point in my life. I feel somewhat embarrassed even considering of quitting."

I have worked with many managers but the one which I couldn't talk to, caused me the most stress.

Btw forget about talking about your personal problems, if they even get to know you're ""spoiled goods"" then they will not hesitate to cut you off.

I once confided my personal problems with one manager who I thought would help me but I soon learned that it was a big mistake. They started to treat me different. A work friend told me your colleagues are not your friends, sad i needed a real life example to see this."

Okay, so I know it wouldn't usually be legal. But I'm less than a week into the job, and the probationary period is three months. Here's what happened:

I disclosed anxiety, depression, and autism to HR during my induction paperwork. After one shift, I knew it wasn't going to work for me. It was a very overstimulating environment and I wasn't going to get enough rest between shifts (front of house at a restaurant at a hotel). So I spoke to my line manager to ask for more time off between shifts. I explained that emotional dysregulation comes with autism and that if I only get a couple of hours sleep, that's likely to happen. Sometimes we only have 6 hours between shifts (it's split shifts so they get away with it. One shift, then six hour break in the middle of the day, then another shift, then 6.5 hour break in the night). 

Me, my line manager, and the general manager decided today that this department just won't work because of the shift patterns. We agreed to a transfer to a different department, but that wouldn't be for a week or so. 

Then I got upset again during my shift tonight. I was already overstimulated. Then a supervisor told me what to do the way you'd tell a dog to ""sit"". I ended up crying in the kitchen. A manger came in and, in the kitchen, told me to go back to my room (live in accommodation) and that it won't work out in any department because I'm ""too sensitive"".

I'm now freaking out because this job has live in accommodation and I have absolutely no money because I spent it all moving here.

Is this legal? What should I do? I'm so scared. I spent every penny I have coming here and have nowhere to go."

I've been working on a PDF parser that uses artificial intelligence to understand the layout and structure of documents.

This is particularly useful for tasks like processing a bunch of resumes that all look different. Instead of manually sorting through them, this tool can parse them in bulk and organize the data into Excel, based on criteria you set.

You can also perform deep analysis to extract your desired data with the 'Custom instruction' feature.

There's a demo on the site with some credits to get you started, so you can test it out and see how it works for your specific needs.

If you're dealing with a lot of PDFs and looking for a way to automate some of the grunt work, this might be up your alley. 

Feedback is welcome; I'm looking to improve it. Here's link to the [PDF parser](https://extractninja.org/)."

I have had four managers in a year and the recent one is absolutely horrible. She talks down to me, is extremely condescending, and has make written me up for absolutely no reason.

A little bit of background: I have been in this field for well, over 25 years and have a proven track record.  I’ve actually had my boss’ position, but chose to step down to have some semblance of a work/life balance.  I can run circles around her and have so many more years of experience. Yet she is the “expert on everything” and doesn’t take my experience into account at all.  on top of that, she is the biggest narcissist I’ve ever met. She starts every meeting by talking about how successful she has been in other jobs and how her staff loved her so much. She never lets anyone else speak and constantly talks over everyone who has an idea.  Her word is gospel.

I had a meeting with her today in which she gave me a final warning. Her complaint was that the graphics I put into a PowerPoint presentation were not clear enough. WTF? I handled the images exactly as she showed me. In the scheme of things, who fucking cares? I do so much other important work that she never looks at and she has never said anything the least bit complementary.  The job is not at all what I was hired to do and is honestly beneath my skills. I’ve been looking for a new job for months. If I could, I would quit right now. I don’t have the resources to be without a job and quitting would mean no unemployment.

During the meeting today, I completely lost it. I told her exactly what I thought of her managerial skills and how she treats me. Of course she denied all of it and asked me to sign the warning. I deleted it instead. 

I have suffered from anxiety and depression in the past, and this job is making it so much worse. I dread any interactions with her to the point of feeling sick. I absolutely hate her and I hate this job, but feel trapped until I find something else. The thing is, I don’t have any passion for this field at all anymore. My true passion is working with animals, but that doesn’t pay the bills.

I met my wits end. I honestly wish she would go ahead and fire me so I could I met my wits end. I honestly wish she would go ahead and fire me,  so I could put out of my misery. 

I am afraid of having a mental breakdown because of this bitch. How do I keep from having this job and horrible manager from affecting my mental health? "

Interviewed about a month and a half ago at what seemed like a pretty awesome company and exciting role.

Two weeks went by and nothing. I followed up with HR and was told I was selected for a second interview with the department director. At the interview the hiring manager said it was between me and two others (one an internal) and that I'd hear back by next Friday (today). Low and behold another email from HR today states that the final decision would now be by next Friday. 

After some reflection and research I summised that at best I was the second or third choice and at worst they are extremely inefficient and disorganized. Neither scenario is exactly ideal in my eyes and I decided to withdraw my candidacy. If I do hear back from them after this I will be sure to tell them my feelings on being drawn out for almost two months after being told that it was going to be a lean timeline. "

Terrible pay and harsh hours. It's early morning hours and working 30+ minutes past your shift. Or you're expected to come in on your day off. The better of an employee you are, the more you're treated like trash and expected to pick up the slack of the lazy bones. 

You're doing a lot of work and cleaning. Expect to be smeared in spit, poop, pee, and topped off with sticky hair. You'll even get stuck with tasks that are way outside of your job description. 

It's a thankless job. You spot a dog with an open wound and bleeding, there's no ""Thank you for finding that"". Management expects you to just find these issues and report them. You get injured, scratched, or bit; it's part of the job. 

No benefits. No 30-minute breaks (15 minutes on the clock). No real HR. No handbook. Everything is settled in house and the house is broken.

The best is when the owners or management is more concerned with their online reviews and making the clients happy, they'll skimp on the more important stuff with the job. Like running low on cleaning supplies. Sometimes they won't care about their employee's safety, either. One of the managers allowed a dog into the building who was super aggressive; no one could get close to the dog, so the dog sat in a crate until the owner had to come back and take the dog out themselves. That dog stayed in the crate for a couple of hours. 

Where I work, there are a lot of employees who don't want to put in the effort. They whine and complain and they much rather stand around and spread gossip. Gossiping is the biggest infestation that we have. Management keeps promoting younger and inexperienced employees to manager/supervisor roles and they won't properly train them. So you have supervisors talking to their cliques of friends spreading gossip and sharing personal information. NOTHING GETS DONE ABOUT IT. 

I love working with the dogs. I don't mind the cleaning or the very quick interaction with the clients dropping their pups off. I just HATE the people I work with and management. Managers will sit in the main office and watch the employees on the cameras and then yell at us over the radios. Management is more concerned with their social media pages that they'll shove a camera in your face and tell you to take photos. Imagine being alone in daycare with 30+ dogs and they're pestering you about getting the photos. There was an employee who was unable to get photos taken of any of the dogs and management and the people who handle the online stuff were so mad at them. This was last year and to this day, certain employees still give this employee a hard time. 

You tell yourself you're in it for the dogs, but after a while, you begin to dislike it. It's the employees who ruin it. The sad part, is there are times dogs are neglected; either because we're ALWAYS understaffed or certain employees don't want to deal with that specific dog. You also see how poorly dogs are treated by their owners, too, and you can't do anything about it. I've worked other jobs with dogs, but this place is horrible when it comes to keeping the employees organized. "

12,2024-03-29,Loyalty goes BOTH way!,u/LeisureSuiteLarry,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1br3ufq/loyalty_goes_both_way/,antiwork,"I worked for this company for about 5 years as a software engineer. I had interesting projects, and was the golden boy because I would drink with the co-owner and talk politics with him. We were on opposite sides of the fence for that. The pandemic hit and they went into full-blown denial. That was the beginning of the end for me. They briefly offered WFH for salaried employees in certain departments (like 95% of employees are both hourly and short time employees). I was one of the lucky few that got to do it, but within a month they started asking when I was coming back to the office. I did, COVID flared again, and I was told that I could ask to work from home again, but HR wasn't authorizing it for anyone, so there wasn't a point in asking. Fine, I went back.

A few months later they got a contract with a FAANG company and started shifting their operations to another state. My manager moved, the big boss moved, I saw the writing on the wall. Seriously, at this point all of my interactions with my co-workers was over video and slack, so why was I having to go to the office again? I started looking for a new job and found one pretty quick.

""Loyalty"" is a big thing with this company. You are loyal to the company. I heard stories about people in management that left and received a card in the mail from one of the owners that said ""you are dead to me"". They take it that seriously.

I recently got laid off from the company I left them for, and I thought ""I really enjoyed my time there. I wonder if they would take me back."" At this point I'm wondering why I ever thought that. I sent an email to my old manager that was clumsily asking for my job back. It took weeks for them to ever respond and when they did I learned a few things.

1. There would be repercussions to my disloyalty
2. There were very high level discussions about me coming back. One owner was on board, the other wasn't.
3. They would only bring me back at an entry level salary

Item 1 I could deal with. Anyone that would bring that up already lived in another state, so that would be fine.

Item 2... whatever.

Item 3 was a deal breaker. I left making 115k and they were generously willing to bring me back at $95k. Fuck. That.

So I got to thinking about the concept of ""loyalty"" and I realized that their concept of it is flawed, downright Trumpian really. You're loyal to them; they are not loyal to you. After I left they lost one of their big contracts and had to lay off some staff. Hourly employees got told weeks in advance, because they were required to tell them by law. Salaried employees that got laid off got told that day, which is shitty but typical. One of them was a project manager that had some software engineering in his background. He knew they were thinking about adding another engineer, so he asked about moving to that position. Nope. What it all boiled down to was they wanted to get rid of him, so that's what they did.

Loyalty is supposed to work both ways. For them, loyalty is something that only goes one direction."

Wondering if anyone else has dealt with severe burnout that made you consider leaving your job, especially to prioritize your health? I could really use some encouragement or advice to make this leap.

I've spent 9 years in a certain industry, but my last job (was there almost 3 years) that I started during covid pushed me to my limits with its insane amount of toxicity (and a culture that completely violated employment law at times), causing me severe health issues like panic attacks, digestive problems and more due to a lack of work life balance and hostility.

I stayed there way longer than I should've because it was a remote job and it enabled me to buy my first home and move to another lower cost of living province to try and escape this rat race.

I grinded it out for a nearly a year, studying in my (mostly non existent) free time to build new skills to transition into a different field.. and finally, I found a big company that was willing to take a chance on me and I landed a job in a new industry. The hiring manager drew me in during the interviews by telling me they support work life balance and even mentioned there would sometimes be ""down time"" in the role. In retrospect, I realized they were selfishly lying to me because they wanted to fill a vacancy in the role asap. 

Now, 8 months in, I find myself completely overworked again, with my health further deteriorating. Despite efforts to address work life balance with my manager and consistently doing therapy to ""cope"" better, and working with my doctor on treating my digestive issues, prolonged periods of high stress is completely affecting me from improving my mental and physical health.

I'm at a point where I'm considering leaving after only 8 months (I wanted out after 3 months and held on for as long as I could), but I have some mental blocks making it hard for me to take that step:
- potential consequences on my career (red flags of how short tenure might look on my resume, burning bridges / not being able to rely on anyone for a reference in the future)
- feeling like I'm throwing my hard work down the drain
- feeling like how this team and several projects will be affected by me being away
- what my team would think about me (judging me for not being able to handle this role)
- personal feelings of failure 
- feeling lost about what to do next (I'm in my early 30s) and uncertain about my purpose in life (I have associated a lot of my identity with what I do for a living) 

I'm contemplating taking medical leave and looking for a new job while I'm away. I thought about just quitting but I would be worse off and truly, I wouldn't even be thinking about leaving if this job wasn't a detriment to my health.

TL;DR: After 9 years in a toxic industry and an intense struggle with work-life balance leading to severe health issues, I made a career switch only to find myself overworked and my health deteriorating again 8 months into a new job. Despite wanting to leave for my well-being, fears about career impact, personal failure, and uncertainty about my purpose leave me stuck. Thinking to take medical leave while job searching as an alternative.

I'd love to know if anyone can relate. If you've been through this, how did things pan out? If you haven't, do you know anyone that has, or, if you don't, what would you tell that person? Thank you.

I’ve been there for 3 years. I learn extremely well and at this point know all their jobs and cover for them while they are on vacation or whatever they need. Hoping for a promotion. Cause it would be amazing for my family. 

Recently we had someone leave. I was an easy fit. Even other people from entire other plants asked me if I was getting it. Cause I should. I don’t even need to be trained or move desk. I’m good. 

Fast forward a month and I was told because I don’t have a degree I will probably be passed up. Even though there’s someone above me who does not have a degree as well. 
Today another person above me quit for family related reasons. So now it feels like I am about to have 2 people hire above me. That I will have to train/cover their desk while they are learning. 

Just annoying and had to get it off my chest. Do I wait and see if I’m really passed up or start looking now?…"

Also company is in a big push to bring maintenance in house to save money.  So we have been doing some simple things so the vendor doesn't charge us 4x for the job.

Me at the meeting ""so we can't replace generator batteries now?""

Safety guy ""what do you mean? You can use a crane or lift.""

Me ""it is impossible to get a crane or lift at those angles and each battery is 150lbs...""

Safety guy ""uh I'll get back to you.""

I don't mind the work.  I have worked hard jobs for years and don't mind some lifting from time to time.  It annoys me that some desk jockey creates a policy to be safer and it really does nothing but cost us more.

&#x200B;

We have had a series of bad runs with noncommitted governers. Instead of waiting for them to come to us only to fail us, we are actively putting out what we are looking for. 

&#x200B;

You can be any gender, women or agender with a hard equity understanding for humans with wombs preferred, for our governing board. If you struggle with this deeper understanding of gender (mock it, don't understand it, get it wrong a lot), you will be immediately barred from applying without a second look. People like this clearly and obviously do not  have the prerequisite deeper comprehension of the gender situation. In addition, women who think a woman being a hunter is closer to being a man than a woman are immediately disqualified as female misogynists, as are any other type of misogynist. Our founder and CEO is a woman. This is a hunter type position, and she is no less female for it. Calling it narcissitic, male or otherwise will immediately disqualify the female misogynist's involvement for female misogyny. Our technique is advanced and backed by strong math and science. Sorry if this disappoints anyone, but we actually don't care and just feel sad for you that you're disappointed. We are being upfront about that. Men are also encouraged to apply if they fill they fit the following criteria. Any women who apply must have worked through envy or ingratitude towards other women and have little to no history of showing envy and petty rage towards other women should a woman in their life who has had a relationship with or been managed by them be interviewed. Any men also cannot be equally envious of the women in their life and sabotage them or be misogynist behind the scenes to undermine them. Any man who is will not be considered.

&#x200B;

We want someone

1. Who has done grassroots democracy work, like open air fundraising or canvassing. Who has seen how the mass of people act and behave for themselves by going out in the field. Who knows how to look for signs that an area ""can do"" real change and signs that it can't and has a successful history of strategy with this. 

2. We are looking for someone who can motivate people to get outside and canvas and do democracy work.

3. We are looking for someone who can challenge rules that were made without the people's direct knowledge and consent adminsitratively, and has the courage to do that and the competence to deliver a better rule on it that is with the consent and knowledge of the people. 

4. We are looking for someone who does not suggest DARPA and military involved government grants that often are linked to technology used to kill Palestinians in a slow burn escalation of the person forced into the grant contract.

5. We are looking for someone who is good with investment and doesn't expect return to land in their lap and grow enraged and vengeful when it doesn't. We expect someone who knows venture capital is almost never awarded to women and gives it when required. We absolutely do not want someone who steals our ideas for themselves without us benefitting at all or even doing worse because of it.

6. We are looking for someone who doesn't turn immediately on someone when they don't immediately get theirs; we are looking for someone who has secular faith, aka a deep connection to their own spirit. Religious faith is fine but not preffered. We want people to have access to and a strong relationship with their own spirit without possibly allowing it to be poisoned by religious abuses of power. We want someone who knows what damage not having faith can do whose faith is so strong it still exists in a purely secular world.

7. We want someone who sees the value and enthusiastically does the work; not someone who struggles to see the value damaging the company due to their constant struggles and flip-flopping and doesn't see the true loss because they failed to ever see the value in this type of work. We don't want any more of that.

8. We optimally want someone with a strong financial situation that is generous and doesn't require song and dance to back up the nonprofit during emergency situations as is fully expected of any board. We want someone who is conspiring for the good of the nonprofit. We don't absolutely need the governer to be someone wealthy and would prioritize someone with strong belief in the nonprofit with high competence and/or the energy to get information about it out, but this is who we want. 

9. We want someone willing to fight places that don't think nonprofits have a right to ask for donations, who show poor math and science about finances; it is simply that things are donated and we serve the public good that makes them nonprofit, it is not that nonprofits inherently have toxic anorexic type relationships to money.  

10. Anarchist required. Sorry. The system is broken and is murdering people out of narcissistic rage. We're not aiding and abetting. We do not consent. Nobody not anarchist will be considered.

11. Nobody afraid to be taken to a people's democratically assembled court (see; Ukraine's democratic anarchism) or something like that. Somebody who has good ethics and know they check out under a proper non-monarchy based people's democratically assembled court and goes forward well aware that they have the skills to communicate and prevent anything being taken to court, but should something suboptimal happen, they know they will check out. No commitment issues due to knowing their ethical delivery would not survive a fair and non-corrupt lawsuit. We don't take people on our side to non-corrupt people's courts but we reserve the right to. Somebody competent in their ethics feels safer about this, not more shy, I am absolutely certian of that and have seen that time and time again.

12. Absolutely little to no signs of envy. This is a feeling without a future. Only can-do, constructive attitudes only. Envy is a waste of time and is useless and we're not going to spend time arguing about that. If you have boundary problems with that, we will take the steps necessary. Envy is a NO.

13. Pro-empathy, no trying to act like an authority when someone is clearly more skilled than you on something as well. Usually these two come together.

	

We know this is a lot to ask and don't expect to find it anytime soon.

&#x200B;

We are hoping by putting the word out it will make waiting for it less of a waste of time.

&#x200B;

We would love this governer and are hoping for it. We can't also be our governer being the founder and CEO otherwise we would definitely just do that as we have made sure we fit our own demands and know what it takes to fill them before putting them forth into the world.

Ushers sell pull tabs and papers and pay out bingos. Ushers should, in theory, cary $1500 worth of games and transaction money at all times.

register sells computer games and papers. They also count out the ushers and tell them if they're short or over or even. This amount should, in theory, be fixed at $1500. 

the ""office window"" is responsible for managing all the money and bingo games. Their money is the ushers money and vice versa. The office window is also RESPONSIBLE for starting out the ushers at $1500. If they fail to do that, the ushers end up being short or over. 

My bfs bingo hall came to him a week later stating that the office was missing money and they need $20 from him. However, my bf was over, therefore, this was a mistake in the office. 

im so irritated from being walked all over on at this job, they clearly don't know how to do math because the office is REGULARLY short large amounts despite the fact that my bf can do math like a machine.

They work well when the manager that has any power over them is on the clock but if anyone else is “managing” they slack off all shift and everyone else has to pick up the extra work. If I or someone else doesn’t, I end up having to wait around for them to finish their side work and stuff for what feels like hours. If I help they step away and go sit on their phones, but I don’t want to be that guy that sits around not helping either. Im tired of having to close my station and both of theirs if I want to go home on time. 


I don’t want to tell people what to do or boss people around but the job is dead af most days  and seeing them slack off is starting to bother me and effect my workflow. I slack off too because the job allows for it but they take it to the next level. Im staying late almost every night because of them and im getting tired of it. I don’t want anyone to lose their job and I don’t want them to feel threatened of losing their jobs but Im at a loss of what to do to motivate them. I would think paying them more but I have no power to give them a raise. And it’s weird because we get paid more than any other starting position in the area and its more than the new minimum wage in other states and we work in Tennessee which still has a lame $7.25/hour minimum. I need advice please.

2,2024-03-30,Fired right after my shift on Easter weekend :-),u/chi7490,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1br9bap/fired_right_after_my_shift_on_easter_weekend/,antiwork,"Gotta love it lol, especially when they know I’m struggling financially right now and just got into an accident 2 weeks ago that totaled my car. I was surprised when I was offered this dental office job in November because I had probably applied to over 100+ offices with no luck due to competition in my area. Being a student didn’t help either because unfortunately no one is flexible in their scheduling. I wish they had given me a 2-week notice until I found another source of income but instead they decided to fire me right after my shift today and said I won’t be eligible for rehire. The pay was also terrible but the dental assistants would say “yeah the pay is bad but we’re only here because the owner is nice.” The owner is nice, but his wife (the office manager) is shady and seems like she hires and fires new employees every few months, which is what happened to me, to pay them the bare minimum instead of giving them a raise for developing skills that helped the business. I also noticed after my first 40+ hour work week that I was not paid overtime, which is ILLEGAL, and her excuse was that we already get paid for our one 30-minute lunch breaks. Pathetic and shady, and I’m going to report them for it and get all that OT pay they kept. I didn’t do anything about it while I was employed there because of how diffficult it was to finally get hired as a dental assistant without experience, but they’ve chosen to burn this bridge so I guess I have nothing to lose now."
9,2024-03-30,Am I in the wrong?,u/m3tasaurus,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1br9h1w/am_i_in_the_wrong/,antiwork,"So long story short, I'm 31 and I can't shake the feeling that I'm somehow being irresponsible, but I'm unsure if that is really the case.

I'm very lucky when it comes to my living situation, my mom owns a 2 family house and she rents the 2nd unit to me for only 300 a month and my total monthly expenses are about 450-500

That being said I still refuse to work more than 25-30 hours a week, making around 1200-1500 a month, my job also has profit sharing and I have about 70k in retirement funds.

The house is also completely paid off and will be left to me one day.

I am of the opinion that free time is more important than making a lot of money, so I live a very frugal lifestyle.

Problem is I can't shake this feeling of societal pressure that you need to work a full time job and start a family and yada yada.

But full time means 45+ hours a week working 6 days a week at my job, and I'm looked down on by management because I have been offered full time multiple times and turned it down simply cause I know those hours woulf make me miserable and depressed.

Am I overthinking? I'm happy with my current life but I can't help feeling like I'm somehow in the wrong.

Any advice is appreciated :)"

He ended up posting the work schedule for next week and I’m working 2 days despite me being out of town. I don’t think I specified it well enough, maybe that was my bad.

I feel like I’m going to get fired which is very stressful. I’ve been struggling with my grades and my work from being sick as my professors and managers are very mad I’ve had to miss.

Me and a lot of my friends, straight out of uni, bagged an inbound call centre job from a company who was mass hiring due to increasing customer cohort. 
Its been a few months now, and the company has started looking at performance a loooot closer, checking our work and encouraging team managers to really get on our ass. This is resulting in people being fired en masse for slacking off. I've heard from other teams that A Lot of people have been fired recently. 

I feel like what is happening is something a bit spooky. A lot of people got hired and trained up, probably at high expense from the company. 
Now that they have the manpower, they're firing anyone who isnt up to standard and offloading the workload onto the people who are staying.
This company also does a Lot of quiet hiring, giving everyone more and more responsibility with no change to our pay.

There are only a couple of us who do both. Most either work hospital, or do the outpatient testing, not both. The others who work in the hospital don't know how to do the outpatient testing. There are two whose only job is the outpatient testing. One is not interesting in working any extra, so when the other one had to take a few days off for a medical procedure, the manager (who manages both, but can't personally do the outpatient testing) asked me if I was interested in picking up at least one of the days. I'm part-time, so this isn't for overtime. I gave some stipulations, like there is one test we do that I haven't been trained on yet on a new machine we just got this year, and I only wanted to work at 8hr day. The person going out does 12 hr shifts. She said fine, they would close out the schedule for the late afternoon.   


Here's where I'm kicking myself--they've been giving out critical shift pay for shifts that don't have coverage. She didn't offer it and I wasn't thinking. Later, I mentioned if I would be able to get critical shift pay. She hemmed and hawed, said she'd see but that 'they' aren't doing that as much these days.

If I don't get it, she's going to probably have to close the schedule next month when the same person has to attend a 2 day training session. lol. Each test we do is billed at about 2k. We do between 4-6 tests per day. I will work the day I said I would even without the critical shift pay because I agreed to it and it's my fault for not asking first, but I won't pick up future dates if there is no extra pay."

The title of this post is rather self-explanatory in the advice I'm looking for, but I'll elaborate nonetheless.

I've been trying to enjoy my long weekend, but as it often happens to me, I find myself occasionally thinking ""only x days until I return to work"" and other passing thoughts of this nature. I seriously don't want to think about work, when I'll be returning to work, or how I won't enjoy being at work. I'm planning to leave this job in about a month or two, yet even still, I can't shake the random forebodes of discontent.

This honestly isn't just with work, either. Any time I have a responsibility or unfavourable task that adheres to a schedule (e.g. I have to be here at this time, or I have to do this on this date) my brain will keep the imminent events in the back of my mind, reminding me every so often that I have to do this upcoming thing, and that I only have a certain amount of time before it comes to pass.

How do I stop thinking about the future? How do I put off those timed and dated responsibilities until I'm required to take them on? Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you."

Throughout my life, I've disregarded work ethics and that exaggerated desire of colleagues - to look good in front of the boss.  
It seems like beside the employment contract, there's an unwritten code, obligating you to give more of yourself than officially agreed upon.  
Okay, I understand that hundreds like me await behind the gates (our current immigration). Yet, I don't want to degrade myself by racing with slaves - who protrude their tongues while the master pats them on the head.  
It seems like people in the job market have only two modes - being a slave or a slave master. In companies, slaves, having gained some power, exploit it to the maximum. And what's worse, in my upbringing, it was asserted that such relationships are normal. I guess others have also accepted that violent communication, communication from above is normal and acceptable.  
I really hate that hierarchy where beside the work goal, there's still a social element in force, obligating you to perform a ritual, which shows that someone is above me.  
I never wanted this, that's why I'm motivated to write and create my own business. What I really want to see is  world where all people work on themselves and are free to be themselves, where they don't need to pretend that team buildings are fun, where they don't need to write motivational letters about dreaming to have a job and money not being important.  
It really annoys me that this gaslighting in the job market, created so that I would sell myself cheaper than I can, is accepted as the de facto rule. Well, let's say job interviews - where you can't ask about salary too quickly? Seriously?  
As I see an employer, they are my equal partner who buys my time for a price that I hope to maximize, knowing the state of the whole market.  
The duality I see is in upbringing, where the employer is hierarchically above me. Imagine if you had your own business (service) where you would hold the customer above yourself. A customer comes, and you're nervous before the conversation, thinking about how to present yourself better, the conversation starts, and they ask you, why would you want to work for me?  
You say well, I started because there's quite a big demand in the market, so money is good... They say stop stop stop... What money, what's important to you in life? You don't lose your composure and continue talking - well, I think everyone works for money. They say - hundreds like you await behind the gates, who will be grateful for the opportunity to improve, not to suck up...  
A bit exaggerated scenario, but the essence is that each of us should see ourselves as a free person doing business in a free market, yet we're being shackled by some unwritten rules saying that we should hand over our self-esteem to the employer.  
It means that I would like all of us to be opportunists, not slaves who say: So what, I, a simple man, will do. Authority gives money and it's good.  
I'm personally interested in which nations are the most entrepreneurial in the world. Because in here, one truly feels like a vapor of a slave when people just assume an identity in which the loss of autonomy is de facto normal. It's scary to be around such people."

I was very excited! The phone screen happened, and I thought I did well - it was a fine conversation and the Recruiter told me she’ll be working with the Hiring Manager to schedule my next steps the next week. Lo and behold, next week I got a rejection email.

I wake up today to find: an email asking to schedule a phone screen for the exact same position! From the exact same recruiter! Did she… forget???

One thing that’s giving me pause is that the email was sent at midnight (on a Friday/Saturday). Everything is legit, tho.

Anyway. I’m not sure how to go about this. If they wanted to re-interview me, why wouldn’t they craft the email to say so, instead of setting me up as if nothing ever happened?

Any feedback or help with responding is appreciated!"

What she wanted me to do was taking too long because she had me redo it over and over again as it was not to her liking and she got frustrated and left. She was there for about an hour for something that would take less than 5 minutes. 

The mother in law was mentioning him the whole time saying things like oh he did this for me but I didn’t know the relation so I didn’t comment on it. When she was leaving she said she would call him and have him deal with it so I figured I should call him before she does and I did. 

I gave him a call with her name saying what happened and he told me it was her and that he would give her a call. 

He also had me send pictures of her stuff she left so that he can deal with it and leave it for him for when he is in.

I am a very anxious person but everyone at work has told me I was just doing my job and being very nice to her and that she was unreasonable, I even had two of my coworkers that were in with me try to do it for me but she didn’t like it and therefore we had to redo it over and over hence why it was taking so long.

Some staff are federal. For about a year, we had no actual manager; a few lower employees and higher employees took on the work when needed, we mostly managed ourselves and completed our work. Sometimes, there is no work; days or weeks will go by where we are only attending meetings, planning for future work, fielding people asking for work, etc. We got a new manager who is attempting to reorganize all of our processes. That's fine, we are a mess. However, all they really accomplish is micromanaging. Team leads can no longer lead projects, the manager handles everything. Team leads can no longer communicate with clients, the manager does that, or tells us exactly what to say, or sends the initial email and is CCed on everything. Everything passes through them, and they have input on everything. We aren't doing any more work than before. In many cases, because of the constant micromanagement and slowing of the process that causes, we get less done and it takes longer. We can't approve work, they have to decide if we accept or deny it. We can't finalize a product, they have to view everything, which always means giving input, to justify their involvement.

We WFH some days. When we do, the manager recently told us we have to send them an email at the end of the day telling them what we did. Initially they said it's expected sometimes there won't be much to do, we aren't going to get in trouble for just saying that. But recently, they started responding to people pushing to know what they were doing. ""This file says it was created at the end of the day, so what did you do the rest of the day?"" ""Why did you spend all day on this, it should have not taken long."" ""Why can't you do this immediately rather than taking time?"" It's getting out of hand, and I see no point in it. If it's to keep tabs on us, again, sometimes there's no work to do. If it's to collect reasons to discipline or fire us, our rolls will exist so long as the contact does. If they get rid of us, they will struggle not having that person until they replace them, which often takes months, sometimes the better part of a year. I want to say something about it, but if this is a means to punish us and justify it through our workflow, giving them more reasons is not a good idea."

You don’t have to read the entire post, just had to get it off my chest. Let me know your thoughts…

     So In my former job, I used to work in a small department with no more than 5 employees including my supervisor. The problem with this job was that it was so stressful and I ended up getting sicker from the stress that I had to leave.
     
     Now the problem with me leaving was there is only 2 people in the entire company that do what I do (myself and my counterpart), so me leaving would leave a huge hole in the department/company. 
     
     Aside from the stressfulness of the job being a big problem, what I really want to talk about was my former supervisor. My former supervisor was one of those super toxic, micromanaging, condescending, pain in the ass bosses. They treated all the employees in our small department like shit and was never satisfied with the work we were producing. If you’ve ever seen the movie Whiplash, you would understand that my old boss would treat us like the music instructor in that movie.

     This supervisor was known by the entire company and everyone refused to work in my old department just because of the supervisor. So when I left, I figured it was going to be tough to fill my old position. Recently, I spoke with my old counterpart and they told me that there have been about 3 employees that worked in my old position and all of them left and some of them even filled grievances against the supervisor during the exit process. Everyone knew how the supervisor is even the higher ups but nothing was ever done about it. Turned out it took about 2 years for them to finally fill my position with an employee willing to put up with it.

     I just don’t understand how someone like that could keep their job when so many complaints have been filed against them and they couldn’t keep a fully staffed department with so little amount of people. I’m just happy to be out there because it was really affecting my health. I wish for the employees in my old department to get out and find a better place to work.

Thank you all for listening.

TLDR: Used to work in a stressful job, had to quit because I got sick. Former supervisor was the reason the department couldn’t stay fully staffed, no disciplinary action to supervisor after several complaints filed against them."

When I told him about my new position with a large financial company, where we have a good amount of paid time off immediately with employment, he was highly confused why I didn’t have to “earn my time”, meaning why there wasn’t a one to two year gap before a “couple of PTO days” kicked in. Apparently that was how it was at his old company, and I tried to explain that it wouldn’t really be a good idea to have employees have no access to time off when they wanted to go on vacation or see family for an entire year, let alone two. 

He was concerned why any company would allow that, saying employees should show their devotion to the company before being granted the ability to take time off. This logic baffles me.

I'm working a job that changes everyday so hours can be anywhere from 45-65 a week. Commute comes up to \~2 hours a day. add sleep and i'm looking at 3 hours every week day to be myself. Im not counting anything that isn't caused by work - showering, chores, appointments happen regardlesss of employment, and theyre incredibly enjoyable compared, so we'll say weekends are a full 32 hours of waking freedom

Roughly 47 hours to call my own each week; in the next 50 years, i will have 14 years to work with 

and granted, this isn't 14 years of primetime either. This is 14 years of staccato bumps of 3 hr increments in the evening alternating with bittersweet blocks of 2 days where you can taste what life is like when you're more than 24 hours away from working. The majority of your sunshine is intercepted by the ceiling of your job 

My equation is of course wildly different from anyone else's, and there are plenty of chances for this to change for an individual. But the majority of people will live life like this. For salaried jobs, almost a requirement to have a family these days, its probably going to be worse. I can't even say what it's like for people with children, or who have to get a second job. 

So now im thinking; im a zoomer so im probably not going to ever own a home. Odds are not looking good for retirement either, and i don't understand Social Security but apparently that's ""running out""?....all i know is how much ive had to work so far, and it's only gone up

this all to explain that i have a bordering-on-rational desire to say fuck it, ill take the 14 now while i'm still able to be ambulatory. Fuck off and live spectacularly grimey until some disease or lack of finance kills me. Maybe i wont even get 14 years but i'm telling you it looks rosier the more time you spend looking down the barrel of decades of jobs that treat you like a robot. 

before getting too worked up realize i acknowledge this as unrealistic fantasy. If it were easy or even halfway attainable for the average person there would probably be a whole name for them. Modern vagabond or some shit. I just want to know if other people do this or if the secret to life is to not do math

I work at a large grocery store chain and I am having issues with the work environment here. 
Consistently have to talk to my union about toxic treatment of employees but since nobody writes statements it seems nothing can be done. 

My Store Director has decided that the way he needs to deal with exceptions for our time clock that is notoriously unreliable is to create a sign. 
The sign reads approximately as follows:


Attention all employee's 
(yes punctuated that way)
If you are on this list you have more than 3 missed clocking's in
one calendar month. This causes inaccurate reporting for
payroll and a tremendous amount of time to correct these
missed clocking's. This behavior needs immediate correction or
will result in a Write up. 
If your name is listed come see me.

Is this allowed? I genuinely think this is a pretty bad way to deal with things, and our work environment is getting very out of hand some days.

Boss was an asshole playing the power card over me and it honestly was for the best. I’ve been applying for jobs left and right. I have gotten exactly 1 interview since October. Now my unemployment is running out. The state says I make too much money for medicaid and food stamps (i had no clue unemployment was even income) so they’re cutting that off. The state health insurance exchange won’t give me credits because I’m not predicted to make enough money and should still be on Medicaid according to them. My credit cards are all maxed out because of being unemployed so long and I have about $40k in credit card debt because I was young and stupid. So now my unemployment doesn’t even cover all of my bills, I lost health insurance and food stamps. I’m feeling completely helpless with no prospects for jobs. Despite all of my debt, my credit score is still in the 600’s (yes not great), but if I can’t get a job, I feel like I will have no choice other than to file bankruptcy. What do I do? I have never wanted to work so badly (really I just want money)."

I’ve been in the run around going from doctor to doctor to try to figure out what’s wrong. I suspect it to be a compressed or damaged nerve in my shoulder. I gotta say, it’s pretty bad and gives me a lot of pain. I still have doctors appointments booked to get more testing done and to pinpoint the root cause.

I started a new job in May of 2023 so it’s been over 10 months now at this job. I relocated for this job from California to Missouri. It’s a pharmaceutical chemical processing plant job and it sometimes requires heavy lifting. This injury affected all facets of my ability to perform well in this job. If it weren’t for this injury, I wouldn’t doubt that I’m able to be a high performer.

I had my end of the year performance review and it was bad. This company has high productivity standards and they expect new hires to learn very quickly. I explained to supervision that I have a shoulder injury and it really affects my ability to work but they don’t seem to budge or care. I get treated badly by supervision and I have talks monthly with supervision to check up on me which is not happening to any new hires except me. This really affects my mental health and my sense of self worth. I don’t know what to do here. Maybe I’m just not fit to work? "

The unions are defanged and weakened from their height, but your boss is still fucking terrified of them.  You need to understand the cowardly psychology of the manager to appreciate this.

If you're in a union you can get a representative to sit in on a disciplinary hearing or any meeting with your manager, and there is nothing more terrifying to a manager than somebody who might know more than them taking notes while they talk.  Here's why, the company doesn't have the managers back, If they fuck up they're fired and the company blames them.

It's the ultimate bully system, they're not afraid of you fighting back and winning, they're afraid of you fighting back.  

I speak from experience.  I worked at a place where I took about 8 months off over Covid.  They tried to fire me and I told them I needed to reschedule so my union rep could be present.  They didn't reschedule.  They never brought the issue up again.

I don't care what union you join, but join one, because the victory of the workers is won on the willingness to fight."

So I would not be able to report this to anyone. Also sorry for the bad formatting, I'm on my phone.

This last week, I experienced being violated at work in a way I'd never have even imagined. I left the office to go deliver checks, stop at the UPS store, and make a deposit at the bank for my work. 

I return to work and the office manager, who we will call Susan, told me she needed me. I follow her to a recently emptied out office. She opens the door. For some reason I thought she was going to show me another new stretch she's learned, which is common between us. I step inside and am very confused. I see two wash buckets filled with water, a chair, and a stand for at home pedicures. 

She asks me to take off my socks and shoes. Somehow, I hadn't yet put two and two together. I'm still thinking a new stretch is coming. 

She instructed me to sit in the chair. And then...she....she picked up my foot and started washing it. Then the other foot. She was humming and praying the entire time, kinda rocking back and forth. I didn't know how to end it. This is the owner's wife, and I've seen others in the past get fired for hurting her feelings. 

She finishes and tells me God told her she had to wash everyone's feet in the office. She pulls me in for a hug and then let's me put my shoes and socks on. 

Everyone in the office loved it apparently. They're all very religious, which is normally fine. They seemed to think it was akin to Jesus washing the feet of whoever, I'm not sure. 

I never in my life thought I'd experience what I did. I'm a woman who doesn't like to be touched by anyone. My kids and my husband, that's all who is allowed in my space. I don't get pedicures or manicures or massages. I just don't like to be touched. 
I immediately updated my resume and am currently looking for something new. I have 2 kids and a mortgage so it isn't in the realm of possibilities to just walk.

I would love any and all advice on how to convince my coworkers to unionize. Currently, I am an environmental chemist working with 5 other employees. Me and one other are strongly for unionizing, however I can't say that for the others. 2/6 are too neutral to make a decision and very pro-company. Another is extremely religious and believes unions are anti-Christian. Another has a lot of respect for our boss and believes unionizing would be in direct disrespect to him. I am trying to contact chemical worker unions for resources and advice on how to speak to coworkers about this issue without further distancing the gap and hopefully bringing them more to the side of unionizing. For reference I am an environmental chemist and make 25$/hr (working with hazardous materials every day).

I would appreciate any and all advice, I love this job but chemistry has failed me with an oversaturated market and terrible wages. Please help."

It feels really gross to force your employees to use supplies that only you can provide and charge for it, especially when it's something that will commonly be lost no matter how responsible I am.

My manager and their friends are all walking in to the entrance as I’m doing my job at the reception desk and don’t acknowledge them because there are so many people coming in and out of the bar that is close by the entrance.

My manager’s friend says, “Isn’t that the weird employee who has a crush on you?”

It’s true that I have a crush on my manager and I knew she probably knew about it because I’m terrible at hiding my facial expressions. I don’t believe I’ve done anything inappropriate to or around my manager because they treat me nicely enough at work. I know I am weird because I’m autistic… I don’t go around telling everyone because I get treated different when I do. All people know about me is that I’m weird. It does hurt a lot especially when I think I do everything that everyone else does. I don’t know how to stop being weird and I don’t know how to try… that’s what hurts the most. Because I know my manager was gossiping about me to their friends because I don’t interact with them so obviously they had to get that information from somewhere.

I don’t know if I should quit. I genuinely like my job and my manager is actually a decent manager most of the time which is hard to come by. I know if I quit I wouldn’t be able to find another job within this field because I don’t have a lot of experience or schooling in this field.

I work at a corporate restaurant’s new location that opened in mid January. My boss said that they are keeping track of the digital tips that come in, but they are not distributing them until 90 days after the grand opening which was in mid February.

Mind you, we were working well before that date and customers were giving tips since day one. My boss has stated that if you quit before the 90 days or get fired, you forfeit all of the tips. 

They also said that when they balance the registers at the end of each day, if the drawer is short, they will take the amount needed to balance it from the tip jar. 

We just started receiving our shares of the cash tips, but money from the previous weeks is nowhere to be found. 

Is what they are doing illegal? If so, which parts? I know that employers aren’t allowed to take any percentage of the tips but what about the holding for 90 days? And forfeiting of the tips if you quit or get fired?

I want to quit, but if I do so, can I still pursue action? Or do I have to be employed still? Am I still able to recover the withheld tips if I quit?"

Often even as sponsored offers eg. on Linkedin, so they pay money to make their offer visible but then dont want to actually hire?

I also had 2 rounds of very nice interviews for a position and then was informed that they wont be able to move forward with me. 2 weeks later I see the exact same job re-appear. I reached out to them asking if it would be possible to re-enter as we had a good run but they gosted me ever since. 

I notice thats happening for startups as well as big legacy companies. Those jobs often had 100+ other people applied and for sure there would be someone matching. 

Anyone knows whats going on?
My guess is that they want to fake presence on the job market for company visibility and to indicate growth, or because they dont have the budget to pay people what they ask and so none of the candidates is a match because they all ask for more? "

Their ‘reasoning’ behind the desperate need for AI humanoid robots.

I hadn’t been following the massive developments in humanoid robotics. This was a huge ‘discovery’ for me thanks to reading what people are saying here.

As somebody with a mental health condition and limited capacity to work and study, this leaves me wondering what would I and people like me be needed for. It’s already very difficult to make a living and find any use for my life. When robots replace me in menial jobs, I can surely say I will be out of any options.

All this robotics and AI craze seems completely insane to me, as doctors can’t even help me with my menta health needs so I can live a fully worthwhile and fulfilled life."

According to the federal reserve, in 2022 the American private sector held a total of about $140 trillion. There are about 350 million Americans. 

So, if all the privately held wealth in American were to be equally distributed, then 98% of Americans would become richer. If your total net worth is $400,000, then you would break even. This means equity in your home, car, savings, etc minus debt.

My family, I think it's in like the 80th percentile in income, and our wealth would more than triple. We're better off than most Americans, and our wealth would triple. That's nuts 🤷"

The sexist and money-grubbing debate surrounding return to work has centered around the false narrative of office collaboration, teamwork and traditional management techniques. Most suspect the true reason behind return to work is a need for commercial real estate concerns to regain their former supremacy and profitability. However, the traditional office setup has one additional and overlooked effect; the continued subjugation of women. 

**The Harassment Factor**

Remote work has one huge benefit for women, lack of daily micro aggressions, harassment and rape. The lack of written and actionable bad behavior from men towards women has a large mental and physical benefit for women in the workplace, an ongoing ease and tension release. Every unwelcome advance, every inappropriate joke disappears in the face of remote work. It is little wonder that women are fighting return to work initiatives as even the cyber bullying becomes collectable and quantifiable. When women can prove through text messages, recorded video calls and Otter transcripts the comments that previously would have merited a side eye, at most, become another piece of evidence to bypass HR and take directly to a lawyer.

### Time Efficiency and Productivity

Working from home has the added benefit of increasing efficiency and productivity in a variety of ways for women. Time previously spent side-stepping problematic co-workers and situations is now spent doing the job we are hired to do. Bathroom breaks can be taken as often as needed without comment. Those of us who have worked in offices with a three to one ratio of men’s to women’s restrooms know the need to schedule breaks around bodily needs that our male counterparts never need consider. Additionally, pregnancy, breast pumping, menstruation, UTIs and other issues are addressed and no one need be the wiser. Allowing women to structure their day around their needs and not be judged.

### Comfort and Collaboration

The battle over office temperature is legendary. Women, statistically more sensitive to cold, often find themselves shivering in chilly workspaces. Staying at home allows women to wear what is most comfortable for them that is appropriate for the weather. Summer can now usher in the dresses we long to wear, but cannot due to the HVAC algorithms that have been used since the 1950s. No more typing with frozen fingers or layering sweaters to combat the Arctic breeze. Every office has policies written to allow or not allow temperature controls as women shiver with runny noses even as 90-degree weather persists outside. Sweaters, blankets and extra layers can be found on most women in the traditional office setting. Hidden space heaters under desks, if allowed, provide little comfort. And Lord have mercy on your soul if one accidentally forgets to turn it off at the end of the day. I was once angrily admonished by a VP for leaving one on, and threatened to fire me if it ever occurred again. So much for workforce retention or even making me feel safe. This was in Carpenteria, where the temperature outside was 85 degrees and in office was 65 Fahrenheit. 

Collaborating with others also becomes challenging when the temperature of the office is too low. War rooms, meeting rooms and break rooms are kept at temps that leave most women shivering, it’s little wonder we eat at our desks. This remains a puzzle as the additional cost of cooling cannot be trivial and yet it persists.

### The Default Diet

Walk into any office cafeteria, and you’ll likely find a menu tailored to the male palate. Burgers, steaks, and hearty sandwiches dominate. Vegetarian options are often an afterthought. Salads? Sure, but they’re rarely the star of the show. The assumption is that everyone craves a protein-heavy, carb-loaded meal. But what about women who prefer lighter fare or have dietary restrictions? Homemade meals and decisions are easily made with remote work. No more having to time food around busy restaurants or fast-food joints. As a side note, I once had a co-worker who knew I was vegan do an office wide lunch at a BBQ joint knowing I couldn’t eat there. However, the place in question had a vegan menu and I went happily, to his obvious distain and derision. It wasn’t the first time a similar scene presented itself, but work from home can ensure it’s the last.

### The Exclusive Gathering

Meetings are where decisions are made, strategies are crafted, and visions are shared. Yet, women often find themselves on the periphery. The “boys’ club” mentality persists, relegating women to the sidelines. Whether it’s the golf course, the cigar lounge, or the informal post-meeting drinks, women are excluded. These spaces become breeding grounds for insider information and career opportunities. Zoom, Teams and Slack invites ensure everyone is gathered for decision making and input. That being said, women must consistently be vigilant that they are included as so often we are forgotten either by weaponized incompetence or plain incompetence. Many time I have personally had grep through meetings to determine if I should include myself or face the consequences of a withholding male majority leadership. Stay sharp, folks. Bring up a project pain point and you may find your calendar empty on your own project, just as when I suggested to a online health publishing group they take a competitor’s idea and tweak it to fit our needs instead of remaking the wheel. The project lead found this was tantamount to heresy to mention we even had competitors, how fragile was his ego. Fighting to include oneself is something women need to force even as our male counterparts do not.

### A Call for Change

Working from home is not for everyone, some truly enjoy the structure of an in-office work life. Once size does not fit all. Reimaging work such that those who can work from home are given the opportunity is a much easier call if peered through the lens of liberation and equality. For those who say men face similar challenges, all I can say is, “yes and?“ Highlighting the unique situations of women is something I have not seen discussed in the Return To Work Debate and it should be.

27,2024-03-31,Is this discrimination? ,u/ZombiePotato90,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bskh4s/is_this_discrimination/,antiwork,"I have autism, and I work for a Midwestern grocery store chain (our store is nicknamed ""Low-vee"" for its location). 

Anyway, I was hired as and am working as a delivery driver for the head start program. Due to head start being redone by the government, I only have one school to deliver to instead of four. This has resulted in reduced hours (I already work part time because I'm on disability). 

As such, I have tried to find other ways to get more hours. When I ask, I'm pointed to either unloading the truck, or cleaning. I am capable of doing the stocking, but prior experience leaves me filled with anxiety. I used to work at an auto-parts store, and was hired as a driver but forbidden to drive because of my sensitivity to sound and smell. As such, I was assigned to stocking when I wasn't running the register, because I was ""good at it,"" and never allowed to drive (never mind I rode to work on a motorcycle). 

At my current job, I expressed an interest in learning to run the register as a means of filling out the rest of my shift. I start at 7am, and am typically done with my assigned job around 9am, sometimes they'll ask me to go pick up items from another store across town. But these are not common enough to be reliable for hours. 
So I took the CBL, got register codes. But the store manager told me I wasn't going to be trained to use the register because I mentioned I had an issue with sounds and crowds. When I was hired, I made no secret of my autism or its effects. I said I was bothered by *loud* sounds and *large* crowds. Our store is small. An earphone helpe me mitigate stressors, which I only wear in one ear, so I can still hear. If noises and crowds bothered me so much, I wouldn't work retail. What bugs me most is I wasn't even given a chance at the register to see if I'd make the cut. 

I went up the chain to the district manager, who said we'd sit down and talk. That was two weeks ago, with nary a word. Should I go further up? Is this discrimination, or merely an annoyance? "
1,2024-03-31,Work Lunch Break Food Issue,u/Nvr_bn_a_pax,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1bskw9i/work_lunch_break_food_issue/,antiwork,"At my job we all receive a meal for our lunch break, the issue is that the kitchen only makes the meals at 3 times during the day for the different shifts. I work a 2-10p shift and generally get to take my lunch sometime between 6 and 8 but the food for my shift is made around 5-5:30. Those of us who don’t work in the kitchen aren’t allowed in the kitchen so what they do is make the break food all at once, box it up, and sit it out on the counter in the break area for each of us to grab during our break. By the time I actually get to take my lunch the food is always cold and has been sitting out for 1-3 hours. I, as well as many of my coworkers, have gotten food poisoning multiple times now as a result. I even had to call out of work today because of food poisoning so I’m literally missing work because of how they do breaks.

Is there anything I can do about this problem that won’t end in them terminating me for speaking up?"

I now have definitive proof that my boss scheduled me outside of agreed upon hours on my schedule without asking me. So on top of everything else she blatantly violated agreed upon hours without asking me first. I’m so pissed how does she think she can do this? Does she think I won’t go to HR and file a complaint.
Absolutely unbelievable."
