1,2024-02-29,CMV: White liberals are actually more racist than white conservatives.,u/MikeShoeCompany,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b3fqpl/cmv_white_liberals_are_actually_more_racist_than/,changemyview,"I've been reading and debating with some self-proclaimed white liberals here and elsewhere, and I've noticed and confirmed that most white liberals are actually more racist than white conservatives. The only difference is that a white liberal who votes Democratic Party wears a mask when courting the minority vote. If a specific minority person happens to be on their side, the mask stays on and they are not racist. However, when the minority expresses any hesitancy of any kind, however rational, however well-reasoned, that is when the mask comes off. That is when the white liberal starts siding with racist Trump supporters and enthusiastically wishes that the particular minority group should be rounded up and deported from the USA.



As a black guy living in the USA, I've always seen this double-faced policy that white liberals have, but recently in the Democratic primaries, I have confirmed that white liberals are actually more racist than white conservatives. They may be racist, but why would I say they are more racist than white conservatives? I say it because white conservatives are straightforward in their beliefs. If a white conservative doesn’t like minorities, they will tell you openly and unapologetically. They don’t have to wear a mask; if they don’t like you, they will tell you and let you know where they stand. If a white conservative isn’t racist, however, they will not use that fact as a bargaining chip to get something in return. A white conservative who isn’t racist doesn’t flip to “deport them all” the second a minority person disagrees with the Republican Party or one of the conservative’s policies.



White liberals, on the other hand, see minorities as a vehicle for political power; they allow no political freedom for their minorities at all. If you are a white man, you can think freely on whether taxes will go up or down, if immigration should be increased or decreased, foreign policy, welfare, etc. Not one white liberal would say to that white man, ""Since you disagree with us on this foreign policy aspect or this immigration policy, I think we should deport all Irish people back to Ireland, England, or Germany."" The reason? Because deep down, white liberals are racist; they think white people own this land, and minorities, whether they are born in this country and have lived for ten generations or they arrived last year, are just guests. That is why white liberals feel “ownership” in that particular minority’s  political expression. White liberals view a black person not voting for the Democratic Party the same way a parent views their child not going into a career they approve of.


The problem I have with white liberals is that it is one thing to be racist and proud of it or not, but to have this PR, this constant propaganda that white liberals convince themselves is what pisses me off. A white liberal would call for a minority to be deported the second they say they’ll not vote for Biden, but seconds later, they’re spreading how great and diversity-minded they are.



If the price of your acceptance is voting with us or you should be deported, you are not on my side. You are just a racist who is using “diversity” as a marketing ploy to get more supporters on your side.



If you endorse anything Trump may do to minorities once elected because a particular minority didn’t vote the way you wanted, you are not progressive or on the side of minorities. You are just an opportunist racist.



Challenge my perspective that white liberals/democrats who claim they would endorse any heinous action by the Trump administration against a particular minority if they don’t vote with us aren’t being racist."
1,2024-02-29,CMV: Population trending down in countries is a good thing,u/Cdm_15,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b3fz3f/cmv_population_trending_down_in_countries_is_a/,changemyview,"There has been lots of conversation about countries losing population which will hurt the country. I see this as a very good thing. 

Population trending down will eventually lead to more jobs available to everyone and higher pay. 

It is too expensive to raise a child and you basically have no shot at retirement if you have a kid. 

Statically it cost $250,000 to raise a kid to 18 years old. This doesn’t count all of the pain they cause you since they can’t take care of themselves. 

In fact, there are tons of terrible people in this world and lowering the population would get rid of some of them. 

Corporate big shots have drove everyone into the ground trying to maximize profits by making people work minimum 40+ hours a week working until we die.  

Every country should adopt a 1 child policy. 

Open to hearing out views are why population decreasing is a bad thing "

1,2024-02-29,CMV: A dictatorship is theoretically the most powerful and efficient government. But it has to be done very specifically.,u/tylerchu,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b3gzxr/cmv_a_dictatorship_is_theoretically_the_most/,changemyview,"I'm sure we've all heard the broad strokes of this argument before, but I think I can provide a bit of a slant that hasn't been largely thought of. 

Imagine a government structured much like the United States, but there is one supreme being above everyone else (SCOTUS, POTUS, Congress): the dictator. This dictator is quite unique compared to real world dictators:

1: Everyone acknowledges the dictator is in fact a dictator. Not a president for life, not a 150% approval rating supreme chancellor, not a god-emperor. A dictator. This acknowledgement serves the purpose of giving the dictator all the power they could ever want, so they don't have to pretend to follow the laws or invent new laws to boondoggle money and power to their favor. They can diddle kids for breakfast, shoot a couple people for lunch, torture a random or two for dinner, and bomb some random Middle Eastern country for a bedtime snack if they really wanted. And it'll all be perfectly legal. 

2: The dictator understands and internalizes that while they have all the power from point (1), their purpose in this government is to break stalemates, loosen stuck wheels, and purge corruption. 

The first point guarantees the dictator cannot become corrupt because they already have literally everything they could want. Combine this with point (2) to make the dictator understand that in order to keep up the ungodly opulence and power they have, it is in their best interests to not micromanage and just let the normally running government churn out the money and power that comes from a nation just existing in a more or less healthy state. Even if the dictator goes on the occasional bender committing what would normally be considered heinous crimes or even just micromanaging something they know they shouldn't, the government machine would bounce back and continue churning on. It'll all average out ok. Alternatively, if the dictator does literally nothing except jerk off all day in their gold plated bedroom, the government would then appear identical to the current US government. 

The end result I'm envisioning is a reasonably fit government running a reasonably satisfied nation with virtually no upper-level corruption. 

There's a lot of ways to tackle this CMV, but the arguments I will NOT entertain are:
1: Those that do not use the two points I've posed. For example, arguing the dictator will succumb to irrationality and ""become corrupt"".  
2: Semantic arguments."
1,2024-02-29,CMV: almost nothing can be said about human nature except for very basic things shared with other animals like “we feel fear” or “we enjoy play”.,u/spice-hammer,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b3gzzb/cmv_almost_nothing_can_be_said_about_human_nature/,changemyview,"When I think about what people are saying when they claim something is “human nature”, I think they’re generally trying to make a broad statement about how humans have behaved all throughout our history and prehistory and that we can expect our descendants to behave that way into the indefinite future. I think that the way people usually do this is they shop around the past for examples that confirm their line of reasoning and dismiss or ignore examples that contradict it. 

I’d point to a couple of pieces of evidence to support my claim, but there are others. 

**1. Funeral Rites**
Anatomically modern humans evolved sometime around 300,000 years ago. Funeral rites like burial, or really any special treating of the dead beyond how other animals are treated, only begin to appear in the archaeological record about 130,000 years ago - less than half the time we’ve been around as a species. 
Nowadays funeral rites appear in all societies as far as I know, but they aren’t a human constant. We can’t say that even something as deeply rooted as funerary customs are an example of human nature. What does that say about any other attempts we make to categorize something as human nature? 

**2. Feral Children and language**
One thing that has sadly been pretty well documented is that children who aren’t exposed to language by a certain point in their development can’t actually learn it. They can pick up a bit, but certain things like grammar which can normally be picked up fairly easily never take root. Somewhere in their brains some sort of switch remains unflipped and past a certain critical window it freezes into position. 
Surely this language “switch” isn’t the only device within our brains which can be flipped on or off by our surroundings. There must be different switches being flipped and freezing in place all the time, and depending on the combination of switches flipped by the surrounding culture people within that culture might never even know which switches they’re missing. If something as fundamental as language can be switched off, surely there are other things like (picking two at random) having extremely good peripheral vision or being unusually generous to strangers that might appear so ubiquitous as to be “human nature” within a certain culture but not within another."
1,2024-02-29,CMV: a commitment to always vote for the 'less bad' candidate is incompatible with a belief in meaningful electoral reform,u/Thecoldflame,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b3ha3r/cmv_a_commitment_to_always_vote_for_the_less_bad/,changemyview,"this isn't specifically about kier starmer or joe biden, though theyre obviously relevant to this topic.


we take our example voter here, joe. joe lives in a stagnant two-party democracy. neither candidate represents a meaningful advancement of joe's beliefs. one of the candidates is likely to act in closer accordance with his beliefs than the other, causing less harm, though


option A - if joe votes for his 'preferred' candidate unconditionally, this will potentially cause less harm in the shorter term, however also means that joe and those in his voting bloc surrender all their political leverage. 


option B - alternatively, joe can choose to potentially withhold his vote for his 'preferred' candidate and use this, likely along with others in his voting bloc, to secure political concessions. whilst this may potentially cause harm in the shorter term, it will grant joe and his bloc the potential to pursue meaningful political change in the longer term.


i don't endorse either of these beliefs for the sake of this discussion.
my view is that someone who both wishes to advance their political ideology AND believes that electoral reform is the means by which societal change takes place cannot also advocate for option A, as it prevents them from wielding their vote to any meaningful effect.


assumptions made:
-a third party does not have a realistic prospect of winning the next election in our hypothetical state. i believe this is a fair assumption given the elections that this debate is centered around.

-joe does not intend to participate in the electoral political process in any capacity other than voting, as is the case for the vast majority of potential voters

-the political parties in joe's country act in their own electoral self-interest

-joe cannot simply lie about his intention to withhold his vote, yet still consistently vote for his preferred candidate. this is a silly assumption"

1,2024-02-29,CMV: I should be able to openly reject any applicants at my company that say they believe in a religion of any kind.,u/Izzy187,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b3iinp/cmv_i_should_be_able_to_openly_reject_any/,changemyview,"Heres my take on it. If you are a logical and critical thinking individual that has grown up fully mentally you should have now realised that there isnt any sky daddy and that life appeared by the craziest amout luck and chance and as much as you should feel thankful for being able to exist with a consciousness for 80 or so years you ultimately can see that if any religion or god actually exists it wouldnt have been originated or created by a human.

That in mind you can conclude that realistically any person who believes that some made up fairy tails from the last 5000 years has any merit or actuality in the many billion years the universe existed is just flat out moronic. If a person believes in higher power then he definitely doesnt think critically and wouldnt be the best candidate (that is if the goal is to hire the best possible person for the job). Also with current laws as they are religions get protection and special powers which are ultimately a liability for the company and also are a hinderance to progress.

I will say that religions do have a place and even more so on the past where there were significantly more dumb people who needed guidelines in order to not shred themselves."

When I say this, I don't mean that one should be any less careful when talking about sensitive topics, I mean that race shouldn't be viewed in how much one understands a topic. This really came to my mind cause its something that, ya know, should be a duh statement but isn't really followed that much in society at least from what I have experienced. An instance of this would be that just because I am white, doesn't mean I know less about racial issues relating to black individuals like that of a black person. Sure, I may not have experienced them as a black person, but that doesn't mean I don't know the impact that they cause or could not experience that as a white person. 

The ways in my life which this has occurred to me have been in 2 incidents, both of which stuck to me cause of how bizarre and out of nowhere they were but how everyone pretty much agreed that, that is how it should be. **(You don't have to read the 2 situations its occurred to me if you don't want to, you can just skip to the concluding paragraph. I just wanted to give examples in case someone didn't understand what I meant cause I've been told I'm vague when writing)**

**Situation 1:** The first instance was during high school is this debate class I was in when we were talking about marginalized groups of people and the topic of Asian-American students came up in that the public education system does little to teach about the history or culture of Asian countries despite the United States claiming to be a ""melting pot"" of cultures. I added onto this idea in that it is unfortunate the education system doesn't teach ancient and current Asian history because the culture around there is very beautiful and we can see snippets of Chinese culture in things like china-towns in big cities like New York and Los Angeles. Someone (who may or may not have been of the Asian ethnicity), responded to my comment with the exact words ""You are white, what would you know about Chinese culture?"" I was just very shock and out of words and when no one responded to that including the teacher, I just said ""sorry"" and didn't speak for the rest of the discussion.

**Situation 2:** Second instance was just recently in college in my English class when we were doing group research projects on students who face marginalization coming into higher education. My group was me, and two black individuals. They both had the idea to do incoming black students as our group of marginalized students we would do research on and I agreed. During the project, I tried to be very sensitive about the topic to them but throughout it, I found times were they started to undercut my work or full out not including me into discussions. They undercut my work in changing up what i wrote in different instances of our research report. I know there were two or three times I noticed it but the only time I can remember the exact words they were was when I was doing a direct quote from a source talking about the ""...unintentional discrimination from teachers that black students face in high school that can lead them into college with less motivation to succeed,"" or something like that. I don't know this was a couple of months ago and I could pull up the report now but it would require a lot of digging. Almost directly after writing this sentence, no more than 2 minutes after. One of my teammates happens to change this quote, despite it being a DIRECT QUOTE and they removed the word ""unintentional."" Because this changes the meaning of the quote, I told my teammate that its a direct quote and that's what the source leads into and gives information on and one of the first things which comes from my teammates mouth is ""I know you are white so you don't understand but racism is never unintentional."" And my teammate seemed so apologetic as well as like that's just how it is and it isn't my fault but its something I should know. 

**Concluding Paragraph:** I don't know, these could again just be isolated incidents and it doesn't happen as much in society as I think they happen but let me know you all's experience in this. And when I say this, it doesn't have to be one race saying another race doesn't understand their race or something like that, It can go either way or they could be of the same race or whatever. Forgive me for any improper wording or something like that, I just wrote this up on the fly and feel very passionately about it but also don't feel like rereading the big essay I wrote. "

It wasn’t until the start of WW1 (1914) that the European nations began to consider who would control the Arab regions of the Middle East after their eventual win in WW1.

The Sykes Picot agreement in 1916, two years before WWI ended was between France and England. It declared that what is considered today Southern Israel, Palestine, Jordan, and Parts of Iraq would be under control of the United Kingdom. France would control parts of Turkey, Syria and Lebanon. Prior to Sykes Picot, these “States” didn’t really have borders. Under the Ottoman Empire, borders weren’t really a thing. The Empire ruled from 1299 to 1922.

When WWII ended, Zionist in France and England deemed giving European & Middle Eastern Jews a state of the their own. They proceeded to arbitrarily draw borders. When Israel was formed in 1948, France was the primary supplier of weapons and investment. In fact, France provided Israel with their nuclear capability. France built their first nuclear reactor and gave them the bomb. In Exchange, Israeli mercenaries fought against a revolution in French controlled Algeria and France received economic benefits from selling and staffing their nuclear facilities.

Around this time, the Secular State of Egypt began their occupation of Gaza (1949 to 1956). Temporarily lost after ATTACKING Israel, again, in what is called the Second Arab Israeli War. Egypt’s military did not grant the Palestinian people independence, they occupied them. Then Egypt and consortium of nearby Arab nations attacked Israel again over the Suez Canal Crisis, which initiated the real conflict in the region…control over the economies of the region by controlling the shipping channels. Egypt had the control. President Nasser of Egypt in 1956 declared the Suez Canal a Nationalized and private resource, blocking a MAJOR shipping channel. Europe demanded shipping access, and Israel had threatened prior to 1956 that preventing the shipment of goods (without goods, you starve…like we Gaza today) to their country was an act of war and would deem a response.

Israel went on the attack and took control of Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt folded and signed a treaty to get back Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula in exchange for access to the Straits of Tiran for shipping. Egypt would maintain control of the canal. Israel left Gaza and the Sinai after occupying for under a year. Egypt’s control and occupation resumed in Gaza and lasted until 1967, when once again, President Nasser of Egypt thought it wise to force of closure of the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping. Israel attacked Egypt immediately on the Sinai Peninsula. Other Arab nations including Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon attacked Israel’s other borders. In Six Days, Israel captured the entire Egyptian Sinai Peninsula, Egyptian Occupied Gaza, the Jordanian Occupied West Bank, and the Syrian Occupied Golan Heights.

Egypt’s president Nasser resigned, and was propelled back into office. Egypt maintained a canal blockade leading to the 1970s energy crisis and the 1973 oil crisis

President Anwar el-Sedat signed the Egypt-Israel peace treaty in 1979, and relations were normalized after turbulent economic years due to the energy crisis. It was all over the control of Oil. The entire match of chess between the west, the Middle East and Russia. 

President Sedat was assassinated in 1981 by Egyptian Fundamentalist army officers. This was the beginning of Fundamentalist Islamic rule under President Mubarak who ruled until the Egyptian revolution in 2011. The Fundamentalist are the head cases we have today in the governments Syria, Yemen and the likes of Libya. Evil people in power. Pure evil. If there was a Satan, it would be Islamic Fundamentalist (or Putin). The kind of people who see a beheading as a normal act of control. 

Israel withdrew from all of Gaza in 2005 until the cycle of Palestinian suicide bombings, rocket attacks and knife attacks sparks a military-police state response from Israel. Now, Israeli citizens were growing into Warhawk nationalists under Netanyahu. They were hitting back harder. Palestinians threw rocks, Israel shot back. Tensions continued to grow and Iran saw opportunity to fund a military presence to actuate a proxy war with Israel. Israel responded with civil rights abuses, allowed for more settlements, and created a blockade on goods to the region. The surrounding Arab nations of pissed, but wouldn’t help the Palestinians as they never did before either. They all start increasing terrorist activities via Iran. Hezbollah, Hamas, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. 

After Israel left Gaza in 2005, the region’s terrorists saw it as a success and increased activities. Gaza elected Hamas as their government in 2006. This brings us to today, my friend. The Palestinians people have been used as pawns for over 60 years passing hands between Arab control and Israeli retaliation, terrorist attacks on Israeli citizens by Iranian backed militias and severe Israeli retaliation…to the point where we have the human rights crisis on our hands. There is only one solution, eradicate terrorism and teach Israel to find its heart. "
32,2024-02-29,"CMV: I believe that high schools across the U.S. should reinvigorate vocational electives (carpentry, electric, welding), in order to expose more students to the skilled trades.",u/Lfitz26,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b3lcoj/cmv_i_believe_that_high_schools_across_the_us/,changemyview,"With the rapid implementation of Artificial Intelligence into the workforce, more jobs are continuously being threatened. According to a study by the Pew Research Center in 2023 ""workers with a bachelor’s degree or more (27%) are more than twice as likely as those with a high school diploma only (12%) to see the most exposure."" It is simply not enough to get a college diploma to stay employed and foster a successful career anymore. 

While I have an undergraduate degree and a MBA, I stumbled into the residential building industry where I have worked as a Project Manager over the past 8 years. When talking with many of my friends that I made during my time in higher education, I noticed that significantly more of them are increasingly worried about job security due to AI. In my field I have seen the exact opposite problem. There are not nearly enough skilled labors, such as carpenters and electricians, to fill the continuously growing demand. In the most recent survey performed by The Association of General Contractors of America it was noted that ""the most widely reported difficulty was for installers, \[at\] 83 percent... \[plumbers\] at 82 percent, and carpenters \[at\] 80 percent."" There are many factors as to why this is the case, but I believe that one of the most signficant is that a majority of these skilled tradesman have retired or are close to retirement age.

In the 70's and 80's these high school vocational programs were extremely common and presented another opportunity to the ""Baby Boomer"" generation. Due to budget cuts and almost sole priority in higher education, a lot of students do not even realize that learning a trade is another viable option. I am not suggesting that trade schools are more valuable than colleges, I just believe that the newest generation needs this exposure now more than ever.

Technology advancements, medical advancements, entertainment, etc have all vastly improved in recent decades.

However, when I look at other and more integral aspects of life, i believe that things will only get worse. When I look at the core/essential activities of a regular person's life, I see that such activities have been getting harder and harder. Such aspects/activities include: getting a job, paying bills, buying a house, getting married, raising a family, overall fulfillment and happiness. 

\- Getting a job will probably get harder with higher requirements for entry, especially for decent paying jobs; vs In the past, getting a job was much easier with low skill requirements;

\- Paying bills will probably continue to be an issue since it will be hard for the pay to keep up with the prices of goods; vs In the past, working standard low skill jobs will still earn you enough money to raise a family;

\- Buying a house will become harder and harder since the real estate will most likely shrink while the population grows; vs In the past, buying a house was much easier for the opposite reason.

\- Getting married and raising a family: relationships have been on decline where people are more pragmatic than ever. Relationships, in most cases, have been very transactional and with cold hard standards. Differences in world views are harder to reconcile than in the past. The level of commitment in relationships has also declined. Dating and getting married have lost its appeal to a sizable portion of young people.

\- Overall fulfillment and happiness will likely go down due to an overflow of information and cultural discrepancies; vs In the past, people were content with their normal everyday life without having to compare themselves with strangers around the world.

So imo, aside from medical advancements, the essential aspects of today's live have been going downhill and will continue to go downhill in the future. Most advancements we have today are only superficial such as fancy new phones, movies and entertainments that only serve to distract us while we struggle to handle the burdens that the previous generations did not have to deal with. I'm afraid that this trend will continue into the future. Though this is only my subjective opinion, I welcome any attempts to brighten up my view. Thank you!"

Theyre an avenue of scientific progress that has potential to provide large genuine help to many people, particularly lower income people by driving the cost of food down. The only compelling arguement I've heard against them is the corporate greed element. I heard a story about monsanto I think sueing a small farmer because they accidently cultivated their proprietary corn, and was therefore liable for theft, which is obviously awful, but the corporate greed isnt inherent to GMOs, it's inherent to capitalism.

You cant have a stateless society because there needs to be a hierarchy. You need to have laws and regulation. So you need to have people enforcing those laws. By definition you would have state. If you have a group or people who are enforcers of laws then what is stopping them from encroaching on more power. 

2. No one is entitled to your goods and services. For example, if your home had an issue with your plumbing. Would you be entitled to someone else plumbing service? What if your home or business needed its roof repaired and it was big strenuous job. You can’t be entitled to someone’s else’s labor. Therefore they are going to name their price and highest payers get the services and communism falls apart.

3. Communism relies on perfect moral citizens to even be considered possible. You would need a crimeless society free of violence, theft, etc.. this is implausible and going back to reason number 1, because having perfect citizens and a society with no crime is implausible. You would need a hierarchy or state to enforce said laws and regulations, and controlling the means every thing. In a communist system, where the state controls the means of production and distribution, there is a centralization of authority. This concentration of power in the hands of the state can lead to a lack of checks and balances, creating an environment where a single party or leader can wield significant control.

Now on to the bad things.

It's 2024. 

* Two major wars are going on in the world. Many more small conflicts too. 
* Europe and Russia are having a cold-war era arms-race, featuring an unpredictable de facto dictator with a nuclear arsenal. Tensions haven't been this high since the cold-war. 
* China might invade Taiwan. 
* Pollution and microplastics are ruining the environment and our health. 
* AI has advanced rapidly to the point where it can create videos and photos that you can't tell if they are fake. 
* AI has taken away many jobs, and is on trajectory to take many more. 
* A mental health crisis is raging. 
* Trump is threatening to dismantle NATO, which would have a huge impact on global unity. 

In my opinion the world was at it's best during 1991-2014. During that time, democracy was thriving, but technology was also developed to the point where people could benefit from it.

After 2014, things started really going downhill. Russia annexed Crimea, Kim Jong-Un became the leader of NK and started threatening everybody, a global pandemic started killing millions, the effects of pollution started becoming more evident, I could go on for days. 

The current state of global geopolitics paints a picture where the wheels for changing the entire order of the world are being set into motion. What if China invades Taiwan? What if Russia wins in Ukraine? Who's the next target of a greedy leader? 

The brief era of democracy is over. Big things are going to happen. I fail to see a scenario where every angry world leader is like ""Never mind, let's cool off the tensions and de-escalate"". I know in today's world it's a lot of talking rather than acting when it comes to world leaders and politicians, but with all of these geopolitical disputes happening at the same time around the world, it seems like it's setting up for some kind of a huge event. We have seen this happen in the past many times, why wouldn't it happen again? It seems like the world will never be free of imperialistic world leaders, with Stalin, Hitler, and now Putin. 

Pollution and microplastics - well, not a lot of to say there. A recent study found microplastics in every placenta they sampled. The health effects of microplastics are largely unknown. And pollution, we are doing good things for pollution, but with wars and everything else going on, I think many governments will allocate their resources to helping with the wars instead of focusing on pollution, even if climate scientists say that we should act urgently towards climate change. So wars and all these tensions will be a huge bump in creating a green- sustainable future. 

I, as a 19- year old student, have lost hope for the future. Studying and everything feels pointless, knowing all the shit that is happening, and is going to happen. "

 a big enough control of the flow of money/information of the state  


²- And By that I mean: every way of seeing how much net worth they have  


The reason for this is simple: corruption. If Politicians can hide their funds, how can the people be certain that they aren't stealing money from the state for themselves, or using the extra information some of they get in relation to the normal folk ( for example, that a bill is to be passed that worsens some military contractors, so that they can sell them ) to get extra money? This is a bigger problem in countries like Brazil, in which both of the candidates of the 2022 election (2nd day) stole at least hundreds of millions of money worth in $ from the brazilian people, and the people clearly do not trust their politicians to not steal multiple billions worth in £ every year

1,2024-03-01,CMV: the notion that you’re more likely to be assaulted than falsely accused is a hypothesis and not a fact,u/LaloTwinsDa2nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b3poh3/cmv_the_notion_that_youre_more_likely_to_be/,changemyview,"The above notion is stated often when men state their skepticism at any given accusation, stating that it’s perfectly possible that it is false.

The reply is that false accusations are exceedingly rare. 

This comes from a 2000s metastudy which used meticulous criteria to determine a false accusation and determined those to be 2.1-10.9% with an average of about 5% of claims reported to the police. 

It then compares this number to the number of women who state they have been assaulted when surveyed by organisations like RAINN. 

The thing is the survey’s findings are not put to strict criteria like the study’s so why are they compared. They’re inconclusive for the purposes of statistics. I’m not saying they’re wrong, just that they could be false or true and we wouldn’t know unless they were investigated. 

The thing is there is a statistic that exists that was meticulously investigated by the same institutions that investigated in the original study. 

It’s the rate of convictions. An oft stated feminist complaint is that the conviction rate is so low. About 2%. 

So at the low end of 2.1% to 2% it’s about 1:1 and at 10.9% to 2% it’s more than 5:1. At it’s average it’s 5 false accusations for every sexual assault, how is that exceedingly rare? 

The only way this doesn’t work is if you assume that false accusations are exceedingly rare. 

But this is an assumption that comes from this research thus it’s an assumption that relies on itself to seek to prove itself. 

Don’t get me wrong the hypothesis seems to me to be a good hypothesis, most women seemingly get no benefit from a false accusation (though this reasoning wouldn’t apply to men of serious means) but it’s still just a hypothesis that seems to have invaded both the public and professional mythos as a well established fact. 

I get why some would argue that we have enough evidence that false accusations are rare, the argument I’m making hardly helps the woman who was violated and is disbelieved and denied justice. I’m well aware of attrition cases that are dropped.

But unfairness doesn’t make an argument true data does.

And as far as I can tell, without some slick statistical buffoonery the data isn’t there.

It's annoying. 

This conflict could be easily resolved if both sides didn't hold this archaic mentality that being of a different ethnicity/faith = green light to murder one another. 

People in the West have their own lives and struggles to worry about without being guilt-tripped into another ""Poor Middle East"" debate. As if the 2000s wasn't enough. But i'm open to hearing what others think.

Even though I like some Taylor Swift songs ('the 1' and 'illicit affairs' spring immediately to mind), I think she is largely an average song writer and the work of artists like Lorde and/or Lana Del Ray is so much better.

I will confess that I've not listened to Swift's entire catalogue but what I have listened to (Folklore and Evermore) has largely been average with a few exceptions. When I say average, I mean that she uses cliches and common turns of phrase that regularly make me cringe. I'm approaching it from a poetry perspective rather than a musical one. 

What are my credentials? I have a B.A. majoring in English Literature, so I'm not exactly new to poetry, but I don't think that I hold any secret key to what is good because I'm educated. Am I just being an insufferable snob?"

But what if you heard that people at the ages of 9-13 are basically in puberty, which means they are not only capable of forging relationships, but also capable of producing cells for sexual reproduction? 

Did you know? This age of consent is just a false forged social construct made by the influential horde to make us go a certain lifestyle. I am not saying I comply with child molestation and rape, but this age of consent is just a plain old lie. Children and teens alike can date and forge a meaningful relationship to whoever they love, as long as both parties are consenting. It is just a bullshit false moral social construct.

If you comply to them, that basically means you are inevitably vulnerable to the lies of the powerful, like if they state like pineapple on pizza is bad, then you just follow them due to this “horde mentality” that I noticed among them, especially considering the fact that there are many examples of this occurring in daily life, especially the internet.

Of course there are extreme sub-cultures that are starkly different (i.e. Cholo subculture, ghetto hiphop subculture, goth subculture etc.) but in general, Americans are very similar in values and behaviours. Any American who's travelled abroad will realise this when they realise they're treated as *just* Americans and not ""Korean"" Americans or ""Black"" Americans. 

The reality is Americans being already culturally similar, if Americans became a mixed society, there would be more unity. Americans are stuck in a constant state of trying to differentiate themselves from one another, but if every American had Asian, African, Hispanic & European ancestry in them due to generations of interracial coupling, there'd likely be less divide.

Creole societies are not a new thing either. Especially in South America & the Caribbean. 

Dominicans for example, often identify as Dominican. Not their colour. When you meet a ""dark"" Dominican & a ""lighter Dominican"" they will both identify as Dominican, not basing their identities on complexion because they already know that despite variances in shade, somewhere back they are mixed. This is how it could be in the US but I'm open to others' thoughts"

No chimerisation: meaning No hybridisation with other species. Human and ape. Human and pig genes. humans secreting insect pheromones etc. 

No Organ harvesting. Creating clones just for medical transplants. Building infrastructures like future insurance banks for blood, organs etc. 

No in Vitro cultures. Creating tumours or forcing infections in clones to experiment with new drugs in whole live beings and monitoring their vitals.

No brain implants. Not using human bodies as remotely controlled avatars etc. (which would also lead to extreme increases in terrorism and suicide bombers and attackers). 

No creating superhuman soldiers. If we were to strengthen Humans it should be democratised and horizontally distributed. not saved only for an elite class of Nietzschean warriors.

No psychomotive assistance of AI research. Using living human brains to enhance computational complexity and emulating AGI platforms biologically. (Biocomputing).

No MKUltra type experiments by secret services around the world trying to test the limits and all nooks and crannies of human psychology on (typical) human or metahuman specimens. 

No commoditization of metahumans as patented products by multinational corporations. And no subjugation of theirs in less regulated and protective forms of law. Equal rights with the rest.

So the main goal would be to use it to prevent illness like cancers, autoimmunes etc. Mechanical defects like bad heart valves architecture etc. And tendencies like mental illness , unnecessary violence, envy etc. this would cut billions of costs in medical bills, in human incarceration infrastructures, correctional institutions etc.

We could even beat human weaknesses like war mindset, greed, hypergamy, hybristophilia, xenophobia, exclusion of divergences etc. and build human relationships on a more healthy foundation than we ever before imagined.

Long-term this could potentially clear the human gene pool from most its bad apples and save humanity of endless suffering and obstacles. It's not a matter of if we should, it's a question of when we are starting.

1,2024-03-01,CMV: A semi-fixed price model is the best for intercity rail transit systems,u/Soyuz_1848,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b3rz84/cmv_a_semifixed_price_model_is_the_best_for/,changemyview,"Define intercity rail: trains, both high speed and normal speed, that travel between cities as opposed to within a city. 

Define semi-fixed price model: there are mainly four types of price models in my definition, which are **fixed, semi-fixed, limited fluctuating, full fluctuating**. 

A **fixed** price model is simple, the price of a certain train and a certain class between city A and city B is always the same, for example $100, no matter the day, no matter how long in advance you book. And there is typically only one type of ticket (aka only one type of cancellation and change policy) for the same train. It's mainly used by bus or MRT companies. 

A **semi-fixed** price model is more complicated. The price is generally fixed but there may be discounts if demand is low. And prices generally don't change much after the tickets are released. There may be one or multiple (Flexible, Standard, Basic etc) types of tickets. For example the standard price of a train ticket from A to B is $120 and it's usually sold at or near the standard price. However, during times of very low demand, the price can become lower, like $70 or $45. It's currently used by China and Japan. 

A **limited fluctuating** price model is even more flexible than semi-fixed. While a semi-fixed price model typically operates at or near the ""regular price"" and doesn't change a lot after tickets are released, and typically restrict how soon in advance one can book (e.g. book max 14 days in advance), a limited fluctuating price model has a high ceiling which is only reached during special events. The actual price fluctuates a lot, and there are typically multiple types of a ticket (Flexible, Standard, Basic etc). For example the standard ticket price between A and B is $300 and is only reached during special events. The actual price can be $50 or $200 depending on how soon in advance you book and the day you travel. It only becomes $300 when all the cheaper tickets are sold out, typically for a same-day booking, or during peak events. It's currently used by Germany. 

A **full fluctuating** price model gets rid of the ceiling altogether and the price is fully market based without any regulation. I'd like to be educated about which countries use such a pricing system for their trains. 

As for why the semi-fixed price model is the best:

(1) Why it is better than a fixed model: With a fixed model, trains are likely to remain empty on ""backward trips"". Like if a lot of people travel from A to B but not from B to A, the train going back from B to A is likely to be empty and the train company doesn't get any revenue. By discounting the ticket the train company can earn more money, and passengers travelling ""backwards"" can enjoy an affordable trip. 

(2) Why it is better than a limited fluctuating model: 

2a. A lot of senior citizens, at least in China, do not know how to use a booking app (e.g. 12306) and have to buy same-day tickets in person. Fluctuating the price is discriminating against the elderly who don't know how to use the internet. 

2b. A semi-fixed price model means that you don't need to track prices long in advance and book in advance. Because of the more flexible and more frequent nature of train travel compared to air travel, having to track prices and buy tickets many weeks in advance is more of a problem for trains than for flights. 

(3) Why it is better than a full fluctuating price model:

2a and 2b still apply, but in addition: 

During the Chinese New Year each year, many migrant workers need to travel back to home, as well as business people. A semi-fixed price system gives everyone an equal chance of securing the ticket, while a fully fluctuating one selectively prices out the poor. And it's usually the poor living in rural areas that have a stronger sense if family reunion. By using a semi-fixed (or fixed) price system, we put people before profit; by using a fully fluctuating one, we put profit before people.

For example, back in the day, men and women acted with sophistication and elegance (Aubrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, Sharon Tate, Elizabeth Taylor, James Dean, Sean Connory, Marlon Brando et cetera), but now we glorify disrespectful and classless behavior. I can't think of one actor or actress who acts with grace and sophistication. Even actors from back in the day had the same level of grace and sophistication about them. James Dean was seen as a ""bad boy,"" but even then, he had manners and sophistication about him despite being a ""bad boy."" Society just doesn't value class and sophistication; we value trash, disrespectful, rude, and unsophisticated behavior.  
  
Look at the actors and actresses from back in the day—how they dressed and spoke. Look at the singers from back in the day—what they sang about and the words they used.  
Listen to how men spoke about women in their songs from the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, and listen to how men talk about women in their songs today. I can't think of any song about women and love by a singer from back in the day where they continuously called women ""bitches, hoes, sluts"" or just objectified them.  
  
But in 2024, it seems like all tall male singers will call women bitches, sluts, or hoes. Look at how celebrities handle beef with others now in comparison to back in the day. Nowadays, if two entertainers have drama between them, they will cuss each other out and talk negatively about each other on social media in such an immature way, but when celebrities had beef with each other in the past, they never got super disrespectful with each other.

Notably, it [negatively impacts safety](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813473) for drivers as well as for other road users; shortens necessary reaction times (especially relevant in an age of distracted driving), and is even bad for the climate, since most cars are at their most efficient at [below the most common posted highway speed limits](https://afdc.energy.gov/data/10312#:~:text=Midsize%20conventional%20gasoline%20cars%20achieve,between%2045%20and%2075%20mph.) (obviously this is US data in imperial units but as I understand it, 100kph+ is the common highway speed limit in most metric-system countries). And in many cases it doesn't actually get you to your destination meaningfully faster--abiding by a posted 60mph/100kph limit is only a few minutes faster over a 20 mile / 32km trip than traveling 70mph/112kph, something that can easily come out in the wash of stoplights, parking, etc.

So with that in mind, I feel confident in having established we'd be better off with less speeding. But why speed cameras?

Obviously, road designs that discourage speeding are a common suggestion by people who fetishize the Netherlands, but this is really only applicable to places that are not trying to incentivize cruising-speed driving, and that have the political will to redesign streets, which is far from universal.

Speed cameras also ignore any bias on the part of a citing officer. While there have been studies suggesting that speed camera programs have inequitable outcomes, this has largely as I understand it been an artifact of deployment patterns for cameras, one largely solved by putting  more speed cameras in richer and/or whiter neighborhoods.

Lastly, and this is mostly a US issue, speed cameras reduce the potential for [violence between officers and drivers](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64458041), which is good for both those concerned about a rise in police violence *and* those concerned about officer safety.

You may say ""but this is just another way for cities to get revenue"" to which I think the most reasonable response would be: just push a little less hard on the accelerator it's really not that hard."

Kiawentiio has received a lot of hate because of how poor her acting is perceived to be, and Thalia  is receiving a lot of fatphobic comments or how ""she doesn't look like Mai"". 

I think the fans are expecting the perfect show: a genuine and faithful adaptation with incredible visuals and CGI, writing comparable to the animated show, amazing acting, AND a cast that looks like the original. That's an order that is impossible to meet regardless of how much money you pour into it. I think it is this expectation that led to the hate and toxicity that we see against this show.

School was really fun, we don't bring phones to school at all, so it's rlly 8 hours of ""old times"" iykwim. The paper notes, the stupid stuff we do to past time. And my friend group is really fun and we are great friends and can either be goofy or deep with each other. 

I'm in my third year of college, graduating next year. I still have my friend group in my college, but each of us is majored in different things, so our meetings are down from 40 hours a week to only 1-5 hours. 

The way my brain is wired is to meet up with them, have fun, and then think about all of our memories together and be nostalgic until our next meeting. I even journaled every day during high school so I don't forget our memories!

I'm a highly nostalgic person and value my friends the most. I know that after college, each of us is rlly going to go their way, either marry, career and stuff. And 'friends' is going to get down on the list of priorities since we'll have bigger responsibilities to deal with. 

So the ""fun"" is ending. I know we can still meet up, but it's rlly not the same. Idk how I'm going to stay happy after graduation, especially after 9 years now of studying with them. +srry if I made it long

I do not believe this claim. In fact, I'm all but certain that physical media is going to see a major increase in sales among younger demographics.

There are a few reasons I believe this. 

Reason 1: price and convenience.

Why bother chasing different subscriptions or dealing with an unreasonable number of ads when you can just buy a copy of what you want to watch or listen to? You don't have to worry about it getting traded hands, getting interrupted, or having an unstable connection. 


Reason 2: you don't like everyone, you like your favorites.

You don't need to have an entire cable library at your fingertips if you're only watching the same few dozen shows and movies over and over again. Same principle applies to music, you don't like everyone, you like your favorites.



Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying streaming services are going out the window, I firmly believe that streaming services will continue to replace live broadcast television and radio, mostly as an extention of Video-On-Demand. 

My argument is that streaming services are just that, a service, and most people are going to realize that they just want the product. "

I've been working for 40+ years now and I've seen people get unjustly fired for all kinds of shit. Sometimes for even just doing their jobs. 

I’ve done some human resources as well, within a few of my rules, and I’ve been asked to do some very unsavory things, like do a PIP plan for somebody they just don’t like, or for other reasons I won’t mention. If an employer doesn’t like you for whatever reason, they can just do up a PIP plan and you’re out a week later. And you’ve got no leg to stand on. You could even be doing your job, and they will let you go.

America is the only country that has Atwill employment. We are so behind and we favor the employer so much, that it puts everyone else at risk. Fuck that.

Unemployment only lasts so long and getting a job with the same salary as your previous one can take some time (years for some people).

The fact that you can get fired for sneezing the wrong way is bullshit. If you live in a state with at will employment laws you can be terminated at any time, for any reason and sometimes no reason at all. I live in Texas, and they can fire you for whatever reason. Even if the boss is sexually harassing you, even if they don’t like the color of your skin, no lawyer will help you at all and it will cost thousands and thousands of dollars even begin to sue the company, and most of the time you just lose, because you can never prove it.

Don't get me wrong, I've seen this go the other way too, where company's are too lax on problem employees and let them hang around. I just don't think with how much most people dedicate their lives to their jobs that they can just be let go for no reason and pretty much no recourse.

I think there should be an independent employment agency that deals with employee lay offs and terminations. For example, it would be like civil court, where a judge/jury looks at the facts from both parties (employer and employee) and then makes a decision from there. I know you can sue in civil court for wrongful termination, but having an agency strictly dedicated to employment issues would be more helpful for the average person (you have to have deep pockets to sue, and most people don't have that).

Side unpopular opinion: You shouldn't have to give two weeks notice before you move on from your job. If your company can dump you at any moment without telling you, the social expectation should be the other way as well.

For those who don't know, well meaning do gooders have required new commercial trucks made 2025 to include crash avoidance systems.

The system i am talking about causes a truck to automatically brake when it exceeds the posted speed by over 20 miles an hour, or if it approaches a stopped or slow moving vehicle.

Sounds great right?

My company fleet has a few already and omg are they not ready. One has misaligned sensor that reads off ramp speed signs as road speed. Another randomly thinks the truck is doing 90. Even though it is governed at 70. The governor works as reliably as the speedometer or odometer but for some reason not the crash avoidance sensor.  All of them have seen ghosts braking in front of them.  

Now i know 40 tons of steel barreling diwn the road with an inattentive driver scares you, but most car truck crashes involve an inattentive car driver rear ending a slow moving truck. 

So I'm  saying it now while these trucks are rare, they will cause more crashes, and more fatalities. 

If anyone can prove me wrong, please do. If not please write your congressperson and ask them to delay this law until the tech is ready."

Second is i am using the [4th power law](https://pavementinteractive.org/reference-desk/design/design-parameters/equivalent-single-axle-load/) (the formula that determines how much a vehicle can damage a road compared to another). So using a 2 ton car compared a 350 pound Electric cyclists by the formula is about 1/160,000 of a 2 ton sedan. Or it takes 160,000 cyclists to match one 2 ton sedan.

So in reality if that driver is paying $10k in pure road servicing taxes then a cyclist would pay respectively $0.06. If a cyclist is paying more then that they should be able to access a parody of infrastructure for cars for example 

* If a city has 200 lane miles of freeways then cyclists should be able to also expect 200 lane miles of grade separated freeway (or bike trails).
* If a city has 600 lane miles of thoroughfares then cyclist receive [comparable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk8uhfFCtM0).
* If drivers have 20 on street parking spaces available per block then cyclists receive the same (not street signs or trees but actual purpose built lockups like rings on the meter poles or signs). If parking minimums require 200 parking spaces for a Walmart then that Walmart must also provide 200 parking spaces for cyclist.
* If a purchase of an electric vehicle just nets you a $7.5k government subsidy then a $7.5k dollar electric bike can be made free (Though a percent of purchase could be required like 50-75% of value up to 7.5k but they cannot delineate using power or number of wheels.

I would also agree in the requirement of Registration of bike and liability insurance. And yes I know ""How do 8 year old do use a bike"" is an issue I'm more focused on proportional taxes to infrastructure available. Not the biggest fan of it but If I had to have that to get this in return I would agree.

Also when I say parody I'm not talking about cyclist needing 150 foot wide 8 lane trail to parody a 150 foot wide 8 lane interstate. As long as the total lane miles of (4-5 foot wide lanes) wide 2-4 lane trails equal equals 200 lane miles, I find comparable (Doesn't even need clover leafs with other trails just grade separated from all other none cyclist/ped traffic)."

Sure, demand for physical video formats have declined, and most video rental chains except Redbox ceased to exist. Sure, mainstream or casual customers have shifted from physical releases to streaming and digital.

However, those factors don't make video rental shops no longer a thing. Rather they make a mainstream video rental chain a very risky business anymore, but one can dream a mainstream video rental chain can take on and rival Netflix (and another capable streaming rival) someday.

Nonetheless, surviving independent video rental shops cater well especially to certain demographics and more likely have rarer movies unavailable on streaming and digital. Furthermore, such shops do unique cataloguing that you've never seen in mainstream rental chains back in their heydays.

They have 4K UHD Blu-ray and (regular) Blu-ray movies. Sure, the supposed successors (of DVD format) won't attract casual customers, but they can help surviving shops adjust if customers can give 4K and Blu-ray discs better chance than the customers (and studios) have had (not?). Furthermore, rare Blu-ray and 4K UHD disc movies have been hot eBay auction (NOT Buy-It-Now) items.

Speaking of rare, if they emphasize more on rarities of lesser known movies, surviving shops will attract more customers and can outrival Netflix and other such services. Furthermore, the shops highlighting and emphasizing releases by Criterion Collection, Vinegar Syndrome, Kino Lorber, and other boutique labels with high appeal can also thrive and attract certain customers.

There are many other things that surviving shops can do, like something unique or never have been done before.

To say video rental stores/shops are no longer a thing may not reflect how video rental shops have been doing recently. Probably the absence of a huge video rental chain and high usage of streaming services (NOT counting piracy!) must have reinforced such (mis)assumption."

Based on my experience with migrants, I am sure that both of these ideas are myths. In the comments of one of the posts, one Tunisian engineer (with no work experience) argued that his life would be significantly better if he flipped burgers in Germany than if he worked as an engineer in his home country. Also many times in immigration debates I have seen people say that immigrants can support a huge family at home. I understand that these are two different questions. But both myths stem from the fact that people simply do not understand the difference in the cost of living in different countries.   
Some people simply cannot deduct the cost of rent and taxes from their salary in developed countries and then divide the remaining amount by the difference in the cost of goods and services. Others cannot do the same, and also overestimate how cheap everything is in developing countries.   
I live in the Philippines and there are a lot of people around me who work abroad or have experience working abroad. In most cases that I know, the life of people who work abroad is not much better than at home and most of them can only afford to send gifts home for the holidays.  
These myths are very harmful. They give people completely unrealistic ideas about immigration. And scammers often take advantage of this.

If you are a logical and critical thinking adult individual that has fully grown up mentally you should have now realized that as gloomy as reality is there is no life after we die, there isn't an almighty creator who promises entry to a paradise eden to humans (the only mammals that are super-duper special enough) who act good throughout life, and also that after death your consciousness will magically float away and get transferred to another body after you die. As hard as that is to accept for people that is sadly the truth. Life on earth appeared by the craziest smallest chance via multiple incredibly lucky an fortunate situations and as much as you should and do feel thankful for being able to exist with a consciousness for 80-some years you ultimately can see that this is all just extremely circumstantial. 

If there was an almighty creator or messiah there is zero reason why it has anything to do with humans. The fact that humans came up with all the religions available tells me even more to not believe. Have you seen how much humans can bullshit? Have you seen how delusional some people can be? Are you really going to take religion which is by nature word of mouth as actual fact without any evidence to support it? 

&#x200B;

Now onto the main topic of discussion:

Now onto with all this in mind you can conclude that a person who believes that passed down stories from the last 5000 years aside from being historically entertaining deserve any serious attention (let alone a freaking protected status) or have any merit or actuality in the many billion years the universe existed is just flat out moronic. If a person believes in higher power then he or she definitely doesn't think critically, accepts word for fact, and in my opinion wouldn't be the best candidate (that is if the goal is to hire the best possible person for the job, not a mindless drone). A belief in some passed down stories which have protection and special powers on a federal legal scale are ultimately a liability for the company and also are a hindrance to progress. This isn't even going into how insane the concept of protecting is to begin with.  
I will say that religions do have their place in the world and even more so in the past where there were significantly more dumb people who needed guidelines and order as they were likely to kill each other. People like stories, people like to have a sense of belonging, people want security and to not fear the future. Religions gives them all of this and keeps them happy. I dont want to hire someone who blindly accepts what they are offered. What their culture by birth offered or bestowed upon them. I want freethinking, men and women who are not afraid to accept reality. 

&#x200B;

Please keep this discussion civil and not accusatory. I am not looking for someone to change my view on whether religions or spirituality are real or truthful but rather why they deserve to be protected as a whole (not individually - I think in the current system where they are protected it is unfair and unjust to not hire people who believe in a particular one. I think a simple checkbox asking if you associate with any religion is would be what I am looking for). Try not to compare this to things such as race, sexual orientation, ect. as those are things we are born with. 

  
As an adult the things you choose to believe in are your business. Fairy tales and magic spirits have no place in mine.

The primary reason Russia has been the way it is now must have been resources in Siberia that we may not be aware of, like oil reserves discovered decades ago. There's not much reports of Siberia's oil reserves, compared to ones in the Middle East.

Of course, there's Soviet Union, which no longer exists since 1991 dissolution, yet Russia still took up most of the Soviet territory.

I'm not confident about Russia's sustainability when Putin's reign and tyranny end. Russia was in decline after Soviet era and before Putin's rise. How Russia was making a comeback is beyond me, and has Russia been losing its economic edge when it attacked Georgia, Crimea, and Ukraine? Were resources in Siberia insufficient when Russia attacked those areas?

Siberia may be fully icy and cold, but it helped Russia survive... and encounter regime changes. Nonetheless, Putin's suppression on his opponents and wars on other areas would put the country's future in jeopardy, especially when he no longer runs the country, dead or alive. Putin's suppression of basic human rights and manipulations especially on poorer citizens further endanger the country's ability to survive and hold Siberia. To put another way, Russia's domestic issues and conflicts would make the country likely to lose Siberia to Siberia's potential independence.

Russia still holds power in the United Nations Security Council and can veto legal recognition of Siberia as a sovereign state. But I suspect other parties of the UN Security Council will do whatever they take to kick Russia out if they can. Whatever Russia does won't prevent potential Russian Civil War in the future."

Everyone holds all kinds of views which are based in all kinds of reasoning, but all of these are given authority by the individual which is what makes it true for them.

When uncertain you can consult an authority - but it's you who bestows that power of authority to them. You decided that this person was worth listening to, that this source is worth citing, and so on.

So even when someone claims their perspective is based in objectivity they are the one who decided on what objectivity means in that sense.

That at the end of the day, people are basically alright.’ 

Not amazing, not terrible. But generally at baseline, people are pretty decent. 

In the U.K. we have politicians and papers telling us that the cities are over run with foreigners and there are ‘no go zones’ run by Islamic extremists. 

Or another group of politicians and papers saying that the countryside is full of backwards racists and bigots and you’d never be accepted there.

As someone who’s travelled all round our lovely little island, and enjoys speaking to people. I’ve never seen any evidence of racism or bigotry in the countryside, I’ve never seen any ‘no go zones’ or ghettos in the cities.

At 36, I’m coming to the conclusion maybe my English teacher was right all those years ago. And papers and politicians are full off shit. Everyone you meet, is basically alright. 


To change my view: 
I guess the obvious road would be to prove that at a baseline people are fundamentally horrible. Or I suspect there’ll be a barrage of people echoing the papers they’ve read, saying group x are terrible, but us in group y are great.

You probably could change my view with compelling evidence that people are broadly not good.

1,2024-03-02,CMV: The Zionists fail to understand what the left means by decolonization.,u/BiryaniEater10,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b4ngtm/cmv_the_zionists_fail_to_understand_what_the_left/,changemyview,"I myself am not a full believer in decolonization, but there’s a lot of mistakes Zionists make when they talk about decolonization. The way I see it, Zionists see decolonization as indigenous people having an inherent right to immigrate back to their land (with an implication that indigenous people absolutely can’t be colonizers) and establish a state in said land, which is why they often see non Zionists who claim they are for decolonization as hypocritical. 

The issue is not only are those things not fully compatible decolonization as a lot of people believe in it, but rather those things straight up are against decolonization. 

One thing is that colonization is about the methods you used. Sure Zionists can possibly trace their history back to the Levant, but ultimately the methods they used to return were depraved and monstrous, and essentially a more evil of what most colonial powers did. They accepted a massive colonial power’s blessing to move into the region and also stole land via so called “legal land purchase” knowing that they were entering communities that did not wish for them to be there, with the intent of stealing said locals’ resources and displacing them. This is colonizer behavior and is not made any better by being indigenous. Additionally, in a decolonized system, immigration should be done in a way that benefits all, not just the indigenous in a region.

Decolonization would more be accurately described as everyone in an area living equally and together in one region wherever possible. As a side note, this is why a lot of people believe the 1880-1948 Palestinians were heroic in their goals (not always their means). What Palestinians at the time wanted was essentially what decolonization is. Which is for the colonizer (and again, indigenous populations do not have an absolute exemption against being colonists) to not have special rights. Whether Palestinians today get too much credit for their ancestors’ humanistic ideas is its own question. 

Think about this. The confederacy tried to separate from the United States, and the US chose not to respect any “right to exist,” and it led to very positive humanitarian changes in the US. 

**The Confederacy is the best proof that there is no right to a nation for anybody, and much more importantly that calling for the dissolution of a state isn’t inherently immoral.**

This alone debunks the idea that any country has the right to exist, be it Israel, Palestine, Jordan or whatever, since the whole point of decolonization is that the people who are oppressed by a state, whether they are inside or outside said state’s borders, ought to be afforded some  legal way to either seriously alter or dissolve the country they are in in such a way that the new government provides justice for all and oppresses nobody. 

Also, decolonization should not be associated with said drastic measures being necessary, just not inherently immoral. For example, in Minnesota, natives already have a full right of return there, but the flag had praises of expelling Natives. They successfully approved a flag design that doesn’t do that, and such a thing is a great example of decolonization.

While I don’t fully agree with decolonization, decolonization is nothing more than having all people in a region side by side as equals. 

One downside of decolonization is that it doesn’t have an answer for what happens when a group wants to not be with others under one nation. We have the confederacy where the US just forced itself upon the confederates but not too much more examples of a nation straight
just conquering another nation with the conquered just accepting it. The answer may be that we just need to get over our American or Canadian disgust that we innately have and just simply accept that in a lot of the world people do divide themselves by ethnicity and will continue to do so.

Another downside is that most decolonization involved someone leaving with no intent to come back, and there’s no option for when the colonists don’t want to leave. For instance, white people left the Congo on their own will. If they wanted to stay and Congo has tried to expel them before or just after being a sovereign nation, Belgium would’ve probably destroyed them with fury and possibly have occupied them to this day. This matters because nobody in the Levant is willing to leave."

Now my city has destroyed and rebuilt every library because of them but you'd have to be an idiot to check out a book because they came right back. 

Why was ddt banned? Not because it is a possible carcinogen, like the neonicitinoids we used to replace it and the plastics we use to hold everything we consume.  It was banned because as a bioaccumulative it weakened the eggs of birds of prey.

Birds of prey are back too, and becoming a serious problem. Nobody wants to see eagles disappear completely, but recently in the last few years hawks became so ubiquitous that i cannot drive a mile whithout seeing a redtailed hawk.
Why is that a problem?  Because big birds take off slowly. Fast enough to get above a car at speed, not so much big trucks. I've had 3 hit my semi's window this last year alone.

So why not kill two birds and get stoned? Make a bunch of that stuff and use it everywhere but only once. Knock out the bedbugs so completely they take another 30 years to make a comeback. Thin the big birds but not eradicate them.

""Ryan Lizza of The New Yorker yesterday tweeted snippets he overheard from an unnamed congressman making fundraising calls from a public space. The tweets provide a small look into the grueling demands that are a reality for many first-term members of Congress, as well as members in vulnerable seats. As Lizza notes, raising campaign money involves a lot of repetition, a lot of voicemails, and a lot of empathy for donors.  
It also requires a lot of time. Incoming lawmakers are instructed to spend upwards of four hours per day raising money, which is time taken away from the legislative responsibilities of being an elected official. Many members will explain, however, that fundraising is a sacrifice that makes the rest of their work possible. Indeed, winning a congressional seat is not cheap. According to data compiled by MapLight, successful House members in the 2012 cycle raised an average of $1,689,580, while winning Senators, on average, raised $10,476,451.""

While all this hype has certainly helped Larian in terms of sales, there isn't enough attention on the shortcomings of BG3. This is a problem for future customers who are considering buying the game, as well as the developers who could use more criticism to help them make improvements on their future games. I think BG3 needs to be brought down a peg.


**What the game does well**

BG3 has the highest production value of any CRPG game. Between the high quality graphics, motion captured animations, generally high quality cut scenes and voice acting, as well as a massive amount of content, BG3 is the closest thing the CRPG genre has to a AAA game. Simply put, a lot of time and money went into making this game. 


**What the game does poorly**

(1) Choices and consequences

While the game does offer the players new choices to make around every corner, most of the major choices in this game essentially amount to:

- (pet the dog)

- (walk away)

- (murder puppies)


For all the 100s of choices I had to make in the game, very few of them, if any, were even remotely thought provoking, nuanced, or difficult to make. It was almost always stuff like save the refugees or slaughter the refugees, save the kid or kill the kid, make a deal with the devil or refuse, etc. It ultimately amounts to a pretty shallow experience, as opposed to other RPGs that really make you think when they offer decisions to you. 


(2) Main story

The main plot is a disjointed mess. It's almost like they wrote a bunch of separate chapters and set pieces and stapled them together, rather than telling one cohesive story..... ""and then this big bad guy showed up, and then this big bad guy showed up, and then this....etc."" 

Also, what is even the point of this story? Some giant evil brain is invading the world, so you have to kill 3 comically evil bad guys who worship evil gods who are each trying to control the brain. Then it turns out this was the brain's master plan all along so you then have to go fight the brain, and then at the end you either kill the brain or take control of it yourself. I mean cmon, I don't expect a video game to be a Tolstoy novel or something, but this honestly feels like something a 14 year old D&D player made up and would probably get made fun of for trying to bring this to the table. 


(3) Characters and companions

This is where the game basically went full Twilight or 50 Shades of Grey. Your party is mostly just a bunch of hot singles who all want to fuck the player, and your base camp in BG3 is basically a dating simulator game. One  companion is a powerful wizard who fucked a goddess. One of them is a goth chick who has amnesia and belongs to a death cult. One is a demon gamerbait lady who fought her way through the hells. One is a burly elf who is a horny nature lover that can turn into a bear. One is a hot twink vampire who was enslaved by an evil vampire lord, etc., etc. For those who haven't played the game, I'm not even making this up, these are actually the characters they came up with. I think the voice acting and animations for these characters are really good which distracts people from how dumb and tropey the writing is, or how the romance stuff in this game is on par with stuff like Twilight. 


(4) Quests

You could argue that the main plot is not the focus, that the game is really about all the smaller stories and quests that make up the game....but which of those actually are supposed to be the standouts? The vast majority of side quests in the game are more so just situations rather than being actual stories. I don't think they were necessarily bad, more so just consistently in that 6/10 - 7/10 range. 


(5) Other

This post is already long enough, so I'll just briefly mention that the game also has a ton of bugs and performance issues, as well as some of the worst UI and inventory management I've seen in a major game. 


**Conclusion**

It kind of blows my mind that this game, which let's be honest, is pretty schlocky in a lot of ways, is being touted as one of the best video games ever. I think that does a disservice both to customers and to developers who need honest feedback in order to improve. I'm not saying this game is bad, at the end of the day it's still a pretty fun game that has hours and hours of content, but I feel like I'm being gaslit when I see the extent this game is essentially worshipped.

It’s not saying it’s immoral or illogical or one of those insane rants using long disproved pseudo“science” trying to claim that isn’t real. To clarify, I’m saying it’s simply just incorrectly categorized with sexualities, or that we have a fundamentally flawed understanding of what sexuality is (both of which are probably true).

Love and attraction in general are complicated things. They’re more than just a spectrum; to accurate graph out a grid that represents attraction would require more axis dimensions than we as humans can comprehend.

If we focus on just the point in the topic, we can heavily oversimplify this by stripping the grid down to purely sexual attraction (since it’s about sexuality, not love and attraction in general), and by cutting off a few parts we can make it a three dimensional graph.

Say you got a piece of paper and drew a straight line horizontally. That will be our x axis, which represents the gender you feel attraction most towards. On one side is heterosexuality. If you’re near that end of the spectrum, you would mostly feel attraction towards the opposite gender. The other side is homosexuality. The middle would be bisexuality.

Now we draw a vertical line for the Y axis. This is how much you care about or notice gender. This part may revive some criticism, and that is actually good, because I do not claim to fully understand how sexuality works (no one freaky does) and am constantly looking for ways to update this. If someone understands things like pansexuality vs bisexuality better than me, feedback on this part is appreciated.

Anyway; the top of the line would mean gender is a very important factor in if you feel sexual attraction in someone. The bottom means gender has zero influence on attraction. Someone in the middle on the x axis and near the bottom on the y axis would he (if I understand it right) pansexual.

Now the final part. The Z axis, making it a cube grid. This is the most important part in relation to the post claim, because it represents how much sexual attraction you feel in total. One side asexual, the other would be hypersexual (there’s probably a better term, but it’s the most fitting I know).

That completes the grid. So where does my claim come in?

The issue is that, while a factor in sexual attraction, it is not a factor in sexuality itself. It is not WHO you’re attracted to, it’s how much you feel the attraction in general. Sexuality is who you feel the attraction to. This means you can be heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or any other sexuality while simultaneously being asexual. Because of this, asexuality is technically not a sexuality, but rather a measurement of the amount of sexual attraction in general someone feels."

For example, see this UN publication on this topic [here](https://www.ohchr.org/en/news/2023/03/conflict-and-violence-are-primary-causes-hunger-and-famine-special-rapporteur-right).

Similarly, one would be aware that collateral damage is an expected and legally acceptable consequence of war (subject to proportionality and other concerns) under conventional international law. 

Without taking a position on: (1) whether Israel is a colonial project, or a lawful sovereign nation, or engaged in illegal occupations; or (2) whether those who have organized against Israel are militants, terrorists, or freedom fighters; in my view, a well-informed and reasonable person would be aware that the use of force in opposition to Israel would provoke conditions of open war.

Therefore a well-informed person in favour of the use of force in opposition to the Israeli state would understand that to do so would risk open war, and therefore famine and civilian death.

Now that this risk is being realized, in my view, those apologists for the use of force by Gazans, or Palestinians at large, are hypocrites should they have known of these risks and believed that the benefits exceeded the risks. On the other hand, if they never considered these risks, then they are quite naive.

Without at all diminishing the entirely different scale of the human tragedy, and the completely different situations, it reminds me a bit of the regrets that people have after commencing litigation. I am a lawyer. When someone sues one of my clients, I have the right to cross-examine them and prove that they are a liar. This is obviously highly emotionally taxing and embarrassing for the plaintiff, but what did they expect? This was an obvious risk when they commenced litigation.

Why isn't the outcry of human costs from hardliners against the state of Israel right now, ***not*** a little bit hypocritical?

1,2024-03-02,"CMV: Toxic Masculinity, at least in a passive sense, is a natural consequence of ideal male societal participation, and complainer should ironically shut up and deal with it.",u/ValuableBreakfast527,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b4vu9w/cmv_toxic_masculinity_at_least_in_a_passive_sense/,changemyview,"
To get the point of this post, I'd start with dating, since it's the low-tier convo from which people csn  springboard up to higher discourse(btw this is a copy from this post.)

Dating for men is like evolution — a brutal trial and error where risks are supposed to be taken.       
And as a male, one ought accept that you more than likely will get rejected a ton ( that’s not an issue and fair)

However, this process doesn't go without consequence — it has its effects on the active participants.

Hearing that if you don’t take those risk as a man, you’ll never find anyone and that you are lazy.       
Yet you see that women of all walks do not have to put in that much energy or get rejected as often is a bit eye opening (not in a bad way tho).

As a man you are told to pull yourself up from your bootstraps each time you get rejected, whether it be a real bad one too.      
That you must change X Y Z about you almost to the point you can’t even recognize yourself. 
And during the times when dating is down for you you cannot complain or else you’re accused of not trying hard enough, being an asshole, and even not taking showers??

I feel that by the time the man gets a relationship he’s changed by that and more than likely a little less empathetic as he had to push his own feelings aside and keep going.      
Meanwhile your girlfriend might want to just cry and vent but all you can think about is 
“Jesus Christ get over it, find a solution, or shut up”.     
... precisely cause that's how you've literally survived in life.

And this is just not dating, that's the male life— the essence of the masculine of becoming, the feminine just exists.        
When men fight to get into positions like CEOS,army, ..etc.. or just improvement in general, they necessarily loose that part of themselves that progressives fantasy-wank to when talking about “positive masculinity.“, infact to drive further this point, most delusions of PM are still in some fundamental way expressive of what men can DO, especially for women and society as a whole.. it's a brutal fact of life.     

It's the highest laughable lunacy to assume that men rejected from society work, who work and fight to get to the top, would have time to appease your delusions? That they'd listen more? not be closed off and hyper-logical that they empathy is non-existent ? 
 
Just like men have to suck it up and move on, y'all complainers have to suck it up and move on.     

And it's not I'm viewing the whole masculine thing as a negative, no, infact I think the opposite — inaction — is worse, especially if you're familiar with Nietzsche's characterisation of the masculine as a strive towards Greatness, and if you've read Goodnight Punpun.     
To wind it back to dating, my view on stuff like  hypergamy is like death; yeah, it sucks, but it's a necessary part of the evolutionary process life quality.     
If the women 100 years ago didn't engage in rigorous hypergamy, we'd be probably 2'5 negative IQ returds squirming around.    

But still, you have to understand that any action taken has opposite effects.      
A man who rises through ranks, acquires confidence and all that stuff, acquires some psychological alterations, that's just life, so stop complaining like the incels and deal with it.

You're not special, your experiences surrounding ""toxic masculinity"" and everything is nothing, you're just a biological machine whose purpose is to pass on thd genes it contains.    

And there's a certain angle of counter-arguement I see, the good ol' ThEWaPEEEEE

No, that's just retarded, like 0.5 IQ retarded,
Therapy has so many delusions about it:

1. It's systemic gaslighting

2. It assumes that that done to the mind can be undone. 
I believe in this vague analogy of thermodynamics from the physical science — any evils done to something cannot be undone, including a mind, cause look, just like disorder (or something more nuanced) is the telos of physical dynamics, evil is the telos of everything, from a metaphysical up to psychological level.    
From 1, therapy is just gaslighting away the sufferer from their suffering, of course living with falsifications is okay, but still, don't expect the person to appeal to your delusions.    
Check your childhood mind state, and answer me honestly, can any amount of ""therapy"" get you back to that mind state?
I believe any therapy men should do is just for themselves, for THEM to live happily, not for someone else; There's no greater salvation than selfish living

3. There's this thing about psychology that is suspect for assuming freewill and blank state — that the individual can change themselves, as if the individual is not just a collection of different drives beyond their control.. so yeah, it won't work.

In summary, if you ever find yourself complaining about masculinity needing to be less toxic

1,2024-03-02,CMV: it’s a red flag if a dating prospect asks for your body count ,u/Embarrassed_Crew_377,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b4wect/cmv_its_a_red_flag_if_a_dating_prospect_asks_for/,changemyview,"It is one of my dating golden rules that if someone asks for my body count, I’m out. I am happy to offer the information if I feel it is necessary, but someone asking tells a lot about them. 

Here’s why:

From a general standpoint, if someone wants to know your body count it means they feel very strongly about the subject in the context of a relationship. There is a high chance that no matter your answer, it will not sit well with the person asking because they feel so strongly about the subject. 

Furthermore, I think there are a lot better questions that can be asked to see if someone’s values align with your own. A body count is an arbitrary number that can be completely made up and no one would know. A body count might include instances of assault or coercion. Someone who bases their opinion of someone and date-ability on a number is not looking for someone who shares their values like they claim. They are looking for a low number that suggests purity or eases their insecurities of being compared to others. Not only is that sexist (red flag), but such deep insecurities cannot be repaired and may lead to abuse and control (red flag). 

Other questions on the subject that show someone is genuinely seeking compatability in values include: Have you been in serious relationships before? Do you prefer to date seriously or casually? What are your thoughts on casual sex? 

There is no need to ask anything else beyond this. I wouldn’t want someone to date me BECAUSE I have a low body count because it shows they want to be with you for how you make them look. They don’t truly care about you, they care about what you can do for them and how you can better their image. The fact that some people focus on a number rather than how someone treats them, makes them feel, and their compatibility is so superficial and therefore a red flag. 

Finally, from a personal standpoint, I was treated just as awfully by people who asked about body count when it was zero as when it was two. I heard conversations between the very people who asked about body count about how they preferred untouched virgins and people who were not that deserved to be cheated on. You cannot tell me this has to do with shared values and compatibility. All I see is a need for power and control which is a red flag for abuse. Especially if that person has a higher body count themselves and doesn’t hold themselves to the same standard.

All reasons are valid. ,u/ikindafeelikesht,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b4wpj8/cmv_there_is_no_shallow_reason_for_not_wanting_to/,changemyview,"There is no shallow reason for not wanting to date someone. All reasons are valid 

TL;DR: Title + first paragraph

Having a racial preference, a preference for a lesser body count or a virgin, a preference for a rich man, not wanting to date people due to their disabilities, or their weight, height etc is all alright. 

Because at the end of day, dating is not like a friendship. Refusing to be-befriend people based on such traits would be asshole behavior, because you would be just discriminating against them. But when it comes to dating, it is very much different. 

There is things such as attraction, and as much as some people want to deny it; people within the same racial group usually share some common facial traits. You simply might be not attracted to that look. Not being attracted to dark skin color or mono-lid eyes is not any different than not being attracted to smaller boobs or larger loses. It doesn’t make you a racist, it just means you particularly don’t find that feature pretty and that’s it.

Same goes for weight, if you don’t feel attracted to people in larger bodies or short sized, then you don’t feel attracted to them . Nothing wrong with that. And if you looks doesn’t matter, well then don’t care about it. But don’t call others for caring about.

About wanting a rich partner, there might be lot of valid reasons. The person themselves being rich and wanting someone on their financial level, or the opposite, the person themselves being poor and growing up poor/ facing struggles and therefore wanting someone that can support the household for the most part. I will admit that realistically, looking for a rich person  in particular will lessen their chance to find a mate if they are not rich themselves, but then this just something they have to deal with and that’s it. 

Same for wanting a virgin or maybe the opposite, wanting an experienced partner. They might have those traits / held standards for themselves and feel comfortable with people who share the same traits / have similar values or it might be a opposites attract case and they might have a sexual preference for that.

I believe I don’t even have to explain disability one, admit it or not, disabilities comes with a package, and not everyone is fit to deal with that. Also people with certain disabilities might not be capable of sex and not everyone is gonna be alright with that. This is just normal. 

Same logic goes for not wanting single mom / dads, not everyone is fit to deal with kids or even they have kid themselves they might not want to deal with more kids, again maybe this might lower their chance finding a partner but that’s about it. It doesn’t make them shallow. 

All for one reason, no one owns a relationship to anyone. You might say “well no one owns a friendship to anyone” but no, it’s not same thing because we (or at the least not supposed to) choose friends based on their looks or sexual preferences we have. Also we can have multiple friends, whereas majority of people are monogamous, so it’s only normal they want to go for the best potential match and not lessen their standard for anyone. 

Those are not my personal standards btw. I’m currently seeing someone with a disability and dated a single dad before. I don’t mind weight that much.  I have my type but don’t really have a strict racial preference either. I’m just saying it is ok to have them, not shallow at all. "

1,2024-03-02,CMV: China is a socialist country,u/warblotrop,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b4xe1e/cmv_china_is_a_socialist_country/,changemyview,"China is lifting people out of poverty by the hundreds of millions, leading the world in innovation and technology, and building super advanced infrastructure while American infrastructure crumbles to pieces, tent cities and syringe piles grow in major cities across the country, and poverty increases. 

Many people have insisted that China's successes are due to capitalism and not socialism, but I will attempt to prove that China is in fact a socialist country. 

China's present stage of development can be described as a *socialist market economy.* That is, they are in the lower stage of socialist development. 

The idea of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics is that it was not possible after the Civil War for China to go straight from a feudal, agrarian economy to a socialist economy. There needs to be an intermediate stage of development during which the productive forces are built. 

This is not at all inconsistent with Marxism. Marxism is not a dogmatic rejection of markets. 

Marx himself stated that capital cannot be immediately expropriated after the revolution, as productivity needs to be built first. Marx acknowledged that some degree of capitalist development must be present before socialist development. 

China is embarking on something similar to Vladimir Lenin's ""New Economic Policy""- using markets under the direction of the state.

China's ruling party is an ideologically socialist-communist party which makes economic decisions in order to advance the overall well-being of the people, create a strong middle class, and build the productive forces to prepare the country for a transition to the higher stage of socialism, and eventually towards a communist future. 

First, let us review some facts.

* State ownership is the predominant model of ownership in China
* All land in China is owned by the government and rented by individuals and business
* The Chinese state has a clear path in mind for the economic and social future of the country, and this is detailed in their 5 year plans.
* China's official stance is that they plan to achieve socialism by 2050- presumably we will see the state take a bigger role in the coming decades as more and more of the economy is put in state hands
* China adheres to the Marxist-Leninist principles of democratic centralism and trade union centralism.
* Massive state-led projects and social spending have been applied to lift hundreds of millions out of poverty from free housing to subsidized energy, food, and transport. 
* Chinese infrastructure is state owned, and China actively takes steps to make sure that more remote areas and rural areas can access transit, telecom, electricity, etc. In the US, private companies take over, the unprofitable sections fall into ruin, and the company prioritizes safety over profits.

**""But what about all the billionaires?""**

The relationship of billionaires to the government and society in China is fundamentally different than that of the United States. 

In China, billionaires who commit anti-popular and anti-social crimes end up dead or in prison. The billionaires are kept on a leash by the Communist Party, unlike the United States where the politicians are kept on a leash by the billionaires. This is why China calls itself a ""dictatorship of the proletariat""- because a Marxist-Leninist vanguard party is in total control.

Everything that billionaires do happens under the watchful eye of the party, and every decision the party makes is with a view to the country's goal of building socialism by 2050. 

The billionaires' activities, as all economy activities, are regulated and directed by the hand of the Communist Party in accordance with 5 year plans. 

China seizes corporations that grow too big, mandates party representation on companies above a certain size, 

**""China has private markets""**

The Soviet Union had a small private economy as well! Both these two countries applied certain economic formulas in order to move along the path from feudalism to communism. 

The existence of market and private business isn't what makes a country socialist, since socialist countries use these things in order to build up a base of production from which socialism can be achieved.

There are games where the minimum difficulty to beat a game should be where you show competency in all of the game's mechanics. This doesn't apply to all games, like Skyrim, but for games that are praised on how well they run at higher difficulties, the lowest difficulty should be a minimum competency. Like let's say there's an enemy in the game who forces you to block on higher difficulties; the lowest difficulty should be no exception, you need to block it, I don't care if it's your 5 year old brother playing it. If he can't block it, the game's just not worth playing if you can't understand its mechanics, and you shouldn't even be playing it (THIS hypothetical game, not all games). If the game's main attraction is its mechanics and difficulty, then people should better defend such games. The defense is that little Timmy would be better off either completely giving up, or finally learning how to block, rather than just playing in his own boring fantasy that he can win. There is an argument to be made for many games that you should be able to play it however you want, but the counter-argument is that some things are meant to be enjoyed a certain way, and cannot be enjoyed any other way- this should be better supported by the gaming community as a whole.

  
Let me give you an example. Let's say you're making the new Dark Souls, and you took a survey on the players who beat the game. Those who beat Dark Souls on Normal felt like they earned $500 worth of a game; it's just that good on that difficulty. Then, your CEO asks you to test and put an Easy Peasy mode. The players who beat easy peasy mode feel like the game was only worth $5 to them at the end. So then you ran a test, and it was easily confirmable that players would cite more value from the game if you turned off Easy mode. Those that usually selected easy, could either choose normal or quit; many elected to simply quit, but for the few that beat normal when they would usually choose easy, the game was worth even MORE to them, and they praised it to their friends. Because you turned off easy mode, the reviews for the game are even higher, and the people that enjoy easy mode end up not being able to review it, because they already knew from the get go that the game was going to be too hard for them. From a business perspective, it was better to make the game harder, and from even a player perspective, the overall enjoyment was raised because you set the bar to play the game.

  
Sometimes, the developer should put their foot down to assert that competency, for their game, is much more worth it than ignorance, even risking the player quitting the game."

It is also interesting to me when people say that who claim to have an interested history that makes me want to toss them a history book. 90% of European history is literally conquering people with the power of guns, germs, and steel and just being better at murdering than their opponents. English didn't become the dominant language of the planet because the British were just that great at [cooperating](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/18/books/review/the-rise-of-english-rosemary-salomone.html) - it became that way because the British were way better at killing people then everyone else. Then white Europeans have the nerve to insult you when you claim that competition beats cooperation when the history of their entire ancestors and the reason why white culture is so dominant is because the people in the past were so good at killing or screwing over anyone who seemed to be a potential threat.

That is pretty much also true to this day. Superpowers like the United States and Russia are where they are because they were really good at hard power and having a military that could crush anyone else that gets in their way. Diplomacy was second compared to their ability to blow anyone away who so much as looked at them funny. 

I understand people's need to want a better more cooperative world, but certain people need to stop being so hypocritical Amber tending that people don't have a point about how being aggressive and competing still plays something in the world stage. One of the reasons a lot of cultures act so aggressively now is because they don't want to become another footnote in the history books The same way native Americans, many African tribes, Polynesian natives, and others who have come across the past of white Europeans ended up being. Not saying it is right, but the same white people who like to claim this behavior is wrong forget that they pretty much taught the rest of the world this is one the only ways to make sure your culture survives and doesn't end up becoming someone else's banana Republic or vassal state.

I understand the message, but it just feels annoying and hypocritical for someone of European descent to talk about how stupid it is for everyone else to shrug off the merits of cooperation when their ancestors and a lot of the people in charge of the world now, predominantly white people in those of European descent, didn't get where they were through cooperation or being nice."

But when the video game Injustice: Gods Amongs Us came out in 2013, i think that was the first of many signs of an evil Superman gaining more traction in popular media 

So much so that WB and Zack Snyder started exploring that same  idea in Batman v Superman, a movie that's initially supposed to unite Batman and Superman as the beacons of hope and justice yet instead dipped their toes in the opposite during a dream sequence

And then years later Omni-Man and Homelander debuted in their respective shows and are more popular and relevant than Superman is at this current moment

And we don't even have to get into the whole life long argument regarding Superman being 

""boring as a hero because only Kryptonite and a big strong guy can give him any issues""

As well as the whole

""He's a boy scout, therefore no edge to him""

My perspective could be entirely flawed and wrong. Because I don't know every single  Superman media possible

But the fact that we need James Gunn in order to prove to us why we should give a fuck about good Superman, and that evil versions are more popular is kinda embarrassing

However, in Africa it is not seen as a big social issue at all. It is hidden to the point where many Africans think it is a British/French issue and not an African one. Most gay people will either hide or see a pastor about it. There are very few that are open and so unfortunately, it is not an obvious issue.

Unfortunately, there is an obvious social issue which is tribalism.

Tribalism creates an almost endless stream of civil wars, it creates instability, and it impacts every single African. It is a widespread issue and something that I believe young Africans are willing to change. Everyone will have grown up being told to stay away from a certain tribe and I think with globalisation this generation is beginning to realise it's bullshit. So many wars, genocides, and murders stem from this.

People are not ready to change their beliefs on homophobia yet, that is clear. However, we are ready to change our attitudes on tribalism. Once the obvious issues are dealt with, the less obvious ones will begin to fall too.

I am confident of this and believe change will need to start with Nigeria, as this is the most influential African country and has the most obvious issues with tribalism. Nigerians are very confident and ambitious and I believe are capable of a massive social movement which could take Africa by storm.

To clarify, I am for gay rights. This post is not about downplaying this issue."
90,2024-03-02,CMV: Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan was the least worst decision.,u/Powerful-Drama556,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b4zy2v/cmv_bidens_withdrawal_from_afghanistan_was_the/,changemyview,"The Afghanistan withdrawal was an abysmal situation, but sunk costs are, well, sunk. All the criticism of Biden in this regard has been centered around the bad outcome rather than the strategic decision itself, which I believe was sound. In my view, every alternative would have been worse.

**First, there was widespread support for pulling out troops.** Short of maintaining a permanent military presence, withdrawing troops AT SOME POINT was necessary. We would have needed to increase our military presence to maintain long term control in the region. This would have meant long term costs in terms of dollars and deaths, and was not favored by any political faction. Therefore, it was broadly accepted that it was necessary to leave. **It was just a question of timing.**

Note that multiple predecessors campaigned on leaving Afghanistan--and then didn't--to avoid the short term fallout (more on that later). Given this, acting on the timeline set in motion under the Trump administration was the optimal decision for Biden to make, both in terms of US political maneuvering and the impact abroad:

1. The existing timeline had already emboldened the Taliban and lead to evident instability in the region, so our weakened presence threatened to jeopardize all troops/civilians that remained. **Immediate escalation/reinforcement would have been expensive, deadly, and made it even harder to leave in the future.** Therefore, simply following the existing timeline while projecting calm was optimal to delay an escalation of conflict/panic, for as long as possible, and to maintain as much stability as possible for the Afghans (without escalating/reinforcing).
2. Absent permanent military presence, the Afghans bore ultimate responsibility for maintaining order. After more than a decade of training and military support, it was abundantly clear that they were never going to be 'more prepared.' It was also clear that they were not prepared (though perhaps not to what extent). This situation was the result of 20 years of failures. However, from a political perspective, no one wanted to take the blame of the short term fallout. Withdrawing troops was bound to hurt the sitting presidents approval (ie predictable instability), but the timing **early in the presidential term** and **partial distribution of blame** minimized the political effect, to the extent possible. Realistically, no one party or president was to blame.

The majority of criticism was directed at the results of the ensuing turmoil: government collapse, abandoned equipment, 800 stranded Americans, and deaths of 13 US soldiers and dozens of civilians in the ensuing turmoil. This type of outcome was inevitable and/or better than all alternatives. "

The damage difference committed in domestic situations is mostly due to women in general having less upper body strength in general than men. And the rates of domestic beatings is fairly close to equal between genders where both persons are guilty.

[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/107780102237407](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/107780102237407)

The main difference is that there is a deep cultural belief of men that would prevent many of them being in any way violent toward women.  While women have a violent nature held back by fear of someone stronger than them. And will unleash it on those viewed to be of equal or less strength than themselves.

[https://www.house.mi.gov/sessiondocs/2015-2016/testimony/Committee331-9-21-2016-7.pdf](https://www.house.mi.gov/sessiondocs/2015-2016/testimony/Committee331-9-21-2016-7.pdf)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic\_violence\_in\_lesbian\_relationships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence_in_lesbian_relationships)

So now I have established women have a possible motive to be violent and are more than able to commit it at high rates like men in the right situation.

The main reason is that men are biologically programed in general to sympathize with women when they cry. And that the women are wonderful effect is extremely powerful on a mental level in general with males. The few men not effected by this would likely be over whelmed by ""gender traitors"" being against them as well as the women.

The other reason is that with guns and bombs existing that in modern shooting wars upper body strength doesn't matter as much. The will to actually pull the trigger is far more important and with the right leadership I could easily envision women mustering up that will. While men would likely try to seek peace and terms contentiously though the war until giving the feminist what they want.

There is more I could add, but this should be enough considering I don't consider this a position I am totally convinced of.

Also please note I am saying the women would win a shooting war against men. That is started by exclusively woman, against men with some sort of feminist ideology that believes in changing the ruling structure by force in a western nation. That the view up for debate here."

His name is fairly common. The reports I have seen from his friends do not mention him having any kids or a wife. In fact, his hobbies such as volunteering with the homeless community, involvement in anarchy groups, and treasuring his [cat and root beer collection](https://nypost.com/2024/02/27/us-news/aaron-bushnell-left-behind-cat-and-fridge-of-root-beer-pals/), do not fit the profile of a married man with young children. Also, no family members have stepped in to assert otherwise--one would expect the widow or her family to be gathering considerable resources for the children at this time if he did have them.

Please CMV with evidence that can be tied to this individual (and not a different person with the same name). Otherwise, I think it is pretty clear he died without leaving behind any dependents (other than his poor cat, who he left in the care of friends). 

If you knew Aaron personally, my heart goes out to you, and I wish you comfort in this time of grief and loss regardless of whether you shared his views on the situation in the Middle East.

Please correct me if I'm wrong and there is some other reason for ""embryo donation"" that I'm unaware of, but so far the story seems to go like this:

Some pro-life people believe that embryo's are people (in this debate we will use people or person separate from merely human, to identify someone with currently active human rights, distinct from a corpse or a brain dead patient, etc). In IVF many embryo's are often left in excess, and these can be donated to science or disposed of. Some pro-life people have taken to implanting these donor embryos into themselves and birthing them! To me that's astonishing enough for an exclamation point.

These are people who apparently chose to have children that are not their own biologically, but who chose to bring a life into this world \*\*instead of adopting one of the 100,000 existing living breathing children up for adoption in the US alone\*\*.

Unlike a person merely choosing IVF over adoption, or choosing to have their own kid over adoption, these parents chose to have someone elses kid (+) indicating that genetic difference is not on their list of priorities, but chose to ""grow their own"" instead of giving care to living children actively looking for parents (-).

Note, this argument does not necessarily rest on any belief that embryo's are not people. Embryo's can be stored indefinitely frozen. Some of these embryos that are being born are 30 years frozen. The argument is this: No one can ethically do this unless all children up for adoption are no more. There has to be priority given to things that have needs, and the ebryo's needs are being cared for, being that they are frozen and thus in no immediate danger. Even if we were to say that embryo's deserve life, it could hypothetically wait.

I was disgusted just making that argument, this is the one I want to make: adopt kids, not embryos! Like, seriously what is wrong with you.

If you are a person who was born under these circumstances, I hope you understand I am not critical of your existence lol. I'm critical of your parents choices.

In summary, ways to CMV:  


1. there are non religious reasons for embryo donation

2. there is some family criteria that is not achieved via adoption that is achieved via embryo adoption"

I believe such people are fundamentally different. They aren’t like the rest of humans. The vast majority of them are not in that position by choice.

But that’s just absurd. Virgins over 25 are fundamentally broken as people. They are not just unlucky, that’s impossible, even people who claim to wait before marriage either get married before 25 or have secret sex before 25, and their parents will look at them with shame if they genuinely waited past 25 if they are male.

Everyone who says they are a virgin by choice past 25 wouldn’t have been able to do it if they chose anyway."

Basically, climbing Mount Everest achieves nothing practical. If people went up to Mount Everest to research things or collect things I could respect it more. I get that it is technically an achievement since it's hard, but it's such a ridiculous risk to your life and well-being. I think the main thing that bothers me is that you are risking your life for something so worthless. If you are going to risk your life for something, go become a firefighter or donate your kidney.

Things like: writing a book, completing a degree, knitting a shirt, cooking a meal, or getting a driver's licence have an end result. You've either made something or learned something. 

Whereas climbing Mount Everest is just literally going up somewhere and then coming back down. It's about as practical as going up the stairs, standing there for five seconds and then coming back down, and repeating the process ten thousand times. Except by doing that I don't risk dying.

I can sort of appreciate people who run marathons. I mean, it's equally useless, but it's far more safe I'm not necessarily against people doing something useless for fun but I'm just  wondering if it is the best use of your time. 

Mount Everest has a death rate of between one to five percent of all climbers. That is just the number of deaths of people who attempt to climb at all. Of the people who manage to make it past 8000m, 14 % die. 

For comparison:

running a marathon kills 1 in 259,000 of all who attempt it. 

Skydiving kills 1 in 500,000 of all who attempt it. 

Boxing is the second most deadly sport at 1 death per 7000. 

Climbing Mount Everest has a death rate of 1 in 50, and it increases to 1 in 10 once you approach the summit. 

The risk vs. reward does not pan out. A 1 in 10 chance of death just so you can say ""I climbed Mount Everest.” IT’s narcissistic and selfish and should not be rewarded. "

Crime victims, as well as families of murder victims, get to make a victim's impact statement before the convicted person is sentenced. They get to vent about all they have lost, about how they'll never be the same again, and so on. The laws allowing for this were passed as a way to give these victims some form of closure, which they previously weren't getting.

It seems to me that falsely convicted people, especially of the more heinous crimes, are victims potentially as bad as any, short of actual murder victims.  
Now , when someone is falsely accused and convicted and imprisoned, and years later are exonerated through DNA or however, they just get to sit there in the courtroom while some glad-handing judge says how great the system is for finally uncovering the truth after God knows how many years. Then they are allowed to have their handcuffs removed, stand up when the judge says to, and eventually shuffle their way outside.  
But I don't think it should happen like this. I think that the victim should be allowed to make a full statement of what the ""criminal justice system"" has taken away from them, and how they'll never really get it back, and what their prospects had been and what they forever lost, and how stupid their conviction was, and all the petty crap they've had to put up with the whole time from the entire ""system,"" and even details of every little thing that was done to them by every petty official, guard, or whomever. They should NOT be forced to sound grateful for finally getting out. This is the only closure that these people are going to get.  
And, all during this time, the judge should be required to remain silent, and not make any excuses. This may sound tough, but this is the counterpart to what the wrongfully convicted went through. But the judge is innocent, you say? Well, the exonerated person was innocent, too. At least the judge doesn't have to go away for a number of years with all their former friends hating them. It should be part of their job."

Now here are some omissions I am making

* I am completely ignoring online dating
* The sex must be free, no sex work allowed
* Arranged marriage is not allowed
* I am looking from the perspective of an assigned male at birth person trying to date cis women

From these omissions I believe that one can make a point that there is no easy way to get sex

Here is an example of an easy way to get sex that hypothetically could exist but does not exist

* get up every day at 6am and work out for an hour
* complete one book a month 
* Attend a monthly book club meetup
* Write a paper about the book and submit it to the book club, always get it rated at 80% or higher
* by the end of the year you are guaranteed to have had sex

Nothing like this exists. There is no easy way to get sex. You cannot get sex through excelling at structured activities. "

I dont hate people who are gay trans or whatever, i do have however a huge problem with the movement and allot of the people who represent it.

My problems are this:

> For some reason even if you disagree with LGBTQ comunity or anyone associated with this for some reason, even if u bave valid criticism you are immedeatly labeled a Transphobic person then people start to hate you, you migth lose your job, you migth get hurt, etc, in other words u are either with them, or against them and the reprecirssions of not falling in line with this bullying cult is immense.

> Special pandering, i hear trans rigths or whatever rigths, but you have the same rigths as anyone else provided you are in a first world country, and why is it that you specifically have months, flags and other such stuff when other opressed groups dont? If were going by this then why dont we have bullying month, or any other such thing?
Also fixing and making everyone out to be a victim takes power away from the individual and continues to make them into a victim mentality.

> Drag shows and transition young kids and teens is wrong, many habe regreted it and commited suicide, so i think having these treatments should only be available when the person is an adult and not as a kid, its ok to be gay or dress as a girl, but never transition or make such life altering changes to a kid, i think ""Think before you sleep"" has made an amazing video on this so i recomend that.

> Toxicity and cancel culture, saw so many people get canceled or have their lifes ruined becauae they disagree with the movement, i have seen games and media get worse because of the movements influence, for example worse looking charaters, female charaters not being as attractive, removal of pronouns and making charaters gender fluid, look at Helldivers 2, The Finals etc, so mamy games now are falling in line.

> Misguided beliefs, i have spoken to a few people who think transitioning will magically change their problems and fix them, when in reality its a mental health issue thats underlying, and needs ti be properly adressed, so allot of people and kids believe by ""being a girl"" they can fix their issues.

> Its delusional, a cat is not a dog, a man is a man a woman is a woman, you can dress as a woman, look like one, fine but you arent, why don't u take pride in yourself, why do you need to bully others into treating you a certain way and label them transphobic when they dont want to, or dont feel comfortable with pronouns? 
Its okay to be gay or look like a woman, but don say you are one.

> The people representing the movement are toxic and not a good way to convince others to join or be an ally, i mean if u wanna change someones views u dont harass or bully them, u try to be compassionate, but instead they get canceled or bullied because u disagree.

This is just my opinion, sorry for bad english i am severly sleep deprived."

1,2024-03-02,CMV: I think I would view a degree from a for-profit online university as worse than no degree at all if I were hiring. It shows an extreme lack of judgement to me.,u/TheBeaarJeww,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b58sxp/cmv_i_think_i_would_view_a_degree_from_a/,changemyview,"I'll state up-front that I mostly don't blame people for getting scammed into going to these schools. I know that they aggressively recruit and they prey upon potential students desire to better themselves. I hate it, I hate that they prey on veterans and military members specifically due to the 'easy money' these schools see in them in the form of the GI Bill & Tuition assistance.   


The people I blame first and foremost for these schools scamming people is the government for allowing them to accept federal money even though the data on these schools is very much not good and there's little reason for them to exist. I think the best solution to fix this problem going forward is for the government to no longer allow these schools to accept federal money and since these schools rely on that type of money disproportionately they would likely just fold as institutions, those loans should then be likely forgiven as this shouldn't have been allowed to happen in the first place and then moving forward if someone wants to spend their own money or private funding to attend the University of Phoenix thats on them.   


Moving on to the meat of my post. In my experience, the word is out on these schools for anyone who does a modicum of research. I attended a scam university called ""American Military University"" (You can tell what kind of money they're going after by the name) for my associates. I then later switched to a non-profit private school for my first Bachelor's and now I'm at a very reputable state university for my second Bachelor's. I say that to give my experience personally with these schools. When I was attending 'American Military University' the word was already out IF I decided to do my basic due diligence AND wasn't so stubborn as to just dig my heels in and continue attending this school despite the negative information out there on them. I understand being in that situation and kind of realizing that you've been made a fool, scammed, and now you can either cut your losses and try to transfer to a reputable school and likely lose most of your credits because a lot of reputable schools, rightfully, will not accept credits from junk programs. It's discouraging, it feels bad, you feel like you wasted your time and your money and you feel like you've been made a fool. Now you have a choice to either accept that and change course or continue on for your full bachelors or maybe even more, just ignoring any information you see that makes it seem like you have indeed been made a fool.   


These degrees do take work to complete, you still are writing papers and whatnot and putting in serious time and money. Metaphorically you're running your marathon and working hard but then when people start telling you hey buddy you're running the wrong direction you just keep going.... Having a college degree serves somewhat as a proxy on your resume for skills and traits you've demonstrated over a prolonged time period. What trait are you demonstrating by having a Bachelor's or Master's from a scam university? That you're unwilling or unable to take in new information and change course? Do you want to work with someone who operates like that? ""I'm just going to keep pushing on on this same course no matter how much information comes at me that this is likely a bad direction, I'm going to see it through!"". I don't.   


So far my post has mostly relied on the idea that as a student of one of these schools that people in your life are likely, at some point, going to tell you that this is a bad idea. Let's say that never happens though, you have nobody in your life that knows better and nobody says anything to you.   


Now what is a degree from one of these schools saying? That someone is willing to take on a multi-year endeavor, one that they will spend thousands of hours of work on, thousands of dollars on, all without doing a basic level of research on if where they're going to school is considered reputable? Does that sound like a good trait to demonstrate to an employer? The inability to do basic research for one of the most important decisions you'll make in your life? Either before attending or at all during the years of attendance. To me that speaks to an extreme lack of judgement and conscientiousness. If someone approaches a decision as important as where they attend college like that how are they going to approach other things in their life?  


Again, I don't necessarily blame students for getting tricked into these places to begin with and I blame the government for allowing this to happen to begin with but still.. You're attending college to learn and demonstrate your ability to think and solve problems and the first and most important problem in college in what school you attend and what you study and this person gets a grade of F- on that assignment and they're demonstrating their inability or unwillingness to course correct by sticking with it.   


I have successfully talked people I know personally from attending or continuing at these schools several times in my life because as a veteran the ways these schools prey on veterans disgusts me. However, I've ran in to many people that when presented this information just dig their heels in, I suspect because doing otherwise would be admitting to themselves that they were scammed and made a fool. I'm pretty much at the point where I see someone completing a bachelor's or higher from one of these schools that it's just evidence of their poor judgement and stubbornness. I've pretty much landed on over the last couple years that if I were in a position to hire I'd view having a degree from one of these places are worse than not having a degree at all because it's just evidence of all these not desirable traits.

There are plenty of stories of part indoor/outdoor cats living to be the same age as indoor cats. 

It's like a hot topic, everybody reads one post about how cats are bad for the environment and they'll die outside and they go rampant telling everybody they're a horrible owner for letting their cat outside.

If you have the right cat, it can be safe. Mine avoids all animals, it's how she is, so there's no risk of disease. She goes on the porch and climbs up the porch to the roof. Follows me through the driveway to the shed. She doesn't go out on adventures because there is no reason and she's not the type. 0.1 mile from any road, and never out at night. So if one of you losers can tell me how my cat is in risk that would be nice. 

Obviously there are times it shouldnt happen. Personally I don't care about the environmental impacts, neither should anyone besides vegans. In towns with cars, obviously not. Where there are predators in the daytime, obviously not. Letting them out at night, obviously not. 

Tldr: Unless you're a vegan, telling someone to keep their cat inside is wrong, and there are many cases where cats can roam outside safely. "

I set it out like this: ""God (or lackthereof), and media is--hypothetically--the Almighty influence of consent, and consent is the foundation of (social) politics.""

Now that I actually think it through, I can't find a fitting counter-claim and now hold this view genuinely, but before getting cocky with it I wanted to run the concept through this subreddit to find any flaws in the view. 

Also, when I say non-consensual, I mean infringement of autonomy. The reason why a hetero/homosexual attraction is more acceptable than pedophilic or zoophilic attraction is because of the implications held by having it. The extent of autonomy is decided by state, and that extent is argued for and against. 

For example, the U.S has absolute freedom of expression, but it can also become a political topic that has the ability to be reduced to consent. So when I think of social topics like abortion, body modification, drug legality, it can always be reduced to consent or perceived indigence. 

But again, I'm not fully confident in this. Maybe I haven't come across the right exception that knocks down the framework.

My claim centers around the burden of decreasing birth rates.

Using Finland and Spain as examples for countries with high social welfare policies. They have birth rates of 1.26 and 1.14. The median age is increasing. Upon an increasing median age and decreasing working population, you have a collapse of programs where they become unaffordable. Countries where spending is high on these types of programs, it will have to inevitably be increasingly scaled back. Retirement age will also have to go up. This has recently occurred in France due to the difficulty of supporting the pension system, spurring riots in response. And despite the riots, the retirement age was raised. This was also partly due to increasing lifespans, which will make the birth rate decrease even harder. As less workers are coming in, old people are living even longer. There is also new costs as well like the expected massive increase in dementia patients (expected 74% increase in dementia in Western Europe by 2050 and nearly tripling globally) among other issues.

The counter argument to this is immigration. My rebuttal to that is 

1. The birth rates are decreasing everywhere. This means it will be harder to get quality immigrants. 
2. Immigration backlash itself is causing non-progressive ideologies to rise in Western Europe and Canada. Especially under burden of a weaker economy, natives grow resentment towards new immigrants. These anti-immigration groups gain support and typically push for other non-progressive ideologies.

I will caveat that AI can change everything. And that I will concede a possible future where AI displaces everything including my argument. But given that the future of AI is very varied predictions, my claim is under the assumption that it wont for the next 30 years."

For example, celebrities are called Zionist and genociders for expressing support for hostages, even if they have not provided any material support to Israel. Even worse, people *deduce* their Zionism by being angry that they have *not* issued statements against Israel. 

Likewise, during the George Floyd protests, the slogan was “silence is violence.” People were judged as racist due to deductions as to their beliefs from refusing to make statements rather than from any concrete action they took. 

This seems to me to be a very dangerous way of looking at the world. Attempting to pry into someone’s innermost heart to deduce what they believe and trying to force them to prove that they think in the right way is deeply totalitarian.

With how easy this information is to come by and how obvious it is to anyone that takes a moment to think critically about it, it makes me think many of my fellow millennials are just lazy, and prefer the easy route of just pointing the finger at boomers and feeling sorry for themselves.

It would be like boomers buying $15k Volkswagen Beetles, then millennials come about and want BMW's while supporting policies that make BMW's even more expensive, and then acting like boomers were so privileged for having more affordable ""cars""."

I really believe we are not as ahead as we feel ourselves to be at this point in time. Out planet is in turmoil. Everyday we come accross news about {genocide} and {war}... (or any other geo-political issue) and are reminded of how weak we really are, as citizens and as average loving and compassionate humans who feel bad when anything bad is done to any other fellow human. Often, what we are taught is the power of democracy (which is, to the people, for the people, by the people) which feels more like a propaganda now. And obviously, why won't we feel at peace when told that we have the power even though we really don't. By making us feel like they have control, they exploit us at our psychological foundations. At the end of the day, we need comfort more than ""reason""  

Not to be absolutely pessimistic, sometimes democracy does give you power, but there were only a few instances in history when, along with power, people also had an option. Do you remember the last time when you had the power as well as a good option?

We structured something within the society where we made each other feel as if we are way over/ahead of the past. Sentences like ""do people still bother about it, comeon it's 20 th century, or common it's 2005, 2015 or 2024"". I once came accross a tiktok a while back in which a girl begins the video saying ""the government won't do this"" and then the music changes and she says ""ahh yes they would"" and then begins to share information about the worst/most cruel experiments conducted on humans"" and it stuck in my head for a long time. 

Our scale of time is really ruined. I guess while trying to comfort each other by saying ""comm'on... nobody cares, it's 2024""... we completely forgot to lay the foundations for this type of thought to become wide-spread and help the mind of the young nurture this way. 

I dream of a world where, before we jump into the comfort that we think a good decision will bring once we implement it (even though it's fcuks us for a short term), we sit and implement them and let the future unfold as it naturally would (without a damn worry)



[The fact that the gov.(s) are committing such crimes against humanity and turning a blind eye to the entire world protesting is just makes me feel so weak that I can't describe]"
1,2024-03-03,Cmv: men should be shamed more and women less for their bodycount,u/Significant-Ebb7333,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b5e869/cmv_men_should_be_shamed_more_and_women_less_for/,changemyview,"Men often get praised for having many sexual partners, while women are judged harshly. I think this should be the other way around. 

When men are celebrated for having lots of sexual partners, it essentially encourages unethical behaviour to lure women to have sex with them. 'Players' say what women want to hear to get them in their bed. Often times after a few dates where they feign genuine interest.

On the other hand, women often face criticism for similar experiences. Many women try to establish genuine relationships with men they believe truly care about them, only to discover they are being used solely for sex. This is not what they intended or hoped for, but they find themselves in situations where their trust is betrayed and their feelings are disregarded. These women aren't 'sluts' or anything, they just want to be loved and just can't find it.

It's not fair that women are blamed for being tricked by dishonest men. They don't deserve being told their broken because they tried to have a connection with 10, 15 or 20 men. Men, on the other hand purposely lied to women to get to such a bodycount. I don't understand why we don't shame the men and be more understanding of the women."

 I believe that people should be able to live however they want (as long as they dont hurt anyone) and criticising them for it is ignorant, lame, and it makes you a bad person. 

All the conservatives Ive met have been insanely gullible to obviously fake conspiracy theories and hoaxes. They have been all the -phobics and -ists. Against womens rights, against feminism, against black lives matter, against anything meant to make the world better. All the conservatives I know seem to believe that their religion should be the law. 

they never want to do research and learn or hear the other side.

Friendships with them always seem to end in either fighting or slowly fading out because all they talk about is their hateful bitterness. 

Conservatives make it harder for me personally to be myself so if i find out someone ik is conservative im automatically always on gaurd and prepared to ditch them. 

So i would make a bet that almost all (if not all) conservatives are like this. these traits are traits of bad people, so almost all, or most likely all conservatives are bad people.

this opinion makes me just as bad as them though. so please, change it.

 How many level headed conservatives are there? how can a conservative not be a bad person and why are their beliefs not inherently bad? (if they arent) How do conservatives claim to want to make the world a better place? it goes against their inherent beliefs"

“Social anxiety” for some people is a manifestation of irrational thoughts or fears that are not based in reality. It’s the fear that people are thinking badly about you, are going to make fun of you, etc.

But when you’re ACTUALLY ugly, none of that is delusion because people most CERTAINLY WILL make fun of you, think badly of you, and mistreat you because that’s what almost ALWAYS ends up happening in any given setting. Many of my friends avoid going out and socializing for this very reason and they dislike interacting with human beings for this very reason or being in public as well. 

Because if you’re constantly getting negative feedback loops and don’t have any social support or social acceptance then OF COURSE your going to be socially anxious! 

Another bullshit idea therapists apparently push for is the idea that the people who shit on us are “just as miserable as we are “ and so taking their anger out on us. They can’t be JUST as miserable.. They quite literally look healthier and ARE healthier in weight, achieving things academically and athletically…

It's insane reading the amount of anti biden comments and folks spewing disinformation about Biden. Don't vote for biden but don't spew disinformation. 

-seems like alot of folks don't realize biden got the railroads workers paid sick leave the following year by threatening to withhold federal money from the railroads. 

-Biden saved the pension fund of over 350k union employees by issuing the biggest bailout in decades. Big banks always get bailed out and workers get thrown to the curb. This cost tens of billions of dollars and NEVER happens

-bidens FTC was the first FTC to successfully block a corporate merger cuz it would hurt labor and they changed the merger guidelines to ensure any mergers moving forward can't hurt labor. This is biggest thing the FTC could've done. They just blocked the Kroger merger this week in the name of labor . 

-bidens NLRB is the most pro union agency in over 50+ years. Jennifer abruzo bringing back the silk doctrine is the most pro union action action the nlrb has done in 50+ years 

- biden has required federal infrastructure projects (50k+ projects) to be done by union labor only or collective bargaining agreement 

- bidens EEOC nd NLRB have ruled more in favor for employees versus employers than any other time in history 

-bidens inflation reduction act has brought hundreds of thousands of new union jobs into the mix as folks are needed to install heat pumps and solar panels 

-Folks here don't realize how big of a deal it is to have a NLRB that's in your favor. I had a cousin who recently got her job back cuz the agency ruled in her favor for a union busting tactic her employer tried deploying. The ONLY federal agency that protects our job is the NLRB. It's like having a insurance plan on your job. When you get fired or something bad happens you want THE BEST nlrb to save your ass which is what we have RIGHT NOW.

Biden is old as hell but he's easily been the most pro union president we've ever had in 50+ years.   We have the lowest unemployment rate in history.  Biden created so many jobs with his infrastructure bill.  Biden is not the orange man who tried to overthrow our government and is a threat to our democracy.  Biden respects and understands what a democracy is.  Trump idolizes dictators.  The choice is easy.  Everyone needs to vote for him to keep our country strong and save democracy.

42,2024-03-03,"cmv: some (rare) ads are useful, but most of them are totally useless and we would all be better off with less ads or maybe none at all.",u/catboy519,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b5ggxl/cmv_some_rare_ads_are_useful_but_most_of_them_are/,changemyview,"I'm not saying ""ads dont work"" because some of them do - or in other words ads work on the people who are or will be interested in the product - but in my experience its 1% useful ads versus 99% useless ads. If the ratio isnt even bigger than that.

Let's just look at this from the advertiser's perspective. You have a product that only 1 in 1000 people would be interested in. So now you annoy 999 people for the 1 person who finds the ad useful and buys your product. This is my main issue with ads, they work for those who are or will be interested in the product, but they waste everyone else's time.

I get that advertising for certain products or brands is necessary and that some ads are useful,

* but why should you advertise a product that everyone in the world already knows about? For example chocolate. Everyone knows chocolate exists, so there is no need for ads to tell us it exists. So why do we see these ads? Is their intention to remind us of our chocolate hunger and then we will go to the store? I don't know, but I have never gone to the store immediately because of an ad like these
* why are so many ads unskippable? if I would normally skip the ad, then it means I'm not interested or already have the product. So making it unskipable is not gonna do any good, it only wastes our time.
* why do some ads have to tryhard being funny when the ad really is not funny at all and then it repeats 1000 times before finally another ad comes in its place?
* Why should 99% of people waste their time watching an ad that is only interesting to the other 1%s?

I think if youtube ads and tv commercials were seriously decreased so that they only show the more useful ads and also that they don't keep repeating the same ad, we would all be much less annoyed and we would be buying more products because of those ads. But forcing people to watch 99% of the crap that can't even be skipped is gonna make people also automatically skip the other 1%"
144,2024-03-03,CMV: religion is the best example of a universal maxim—people are more interested in group identity than in truth,u/unenlightenedgoblin,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b5gtun/cmv_religion_is_the_best_example_of_a_universal/,changemyview,"I am choosing to focus on religion, but the same principle holds in politics, pop culture, and to some extent even science and academia: people would rather be accepted than be right.

As for religious affiliation, I’ll start by pointing out that there is absolutely no more verifiable evidence for your particular deity/deities than there has been for any of the other thousands that humans have worshipped since symbolic thinking emerged during the Middle Paleolithic. As an adolescent, the Problem of Evil became irreconcilable to me and I lost my faith on those grounds—or at least the ability to entertain a benevolent monotheism. Second, nearly the entire human population that adheres to organized religion follows the exact same tradition that they were born into, or less commonly marry into. The idea that some overwhelming majority of the global population thinks that they *just so happened* to be born into the one, true faith.

That all said, I absolutely understand why people choose religion. Beyond fear of ostracism, there can be tangible benefits in terms of social support, networking, status and authority, shared moral values, and aesthetic beauty in the rituals and iconography. These are reasonable—even essential—things for humans to want. In the case of religion, however, it is entirely built upon falsehoods. But my reasons for secularism are not the basis of this CMV—rather the notion that *we*, religious or not, are consistently balancing evidence with the approval of our peers. 

For politics and cultural issues, there may be an underlying truth, but the greater instinct for most is in having a public position that is approved by their selected peers. Ironically, this is just as true for the conspiracists and ‘you’re all a bunch of sheep’ crowd. In their case, affiliation is marked by contrarianism and individuality, but the underlying principle holds—the implications of being debunked would shake their core identity, making them resistant to facts which run counter to their beliefs. 

In all cases, there are rare occasions when ‘conversion’ takes place, but I don’t believe that we change our interpretation of evidence without also joining a new group of peers whom we subconsciously wish to align with. There are well-documented benefits to social inclusion: improvements to happiness, health, and longevity. So while I don’t have any prescription to address it—I think it’s probably a phenomenon too deeply ingrained in human socialization to avoid—I think that recognizing this impulse within ourselves and others is an important first step to a more civil society.

I'll be 25 in a month, and as a person with ASD, I don't think I need to express the extreme and profoundly suffocating loneliness people like myself seem to be destined to face from day one, as I found out the hard way growing up in Toronto with all the bullying, exclusions, rejections, and passive aggressiveness I faced. 

But to get to the main gist of what I wanted to share, based on what I've experienced in life, with constant failures left and right of trying to join social groups and find a long-term partner, it seems to have really solidified this belief that there is no point to even try to make such connections after a certain age. Even after 12 therapists in 9.5 years, it seems these beliefs could never be combatted.

Here's some reasons/anecdotes that I feel back up my claims 

1. Every group I've tried to join in and even after high school was resistant to having me as part of them, and I had two particularly traumatic events in 2020 where 2 groups I tried to be a part of engaged in some of the most passive aggressive and socially deficient behaviours to bar me from connecting with them deeper, even after having positive experiences prior.
2. As for dating, I'm pretty close to accepting that any woman that I find interesting will be in a relationship or won't want to be with me. Case in point, I'm in a master's program where I'm the only male out of 15 people, and yet all the women I found interesting were already in relationships, a lot of which stemmed from high school. I wouldn't be surprised either if they wouldn't bother trying to connect me with their friends given how I'd probably be seen as a loser failure by them.
3. I am wanting to move out of Toronto for my PhD studies, as I feel like staying here will continue to reinforce my livid rage, yet now I am seeming to rethink that decision as based on a lot of the subs I see for the respective locations I am thinking of, you see the same posts over and over again of ""oh I can't make friends with X people; Y people are so reserved and cliquey etc"". And I cannot help but feel these people have a point, so it seems like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, since no matter where I am in the world, I will feel lonely, depressed, and an utter failure.
4. After 25 years of living, I only have 8 people I can call friends, only two of whom are women btw. I have no squad unlike most people my age, and most of the time, I have to be ***involuntarily*** alone (like I was this past week) whilst for most other people my age, they get to be ***voluntarily*** alone.
5. I've joined clubs/classes/used apps etc., yet none of them have worked, for the reasons I've mentioned above.

So yeah, I feel like a lot of the people who say life doesn't end after a certain age were lucky enough to establish themselves, but I saw a comment on Reddit earlier today that seems to have expressed my feelings perfectly. Relationships are like atoms, once all the bonds are filled, no more can arise or be filled, but you guys are welcome to combat these views with stories/perspectives of your own.

Oh, and for the record, I'm totally expecting to hear some comments preaching about how ""if everyone is an a-hole"" or ""if it smells like crap everywhere"", but I'm going to say my view anyways cause I am not afraid to own my experiences anymore."

It makes being a landlord more about extracting money from someone rather than providing a real good or service.

Bad spending habits are not due to lack of financial literacy. Buying useless expensive things which one can’t afford is simply a bad decision like driving drunk and not due to lack of education in finances. People don’t drive drunk because there are consequences and people don’t spend frivolously because there are consequences(former jail etc, latter homelessness both of which are understood by everyone). Financial literacy has to do with IRAs, investing, credit, taxes etc. it has absolutely nothing to do with being frivolous which is why both financially literate rich people and financially ignorant poor people can both lose their money by spending above their means. Instead of blaming irrational purchases on lack of education we should blame the person for failing to acknowledge the consequences of poor decisions. This is evident even in children at lunch tables where some savor their food and eat throughout the day and some scarf their food down and complain about not having any later. And yet when it comes to adults and money(obv having higher stakes than school childrens lunches) we don’t blame them we blame their lack of understanding of the implications of dumb purchases ."

Point 3: Population control is important and both ends

Point 4: The opposite of my statement is also true. If you can't support one you shouldn't support the other

Point 5: Religion should have nothing to do with either

Point 6: The percentage of wrongful executions is very low (in the US). It can happen, but is rare. Especially, in the 21st century. It happened a lot in early US history due to race or finger pointing. 

Point 7: How many innocent fetus' are killed? How many could have changed the world for the better? What if one was the person that solved global warning and that mother terminated the pregnancy without knowing?

Point 8: No more than 2 appeals and 5 years prior to execution. No reason to keep taxing the public so you can continue to prove nothing new.

Point 9: No non-health related abortions after 20 weeks. That's halfway. If you don't know by then, put the child up for adoption. Of course rape is always a question. I'd say that if you don't want the child due to rape, you'd know pretty quickly after finding out you were pregnant, but certainly prior to 20 weeks. 

Point 10: Only to round it out. I'm sure I could think of more, but this is too long already to prevent my preconceived arguments that will come my way. 

Finally: Some will find faults in my points because of their political agenda. I argue your political leanings aren't a factor in CMV. Only in supporting your cause one way or the other.

B) Smoking/Vaping

It is 2024. And young adults people \*still\* smoke or vape. (I do not include children since they have parents who \*should\* be responsible for them). We learn about why doing it is a bad idea all the time in school. Yet people still do it. Plus smoking (and vaping) is out of fashion anyways.

C) Astrology

There are people (Mostly women, idk why) who \*still\* think astrology has some basis. We may not learn much about astrology in school (At least in my country) we still learn \*some\* things about how stars affect earth and what have us somewhat. I think it is just enough to understand that astrology has literaly zero basis. However there is still a huge number of people consuming \*unironically\* astrology content.

D) Most Crypto Scams

I said \*most\* because some of them are \*far\* \*far\* \*far\* more sophisticated. I do not include these. However I do include the Ponzi-like ones and the ones that defy any middle school economic principle we were taught. (Like basic Supply and Demand for example). This includes NFTs.

E) Structured water:

We learn about why (and how) water gets purified in elementary school for crying out loud. And how ""The dose makes the poison"" about the stuff they put in it.

&#x200B;

These are just a few examples. I could include things like some other ridicoulous alt medicine fads, vaccines, etc. But the list gets far too long

I get that people are falling for these kinds of things since forever. However given today's education there should be \*no excuse\* for most people to fall for this kind of BS. Yet they do. That implies that in most places current education is failing us. 

I delibrately excluded elderly and children. My argument assumes healthy young adults with current educational material. (And some slightly older ones as well).

I feel like I am missing something. The reason I want to change this view is because I believe that it may be flawed. (Or maybe I am a smug know-it-all prick.)"

Most straight men dislike homosexuality. Thats just the guy code. Some straight men bully other men who they perceive as weaker than them. They may even accuse another man being gay and beat them up. This is perceptive discrimination, not homophobia. Straight men do not need to hide themselves for their sexuality nor have to worry about their safety constantly. All straight men have to be is mediocre and they can live their lives without worry. Thats privilege. There is no way straight men could EVER face homophobia."
1,2024-03-03,CMV: Having a party in a student residence in the middle of a neighborhood makes you an asshole,u/JesDaM,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b5n3bw/cmv_having_a_party_in_a_student_residence_in_the/,changemyview,"This is more so like an AITA type of post, but since I'm not looking for reaffirmation on what I think I rather post here. More than a general discussion I want ot focus on my own experience. Also keep in mind that I do not live in the USA, so what you imagine based on the title might be very different.

I live in an unofficial student residence, meaning the college doesn't have any involvement with this place. Nonetheless, it is very explicitly a place for students, and there are even rules are technically known to all that live here. One of these rules prohibits parties and any activity that might disturb others and makes a reminder that we are in the middle of a neighborhood. The party took place in the backyard of the building, in the afternoon of a saturday. The music was so loud that even with a headset on I could still hear it from here. 

One of the main arguments that were presented to me in the defense of the party is that I should be more empathetic towards them because they just want to have some fun, but I feel like that is just a convenient excuse given that ultimately the people involved are failing to be empathic towards their neighbors. It's not the worst thing someone could do, and other than loud music and some yelling I don't think they did anything to cause a ruckus. But the loud music alone makes me think they are assholes, because they are being inconsiderate of everyone around them. Sure, many of the neighbors and the students in the residence might not have an issue, but they have no way of knowing that everyone around them is fine with it. And when confronted with the fact that some people are indeed bothered by the loud music, their response is to increase the volume. You can have fun with some friends in ways that don't disturb others. You can gather with some people in the residence without being so loud. And if you want to be in party, then go to a party rather than bring the party to a living area.

I haven't heard from anyone living here who also had an issue, in fact some even defended them, so I feel like I might be acting like an old man yelling at the kids in my porch. Which is why I made this post."
1,2024-03-03,CMV: Homosexuality is just a fetish,u/Expert_Doctor98,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b5n9lz/cmv_homosexuality_is_just_a_fetish/,changemyview,"I think same sex attraction is just a fetish that some people have, it means that people with same sex attraction just feel an specific desire to have sex with someone of the same sex they find attractive, but they are absolutely capable of having a crush on someone of the opposite sex and procreate.

I've seen plenty of lesbians that display some kind of romantic interest on males, and gay males that have a high romantic chemistry with females. I don't think gay people are really capable of loving someone of the same sex in a romantic way, romance just exist between people of the opposite sex, because it leads to intrasexual competition and many standars. I see no intensity between people of the same sex, I just see physical contact and a sense of control toward the partner, I don't see love at all. 

I'm not heterosexual, I identify as a bisexual man, but basing on what I've found among gays and lesbians my conclusion is that gay people is just following a lifestyle based on a fetish, a fetish or a deviance. It's not something immoral or a mental illness, I think homosexuality is natural and acceptable, but nowadays we give to it too much seriousness. Gay relationships are not serious at all, they are not in love. There are plenty of homosexuals/bisexuals marrying someone of the opposite sex and raising children, that's true love.

It was *the* place where you could meet and receive lectures from the big shots who contributed groundbreaking theories to their respective fields.

But today you can learn basically anything on your own thanks to the internet. The common counterargument to this that that I kept hearing was ""But Dr. X is teaching it!"". Well now thanks to the pandemic and online classes, I could find some student who recorded Dr. X's online classes and ask him to give the video files to me, if they're not uploaded on youtube already.

Then one may argue that the real point of universities is conducting research, which I would accept if 90% of the papers published weren't trash. I think it's basically an open secret in academia that many, many papers cherrypick or just outright lie about the results and the data. Sometimes it gets called out like the recent scandal with the stanford psychology professor, but the vast majority of the time it doesn't. I've seen far more credible papers from the R&D departments of private companies than labs of universities. 

All of that on top of the fact that I believe that academia is an extremely toxic space to be in. Thanks to tenure, professors can get away with anything short of sexual abuse, but according to the news many fail at even that. If Dr. Y the power tripper is the head of your department and says ""dance monkey dance"", you MUST do it because who are you going to complain to? 

So in short, I believe that universities fail at teaching and fail at research. They are an extremely outdated concept, and should be replaced with independent self-study and research-only organizations. Change my view"
21,2024-03-03,cmv: Reddit's blocking feature is extremely flawed and can ruin users' experience,u/OrangeIllustrious499,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b5nmt5/cmv_reddits_blocking_feature_is_extremely_flawed/,changemyview,"So first of all, I agree that a blocking feature of some sort is def needed but Reddit's way of implementing it imo is just flawed. 

Basically when someone blocks you, you won't be able to see their posts, reply in the threads they created, reply to them and you will see all of their comments as deleted with red symbol to indicate you are blocked. 

A lot of people and even Reddit says that the reason the block feature is this way is to prevent further harassment and to end convos that go on forever. But to me, its downsides just get worse the more you start to think about it and experience it yourself.

First of all, if a user **really** wants to harass you, they will most likely go all in and not just stop at one account that you blocked. Essentially blocking becomes somewhat redundant if the blocked person is just that stubborn. But for people who only got into a heated discussion once, reddit becomes worse for them.

Which is my second point. The blocked can't reply to any people on any threads that the blocker made. Imagine if the blocker is active on the subreddit you like to browse, so suddenly a decent chunk of their comments are now just deleted and you just stare blankly at the people replying to the blocker not able to do anything, essentially worsening your experience if you want to talk with them. To make it even worse the blocked is permanent until the blocker remembers that they blocked you and decides to remove the bloxk (which is most likely never). So basically your experience in a sub just got ruined significantly forever just because some random guy who you don't even know blocked you over that one heated discussion and then prob forgot about you like 1 week later along with their blocking reason. 

Thirdly and finally, blocking feature in reddit has been used to manipulate the threads. This has been said before but a blocker can immediately reply to you by accusing you of doing smt or shitting on you then blocks you afterward. Essentially you would have no way to defend yourself and people would think you are a coward or what the blocker said is true or why else would you not fight back the accusations. It only gets worse if it's a controversial view, the blocker replies to you then blocked you, then you look like a person struggling to defend your point. Of course you can just edit your og comment and say: ""the X guy blocked me so I cant reply"" but you dont have proofs of that so some might think you are just a big fat liar and coward.

Overall, what Reddit should do instead is to make blocking have a time limit like 1 week because that's the time frame that most people forget about the reasons why blocked. Only when you block the user for the 2nd time shouls they provide you the option to permanently block someone. They also need to change how threads work with blocking, perhaps make it so you can see their comments but not reply to it and obviously reply to the people in the threads they created. A person should always have the rights to discuss in a thread to engage in a positive conversation or to correct  mistakes, denying them that just because a person blocked them is just dumb. Not to mention most of the one being blocked prob doesnt even harbor any ill intentions toward the blocker and only wanted a discussion."
1,2024-03-03,CMV: Normies have a dramatically contradictory party line they use to gaslight virgins,u/ImmanuelYemos,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b5nrh7/cmv_normies_have_a_dramatically_contradictory/,changemyview,"Some people including u/Hellioning claim that   
  
\> It does not 'add confidence' to have sex once you're past college age.     
  
Which is something I see as absurd because why should sex not add confidence after college age? That doesn't make sense, why do people have to miss out on confidence through being too late?  
  
\> Plenty of weird people have had sex. Plenty of otherwise 'normal' people have not had sex. You are putting entirely too much on a single idea.  
  
I don't think that's right. I think that having sex is the definitive trait of being a normie.

But they go further in saying things like

\> Because it's a statement of fact to point out how easy it is to get laid. There are bars full of people just prowling for that specific thing. Get a hooker even if you're that desperate. The fact is people who have nobody into them, it's 100% ones own fault for not putting in any effort.  


And a guy u/lo_schermo said this

&#x200B;

 \> The average person finds that they've had sex before 25. That sex comes to them. It only requires tenacity if you're an outlier and have to seek it. I'm guessing most PhD holders would say they had to put in a lot of hard work, that it wasn't easy. Perhaps you're an outlier there too.

  
But then u/Pesty_Merc said that it is hard and doesn't come to people and that is where the value comes from it 

&#x200B;

\>Why must it be so easy to get? A huge amount of the value of sex is that it takes some effort to get that kind of intimacy with someone. Even in our Western culture which normalizes hookups and one night stands it's not that easy. Why should it be?  
\> It's not something to earn like a video game benchmark, it's an activity. Go find a nice lady (hobby, bar, school, workplace but not in your immediate department, social club, dance lessons, volunteer org, idk whatever the kids are doing these days), talk to her, get closer, have a relationship.  


But then u/finaltunnel came in and added even more contradictions to the party line by saying this

\> If you are good looking enough and have some degree of social intelligence you can get sex easily as a man. Other than that, yes you have to provide something that women could value in order for them to sleep with you.  


So the normie party line is basically this insane contradictory thing that people say where it is easy but hard to get sex and it doesn't matter but it also is the only thing that matters, that they constantly tell virgins to make them feel disempowered in their lives."

I am a big fan of games like Hollow knight and have been trying for quite a while to beat Baldur’s Gate in Honour Mode. But…

I think all games should have an easy mode/setting and you’re a bit of a dickhead if you make fun of people who do use easy mode. 
Video Games should be available to everyone, when the mechanics of a game are too hard for someone they should have the option to make it easier so they can at enjoy the other aspects of a game like the art and storyline.
On the flip side I also think there should be an option for a “Hero Mode/Hard Mode” for the people who want an even harder experience, and would still allow for that badge of honour for beating the game still an option.
 
I’ve heard from people about how they didn’t play Dark Souls or Eldin Ring (aka any “souls like games”) because of the game difficulty and that just seems like such a shame to me that so many people miss out on the rest of the game because they can’t enjoy the combat. Not only is that a loss for the player but for the people who worked on those aspects of the game.
May it be the casual gamer, a beginner, a child, people with disabilities…etc. they should have just as much of a chance to enjoy a game as the seasoned gamer.

I don’t really think I need to explain why I’d call someone a dickhead for making fun of people who do use easy mode, but I’ll say it anyways. Lots of people don’t have the time, abilities or want to be good at video games and that doesn’t make them any less than anyone who is good at games. Different people, different hobbies. Don’t discourage people from enjoying the art form of video games just because you have mastered the combat and think you’re better because of that. Yeah yeah, I get it you’re the master at Sekiro but at least John who plays Stardew is actually fun to talk to. 

So in conclusion, I think every game should have an easy mode. It would be decently simple to change without having to uproot the entire gameplay by changing player and enemy HP, starting weapons/armour, more save points… etc. 
I don’t think we should be making games easier in general, it should still be a source of pride for people who finally get past the challenges of games but that shouldn’t be reason to not have a mode for those who still want to enjoy the rest of the game. So have a Easy, Classic and hard mode in games and have them be open and fun for everyone. "

I also have a history of working in public a11y supporting students with disabilities. Our group is planning a large event, but it remains a company policy that masking is only recommended.

**Here is my view:**

Given that one-way masking is insufficient to preventing the spread of COVID.

Given that COVID poses a large threat to immunocompromised people.

Given that under the ADA each entity must ensure ""No individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation""

ADA S. 36.201 ([https://www.ada.gov/law-and-regs/regulations/title-iii-regulations/#-36201-general](https://www.ada.gov/law-and-regs/regulations/title-iii-regulations/#-36201-general))

Given that immunocompromised people are a legally protected class under the ADA.

**Therefore the event should provide high quality masks at check-in to all attendees and require them to be used outside of one-off cases and not doing so would be a violation of the ADA.**

Edit1: I am amending my point to make it clear they should be a public accommodation. and to better state my case. 

Without these protections these people are unable to freely and independently participate in a manner equal to others. Please if you are responding indicate whether you work in the a11y space or not, and whether you have experience with the ADA. I'm open to all responses it just helps me gauge perspective better.

I’m bisexual so I view both sexes as attractive and I don’t see a difference. They say those with female bodies must dress “modestly”, but even modesty seems too vague to me. Like wearing skimpy clothes could be considered modest to me since there’s not as much fabric and could even be called more modest than full-body clothes for that reason, but that’s not what they mean. I’ve always wanted to go without a shirt like a guy could, but I guess my body is too “inherently sexual” to do so. Meanwhile a guy could do it without a problem. I view both chests just as sexual. 

&#x200B;

So if female bodies are inherently sexual aren’t male bodies also inherently sexual? To be honest I see both that way. Let’s say it is inherently sexual, I still don’t see it as a reason to cover up more than the opposite sex. This has been stuck in my head and bothering me for so long and it won’t stop until I can make sense with it. Also I’ve made sense with the fact that the lower region is covered for sanitary reasons for both sexes. I don’t see how the female chest is unsanitary unless she’s breastfeeding (which most aren’t so only breastfeeding bodies should cover up), but that’s straying from my confusion about how the body is inherently sexual.   


They also say the more you see body parts the less sexy they are, but that’s been proven wrong to me on so many levels. Feet are seen all the time which is seen is sexy by most, but nobody cares. So feet are just as “inherently sexual“ as chests are even though I don’t see feet as sexy. They say the nips are sensitive when necks are also sensitive so are necks inherently sexual too?  All of this “inherently sexual“ stuff just doesn’t make sense. Even supposedly modest clothes such as nun uniforms and burcas are sexualized so much. "

(And will ask you to pay the loan installment for her useless social studies degree which she still pays).

The men who they date play them all the time. Or better they allow themselves to be played to ride the rollercoaster of emotions. And then unload all accountability on other men with (where did all good men go). (Spoiler alert she chases all those indifferent to her aholes because they are ""fun and a challenge"").

They are now even about to justify bestiality guys and pedos now through the woke and LGBTQWXZ movements. They bring in and care for Invaders in their own countries through all those NGO campaigns. They don't make their own tribes' babies/kids but will make sure the country will be a breeding ground for others with opposing religions that will eventually consume her own morally weakened populations.


Like what difference has the world in the hands of women, than Rome had in the hands of Nero? We need to take their rights back asap. And show them the door to the kitchen..... Would say someone who cares. But i don't. I 100% support their effort to destroy a 5000 years old civilization. And i can only hope they get faster in positions of power to accelerate the process <3

If you don't agree that women must destroy the world exactly like they fd up the whole Eden situation, you are a musogynist and must be tortured by proverbial death with a thousand naggings, and diverging stories of how she spent her day distracted in the grocery store, and descriptions of how many colours her oussy discharges changed that week. Those are the real troubles of humanity, not pitiful endeavours like saving the traditional West and silly stuff like that. Vulva mondus exterminalis.

I voted for Obama twice, but the ACA, a.k.a. Obamacare, is a broken mix of free market and government program.

It is certainly an improvement over what we had before. If you got a lifelong pre-existing condition and lost your employer-provided health insurance, individual plans would only cover you if you paid extravagant premiums. That's not how insurance is supposed to work. If you had homeowner's insurance, and your house burned down, it wouldn't be right if your insurance agrees to rebuild your house, but leaves some things damaged by the fire in place that would need constant maintenance. They'd cover the maintenance, but only if you paid inflated premiums.

Under the ACA, insurance can't deny you for having an expensive condition to maintain. That means they have to accept patients they know they will lose money on. That's okay. They will probably make a profit overall because they have many more patients who don't need serious care, and they make a profit on them.

But herein lies a perverse incentive. Insurers can increase their profits by getting rid of patients with serious problems. They can't decline those patients, but they can make those patients want to switch insurance by providing terrible service.

Wouldn't that make their profitable patients quit, too? Not necessarily. The profitable patients don't use the service much. They might be willing to tolerate occasional poor service for a lower rate. The insurer could even selectively target patients that need a lot of care with bad service. Maybe they don't explicitly target them, but they use weaponized incompetence to make services typically needed by unprofitable patients difficult to access.

The company might get a bad reputation for care, but a lot of healthy people won't care. If their health takes a turn for the worse, they can always choose a better plan next year.

Real solutions could include

1. A properly functioning free market where the insurance you have when you are diagnosed with a long-term condition is responsible for your care for it for the rest of your life, even if you quit their plan or switch later. The insurer could raise your premiums if they want to, but you could walk to a different insurer, who wouldn't charge you an inflated premium because they wouldn't be responsible for care of your pre-existing condition. This would incentivize people to at least consider the quality reputation of the insurer even when they're healthy, though some people would probably take a gamble.

2. If you get a serious condition, the government covers or allows a tax credit for the inflated cost of your premium with your pre-existing condition.

3. Cut out the private insurers entirely and just have the government pay for care directly (single payer / Medicare for all).

There's a good chance you can change my view by simply correcting factual misunderstandings I have about the American health insurance industry. The system is incredibly complex and non-transparent. Or you might be able to convince me that other factors prevent or dissuade insurers from the Macchiavellian practices I suspect them of."

",u/Thin_Manufacturer835,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b5ttk4/cmv_kyle_rittenhouse_did_nothing_wrong_and/,changemyview,"Keep in mind that I do not believe in any right-leaning politics at all or agree with or endorse any shit said on the right-leaning shows he's been on/people he's been associated with such as Tucker Carlson. This is not political. 

I had two friends go ape shit on me for ""defending"" Kyle and it wasn't even worth it because in my mind it's not worth losing a friendship over, but people felt so fucked up by this that there's all kinds of extreme opinions spread all over the Internet and IRL, with a lot of them being based on false pretenses. For example, a popular YouTuber turned political um, online figure, Ethan Klein, said within minutes of starting his segment on Kyle Rittenhouse that the riots were over a black man being murdered. 

The man was NOT murdered, yet he continued to make grand statements afterwards that his fans agreed with and circulated and regurgitated, based off a false pretense *immediately*.

So I want everything here to be based on the facts of the situation and what led up to it. I am asking for my mind to be changed because I want to see in what ways Kyle Rittenhouse can be construed as a murderer.

So let's stick to the facts and have a discussion based on that.

There was a black male named Jacob Blake who was shot by police and paralyzed after ignoring police orders and reaching into a car that wasn't his with a child in the backseat. Ignoring everything else about him and this situation, including his criminal record as a sexually and physically violent offender, he ignored police orders and it appeared to the police he was attempting to kidnap/harm the child, and seeing as how he admitted to having a knife in his hand, it appears the shooting was justified. 

An unrest then began where protests turned violent, with shit going up in flames for no reason, and by no reason I mean this guy fucking deserved to be in prison for how dangerous he was, and this wasn't an unarmed black man unjustifiably murdered in the street like a dog. This guy was a piece of shit and lighting shit on fire and breaking shit and looting is not something he's worth getting arrested/hurt over. 

Kyle Rittenhouse, with a clear passion for used car dealerships, brought a legally owned firearm (whether you like it or not, and I personally don't, he was allowed to bring that and carry it in public), and stood in front of the dealership with medical supplies to assist in defending the small business against *actual criminals* (keep in mind, no matter how angry something makes you, destroying small businesses is still illegal, and you're still a criminally stupid asshole for doing it.), and provide medical aid by those harmed by the actions of, again, criminals using one *HIGHLY JUSTIFIED* police shooting caught on camera to be degenerates.

He was then attacked by a convicted serial child molester who had just been released from a psychiatric ward who had earlier been caught on camera trying to get someone to kill/fight him, or otherwise engage in a life threatening altercation. Keep in mind this man molested multiple children, God knows how many, is clearly crazed, unstable and violent, and is now charging at another child. Kyle ran as far as he could and only used lethal force as an absolute LAST resort. He was then chased and hit in the head with a skateboard, which - as much as people claimed was not a ""deadly weapon"" - can easily fucking kill you, and if someone is trucking me with a skateboard in the head, I'm assuming my life is on the line and am taking precautions to eliminate the threat. He then used the firearm like a fucking surgeon and raised it at a man pointing a handgun at him, and as soon as he dropped it he dropped his, and then when he raised it again with absolute precision, shot his arm to disable him.

And again, this is ALL ON CAMERA.

So, given these facts, I would like to see if anyone can change my mind that Kyle Rittenhouse is a murderer, went out that night to hurt people, and should be in prison.

 It's funny because the people I talked to thought that he was out there gunning down black people. It seems like barely anyone that talks about it has actually looked into it."

I'm posting this because I'd like to understand how sex is supposed to be an expression of affection.

The way I see it, sex is like pooping or peeing. It is something private that is best done alone (masturbation), and I do not see the point of doing it with another person. To me it sounds like if you were to invite your partner into the bathroom to poop together. Sure pooping can be enjoyable, but it's gross and dirty and I would never want to be seen in that state.

I think sex may be in some cases an expression of a certain type of fondness - an appreciation/gratitude for that person's sexual attractiveness. But that to me does not translate to affection.

I also believe that in the majority of cases, in heterosexual sex, the woman loses her culturally defined purity, which is harmful to her emotionally. I believe that most consensual sex is a woman making a mistake, hurting herself, and a man enabling it and enjoying the process.

I do not believe purity is a thing that actually exists, but I believe it is ingrained in our culture and so I will not try to fight that, and instead operate under the assumption that it simply is an established part of our culture for now, whether that's good or bad.

Regardless of the whole purity thing, I think sex is far too private and invasive to be an expression of affection. Probably one of the biggest arguments for sex being an expression of affection is that it gives the other person pleasure. However, I believe the sexual pleasure that somebody receives and their body's involuntary reactions should be kept private, and it is humiliating oneself to express them for no functional reason.

The entire idea of intimacy is glorified, but it's simply an expression of weakness and helplessness to another person. I believe that there is no reason to express such weakness unless you are asking for help that you actually require. Otherwise it is simply embarrassing yourself. I do not think intimacy should be celebrated, and I think a partner encouraging another to be intimate is encouraging them to humiliate themselves.

As a side note, I have a question. Why is it that people are so disgusted by the idea of having sex with their parents, siblings, or children, but NOT disgusted by having sex with a romantic partner? I don't understand why there's suddenly an exception. To me the idea of having sex with a romantic partner is equally as upsetting as the idea of having sex with family."

I may not have too much of an opinion, cause I'm not a ""sex haver"" (cause I'm a Redditor), but I believe this to be so.

 My reasoning behind this, is because sex could be for anything, like hookups. **Sex isn't all that special, unless it's with your special someone.** This brings me to my next point, cause hugs, on the other hand are best received by friends and family, and they show love better than some hookup with a girl in the backseat of your Honda Civic Type R (oddly specific, but only cause I'm bored)

 And I'd much rather have **a genuine hug** then **a fake sexual experience.**

However, you've already given up on life, so it matters less to you. Go somewhere dangerous and fight...fo something worthwhile, knowing you will probably be a casualty, instead of bring a drain on public resources via searches etc.

And who knows, maybe a bullet misses your head by inches, maybe that will make you reevaluate things, maybe not. Maybe you think, shit, I don't wanna die anymore. There is much research on that also that suggests people regret, for a lack of a better word, their decision.

Lastly, it doesn't need to be war related, that's just the obvious example, but if you want out, do it for something.

There’s also people that are (falsely) uncomfortable with ALL firearms, and assume that you will be a problem simply because it’s visible.

The only argument I’ve ever heard for this is that it’d be a “deterrent,” but I believe it just puts a target on your back or creates a false narrative within whoever sees it with you - including myself, at times.

I think that it’s the most responsible thing to be properly licensed and carry it in a hidden capacity. Most people would likely never know that you have one.

1. You’re an American cheering for a European in an American sport. Not really that much of a problem with this (not xenophobic) but why watch the sport if your country’s players aren’t even the best at it? The best players now are like SGA (Canadian), Luka, Giannis, Joker, etc. League is hardly worth watching as an American. 

2. Dude is an elitist European prick. He is a 19 year old kid who insulted the city of las vegas for no reason (you can look this up, called it, “dystopian”) This would be like me, a dumbass American, going to some random place in france and saying its dystopian. Its absolutely arrogant and douchey for a 19 yo to do but is on par with french culture, considering his fellow french player gobert punches teammates and blows on mikes like a child (another thing you can google). 

3. He’s french. See further explanation above.

4. He plays on the spurs. Horrible org, essentially the new england patriots of the nba when i was growing up. Very irritating fans, awful culture, and have a head coach who insults reporters and makes their lives harder just for dong their jobs. Douche org with douche fans. 

5. His main strength is being tall. Explains why every scrawny unathletic loser white kid likes him.

1,2024-03-03,"CMV: Modern conservatives only view jobs and careers as a means to make money, and can’t see why this makes them unpopular.

Pretty much all, and I mean close to 100%, of the negativity I have received for being in medical school has come from conservative-minded people. And pretty much all of it has centered around the debt I’ve had to take on to attend medical school. 

I find it utterly pathetic that grown ass men care more about my medical school debt than me, but this is what the modern conservative group-think has become.

Conservatives only see jobs as a means to make money, and as such shit on any path in life that that necessitates debt to accomplish. This includes anything as broad as simply going to college or as specific as being a software engineer vs a doctor, like in my case. As such, the only worth while careers, of course, are trade schools, computer science and engineering degrees, or business. Everything else is obviously inferior, simply because other careers dont make as much money immediately. Doctors like radiologists and plastic surgeons can make just as much if not more than these careers later on, but of course you have to go into debt and they dont make money immediately, so they’re “bad.”

Conservatives also dont seem to understand why this mentality makes them unpopular. They blow a gasket when i simply respond “I didnt go to medical school for the money.”

When your entire political party’s identity becomes trolling, I guess it’s difficult to understand people enjoy different careers, not everyone wants to be a plumber or sit in front of a computer writing code for someone else their whole life. 

Moreover, lets say everyone adopted the conservative mentality of money being the only thing that matters when choosing a career. Nobody in the US would become doctors except a select few rich, which obviously cant last in a functioning society. Their ideology does not even hold up when everyone adopts it, unless you unironically believe only rich people should become doctors, ha. 

Last point, the most ironic things about this is conservatives are now the more uneducated party, so most of the people in higher paying jobs are voting democrat now, lmao.

Conservatives unironically think going to med school is just being brainwahsed by thw woke agenda and “doing what your told.” When the only reason they blindly hate the systems they blindly hate is why?

I find this issue quite complex and often in two minds about Begum's fate.

In essence, my emotional response is that she should be left to rot in the Kurdish prison/refugee camp that she has found herself in, as a result of her choices, treasonous actions and support for some of the very worst terrorist attrocities of the 21st century. 

I entirely reject the idea that a 15 year old is/was incapable of the ethical decision making ability to recognise that their actions were morally wrong. Discussion surrounding the idea that Begum was groomed is relevant, but only as a mitigating factor in her guilt, not as proof of her innocence. We rarely see the same leniency in ethical discussions of the teenage Germans who would have joined the Hitler Youth, and graduated into the SS. Nor the perpetrators of the Tokyo Sarin gas attacks, who may have joined the *Aum* cult in their youths.

On the flip side, my head also recognises the dangerous precedent set by removing her statehood. There's also a pragmatic value in bringing her home and using her inside information against whatever offshoots of ISIS (or Daesh) that are likely to pop up in the next decade or so. Lastly, it's pretty apparent that Begum had her statehood removed on the basis of political expediency. It was a populist move (and it worked!)

But, with all of those mixed feelings out of the way, let's get onto the actual reason she should not be brought back to the UK.

Because every thread I read about Begum includes platitudes about how she is 'our problem' 'our citizen' 'born and raised and became a terrorist in the UK' etc.

None of which is relevant to a person who commits crimes abroad. 

If a British teenage football hooligan gets into a fight in Turkey with a local, and ends up killing them, then you expect that person who be tried, imprisoned and generally brought to justice in Turkey.

If a drug smuggler takes drugs out of the UK, and attempts to sneak them into Singapore, then expect a huge diplomatic spat in which the Singaporeans want the individual executed, while UK plead for clemency.

Either way, the law of the country you're in applies to an individual, regardless of laws back home. 

Insisting that Begum be brought back to the UK is the height of British arrogance. The very worst of her crimes were committed in Syria (or whatever Kurdish independent region/authority she's in) and therefore their authorities are the people who have the right to deal with her.

1,2024-03-04,CMV: Proposal to Relocate Israel and Establish a New Jewish State,u/FrenchCorby,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b63506/cmv_proposal_to_relocate_israel_and_establish_a/,changemyview,"I firmly believe that it would be a better long-term idea to cease recognizing the state of Israel in the Middle East and instead promote the establishment of a new Jewish state within the territories of the former belligerents of World War II, namely the Allies (Great Britain, France, the Soviet Union, the United States, and China) and the Axis (Nazi Germany, the Japanese Empire, and the Italian Empire). This would rectify the mistake made by the British in granting one of their colonies to the Israelis and address the ongoing genocide of Palestine. Here are some points to consider:  
1. \*\*Reduction of Regional Tensions\*\*: Moving Israel out of the Middle East could potentially lessen tensions in the region. However, this would depend on how such a relocation is managed and the reactions of other countries in the region.  
2. \*\*International Support\*\*: Countries like the UK, the US, France, Germany, and Italy have shown unwavering support for Israel. If these countries were willing to host Israel on their territory, it could bolster Israel's international standing.  
3. \*\*Relocation Opportunities\*\*: In some cases, asylum seekers can be safely relocated to their country of origin. If this were possible for Israelis, it could provide an alternative solution to the current situation.  
4. \*\*Political Neutrality\*\*: Israel has managed to navigate a delicate balance between Russia and Ukraine. Relocation could allow Israel to maintain a neutral stance while avoiding international sanctions.  
5. \*\*Historical Recognition\*\*: Acknowledging the historical error of creating Israel as a British colony could be seen as a step towards reconciliation and justice for Palestinians.

&#x200B;

It may have been necessary in the earlier years of 2000AD when Dredd was supposed to be the faceless personification of ""The Law"" but the comic has evolved to the point where he's a 100% human character who has moderated his views as he gets older and even has to stop himself from questioning whether what he's doing is right. He's no longer faceless and no longer should be.

&#x200B;

The ""helmet always on no matter what"" formula has become less of an identifier and more of a burden on storytelling. Since his helmet has to stay on even in inappropriate situations such as when he's in hospital or captured by baddies. One story arc broke this formula and even showed one of his eyes with the rest of his head wrapped in bandages, and I think this needs to be normalized. Other story arcs have tried to explain it by suggesting he's got some kind of obsessive neurosis which makes him scared to take it off.

&#x200B;

We don't even have to see his whole face. Like, when he's captured by baddies or something, just show a small portion of his face in shadow, or obscured by an object, or something. It's just awkward and strange otherwise. CMV. "

I can only find articles / organizations saying they agree with the Gaza report.

There is much more ofcourse, it just seems that all israel does is lie, and they dont care about it, they will find reasons to backtrack. i live by the belief that there is no such thing as a good government/politician, there are only different levels of evil.

My take on hamas is they are a useful tool by the right wing israeli government to slowly steal Palestinian land. During ceasefires and non violence, israel would provoke hamas by continuing to bulldoze and destroy Palestinian homes and imprison dissidents.

Settlers murdering innocent people and mocking them. its all just disgusting, this level of evil is simply equal to what a certain group did many decades ago.

Hamas i believe is made up of the orphans and children whom had their parents killed during israeli operations and so that hatred and anger is uncontrolled and thats what israel wants, imagine if hamas were actually gone? israel would be forced to a 2 state solution.

That aside, i believe other jewish groups are a victim of israel to. I'm sure they feel their religion has been hijacked by the zionist belief. i've seen ultra-orphodox jews in israel get beaten badly.

people talk only about the hostages about october 7th, and while i condemn the atrocity, how come no one talks about those held without cause in Israeli prisons?

There is something i seem to see, that the people are with Palestine and the elite are with israel. the world has seen the crimes committed, and october 7th does not justify the response, this feels like the final nail in the coffin for the state, they ruined relations with their neighbors for this, and if the rafah invasion goes through in full force. they risk a regional war where America is probably not going to be able to stop because there is not only world wide pressure on it, but it will cause protests possibly in the millions in Washington.

With nearly 31000 dead, even if hamas is wiped out, all israel did was simply provide future fighters for another hamas, and then these orphans will be called terrorists for simply fighting back. To me it just seems like the majority of israel and its people are just Evil.

In their report on the 2008-2009 war, Amnesty said that ""contrary to repeated allegations by Israeli officials"" that it had found no evidence of Hamas directing civilians to shield military assets or that it had forced civilians to remain in or near buildings used by fighters""

&#x200B;

Israel is the one using human shields.

quote, ""The Israeli Defense Forces have been documented to use Palestinians as human shields. Examples of this include: IDF soldiers putting Palestinian civilians in front of them or otherwise putting civilians in the line of fire,\[6\] and forcing Palestinians to remove suspicious objects (possible explosives).\[6\] IDF soldiers also force Palestinian civilians to walk through suspected booby-trapped buildings.""

&#x200B;

In my view, rather then a two state solution, it would be nice if gaza/west bank/israel, merge to become a new country ""New Jerusalem""  where the Palestinians get reparations and their land back. and those whether from Hamas, the IDF, Israeli government, former soldiers, are all tried for their crimes against humanity.

where there is a celebration to honor those lost in the previous wars. honestly though i don't think Zionism allows that. as long as there is a government in that position in israel, they will continue to provoke the Palestinians and hamas, they will continue to steal land, they will continue to victim blame.

ironside voiced the character in the DC animated universe and he pretty much became to darkseid what mark hamill is to the joker. he is often considered to be THE definitive take on darkseid. it's telling that, despite the DC animated universe ending 2006(jesus, does anyone else feel old?), ironside has reprised the role twice, first in the video game lego DC superheroes and then again in harley quinn. 

you may be inclined to say that ironside is too old to play the role since, as of the writing of this post, he is 74 years old. well, if it comes down to it, they could have someone else do the motion capture while ironside does the voice. 

if they don't decide to go with ironside, his successor is gonna have some pretty big shoes to fill."

This happened a few years ago with a few Russians over there, and to this day... they are still missing.

People keep using the mantra of ""Release the hostages,"" but I don't believe there are any hostages. I don't believe any of them are alive.

When Hamas attacked on Oct. 7th... Hostages were more like a mash-up of corpses, trophies and subjects intended for punishment and torture. I believe a most of these people were quickly executed.

You are seeing zero evidence of proof of life.

Hamas isn't just Hamas. It was a loose connection of militants and even some locals. Hamas themselves likely have zero clue, hence why they can't provide names and numbers.

To me that seems rather obvious to any leftist sensibility.  LGTBQ rights are, of course, a priority but once a person: be they, gay, straight, black, white, male or female becomes a member of the owning class, they become enemies of the proletariat.  

There is no reason for a leftist to rejoice that the CEO of Apple is gay or the Secretary of Defense is Black.  All this means that the the bourgeoise has opened its ranks to racial and sexual minorities but that has no bearing on the fact that the working poor remain oppressed.

I don't necessarily agree with all of Trudeau's decisions (or indecisions), reflecting on some of his key policy accomplishments its difficult to deny that he has been extremely audacious. I mean this in the context of his 'legacy' achievements: those major policy accomplishments or moments of leadership for which he'll be remembered years on. To be clear: I don't necessarily think this is an indictment of other PMs - its often just the circumstances under which they governed (as in the case of Harper and Chretien, for instance). 

But, just weighing his 'legacy' achievements against some of his predecessors:

**Trudeau**: Cannabis legalization, assisted suicide, carbon pricing, the Canada Child Benefit (reducing child poverty by 1/3 in a single year), national childcare, leading the government through COVID, and now national pharmacare/soon dental care. These are all really significant achievements, especially given that he only had a single majority government. 

**Harper**: I think Harper will be remembered more for his role in realigning the country politically and uniting the right then any particular achievements as PM. As Prime Minister, he'll obviously be known most for guiding the country through the recession, but beyond that? His two flagship policy achievements were probably TFSA and the sales tax reduction. Those aren't insignificant, but they also aren't exactly enormous. 

**Martin**: Had the Kelowna Accord/childcare passed this may be different, but absent that he'll almost certainly be remembered more for his time as finance minister. 

**Chretien**: It's clear at this point that Chretien wants to be remembered most for keeping Canada out of Iraq, which is notable. Other than that, his legacy is centred almost entirely on his economic stewardship helping reclaim Canada's fiscal health (which will always be a legacy shared with Martin), as well as the 1995 referendum/ensuing Clarity Act.

**Campbell**: Canada's worst summer gig. 

**Mulroney**: NAFTA alone is enough to make him a very consequential PM, but in the grand scheme of things it really is ""NAFTA alone."" His leadership in opposing apartheid is notable, as well as the sale of certain crown corporations, but beyond that he's really just the NAFTA PM. 

**Clark**: Kind of like Harper and Martin (and even Chretien to an extent), I think Clark will be remembered mostly for what he did *outside* of the Prime Minister's office. 

Among post-WW2 prime ministers, I really do think Justin Trudeau is more in the echelon of Trudeau Sr. or Lester B. Pearson in terms of the overall impact of their governments. Again, this is not necessarily a judgment on whether his government or its key policy accomplishments were ***positive***, but rather that they are extremely ***impactful.*** His policy impact has been pretty remarkable in just nine years, especially given that he only had one majority, was hampered by COVID, and still has dental care on the way (presumably). 

All this said, I'm very open to the possibility that I've missed out on key accomplishments of other PMs here, or am perhaps inflating certain accomplishments of Trudeau's. I'd be curious to hear other peoples' thoughts. "

(Honestly, most athletes across all sports are overpaid.) LeBron is underpaid. If he were paid what he was worth, his annual salary would likely be between $80 million and $100 million. I wish the NBA would eliminate player max contracts (35% of the cap) and set salaries in line with the market. (This is not to eliminate the salary cap. If one player receives more than 50% of the team's salary, other players receive less.) In 1997, Chicago's Jordan received more than the salary cap. The players who lead the league are greater than other players. Curry turned Golden State into a $7 billion club. Also, the NBA seems to have more player fans than team fans."

1,2024-03-04,CMV: Talk therapy is basically a scam. ,u/shoshana4sure,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b6jgfh/cmv_talk_therapy_is_basically_a_scam/,changemyview,"Therapy’s positive effects are impossible to deny- decades of research have proven it to be an effective treatment. Despite this, therapy is plagued with the same issues as the rest of healthcare, namely financial issues and exploitation. 

Yes, you read that right; therapy is a scam. In a world where phrases like “mental health matters” seem to greet you every direction you look, it almost seems forbidden to utter the kind of remark you’d expect from your grandfather who exclaims, “therapy is for suckers!” While I don’t hold the sentiment that therapy has no value, he does raise a point: Are therapists really swindling our money? The short answer is yes, the field of professional help and the pharmaceutical industry is rigged with financial traps and emotional roller-coasters that run for as far as the skeptic’s eye can see. 

The last decade worked hard to destigmatize mental illnesses, and contemporary culture finally recognizes that everyone can benefit from therapeutics, not just “those crazy people that belong in the loony bin,” as the older generation says. However, if you haven’t been dragged into the mess of professional help, there’s a misconception that once you finally seek a therapist, their help will…help. 

Therapists are never available to begin with, and after months of waiting for a consultation, you enter Susan’s soothing lavender room, complete with a stress toy and a place to vent. But on your second visit, you realize Susan only asked variations of “so how does that make you feel?”,  made surface level insights, and suggested general coping mechanisms that could be doled out to anyone. You walk out feeling more anxious than when you walked in, and that complementary stress ball is soon to be on life support. You end up asking yourself, “is this what therapy was all cracked up to be? No thank you, I think I’ll stick to my beer and Sunday football.” 

The typical rebuttal is “you just have to find the one you click with!” But why should I, the patient, have to go on a wild-goose-chase for a therapist that “works” for me? They should just…work. A highly qualified therapist would be sharp and strategically personalize their treatments for each of their clients. Leapfrogging through the field of therapists illustrates a fundamental flaw in our approach to treatment. Clearly, schools of psychology need to increase the rigor of their programs and raise the standards to be a certified therapist. To put it into perspective, we easily give doctors access to our bodies; their job is to maintain our physical health. Would you trust therapists to have unrestricted access to the depths of your mind because their job is to maintain our mental health? Would you be okay with allowing a surgeon who botched surgeries sometimes?   


Therapy can be life saving for some people. This makes the long wait times to find a therapist who’s right for you and the financial gates blocking off expensive options all the more harmful to patients who are seeking help. 

Getting legitimate therapy isn’t the only factor draining our pockets. The pharmaceutical realm shamelessly capitalizes off the increase in diagnoses for mental illness. “Big Pharma” is a running joke amongst younger generations, because no matter what economic logic you come up with, it all boils down to a gut feeling: Profiting off of someone suffering just doesn’t sound right. Corporations are incentivized to prolong the misery of patients, forcing consumers to rely on their pharmaceuticals. It’s no secret that corporate America rarely shies away from the chance to play with lives; they certainly haven’t hesitated to use the trivialization of mental disorders to their advantage.  

This is also where accessibility comes into play. Your favorite pill-pushing company may brand themselves as a “family company,” but which families are we really talking about here? Prescription anxiety medication is likely to earn a scoff in most marginalized communities. We circle back to the age-old controversy: should those on the lower rungs of the socio-economic ladder still have the right to healthcare in spite of their inability to pay for it? Do marginalized groups not deserve therapists, medications and an improved standard of living? Or is it just tough luck, since they didn’t “work hard enough” for that white picket fence that anyone can earn in good old America? 

In the end, whether you’re rich or poor, one thing seems clear: we still have a lot of work to do in order to evolve our idea of what good, effective therapy looks like. We need to recognize these petty, stubborn mindsets are keeping us from focusing on reaching a point where the answer to “Do you think having a therapist is essential?” is “Yes.” And if we were to indulge a lofty prediction, when doctors’ physical check-ups are automated, perhaps therapists and psychiatrists will ironically become a “no-brainer”. Until then, do your research before shelling out cash for those pricey medications and wasting precious time on finding a decent therapist. Or as grandpa would put it: Don’t be a sucker! "
1,2024-03-04,cmv: People shouldn't negatively judge someone breaking a law if no one was harmed or put in danger,u/catboy519,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b6jppb/cmv_people_shouldnt_negatively_judge_someone/,changemyview,"# One law example:

Ill mention one pretty bad law as example: In my country there is an ebike named the Speed Pedelec (top speed 45) and, in my own words, the law says this: Even if you're going slowly let's say 15 km/h, you still have to use the road where cars are going faster than 50, and you can't use the bike path.

Its not that this law is totally useless. It achieves something good: it prevents people from going 45 km/h on bike paths.

But.. exceptions should be made for lower speed. If the battery is empty, if you are too tired to pedal seriously, if you get a super strong headwind.... you might be going 20 km/h or even slower than that, and then the right place to be is the bike path, not the road with cars going faster than 50.

One might make the argument: ""but then cars should also be allowed to use the bike path with a slow speed"" and I counter that by saying cars and speed pedelecs are very different things. On a speed pedelec its often physically impossible to actually achieve the top speed of 45. Combine a (near)empty battery with tired legs and a strong headwind, you might be going just as slow as a normal cyclist in normal circumstances. You are also about the same weight and size as a normal cyclist.

In short, if for whatever reason you can't go faster than 20 km/h on a speed pedelec, you should 100% be on the bike path and not on the road with cars going 3x as fast as you.

However the law says this is illegal. The law wants you to put yourself in a dangerous situation, by mixing with cars going 3 times as fast. Which also inconveniences the traffic behind you and creates a huge jam.

You might argue that, other than choosing between bike path and road there is also a third option: becoming a pedestrian and walking on the sidewalk with the bike in your hand. This is both safe and legal, however its not reasonable AT ALL. What if your destination is 25km away? That would be 5 hours of walking. It is not reasonable, at all. The choice is between: dangerous, undoable, illegal. Pick your poison, it gotta be one of the three. I would go for the illegal option.

# In some situations, disobeying the law is the best and the right thing to do.

With the example above in mind: sometimes a situation requires you to disobey a law. Sometimes obeying a law causes harm to people or puts them in danger. While in some situations disobeying a law is the only right thing to do.

# Its wrong to negatively judge someone's action if the only argument is ""its illegal"".

I often find myself and other people being negatively judged for rule/law breaking. But as long as you cause no harm or danger to anyone, why should the legality matter? Why is it anyones business if I break a law without harming anyone?

Why do people get mad at the actions of someone else with the only reasoning ""its against the law""?

Breaking a law does not automatically mean youre doing something bad. Infact in some situations obeying a law means youre doing the wrong thing.

If someone on a speed pedelec obeys the law and gets on the road with cars going 2-3 times as fast, an accident might happen, road rage might happen, a huge traffic jam might happen... Quick note about this example: if you're able to achieve your top speed then you really should go on the road, but if you can't even get close to it, you should do what is safe and not what is legal"

Failure can happen for all kinds of reasons outside the control of the business owner. Betamax was better than VHS but failed anyway. People thought A&W's 1/3 pound burger was less meat than a 1/4 pound burger. Whether it's the customer base you're trying to reach or deliberate anticompetitive practices from other companies, your venture can and probably will fail. The probabilities are known and they're not optimistic. Only 25% of businesses survive more than 15 years, and unless you're a trust fund baby the consequence of failure can be life-ruining.

Meritocracy and entrepreneurship are used in conjunction with survivorship bias to trick people into thinking THEY will be the ones that succeed. Our capitalist system DOES need companies so we sacrifice 9 entrepreneurs so that the 10th one (whose success is probably more rooted in luck and privilege than competence) can succeed. The success of the 10th person is then used to motivate more people to throw themselves into the furnace to keep the fire going.

If your partner verbally abuses you or if a fight goes beyond where you're comfortable with it going, I believe wholeheartedly that you are within your rights to step back and collect yourself regardless with no need to communicate you are doing so to the partner.

I am not: advocating this for people living together. You literally cannot just disappear on someone that way. 

I am saying, if your partner verbally abuses you you are under *no* obligation to speak to them until you decide to, even if that's just to officially end the relationship. In my view, someone being verbally abused having to tell their abuser ""I'm avoiding you while I process your previous words"" is literally just handing them a new opportunity to abuse you. Especially if they know or intended for their words to hurt you.

I have been a bad person. I have also dated bad people. I freely acknowledge this so I understand how it can feel on *either* side of the fence. Quite frankly I'm of the opinion if your actions require a partner to take silent time away from you and the negative behaviors don't change, you should leave, but that's a different argument altogether."

\--First of, I consider myself very homo--

Even so, this really wasn't always the case. Albeit, I grew up with a conservative religious mother and an ally mother who really couldn't give a damn either way.

I know for a lot of gay people, paving the path to accepting themselves(even when everyone around them rebukes it) can be a tough cookie, but I genuinely despise how \*they\* more than anyone, in addition to our closeted homophobes, strip people who genuinely wasn't born that way, from their experiences, just to drive a narrative to the world.

Love it for you if this really was your broke back err killing eve awakening, I just wish sexually fluid folks had a voice in this restless debate too. Scientific data tends to prefer either one or the other, and more often than not, to steamroll an agenda.

But, despite the inevitable gatekeeping I'll have to confront for this, I really had no interest in men till my mid-teens, where (spoilers) I really only found women sexually attractive up until that point. 

Never heard anyone else mention completely flipping from one team to the other, without any overlap. But I wanna be proof that it most certainly can happen, if anyone else who can relate stumbles upon this post. Yes, some people, like myself, who expressed full interest(both sexually and romantically) in the opposite gender, can completely play for the other team.

I suspect for some people, it might tie with how they perceive their own gender, or gender expression in my case.

TLDR; I completely flipped to the fruity side, as someone who formerly only experienced same-sex attraction, and lost all interest in women. It is possible, and while I do believe most people are born gay, I wanna highlight how this really isn't the case with everyone"

Ignoring her son’s messages about intrusive thoughts. Telling him he should learn not to get caught when looking up content about weapons. The list goes on and on.

Prosecutors prosecuted her for her negligence, as they should. But that can only do so much. Any smart parent would know that guy is as much a danger to her as he is to anyone else. If she doesn’t realize *that,* how is she supposed to *realize* she could be prosecuted for negligence, much less be *deterred* by that? What we really need are ways to prevent people like her from getting to raise kids in the first place.

Right now the system is putting up a green light saying “you can be the most incompetent parent in the world and we can’t do anything about it until after you’re caught being negligent.” Which, again, does nothing to deter the parents willfully ignorant that what they *do* is negligent, let alone they’ll get prosecuted for it.

When children commit crimes; hell, in some jurisdictions, even when *teenagers* commit crimes; the judges are lenient. So what’s stopping parents from encouraging them to commit crimes on their behalf, if anyone gets to become a parent? You can keep your young offender leniency or your absolute right to parenthood, but this idea that you can keep *both* sounds like a recipe for disaster.

And if were to scrap either, the idea of an absolute right to parenthood; the idea that the system doesn’t get to do anything about neglect that *will* happen, only neglect that already *has;* sounds like it has the strongest case against it or the two."

Strawberry within itself is a pretty basic flavor too. There are a million things out that are strawberry flavored, and strawberry ice cream doesn’t taste that differently from a lot of those, making it by definition pretty basic and not really standing out much. Vanilla isn’t as common as a flavor, especially not outside of desserts, so it’s less basic than strawberry in that aspect. The same thing can be applied to chocolate flavor (I am aware of many different variations of chocolate ice cream such as mint, caramel, etc but chocolate in itself is not considered basic).

Because of this, I guarantee that if vanillia ice cream looked more pretty and not as plain, it wouldn’t be considered as such especially when taking into account that other more basic ice cream flavors aren’t treated the same."

1,2024-03-04,CMV: Cereal IS Soup,u/WolfNinja4,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b6totb/cmv_cereal_is_soup/,changemyview,"the current definition of soup is not broad enough and in its own definition will not include other well-known soups. Wikipedia for example defines soup ""a primary liquid food generally served hot (but maybe cool or cold) that is made by combining ingredients of meat or vegetables with stock, milk, or water."" Now I think we can all agree that all soups do not use vegetables. Tomato soup, for example, tomato is a fruit, and mushroom soup exists, mushroom is a fungus. Soups can also be sweet like a Scandinavian type soup. 

Now that we have established that soups do not need any meat or vegetable as a base, 
can be cold, 
and can be sweet

let's get to the issue of combining

During our lifetime we would have the word ""combine"" in multiple different contexts and it makes sense because combine is such a broad word. Some would argue that the ingredients have to be Blended together or cooked together in some fashion in order for it to count as soup

But, the Wikipedia definition explains that hot soups boil solid ingredients in liquids in a pot until flavor is extracted, 

but cereal is not hot soup

So that leaves blending which begs the question ""how Blended is something have to be in  order for it to be ""combined""""

Let's say for example you're making a pea soup but you haven't blended it fully and it's still a little chunky, it would still count as a soup, just might be bad soup I don't think anyone is arguing that bad soup does not count as soup.

but WHERE is the line?

If I take peas and a few ingredients and put it into a blender and blend it for one second, does that count as soup? maybe, but it should still count as soup because its the intent of the meal that matters, even if the meal was not prepared well.


So that's why I believe that as long as there's
Two or more ingredients and they are put together in some fashion whenever its  Blending, cooking, or even putting them in a bowl and stirring 

as long as it takes a new form by said combination, then it should count as a combination


Cereal does require the combination of two separate ingredients although  not involved in the way as blending or cooking would, but still in a way that the two ingredients become something else of the act of combining

And therefore I believe a better, more better definition of soup I think that we can all get behind is


soup: any food with a liquid base than is primarily served in a bowl and eaten with a spoon

And what do you know, cereal and all soups I mentioned today, regardless of their quality, fit under that definition

cereal is indeed, a breakfast soup

2,2024-03-04,CMV: Trump V. Anderson (the ballot removal case) was wrongly decided,u/BackAlleySurgeon,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b6vwpf/cmv_trump_v_anderson_the_ballot_removal_case_was/,changemyview,"For the record, I think it's a bad idea to remove Trump from the ballot. But that being said, a state should have the power to do so. The question of whether or not it's a good idea is not the subject of this CMV, so please don't focus on it. 

Trump v. Anderson decided that states could not choose to remove presidential candidates from ballots (the decision did not differentiate between primary and general elections for president). This decision may make sense for House or Senate candidates, but it doesn't make any sense for presidential candidates for one simple reason: the people don't vote for president.

Here's a little legal nitty gritty on how presidential elections work and their history. The Constitution states: ""Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors."" The original presumption of the founders was that state legislatures would either directly appoint electors on a district by district basis, or that state legislatures would set up elections where electors would be chosen to represent particular districts. Then the electors, representing each district, would vote for president, independent of the desires of any constituency or the legislature. So no person would ever vote for a president; they'd vote for an elector. This fell apart quickly, but the mechanics underlying this still exist. 

In modern times, the way it (typically) works is that state law dictates each state party nominates a slate of electors. For a state with 3 electoral votes, the Democratic party will nominate 3 Democrats and the Republican party will nominate 3 Republicans. Then an election is held. The ballots will list each party's nominee for president on it. If Biden wins that state's election, then the Democratic slate of electors are chosen to represent the state. Depending on the state law, those electors may or may not be bound to vote for the candidate of the same party that the electors represent. Those electors vote in December. On January 6, the Congress decides for each ballot if the votes were given in conformity with law. If they decide they were, then the votes count. Whoever got a majority of votes becomes president.

So, here's the thing. The listing of a candidate on the ballot doesn't actually mean anything directly.  The state gets to decide whether the electors have to vote for that person. The states can decide that the electors are bound to vote for the winner of the state popular vote (see Chiafolo v. Washington). The states can decide that the electors are free to vote as they wish. Or they can decide that the electors have to vote against the popular vote. Or the states can decide to pick the electors. Or the states can decide that state courts decide the law on voting (see Moore v Harper).

Given this wide breadth of power, it logically follows that states can choose who the electors *cannot* vote for. The decision to remove someone from the presidential ballot is within the scope of that power. No one would doubt that a state could bar someone from the ballot for being under 35, or not 14 years a resident of the United States, or not a natural born citizen, or having served 2 terms already. Nor should there be any question that a state could bar a person from the ballot for being an insurrectionist. The decision to bar someone from the ballot is purely within the scope of the power of deciding who the electors can vote for. 

The Supreme Court's decision completely ignores the fact that the people don't directly elect the president, and thus, its legal analysis falls completely flat. "

Tubthumping's chorus of ""pissing the night of the way"" and getting up when knocked down are reminiscent of British cultural norms. Closing Time is more upbeat and speaks of the positive, and rather than saying things like talking about a reflecting bar patron, speaks of the POV of a person who knows where their night is ending, showing the American view of being optimistic.

I should choose whether to wear it and I'm aware of the risks and potential dangers mostly for not wearing it.

Here's my little ignorant argumen (I'll try to divide it in points to make it easier to read):

1) I am the one putting at risk my life when not putting on a seatbelt. It's a risk I am aware of just like when drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes.


2) motorcycles don't have them, they have other systems in place sure but I don't think I ever heard of a man driving a motorcycle killing another by becoming a projectile and even if ejected by the car itself the windscreen might take some of the force lf the impact away too in confront to a motorcycle. Both vehicles are legal on the road and if it was such a huge security risk they'd probably try to prevent motorcyclists from slingshotting away.


3) There's life insurance, sure, and having one's safety compromise could mean bad stuff for insurance companies and we surely don't want that as with all other pseudo corporative bodies they are more important than human beings.


But, life insurances aren't that big over here where I live yet seatbelts are compulsory anyway, so I don't think this should apply. Just put demerits on the car insurance if I have an accident while not wearing a seatbelt, that's part of the risk I'm willing to take.






4/end) I do put a seatbelt on because I care at least a little about my own life, but still I do not think it should be compulsory for the aforementioned reasons.

1,2024-03-05,"CMV: Freewill by its own most basic definition, doesn't exist ",u/ValuableBreakfast527,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b6ywcy/cmv_freewill_by_its_own_most_basic_definition/,changemyview,"The irony of ""CMV"" here lol.

Anyway, I argue that if freewill is ""the ability to do what you want"" or more fundamentally, that the ultimate causes of your actions can be traced back to you, then Freewill doesn't exist.

I outline a formal argument:

 1. Freewill exists if and only if an action (x) is entailed by either by will or any other agent faculties. (definition of freewill).     
2. any x, necessarily, is entailed either by force or will.      
3. If x is entailed by force, then x is not entailed by will.    
C1. Therefore x entailed by force is not a freewill x.      

4. The will that entails x(willx) is entailed itself.       
5. The will of x is entailed by another will(x2). (supposition).     
6. willx2 is entailed by another willx3... willxn.   
C2. From 5&6, The entailment of a willx by another willxn leads to an infinite regress and is therefore logically impossible.     

8. From C2, willx is entailed by something other than another will.     
9. will x is entailed by some other agency faculty(p) like desires, needs, wants ..etc(supposition)      
10. any p is entailed either by force or will.     
11. If p is entailed by force, then it is not entailed by will.     
C3. Therefore any p entailed by force are is not entailed by will, and hence, not a free p.    

13. The will that entails p(willp) is entailed itself.    
14. The will of p is entailed by another willp2. (supposition).    
15. willp is entailed by another willp3... willpn.   
C4. From 14&15, The entailment of willp by another willpn leads to an infinite regress, and is therefore logically impossible.    

17. From C2&C4, any x is not entailed by any agent faculties.    
18. From 1&17, any x is not freewill.    
C5. Therefore, freewill does not exist.     


**Some clarifications:**

1. is out of the gate the definition of freewill

2. Means that there are only two reasons, two ultimate causes, for why you'll do anything you do, either cause you want to, or cauae you're forced to.

3. Obviously actions by virtue of force aren't freewill.. so that's ruled out from the get go.

**Possible counter objections:**

“There are other definitions of freewill”

Whilst I'm willing to grace this, this wouldn't solve the issue, cause as long as the *ultimate cause* of your actions can br traced back to anything EXCEPT you, you have no freewill.

For instance let's take the definition ""that you could have acted differently"", this wouldn't still cut it cause a counter would be ""in all possible worlds where you acted differently, non of the ultimate causes are traceable to you""

Talking about that, I think the dichotomy between freewill and determinism is low-key unnecessary; you can have freewill EVEN in a non-deterministic universe.

We simply need your actions to be unexplainable by you.
(Talking about ""you"", there's this assumption people have that the self is a singular self contained entity or something like that, even this view is objectionable if we take the route that the individual is simply a summation of different drives, different ""spirits"" all vying for control.   
So ironically, not even the ""you"" is within the control of you, so there's no tracing actions to YOUr control to begin with.

Just a side note)

Futhermore I think this shows that the definition of freewill I critiqued may be the only available definition, cause let's run that back; 

If in an array of possible worlds where you acted differently, and then you say in response to the previous counter that at least there are SOME worlds where the acting differently was traceable to you, that'd mean that the ACTUAL definition of freewill you're using is that the ultimate causes of your actions are traceable to you, not that there are worlds you acted differently.

A crass prediction is that most alternate definitions of freewill fall into this same thing.

“Belief in Freewill is evidence of freewill""

I think this isn't even a big thing, cause many people believe in many thingsbut , that doesn't make them true.

But suppose one were to take this approach of ""only I can access my experiences therefore only I constitutes a good source of evidence""; a) Someone else can do the same thing for free b) it doesn't help cause one could as well say the reporter is experiencing hallucinations or some ish.

A democratic Jewish state relies on a Jewish majority. The moment Jews become a minority in their own state they will be outvoted, and can democratically be undermined. 

For this reason expulsion of non-Jews, or redrawing borders to exclude non-Jewish majority areas is essential in preserving demographic supremacy, which ensures the nature of an explicitly Jewish state. 

The Israeli priminister Sharon:
>""More and more Palestinians are uninterested in a negotiated, two-state solution, because they want to change the essence of the conflict from an Algerian paradigm to a South African one. From a struggle against 'occupation,' in their parlance, to a struggle for one-man-one-vote. That is, of course, a much cleaner struggle, a much more popular struggle – and ultimately a much more powerful one. For us, it would mean the end of the Jewish state. The parameters of a unilateral solution are: To maximize the number of Jews; to minimize the number of Palestinians.""


Integrating Palestinians, and giving them equal rights is an existential threat to Israel.
Part of current Zionist rhetoric is that for Judaism to survive it must have its own state. Threats to the nature of this state will be removed. 

This also has the consequence of cleansing even within Judaism - Judaism is an extremely diverse label which encompasses many languages and cultures. Israel claims to represent all of Judaism, but has forced/encouraged leaving those previous cultures and languages behind in favour of Hebrew, with a loss of Arabic, Yiddish, Ladino, Aramehic. 

Erasing diversity and blurring all branches of Jewry together into an attempt at homogeny is a form of cultural cleansing. 

As much as I view things this way I wish there were a practical solution. I'm open to hearing those, and discussing whether or not any would allow Israel to be democratic and free while remaining a Jewish state, or whether there are built in fallacies to the situation which cannot be resolved."

Over time, through different comic runs and time periods, it keeps changing so he's always up to date on the present day. To where most adaptations are basically in modern times. Come to think of it actually, there hasn't really been a single Batman movie where I was really satisfied they did it justice, the closest now was The Batman, with Robert Pattinson. Ben Affleck is definitely the most comic accurate, but only really in appearance. 

I can't really explain why, but I just feel like superheroes fit in much more nicely in older decades than they do now. Capes and tights. 

Also, if we're going with the story of Batman, it definitely feels like it should be set in the 40s. When he starts out first he's fighting gangsters like Falcone, as seen in The Dark Knight trilogy and also The Batman. The mafia was largely a thing in the 30s and 40s, so that fits in perfect. Not so much if it's modern. 

This is also pretty much how BTAS is. I just feel like the old style of the 40s and 50s blends so well with Batman, it's part of the character and the story, to strip that away is to heavily downgrade it. It would be like taking your favorite character and then putting them in a totally different setting, it just doesn't work as well.   
Not saying how it's been is bad by the way, but the former would just \*click\* so much more. The whole Noir feel I feel would just really sell it, and that's how it should be.

Just like BTAS did, many of the other villains also are almost like glorified mascots for different gangs. Two-face, Joker, Riddler, so on. They just happen to look and act different, just like the mafia gangsters, just with different agendas.  

Now I do really love multiverse stories and other ways of telling stories, so it can really be told in so many different ways, so I'm fine with the opposite. I just personally prefer this that much more.

I see absolutely no reason why you shouldn't be able to preemptively plan for bad situations. If someone breaks in, you don't know what they're armed with, how many accomplices they're with, etc. Using lethal weapons I believe can be argued, but using non-lethal weapons should be a no-brainer.

When seconds count, police are minutes away. You should be able to protect yourself before they get there. Criminals don't wait

1,2024-03-05,CMV: Michael Jackson was a pedophile and this fact is itself evidence of his guilt,u/Secondndthoughts,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b725tk/cmv_michael_jackson_was_a_pedophile_and_this_fact/,changemyview,"To be honest, I’m not sure if this view is contentious at all as I’m under the impression that most people agree with my position? I find this topic fascinating (and incredibly disturbing), in addition to how crazy it is that the most significant performer of all time had a high likelihood of being both a pedophile and child molestor.

I'm mainly discussing two things here: I want to distinguish between arguments of whether or not he is guilty and arguments of whether or not he is actually a pedophile. I will mostly be arguing that he is in fact a pedophile, noting that there \[exists pedophiles who ""claim to be, and advocate against,"" criminal behaviour involving their sexual paraphilias\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuous\_Pedophiles). But I also think whether he is guilty or not primarily relates to his behaviour in the context of potentially being a pedophile (It isn’t really important outside of being pedantic, but Michael Jackson would technically be a hebephile). As in, \[although being a pedophile doesn't equate to being an abuser\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVfDzXVYiCc), his behaviour around children would constitute abuse if he was a pedophile.

On Michael Jackson's sexuality, I claim to believe that he was a ""preferential pedophile, in that he primarily only had attraction to children. This is due to his observed \[lack of attraction for women\]([https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/hook-ups-break-ups/the-famous-women-michael-jackson-loved/news-story/32ddd4a1c5056e0edf2c4a708a0bf0cb](https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/hook-ups-break-ups/the-famous-women-michael-jackson-loved/news-story/32ddd4a1c5056e0edf2c4a708a0bf0cb)). Whether or not he was attracted to women, his behaviour differed from someone like Prince, as MJ's sexual orientation was and still is obscure. \[Although this video is incredibly biased in my favour\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFblJ0s0Gts&t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFblJ0s0Gts&t=2s)), is long, and makes a bunch of assumptions, it further looks at the mysteries of his attraction in relation to some of his partners. Overall, Michael Jackson comes across as almost asexual, and this could be excused by his arrested development but I'll discuss this later.

Anyway, pedophilia obviously involves sexual attraction to children, however, it also \[greatly involves romantic attraction\](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329544224\_Experiences\_of\_sexual\_and\_romantic\_attraction\_to\_children\_andor\_adults\_in\_persons\_with\_pedohebephilia\_2018) in the same way a person in a heterosexual relationship may love their partner. What makes Michael Jackson's odd behaviour around children interesting (and concerning) is that Michael Jackson didn't seem to be overtly aggressive towards children, and there has been no definitive proof that he was guilty of assault. However, \[this isn't uncommon for pedophiles\](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41213657), as not all are as sadistic as R Kelly. I think most people underplay the romantic component of pedophilia, and I want to reframe MJ's behaviour in the same light as any other celebrity that surrounds themselves with the focus of their attraction.

Michael Jackson's own words seems to describe this phenomena (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5xxK7ad-zg) in a number of interviews he did where he expressed a form of ""love"" for children. \[This video\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avdlDVe4Ohs&t=7s) depicts a bunch of interviews. The interview at 3:50 captures an interesting part of his fascination with children, where he specifically states that he loves their ""innocence"" and ""purity,"" and that his songs and dances are inspired by them. The interview at 9:30 discusses further MJ's odd obsession with children, as he describes sharing a bed with a child as ""love."" \[In this interview\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5xxK7ad-zg), at 22:00, MJ again talks about ""purity, love, and innocence"" in reverence of the children he surrounded himself with. I want to focus on the specific words Michael Jackson uses as I will compare them to how actual pedophiles describe their attraction.

From AMA's on Reddit (CONTENT WARNING); \[This poster\](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/nmhzl/i\_am\_a\_pedophile\_ama/?rdt=41194) describes their attraction to ""childlike personalities and innocence"" and they enjoy being around children. \[A comment from a pedophile on this post\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/94l76/i\_know\_a\_paedophile\_ask\_anything\_and\_ill\_pipe\_the/?rdt=60642](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/94l76/i_know_a_paedophile_ask_anything_and_ill_pipe_the/?rdt=60642)) claims that they get along well with children and express love for ""making them happy, playing with them, and seeing children smile,"" going on to say that they ""have to try extremely hard to stay away from children."" :O. \[The OP of the same post\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/94l76/i\_know\_a\_paedophile\_ask\_anything\_and\_ill\_pipe\_the/?rdt=60642](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/94l76/i_know_a_paedophile_ask_anything_and_ill_pipe_the/?rdt=60642)) describes how they have ""acted on \[their\] impulses several times"" by ""playing with girls, hugging them, cuddling et cetera,"" while also having the belief that they ""have never done anything inappropriate or illegal though, and \[they\] would rather kill \[themselves\] than to do that."" \[Another post\] details a pedophilic commenter stating that ""Physically, I think closeness is more important than sex. Simply being together, cuddling, holding each other, etc."" These accounts and behaviours align with the ones of Michael Jackson, above.

Of course, the other possibility that seems just as likely involves his arrested development. I do believe that Michael Jackson suffers from a sort of stunted mental age as a result of his abuse. MJ did also have extraordinary circumstances that can't be accurately compared between others who may have suffered early childhood trauma and yet didn't grow up with his same obsession with children. From this angle, his relationships with young boys would have to be a sort of exploration of the childhood he never had, either vicariously through these children or with himself being their peer and friend. However, Michael Jackson would discard his friends as soon as they reached later adolescence, and seemed only fixated on a certain stage of development. This is a point that I have found little amount of sources describing, although it seems to me that his lack of interest in these people after a certain age is indicative that he didn't primarily see them as his friends. Though, I want to leave one more account from \[this post\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/nmhzl/i\_am\_a\_pedophile\_ama/?rdt=41194](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/nmhzl/i_am_a_pedophile_ama/?rdt=41194)) where a pedophile describes his ""love"" for children. The poster describes: ""Children don't have emotional baggage, they aren't manipulative in the same way adults are, they don't say one thing and mean another."" This could very easily be a result of this pedophile also being in a state of arrested development, however, that would invalidate the argument made to rationalise why MJ is also obsessed with children...

&#x200B;

Overall, I don't mean to slander Michael Jackson with this post, I just find this topic really morbid and I want to know if my view can be challenged, given that I believe that MJ was a pedo. Despite never being found guilty in his life, if he was a pedophile then I also believe his behaviour absolutely crosses the line into being that of a sexual nature, and thus, of abuse given that it involves children. Again, if a straight man surrounds himself constantly with women, it's should be true that to some degree he is sexually motivated."

He first refused to concede, and then he publicly claimed that the election was rigged (with no real evidence), that our Republic was a fraud, and that he should be installed as president despite the results. He riled up and convinced many of his followers, and eventually the majority of the entire Republican Party of the same. He put pressure on Republican members of Congress and the head of the Senate, his own Vice President, to reject the certification of the election results and to instead crown him as the president. This amounts to an attempt to destroy our Republic and establish an effective dictatorship. This has gone so far without any real punishment and, in fact, has been met with Trump now polling better than ever. If the election was held today, polls suggest that Trump would win the popular vote for the first time and would likely win by a significant margin in the electoral college. This autocrat - this wannabe Caesar - must be stopped by any means necessary. Every lover of the Republic should hope that he is stopped. We cannot reward or encourage the things Mr. Trump has said and done with another term as president.

A good example of this taking place is the re-election of president Bukele in El Salvador-- yes, he has a 93% approval rating, and yes he has also cracked down on the country's gangs, but he has also fired or threatened to shoot with troops members of the courts, Congress, etc, and has created a culture of fear around his critics, where criticizing him could get you immediately fired or imprisoned. He could have easily gone after only the gangs and left his presidency at that, but he chose to go even further and dismantle the old two-party regime, and he has been labeled an autocrat for this reason.

We could also say the same thing for why Hitler assumed power and was highly approved of in the early 1930s-- people were angry about the Great Depression and the Weimar government's weakness, so they decided an extremist dictator would fix Germany, and we all know how that turned out.

Authoritarianism has always remained appealing across the ages for the reasons I have listed above, and will continue to be appealing as long as people feel fear or anxiety or are conditioned into believing scapegoated groups of people are their enemy, or value the results and ultimate goals of a regime rather than its methods. The problem of course, is what Benjamin Franklin famously said about liberty and security: ""Those who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.""

12,2024-03-05,CMV: Generated by the user AI entertainment will not replace human generated content,u/Subtleiaint,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b73ppy/cmv_generated_by_the_user_ai_entertainment_will/,changemyview,"The recent reveal of the Sora text to video generator has sparked a new discussion on the future of home entertainment with one view being that, in the future, users will simply type in a prompt (such as 'show me a high fantasy TV show staring Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe involving a quest to find lost treasure) and a bespoke high quality TV show or film will be generated for them. My view is that this will never happen.

Sora can currently generate high quality video, up to a minute long, with no sound based on simple prompts. Bar some minor flaws the videos look amazing and it is reasonable to believe that it won't be long until longer videos, without the flaws and with full audio (including speech) will be possible. However there is still a huge leap from better Sora videos to quality entertainment and that leap will be much harder than all the progress AI has made so far, so hard in fact that I don't believe it will ever be made.

The first problem is can AI create a complex narrative with multiple characters that is not only compelling but also logical? The answer to that is no and there's no reason to think it can or will be able to. AI is not creative, it's predictive, it doesn't come up with an idea and then expand on that idea it simply shows you something that it thinks relates to your prompt, it's an illusion of creativity.

The next issue is performance and staging, AI doesn't know what makes entertainment good, it only knows what entertainment looks like. This means it will never understand creativity in a way that a human will and will be unable to produce something that a human can.

Next up is quality control, if an AI made bespoke content for a million different users the range of quality would range dramatically with much of the content unwatchable, no entertainment platform can succeed if much of its content isn't, at least, competently made.

That's my view at the moment, I'd be interested to know if anyone can point towards AI currently creating, or working towards creating, viable entertainment."

It's a ridiculous point and I can't believe that the international community has let it pass like that on the basis of religious claims.

And people often say that Arab states shouldn't gave attacked Israel in 1948. But to me it sounds like the only logical solution since the land was occupied by a foreign power (Israelis) and they had to defend the land by all means.

I get it.

-> You’re going to tell me it’s about a *real connection* between you and your partner; something that is rare and something you can’t and won’t find with most other people that makes you feel deeply secure in your relationship & your partner’s loyalty. You will never find that connection in another person, ever. 

If this was the case, people would never remarry, find love again or ever move on from their past relationships. There’s not a single person for us on this Earth. 

-> You’re going to tell me you have rules of *no falling in love*, only physical intimacy. 

To me, this may be one of the silliest things I’ve heard so far from people in OR because if you think catching feelings is something rational and controllable, I have something for you. This is not how the human brain works and not how feelings work. Of course, people are able to abstract any emotion from sex but you still spend time with that person, you speak to them, you speak to them after sex - you repeatedly expose yourself to a potential development of attachment because there is intimacy involved, sex is, at its core, still an intimate physical act. 

-> You’re going to tell me your partner could never be replaced and there’s no one like them for you. 

Although I understand that feeling, for me it feels like it comes from a false sense of security of our uniqueness and maybe narcissism. The truth is, there are _a lot_ of truly amazing people out there. People we find attractive, people that fascinate us, move us, turn us on, you name it. The belief that allowing to become intimate with a person like that leaves us unaffected and with no effect on our relationship is.. baffling to me. There are people out there our partners do find extremely attractive and alluring in whatever way regardless of our own attractiveness. Sometimes I wonder if I’m just too insecure in myself or if people in OR are simply oblivious to the amazing people around them. An open relationship opens up a possibility to actually get to know these amazing people and if there’s one thing I believe, then that relationships and love are highly circumstantial. Sometimes it was the right time and place and then attachment grew. Maybe it was luck. And if you get into a relationship and it’s monogamous, as most relationships still are, you simply don’t look for other or better matches anymore. You don’t allow an opportunity to even get into a situation like that bc you’re loyal. An OR however opens up these spaces. 

Change my view. "

I am not a teacher, many of my students are furries. Nearly all of which are porn addicts and constantly browse inappropriate content on the computers (my friends were/are no different). It seems that every younger person who lands in the furry community goes down a path of being sexually deviant and porn addicted.  


The community itself attracts the attention of minors. The art is cutesy and reminiscent of cartoons. The community is very pandering towards emotional turbulence and open to nearly anything someone can say they are struggling with. The community talks young, innocent, and emulates the behavior of immature and young people.   


It is also inherently sexual and filled with fetishism. Even in SFW spaces you will also find fursonas in bondage gear or with imagery which is symbolic of other sexual fetishes like inflation, vore, ect. It's not a coincidence that furry art know no bounds in what sexual acts they depict and share. The reality is that the community has a cute an innocent surface with a deep sexual underbelly.   


I do not think it is possible for a young person to join the furry community, browse its forums and discords, and not be exposed to rampant pornography. So many *children* who take interest in the community for its attractive an innocent outward appearance end up with twisted sexual fetishes well before they have even had sexual contact with a partner. Often before or as soon as they enter puberty.  


I can't seem to see it any other way. When I see a fursona I am disgusted. When I hear an adult is a furry, I am immediately wary of how they interact with young people or those around them. When I hear a child is a furry I feel uncomfortable with their browsing of content. As someone who is responsible for content moderation in a school setting I want to censor and block these communities and tell other teachers not to encourage that. Others just see it as art and self expression but I just see it as a gateway to being sexually victimized by a community which pretends to be open to their feelings and thoughts."

This is important because it sets the stage for what I will describe as ""reasonable military actions.""

Hamas, as the duly elected leadership of Gaza and the most popular party in the West Bank, should be required to release all hostages before the International community pressures Israel for a peace treaty. While Hamas attacking Israel is justified as a military action while under occupation by the Israeli forces, it is a war crime to specifically target civilians and even worse to take civilian hostages. Because Hamas has chosen to attack the civilian population and take hostages the onus for pursuing peace should be on the instigator this specific conflict. 

The international community cannot validate the Hamas leadership given these clear and planned human rights violations and should cease to apply any pressure on Israel for peace until Hamas takes the first step of releasing all hostages from the Oct 7th attacks. The core argument here is that, much like Hitler and the Nazi's, we cannot recognize as a legitimate negotiating partner a group that makes human rights violations its modus operandi. We can acknowledge that violent resistance is reasonable against an occupying force, however even in these scenarios the imperative is on a military force to attempt to mitigate civilian harm not to specifically target them, something that Hamas would need to be held to account for before we should recognize them as a valid negotiating party. The first step and most reasonable ask here would be for all hostages to be released, then the international community should apply the full weight of pressure on Israel for a ceasefire not limited to completely ending any support funding to possible military action in opposition of. Without that step we should assume that the elected Hamas party is belligerent and requires complete excision and that any support for said party is support for their human rights violations on Oct 7th.

Ukraine is absolutely pushed to the brink by this war, be it its economy or war machine, while Russia is in a much better position to draw this out. In order to recover the lost territory, Ukraine will need to break through Russia's defensive line, which means they need _significantly_ more military aid, to the point where I don't think even Biden is comfortable with. Russia, on the other hand, still has access to Western military technologies through intermediaries, and has access to a large part of the global market (BRICS+) to maintain a semblance of economy. 

I think that until the geopolitics of Russia has completely changed, like those comparable to the collapse of the Russian Empire or the Soviet Union, AND if that shift is in Ukraine's favour, then Ukraine will be in the position again to negotiate their territory back. I don't think that will happen in the short to medium term (loosely defined as anything under 20 years).

On the other hand, Nikki Haley helped expand gun rights not only in her own state of South Carolina but for residents of Georgia with a reciprocity agreement for CCW’s. She is more conservative on economic and social issues than Donald Trump according to ontheissues.org.

That’s one of the things that irritates me the most about the current comparisons conservatives are making between Trump and Haley. Conservatives act like Haley is a deep state Democrat working as a double agent in the Republican Party but she has a more conservative record than Trump.

If I were in Nikki Haley’s campaign, I would be running ads non stop about all of the anti gun stuff that Trump has ever done or said during his life, including during his presidency.

Not only should upwards of a trillion dollars per year immediately be spent on the construction of dozens of nuclear power plants, as well as solar/wind/etc. We should go to the extreme to force other countries to do the same while we are still the most powerful.

Embargoing countries that don't also make the extreme changes needed, to eventually military blockades, and even threatening declarations of war to force other countries to combat climate change.

Considering the threat of climate change, I think those extreme actions are called for.

Also, higher ups in companies that have slowed progress in this regard (oil companies for example), should be rounded up and thrown in prison.

I recognize the US government won't do these things in reality, but they should.

note: Power plants were the only example I gave for change. There are other necessary changes as well of course. Listing them isn't important to my point, so I just chose perhaps the most important example."
2,2024-03-05,CMV: Democrats are disproportionately focusing their ire on progressives/leftists when they should be more concerned about losing ground with Black and Hispanic adults.,u/tootsonboots,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b7be5p/cmv_democrats_are_disproportionately_focusing/,changemyview,"I lived in Detroit in 2016 and voted for Hillary and noted how empty the polling location was. Purely anecdotal, but when I looked at the stats after Hillary lost, I noted that Hillary got 519,444 votes in Wayne County (the county Detroit is in, which is \~80% Black) and Obama got 595,846 votes in 2012 in Wayne County. 

That is a drop of 76,402 votes and Hillary lost Michigan by 10,704 votes. 

All I heard was blame for the ""Berners"" for Hillary's loss but Hillary undoubtedly lost a considerable amount of the Black vote in 2016 and nobody dares blame Black voters for Hillary's loss.

This narrative, that the blame lies on the shoulders of progressives and leftists, continues to this day, with many democrats preemptively blaming them if Biden loses in November. But, the reality is, that [Democrats have lost considerable ground with Black and Hispanic voters](https://news.gallup.com/poll/609776/democrats-lose-ground-black-hispanic-adults.aspx). 

>Although Democrats continue to hold a formidable advantage over Republicans among non-Hispanic Black adults in the U.S., their current 47-point lead is the smallest Gallup has recorded in its polling, dating back to 1999. Most of the decline has been recent, with the net-Democratic ID for this group falling 19 points from a 66-point advantage in 2020. At that time, 77% of Black adults favored the Democrats and 11% the Republicans, so the 2023 findings represent an 11-point decrease in Democratic affiliation since 2020 and an eight-point increase in Republican affiliation.

The ground that democrats are losing with Black and Hispanic voters are enough to put elections into jeopardy, but they don't criticize those demographics like they criticize progressives and leftists, despite progressives and leftists being a much smaller national demographic. (These also aren't mutually exclusive groups, but we will put that aside for now.)

It is my contention that Democrats are focusing their ire unproductively, more focused on having a scapegoat than actually strategizing to increase voter turnout and win elections. Am I wrong?

This is a heated discussion we have had a couple times. This post will not be used as a defense of my stance, just an alternative view point for me to learn her view point.

I believe that racism, on its own is described as any judgement of a person solely based on their skin color, ancestry, race, etc. This does exclude white people.

I understand that racism for many people is systemic. I am aware of redlining, residential schools, generational trauma, racist school funding practices, and so forth.

I try to convey that the viewpoints I hear on systemic racism being a product exclusively by white people are extremely north american centric and that these arguements fly out the window the moment you land in Japan or Iran or many other countries. To be clear, that does not invalidate that white people are exclusively at fault for north american systemic racism.

I believe that racism and systemic racism are not synonymous but rather that systemic racism is a further defined type of racism. It just happens to be much more prevailent than plain racism. 

I also want to be clear that though there are people arguing that white people are victims of racism en masse, that is not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about solo white kids at a black school getting bullied. I'm talking about a white guy working for an indigenous company having his co workers belittle his work. These situations are rare, but they shouldn't be waved off as not actions of racism simply because they are not systemic."

For example today, I found out that an old friend who I used to be inseparable with, died. 

She moved away and that’s why we stopped hanging out. I loved her dearly. I’m still friends on social media etc.

 Today I go on Instagram and see all these posts about her being dead. I am not connected with her new husband ( I never met him ) but I ended up writing him, her mom and a few other people and asking them all how it happened. She was young. Vibrant. Alive. No way is she supposed to be dead. 

Husband writes me back- sends me a paragraph that he just can’t deal with it and seeing her family broke him last night ( get that absolutely ) but refuses to tell me how it happened. 

Random friends write me back that they have no idea how she died either - they just saw his post about it. 

This sort of thing has happened soo much. To me. 

It seems like every time someone dies, people gate keep the cause of death. 

Some people have told me that till the family finds out - or the family should be the one to let everyone know- 

Why are you posting about it then? 

Everyone who loves that person should be able to find out how they die. 
Yes, the family should know first. I agree. 
They usually do. 

But wouldn’t you be doing the family a favor, of having to avoid telling everyone that will need to ask them how their loved one dies? 

Idk this really makes me mad and I feel like I’m right about it. When my bff passed a few years ago- I told everyone. Publicly. 

So now… I am left with confusion, pain, sadness and even more angry- I can’t make sense of it without knowing how it happened. 

Gate keeping cause of death makes me angry. It makes me feel like the people who know ( excluding family) are just trying to get as much attention as possible out of it. 

It’s so easy to just write “ they died in a car accident”. Or they overdosed. 

I just can’t relate to people who gate keep cause of death. "

Conversely, such people tend to be the most upset when get very upset when the other side does the same.

For example, take the word ""racist."" The word, originally a scientific term, acquired massive moral weight during the horror of the Second World War (and slavery I guess); and conjures up images of foaming at the mouth bigots, lynch mobs and Nazis. But since the protests of 2020, the left repurposed a new formulation of it (prejudice + power) to lend moral weight to a narrow political agenda (like modifying various elements of the meritocracy). The term ""fascist"" is another example. You could argue that the term ""Islamophobia"" is another example of this because it's piggybacking off ""homophobia.""

Similarly the right has recently been very keen to lobby accusations of weaponised anti-semitism against people (like university presidents or anti-Zionist Jewish intellectuals like Noam Chomsky) who are extremely unlikely to be ""antisemitic"" in the common meaning of the term. I guess ""cultural Marxism,"" ""communism"" and ""groomer"" are also examples of this phenomenon on the left.

My thesis is the following

a) that these are both morally equivalent phenomena

b this is an example of politicians and other influential opinion setters deliberately trying to deceive the public.

c) undesirable in a democracy which should rely in frank, clear communication.

d) academics who go along with this (for example, Jordan Peterson or the editors of Merriam-Webster) are acting unethically."

These laws typically allow for .02, recognizing that you can have trace amounts of alcohol in you for totally innocent reasons like mouthwash or some foods. The laws are designed to remove all excuses for ""accidentally"" driving drunk and basically make it ""one drop of alcohol and you can't drive"".

Should you violate these laws, you're arrested for DUI, and there is no distinction between you and someone who is actually drunk while driving. I support the laws 100%, I simply believe there should be a distinction. First of all, young drivers know for a fact that one drink isn't drunk driving. So kids sitting through drivers ed being preached to about how one drop of alcohol is considered legally intoxicated lose respect for what actual intoxication is. By that point, what's the difference between driving after one drink versus 3 or 4? Obviously having multiple is more dangerous, but legally, there is no distinction. This is even worse with convicted DUI offenders. In the state of Wisconsin for example, third offense DUI will land you with a permanent .02 restriction. Now I might just be confused but I simply cannot see how someone who repeatedly violates the existing legal limit will be in any way deterred by theirs being permanently lowered. Again, it just seems to me like if you make any amount of alcohol considered legal intoxication, it will destroy any appreciation for what actual intoxication is. 

Also, having a DUI conviction will stay on your record, and it's stigmatizing. Anyone hiring you can see that you have a drunk driving conviction, and you'll be seen as someone who does not have a regard for the safety of anyone else. Spare me the ""any amount of alcohol impairs you"", a .03 BAC is not dangerous. If it was, we wouldn't let any driver have that. I find it wrong that a 20 year old who drives with such a BAC will have a lasting criminal record and be considered a drunk driving offender, while a 21 year old with a .03 will be sent on his merry way and told he can have 2 more drinks and still legally drive. 

Please no lectures about how any amount of alcohol impairs you. That's your opinion and I'm not arguing against it. What I'm arguing against is having unscientific thresholds for intoxication at age 20 and under versus 21 and up. I'm all for having the rule for new drivers, but it should be a ticket and possibly a license suspension, not a DUI conviction. It should be considered a violation of new driver rules, as opposed to someone being ""legally intoxicated"" when they're really not. "

I’ll start this by saying there is a difference between a willing prostitute/escort and a sex slave/human trafficking victim.

The whole prostitution industry should be legalized and regulated for harm reduction. I don’t think either side is evil just because the law states it is. At one point there were laws that were horrific and immoral but still the law-doesn’t mean they are right. If it was legalized, there will still probably be a black market and nefarious players in the game but legalizing it and having safer alternatives to the current situation is ideal and would reduce harm.
Pimps would have less leverage and escorts would be safer and could make a living in peace. 

A common argument I see people make is that prostitute addicts are using the money to score drugs so it’s wrong. 

1.) Not all escorts are addicts. Some of them just want money, new designer bags and material expenses to be covered. They can use their looks and sexuality because it has value. Much like how a beautiful actor or model can cash in on their appearance they should be able to do the same without the same ridicule and law enforcement threat.

2.) This common argument falls flat because there are addicts working 9-5 construction jobs, working as strippers, bartenders, bankers, lawyers and none of those professions and employers come under the same scrutiny the same way for “feeding an addiction. Addiction is a brutal lifestyle that effects everyone from every industry and all walk of life but it is on people to not do dope and if they are already on it, it’s their sole responsibility to get clean. Addiction is often rooted in trauma and I do have empathy and can understand that and feel bad for people in grips of that life but I do not think it warrants keeping the sex industry illegal. I don’t see the correlation. 

You can have sex, that’s fine.
You can pay people to do stuff, that’s also fine. But the second you pay someone to have safe sex it becomes wrong and illegal in societies eyes. The buyers and sellers of this industry should be protected.

It’s somehow legal to pay people to have sex but only if you’re recording it and making porn? The rules around it are not sound is what I’m saying therefore it should be updated and legalized for the safety and wellbeing of everyone involved. Is it the best thing you could be doing? No. But neither is drinking alcohol, smoking, gambling etc. We’ve legalized many vices that are arguably more harmful. I’m open to having my mind changed but as of right now I don’t really see a big issues with sex work.

",u/moneylooser1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b7hqg3/cmv_there_will_soon_be_another_terrorist_attack/,changemyview,"It seems that Europe hasn't learned from its mistakes, as it continues to allow Muslims to come despite various concerns, particularly regarding safety. Muslims who adhere to their faith inherently tend towards extremism due to certain beliefs within Islam. This extremism can manifest in acts of violence, the oppression of women, persecution of minority groups, and other harmful behaviors. Countries like Iran and Afghanistan as examples of the negative impact of Islamic rule. Europe has witnessed a significant increase in its Muslim population, primarily through migration. In 2016, there were approximately 25 million Muslims in Europe, with projections suggesting a potential rise to 75 million by 2050 due to continued high migration rates.Countries such as Sweden, the Netherlands, France, Germany, and the UK are experiencing issues with rising crime rates and gang activities.

Additionally, the recent Israel-Palestine conflict has fueled anti-Semitic sentiments among some Muslim communities, leading to incidents like the stabbing of a Jewish man in Switzerland by a Muslim teenager. Europe's efforts to demonstrate inclusivity and tolerance have inadvertently allowed Islamist extremism to thrive. This may leads to further attacks on Jews and Christians in the name of religion.

 I predict that Europe (maybe France again) may face a significant attack in 2024, highlighting the consequences of supporting what I think is a religion of terror and intolerance. 

I believe in freedom of speech and I will probably be labeled as racist. Maybe I will  get banned for the 4th time. Anyway. Try to convince me that I should not be concerned about muslims. "
5,2024-03-05,CMV: The Supreme court taking the immunity arguement and adding to the delays in the Jack Smith case is a net benefit for Biden. ,u/thesweeterpeter,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b7iiit/cmv_the_supreme_court_taking_the_immunity/,changemyview,"So just to establish my perspective;
- I am not American so I don't have a horse in this race. 
- I am not affiliated to a party, but I'm definitely left of center, if I was American I'd be a Biden supporter
- from my outside perspective and with my daily interactions with Americans, I think the polls are right and Trump has a slight advantage today, but it will be very close

So this is why I think what I do;

The assumption that this trial will find Trump guilty is probable, but not 100%, there is a serious possibility that this will have a hung jury or even acquit Trump. In either of those eventualities Trump would all but certainly win the election. There are more than enough people out there who are only tangentially aware or engaged and they revert to the poll figures that they think life was better under Trump. They just need a reason to be allowed to. 

I can imagine Trump on the stump after a hung jury or acquittal and he'll ring the political prosecution bell all day and night. 

Consider that even if we're generous and let's say 1/3 of the country is a Trump fan, it isn't hard to assume 1 of the jurors is a Trump voter, and it only takes one stubborn ass for a hung jury. Beyond a reasonable doubt is a higher bar than Trump has ever faced before - and these are novel charges, this is a very new kind of trial and it's not like the judge is exactly impartial - she's leaning Trump. 

I think the Georgia case and the New York case are red herrings. New York is going to result in a reprimand and fine. It's basically an accounting error, had he properly identified the payment as an election contribution it's basically fine. I know I'm being reductive, but it's a victimless crime and doesn't really change the electoral math. Georgia being pursued as RICO is interesting but too complicated, it could fall apart fairly easily. Even if it goes through he tried to strong arm a secretary of state who refused to comply. At the end of the day he wasn't successful and it'll be easy for Trump to defend in the court of public opinion as a ""perfect phone call"".

In terms of the Jack Smith Trial - Trump will mount a defense. And even the smartest amoung us will have to acknowledge valid arguements as they come up. Take for example the Colorado arguements, some of those arguements in oral I thought actually were convincing, and let's not assume all of his lawyers will be as stupid as Habba at Jack Smith, that's going to be his all-star team. 

In terms of offense, I think Biden has a better position with the unknown than with a definitive ruling. If he's facing a convicted Trump who's facing what will likely amount to more fines - it diminishes the specter of those crimes. At least pre-trial he can speak about it as ominous and use it as a cudgel. 

If Trump is at trial during or in the weeks before the vote - he's going to have the biggest microphone on the planet. He'll be able to say whatever he wants every single day after trial. It'll be the best free advertising he could ask for. And no one will be able to silence him. If the judge does she'll be labeled deep state and Trump will be able to say that Biden is suppressing his political enemies. Let's not kid ourselves that will look convincing. 

With this delay Biden can use the arguement that Trump is getting all of the possible due process, more than nearly any criminal defendant in history. His pre-trial motions are going to a Supreme court Trump appointed! Every single motion is in Trump's favour, and Biden can use that as his arguement.  

Mostly for me it's that conviction is not a forgone conclusion. They should let this play out and focus on beating Trump regardless of this outcome.

Futurama has always been satire, but it was more subtle in the past with its own storyline and character development. The new season has none of that. The characters are already developed, and the story is just repackaged current events. There are some exceptions, (The Dune parody for example), bout for the most part, it’s offering nothing new or unique, it’s just the same shit we’ve been hearing on news and social media.

The word morality ""principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior.""
Good and bad are relative terms. What's considered good in one context can be considered bad in another. And morality is entirely a social construct that's relative to the human species. Do insects have morality? Do certain animal species have a so called objective right and wrong? Morality is completely a social construct that's based on opinions and preferences that's it. Things that are objective are verifiable truths independent of and thought, feelings or emotion. For example 2+2=4 regardless if the entire world believed it was true or not. But every culture, throughout the world have different moral principles. In some parts of the world it's considered immoral to eat with your left hand. What metric can one use to say that this is immoral or not? And many people like to appeal to religion when it comes to morality but this comes straight from divine command theory. So if you're going to say that something is immoral just because a religion says so let's apply this logic to something else that isn't objective and that'd be beauty. If a god/religion deemed blondes are more attractive than brunettes does that just becomes an objective fact just because a higher being says so? No. That's just appealing to authority rather than actual objective truth. Same goes with morality. Appealing to gods just makes morality arbitrary at that point and different religions has different moral codes so which one is right? 
Conclusion. Morality is just another social construct so by definition there cannot be an Objective morality. It's a complete misnomer .

I think this, primarily due to the number of quotes within the Bible which would, in my view at least, appear to be inconsistent with one another. As an example:

Proverbs 12:21 “No harm overtakes the righteous, but the wicked have their fill of trouble.”

Ecclesiastes 8:14 “There is something else meaningless that occurs on earth: the righteous who get what the wicked deserve, and the wicked who get what the righteous deserve. This too, I say, is meaningless.”

I could point to many other areas of disagreement within the Bible, but I feel that this is a concrete example to start with before jumping on to another. A good start to changing my mind about other sections of the Bible, and the Bible generally, would be to demonstrate these two passages aren’t in direct contradiction.

I think any approach which appeals to other sections of the Bible without already dealing with the example laid out will be ineffective. If the Bible is inerrant, then you should be able to demonstrate any passage is congruent with any other.

We are sifting through the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, and from the ashes emerges the Tea Party movement. Nikki Haley, being backed by this movement, is referred to nationally as being ""radical"", ""ultra-right-wing"" and ""oppressive."" The platform she ran on was one of deep spending cuts, a complete rebuke of the global banking system (and calls to abolish large banks altogether), strict originalist reading of the Constitution, etc. It was like an earthquake for captains of both parties when she won in South Carolina.

Fast forward to tonight. Looking at the map, Nikki Haley has gone from extremist Tea Party underdog to the ""safe harbor"" for the wealthiest and most educated members of the Republican party. She's even attracted a decent coalition of independents and moderate Democrats to her platform (which is still a nod to the Tea Party movement through and through). Even the Koch family is behind Haley.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump (who once hired Nikki Haley as one of his highest-ranking diplomats to fight globalism and the WHO) has ran a mile right of Haley and the vast majority of conservative voters are chasing him there. It's become the case - I think astonishingly - that many Trump supporters see Haley as far too tame in her platform to achieve their desires.

As a libertarian conservative myself, I am a bit in awe of this. I have watched as the Republican party viewed people like me as ""far right"", then caught up to me in my views following the 07/08 crisis, and since 2015 and onward have run right past me and now would question if I am just a moderate or ""left-leaning."" My views have never changed - never shifted - I haven't given an inch in either direction really. But, overall, the entire country has adopted a highly authoritarian idea of what government should be - and left people like me somehow ""in the middle."" It's notable to say that I didn't get anything I wanted during this ""transitory phase"" or any phase that came before or after, which is its own irony."

-Without NYC and co the whole state would be screwed 

-Upstate is a wasteland of industrial decay, rustbelt and population loss to the point that Mississippi outperforms it. Add in the tax and regulations and you see why businesses avoid it

-its getting expensive and people who actually grew up here can't afford it

The way our country is set up there is no person, organization, or idea more powerful than the law. In theory the people make the laws and therefore the power lays in the people. Either way, the rule of law cannot be usurped by any individual person because of our checks and balances.

Because we have made the law the highest authority in the land, the judiciary are in a unique position of controlling that supreme power. In the past we had great respect for these people but lately the attitude has changed.

As a society we question the law instead of trying to change it, we question judges for carrying out the law as it's written, and we accuse the judiciary of acting for political reasons.

Judges are no longer protected by a societal culture of respect and NEED better security. Judges need to be more protected in the courtroom, in the court building, in transit, and at their homes. As we get ready for several intense highly political high-profile court cases this needs to be talked about more.

""a colorless volatile flammable liquid that is produced by the natural fermentation of sugars and is the intoxicating constituent of wine, beer, spirits, and other drinks, and is also used as an industrial solvent and as fuel""

Read that carefully. This stuff is literal poison and people seem to forget about that. The state of being 'drunk' is your body's way of expelling that poison and it damages your brain in the process, thus why people do not remember being drunk or have impaired vision. Alcohol contributes nothing to society, drunk driving is a horrific act and it kills about 37 people a day. Alcohol also can financially ruin people,  destroy their liver, and tear apart their family, hence why they have to go to rehab for it??? 

As someone in college, I see those stupid parties where it's cool to get absolutely hammered and then dumb stuff happens. People get hurt or a lot worse...

Then again I am torn here because prohibition did not work as it just caused people to drink but in secret. Also, there is nothing truly wrong with casual drinking/celebrations. I just hate it when people get drunk because they black out and they are destroying their body and their friends will most of the time just encourage it. 

It's just funny to me because someone who refuses to consume this toxin is seen as 'less cool' because they prefer to not get drunk and damage their brain and liver. I am not asking for another prohibition, but there need to be more regulations on how people purchase alcohol/its intended use. If you are truly someone's friend, you wouldn't let them get absolutely hammered at a party because it is truly unsafe and causes more harm than good. 

I know you may be thinking, ""this post is not productive because of course getting drunk to an unsafe level is stupid."" But I'm saying it needs to be talked about more and you should never let it happen as it can cause terrible damage to your body and your family/friends and it should not be consumed multiple times a day.

15,2024-03-06,"CMV: The best subreddits are medium-sized ones and it will remain so that medium-sized subreddits are the best for discussion, as long as Reddit exists and does not fundamentally reform.",u/Soyuz_1848,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b7rjch/cmv_the_best_subreddits_are_mediumsized_ones_and/,changemyview,"Define medium-sized: subreddits are classified into small-sized, medium-sized and big-sized. 

Small sized subreddits are silent, barely moderated, without much response.

Medium subreddits have a few thousand to a few hundred thousand people, with vibrant ecology and typically not over-regulated.

Large subreddits have population in the millions, and strict moderation.

This post will mainly focus on why large-sized subreddits are inherently bad. 

**My point 1: The larger the sub is, the stricter the moderation is, and overmoderation is inevitable.** 

Reddit has a limited number of mods, and the larger the sub, the harder to moderate. Moderators **have to** establish a very strict set of rules, to automatically filter out possibly rule-violating threads and posts, such as **banning users for participation in another sub, banning popular topics, banning certain keywords regardless of context, and banning users for simply disagreeing with the sub's ideology.** Such rules have a very high sensitivity but very low specificity. Many posts become automatically removed without good reason. False positives are so common that it's extremely difficult to participate without encountering the automatic filter.

**My point 2: The larger the sub is, the more of an echochamber it will become.**

Reddit's upvote and downvote system inevitably makes larger subs echochambers. Any comment that disagrees with the popular narrative gets downvoted to oblivion and does not even appear. The larger the sub is, the more severe it will be (the large number's principle) and the faster it will happen. Dissenting users eventually leave the sub making the entire sub a toxic echochamber.

**My point 3: The larger the sub is, the more extremist and dogmatist it will become.**

By extremist I do not necessarily mean ""politically extreme"", I mean the more rigidly they follow their rules and groupthink. For example, being strictly centrist on every issue is also a form of extremism because any slightly non-centrist opinion is barred from participating.

For example imagine a leftist sub. It consists of liberals, social democrats, libertarian socialists, Marxist-Leninists, patsocs, nazbols, everyone.

Firstly some groups will be banned for violating the rules, let's say nazbols.

Then some other groups will be disliked by mods for their ideology, such as MLs. 

Then a rule such as ""no tankie"" is established and quickly gets over-interpreted. Any comment that criticizes US/UK foreign policy is dismissed as a tankie and removed, user banned.

Then an event happens such as Gaza war, and the sub quickly picks a size, let's say Palestine, and any user that disagrees with the sub on this issue either gets banned or leaves the sub.

Then more and more groups get ostracized.

Finally the sub becomes a ""political discussion sub with a social liberal economic ideology and a progressive cultural ideology and has an extremely hawkish/pro-West stance on every foreign policy issue except for specifically the Palestine issue and it exclusively discusses US policy issues and universally supports the Democratic Party...""

It becomes a very specific, rigidly dogmatic rabbit hole. "

The only beneficiaries would be those property owners (politicians/ ultra rich) who keep pushing for urbanization / concentration agenda. 

There is also studies that high density cities have low birth rate, also zoo animals also have lower birth rate compared to wild life. People keep saying how great walking city, or building 1/2 bedrooms are; sure they are great for young people in 20s or temporary workers relocating but we need to go back to how boomers were raised with more wider spaces and maybe impose law, limiting how many sfh each person can own in cities. 

Instead have, smaller counties or smaller scaled cities popping near each residential big LOTs where kids can run around without getting fined by strata. Some aging rural areas complain they are not getting youngsters and people are moving away; guess what, jobs are not there anymore due to offices all cramped into smaller downtown cities. It might be harder for companies to pull cheap labor from a big urbanization but guess what, maybe that' will make them treat their employees better. Also, lowering housing cost might actually prevent people from job hopping.   


Summarize:

1. Concentration / densification does more harm than good 
2. Correlation ship between densified cities and birth rate
3. Real estate, value is more spread out, less inequality 
4. Build smaller cities between sfh
5. Lower job opportunity, but maybe better prolong stable job with cheaper housing

Pupils should never be pulled out of lessons because of their religious beliefs, they should never be taught what they need to believe, they should never be taught separate information to what the other pupils are taught.

Pupils who are religious or whose parents are religious must still learn about religions separate from their own in RS (Religious Studies). Creationists must still learn about the history of the earth and evolution. Pupils must still be educated on sex and relationships regardless of their religious beliefs. 

Regardless of how a pupil’s religion might affect how they think of these groups, pupils must still be educated on the existence, history of and how to properly respect marginalised/discriminated-against groups (for example; black history month, stonewall riots, women’s rights). 

I’m definitely don’t want to do it the French way and ban any religious expression in state-funded areas. I’m all for religious expression and freedom, but I don’t think it’s reasonable to allow a pupil’s actual education to be hindered, changed or facilitated because of their religion."

The idea that one person has the skills and knowledge to run an entire country by themselves is ridiculous. While it is true that many American presidents may have been geniuses according to historians, that doesn't mean that they are experts in every country, and in infrastructure engineering, espionage, epidemiology, environmentalism, military sttrategy and technology, food safety, agriculture, and the economy, etc. People often spend their whole lives studying just one of these things. And even if you know a lot about one of them, there may be angles you haven't considered. That's why the ability to properly use advisers is so important.

Possible arguments against: Sometimes a president needs to make split-second decisions and doesn't have time to consult advisers. While I agree a basic knowledge of each of these topics is ideal, in most cases you can deal with the one minute it takes to contact an adviser even if you are short on time, and in many situations, if you don't contact an adviser, you're screwed.

Other potential argument against: the President needs other skills too, such as having a good public presence. While I agree this is important, as long as they don't go around offending world leaders, most of the time their duties of overseeing the government and signing bills has more influence on the lives of the average American. And if they're doing something which needs public skills, such as signing a treaty, it's not like they could know whether the treaty is a good thing to sign in the first place unless they asked their advisers.

P.S. Both adviser and advisor are accepted spellings, so let's not have any spelling wars here."

1: Most humans are stupid

2: The reason for any trash is stupidity

3: Therefore the human world is, for the most part, trash  
  
I think that most people's lives are negative, sad and full of suffering, and I don't understand why most people don't try to reduce it/are not conscious about that. And if they try, they rarely succeed anyways. 

It also kind of always has been throughout human history, and it's gotten better over the centuries. But it still is far away from a happy place.   
  
It may be a totally false view of the world, but unfortunately I don't have any strong enough evidence to prove the opposite.

Like people who say ""life is a wonder"" frankly, hell yes, in some cases, if you have no awareness of yourself and the world around you. (And probably if you have unlimited money to create an almost unbreakable bubble of happiness.)   
  
But if you see things from a more objective angle, it's still ultra-negative and full of suffering. 

Some might argue ""yes, it's suffering, but human relationships allow us to add meaning and take away stress"".

Yes, but there's also divorce/breakups/betrayal. Most married couples end up in divorce or in less than ideal couples. Like in the 1/2 marriages that don't fail, there is also maybe 30% of them who stay together only for the children but are -deeply- unhappy.

There are great things in life, but I feel like the net ratio of negative:positive is probably higher than 2:1.

I really want to change my view because it's making me unhappy at times and it doesn't help my relationship. I'm mostly happy, but when I'm getting reminded of this, I'm just completely hopeless about it.

 However I don't want to give up on the truth and just close my eyes to the amount of sh\*t I see everywhere, every day, just by walking in the streets. I'm not a big social media guy btw.

Meanwhile here you are doing the same thing they're doing by refusing to point out one thing where they got a point. They refused to hear you out just like you refused to hear them out. What makes you think you're not the dumb one in the situation then?

TLDR: Not being able to see where a movement is coming from in any way and simply calling them dumb proves that one hasn't done their research (ignorant) and should therefore not talk badly about it.

So I've been thinking of devising at least a semi-agreeable immigration idea that still does immense good. I would like to preface it by saying, in the interest of being honest about possible conflicts of interest, that I'm someone  from what would typically associated as a source country and not a target country of immigration. I'm however a man, and I will make a case for women instead.

Women face special forms of oppression and loss of agency in many of the authoritarian regimes, especially if it is Islamic in nature. On average we should expect an accepted woman from this region to alleviate more suffering than a man.

Women are immensely less criminal than men, especially for the more violent crimes which cause more harm to society and are harder to manage, which will lead to less public backlash.

Women, by virtue of being subject to special forms of oppression a la religious patriarchy, will likely be less inclined to advocate for them there.

Even if above point is not the case, they are socialized around from a young age and accustomed to not really speaking out against and accepting the society they find themselves in/conforming. While, in most cases this isn't great, here it may have the silver lining of them not questioning or trying to change social liberalism even if they deep down disapprove.
(While anecdotal, in all the ""one immigrant one native parent"" families I've known, the ones where mother was the immigrant were able to exert less cultural influence on the children, than the one where father was the immigrant. I mean things like Arabic names, practising Islam, conservative attitudes to sexuality etc)

The good men from these nations could be helped-albeit to a lesser degree-this way as well. His loved ones, if he wasn't oppressing them, would in all likelihood send remittances back home.

If the regime in question is a foreign adversary that is causing other sorts of unethical actions in the region, like say, Iran, they would be weakened as a result of the population and fertility hit that will ensue, and may be more manageable in the geopolitics scene.

Anyway, these are all I got. It's not as baked an idea in my mind as my more long-standing beliefs but I think it's polished enough to be entertained."

**One shouldn't be obligated to feed a parasite attached to their organs**

The fetus isn't a parasite. And the female body is designed to carry and nurture a child. But the main difference is that the ""parasite"" in question was in some way brought about by the actions of the body that it depends on to live. Yes, I know rape exists and it is an exception (also makes up 0.02% of all abortion cases).

A better analogy would be if you severely injured someone due to negligence and only you could supply blood to them and save their life. 

**I wouldn't be legally required to give my victim any blood**

The law doesn't reflect what is ethical and doesn't try to. Just because you wouldn't be forced by law to give blood to save your victim's life doesn't mean it isn't the morally correct thing to do. In any case where the mother wasn't raped, she is 100% responsible if she gets pregnant. Just like any person would be responsible for a person they injured.

Like for example in Iran there’s tons of women who want to get the fuck out because of the discrimination towards womens freedoms and rights, yet people want to imply those rules in other non religion countries.  

There’s people who are sadly born into these extreme religions and are brainwashed into thinking it’s ok and normal to for example hide your whole face, not being in the same room, area or restaurant with the opposite gender and now we’ve created a bigger segregation between the ethnic group and those people (when I saw ethnic group I include those who have immigrated but have adapted to the country’s culture and values)

Like for example here in London people want sharia law and that for example says that if a woman gets raped then there needs to be 4 male witnesses or else it’s invalid. There’s people who are born in a country who doesn’t have these values but are still brainwashed into thinking it’s okay and I think you should move to that country that allows it and let those who want to escape such living situations escape it. 

I can’t tell you how many people have been killed in non religious countries because their sister had a boyfriend or because they didn’t cover their knees like are you serious.

To be honest I think you should only be allowed to practice your religion behind closed doors and not bring it to the public, and if you don’t like it why not move? I don’t want to hear prayers, see discriminatory clothes and eventually dangerous laws.

86,2024-03-06,CMV: San Francisco isn’t as bad as social media puts it out to be.,u/invadrfashcag,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b878qo/cmv_san_francisco_isnt_as_bad_as_social_media/,changemyview,"San Francisco, nicknamed the City, SF, or Baghdad by the Bay, is the most beautiful city in the United States, maybe even the world. And the political right’s ultra fear of San Francisco is extremely unjustified. Despite increasing homelessness problems, the city is still a monument to American culture, counterculture, and the idea of America being a melting pot. 

It’s only real issue is price, but even that is starting to become alleviated. Rent has started to finally go down from its astronomical highs. As a Starbucks addict, I often order a venti iced coffee with syrups. In my present midwestern hometown, I paid $4.75 for this, and I paid the same price at the San Francisco Starbucks at Masonic and Fulton (shoutout to Gaines and Angel btw for being amazing baristas). 

Getting around the Bay Area by transit is easier than in almost every other city in the United States. Within the 49 square miles that is the city, tons of bus lines, street cars, cable cars and subways operated by the Muni Metro run 24/7, and are accessible to all with a $5/day daily pass or $90/month with access to BART, and Muni services are free to everyone under 18. Speaking of BART, it’s never been easier, quicker or cheaper to go to SFO, OAK, Berkeley, Berryessa, or anywhere else on the network, especially during rush hour. Where BART doesn’t go, Caltrain picks up the slack providing Stanford students and peninsula residents train service enabling a visit to anywhere from the touristy Fisherman’s Wharf, the countercultural Haight-Ashbury, the professional sports stadiums hosting the Giants and the Warriors, the luxury shopping at Union squarea eh ;1 or the insane nightclubs South of Market. Shoutout to Temple in particular for putting on amazing shows, and Club X/City Nights for consistently redefining 18+ nightlife. 

The most common complaint I get from SF haters is homelessness. They are common, but nowhere near despicably aggressive. A genuine sounding and simple god bless you will make them respectfully accept you aren’t able to give. In LA, New York, even Columbus Ohio, they act much more aggressively, and start cursing if they can’t get anything out of you. Exercising normal city precautions will all but ensure you’re able to get out of any situations. 

Don’t forget that the region is a major innovator and cultural powerhouse in nearly every area of life. SF has been the hub of the earliest public robotaxi deployments, the home of the disability rights movement, the hub of freeway revolts, feats of engineering like the transbay tube and Golden Gate Bridge, and too many others to mention. I left my heart in the city, and every post on social media only highlights the worst that our city has to offer, disproportionate to all the good we have to offer. "
1,2024-03-06,CMV: Two-footed driving in automatic vehicles is a safer and more optimal way to learn to drive.,u/IanRT1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b87n0q/cmv_twofooted_driving_in_automatic_vehicles_is_a/,changemyview,"Two-footed driving allows you to have much more optimal control and awareness of your vehicle, it also fosters faster and more reliable braking in emergency situations.

The recommendations that say to avoid two-footed driving are generally misguided. They are not based on actual empirical data, but based on fear of doing it wrong and going against the norm. 

To be fair, this is not something thoroughly studied. But the existing science backs my claim. Look at this source: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27210894/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27210894/)

The study concludes that bipedal (two-foot) driving offers advantages in brake reaction time, stopping time, and stopping distance, suggesting potential benefits for driving safety.

These are the two main arguments against two-footed driving:

Pressing both pedals at once: This argument relies on the hasty generalization fallacy implying that just because you use both feet you will press both pedals. In reality, pressing both pedals is a no-brainer mistake that it is very easy to avoid. Two-footed driving is not about resting your left foot on the brake, it's more about resting it beside the brake or hovering without any pressure and only actioning it when necessary. If you learn this from the start you realize how easy is this to do and not to press both pedals at any given time.

Pressing the wrong pedal in emergencies: This one is even more problematic. People who press the wrong pedal in emergencies are generally one footed drivers. When you use one foot to press both pedals it's understandably easier to mistake which pedal to press in an emergency when you don't have much time to think critically to 1. lift your foot off the gas, 2. switch pedals, and 3. press the brake.

In two-footed driving, you literally have it programmed in your head that one foot is for gas, the other foot is for bakes, there is absolutely 0 confusion there,  even in emergency situations you know exactly and precisely which foot to use in one single step instead of 3. 

So based on the limited science there is, and the logical reasoning behind two-footed driving. It can be concluded that two-footed driving can be actually safer for many people, given that they learn this way. I also acknowledge that trying to switch techniques or trying to drive a standard vehicle would make this technique problematic, so I understand it may not be for everyone"

Forget spending time with friends, a newborn would basically preclude the new parents from spending intimate time with each other. Every time I’m in public, everything about what kids do annoys me.

Analysis of the incel movement found that online references to inflicting violence and extremely degrading language on dedicated incel forums are running eight times higher than in 2016, when researchers first began tracking misogynist content on the internet.

Academics from the University of Exeter also noted an increasing overlap between incel followers and the far right, with online algorithms blamed for pushing young boys towards extreme rightwing ideology.

https://www.counterterrorismgroup.com/post/the-role-of-social-media-in-advancing-violent-incel-extremism

I recently finished reading Laura Bates' ""Men Who Hate Women"", and she certainly seems to think so. 

The main thrust of her argument can be boiled down to: 

Incels adhere to a violent ideology.

Incels have instigated mass attacks because of their ideology. 

Therefore, incels should be classified as terrorists. As a society, we should push back on their ideology because it is a risk to free speech, they have issued death threats before and praise Elliot Rodger. 

The FBI and CIA both watch specific groups based on their ideologies and the likelihood that members will commit violence either at the direction of, or inspired by the ideology of the group. Examples of groups watched under this approach include the KKK, Neo Nazis organisations, a variety of other white supremacist groups, some Black supremacist groups, some extreme religious groups, etc. Clearly, not everyone in those groups will become violent, but the ideology’s comfort with and often advocation for violence makes these groups more likely to have people discussing potential terrorist acts they might commit.

Under that same ideal of preventing terrorism before an idea turns into an action, the Incel movement has a violent ideology and often members rile one another up to commit acts of violence. While the vast majority of people hanging around in Incel chat rooms are not going to commit violence, and not all incel chat rooms are equally aligned to violence (any more than every cell of the KKK is equally violent), watching those rooms for emergent terrorist threats is reasonable - with a note that not all of the FBI / CIA’s decisions around this are, or have always been without bias.

And… there is a second element of illegal activity that often accompanies terrorists. In the same way that religious extremists use violet videos for promotion, Incels appear to use videos of violence against women to promote their ideology and excite their members. And it is illegal in most jurisdictions to have and distribute a video of a person being raped and / or murdered.

So while of course thoughts should not be policed, there is every reason to watch, and prosecute members of the more extreme Incel cells because of the likelihood that they will commit terrorism.

And that is what Laura Bates is talking about when she says that we should designate Incels as Terrorists - that the FBI and CIA should include the Incel community in their terrorist watch list alongside groups like the KKK…

Incel ideology is a form of stochastic terrorism and they are formally recognized as terrorists by some law enforcement agencies.  Their own words and actions make this irrefutable.  Let’s not conflate Incels with “guys who can’t get laid”.  Incel ideology is based on hatred of women and encourages violence.

I think we have to be careful when we say it doesn’t happen, or that it only happens rarely. I can think of at least 2 Canadian cases where the perpetrators credited incels with their acts of violence:

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65829240

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Toronto_van_attack

And there is a “mass murders and violence” section on the incel Wikipedia page: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incel

I’m not arguing that we classify them as terrorists. But I think it’s important that we don’t downplay the real harm they’ve done.

I will not respond to anger or cruelty.  I got the inspiration for this post from a female oriented sub Reddit, where there were both men and women who are communicating, and they did so in a very adult, immature way, so anyone who decides to be cruel, I will simply not answer.

If theism is ""A"", then atheism is ""not A"". If you believe in a god, you're a theist. If you don't believe, you're an atheist. That's the dichotomy, the true negation as per the law of excluded middle.

However, some assert that ""agnosticism"" is the third option. Under the law of excluded middle, agnosticism is not a third position, it is a subset of either ""A"" or ""not A"". In this instance, you can be an agnostic, but you must also be either a theist or an atheist. I.e. an agnostic theist or an agnostic atheist.

This makes perfect sense to me. However, it's a contentious point for a lot of people. 

Help me understand their side. To change my view, all you have to do is make sense of why agnosticism can break the law of excluded middle."
267,2024-03-06,"CMV: Anyone who says ""Israel should never have been established"" has no good argument for what should have happened INSTEAD of Israel being established",u/Agtfangirl557,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b8gfs0/cmv_anyone_who_says_israel_should_never_have_been/,changemyview,"I just want to clarify before I start: I am not in any way arguing that the creation of Israel was completely moral, or that people weren't unwillingly displaced, or that there weren't bad faith actors in the Zionist movement. What I am specifically trying to argue is that I truly don't think there was any better *alternative* to establishing Israel as a state (also, I'm specifically talking about the UN resolution that led to this happening, not necessarily the actions taken between the resolution and Israel actually gaining independence--which did involve a lot of back-and-forth killing, displacement, and taking more land than was initially intended). I am pretty confident that anyone who argues that Israel being created as a state was a mistake or that Israel should be dismantled because it should have ""never been created in the first place"" has not actually considered what should have happened instead, or is possibly unaware of some historical facts that led to the necessity of Israel being established.

I'm going to present several arguments (in bold) that someone may make when arguing why Israel shouldn't have been established. My responses to each of these arguments are not serving to discredit the legitimacy of the arguments, but rather show that there wasn't really anything *better* that could have happened in each of these scenarios, unless we want to completely ignore historical context at the time.  
Let's start by talking about the UN resolution 181 that led to splitting Mandatory Palestine into two states--one Jewish, one Arab. The Jews accepted this plan, the Arabs did not.

   
**""But why did the Arabs have to accept? It's their land! They shouldn't have to partition it!""**

For one, it wasn't just ""their land"". Again, it was ""British Mandate of Palestine"". The land was owned by the British, won from the Ottomans after WW1, and there were several Jews living there at the time as well--some who had lived there for years and whose families had never been kicked out of the land, some whom had escaped pogroms in Eastern Europe starting in the 1800's and had legally purchased land from Ottoman landlords, and a large number of refugees escaping from violence both in Europe and in other Middle Eastern countries (more on this in a few points). Now, does Palestine not being a country mean that the opinions of the Arabs living there shouldn't have mattered? Of course not. They had been living there for thousands of years as well. But it isn't true that it was ONLY their land. 

Now, there can definitely be arguments that the *way* the land was partitioned was unfair, or that there were unfair components of the partition, but what would have been the right thing to do in that case? Offer a counter-proposal or counter-solution. Instead, they immediately went to war with Israel months before the partition plan was put into effect.   
Now, if you accept that both Jews and Arabs were living on the land at the time, your argument might be **""They should have just created a binational/unified state where they could all live in harmony like they did before! Jews and Arabs lived together peacefully before Zionism!""**  
First of all, they definitely did not live peacefully together, and this is severe historical revisionism. Of course there were good relationships between Jews and Muslims, it wasn't all hatred. But for the most part, there was a ton of violence and fighting between the two groups. Second of all--many people don't know this, but a binational state was considered and proposed. There are several reasons why that didn't work. This is just one source, so take it with a grain of salt, but here is more info on this that's compressed into a fairly easy-to-follow post: [https://www.instagram.com/p/C2PO89vtUVi/?hl=en&img\_index=1](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2PO89vtUVi/?hl=en&img_index=1) (there are sources for this information in the caption of the post).   
So, long story short: At the time of partition, there were several Jews and Arabs living there, both of whom had the right to live on that land. A binational state wasn't feasible, so there was no option but to partition. To this you might say:  
**""Okay, so there were several Jews there. But why did Palestine have to be responsible for all of them? It's Palestine's land! It's terrible that Jews were kicked out of all those countries, but why did Palestinians have to deal with it?""**  
I mean, here's the thing: The Jews who escaped to Palestine did so because there was a growing Jewish presence there and one of the only places they thought they would be safe. In fact, the British essentially pushed them into Palestine because the UK refused to take in Jewish refugees to help them escape from the Holocaust....while letting them escape to Palestine, despite the fact that they knew the Arabs wouldn't necessarily be happy with this. But ultimately, the reason they escaped was because of violence in the countries they came from, so they were essentially refugees. Are you anti-refugee? Or anti-immigration? Because I don't think anyone trying to argue that ""The Jews shouldn't have immigrated to Palestine and just expected the Arabs to take them all as refugees!"" would have any problem whatsoever with America or other Western countries taking in refugees. In fact, I think that anyone who did had a problem with Arab refugees escaping to Europe, or Latin Americans immigrating to America, would be seen as very racist and ""anti-progressive"". Is it only ""progressive"" to take refugees in when it's Western countries taking them in? Do refugees have to be ""non-white"" for their status as refugees to be taken seriously? (We could also go on for hours here about how the majority of Jews in Israel now come from the Middle East and *aren't* white, or that Ashkenazi Jews in Europe were literally persecuted for not being white enough, but I think you get my drift here--a lot of people view Jews as being ""whiter"" than the rest of the Middle East, therefore have the tendency to view Israelis as ""white colonizers"")  
Now to this you might say: **""But it wasn't just immigration! a lot of the Jews who came to Palestine weren't just there as refugees, they were there as part of the 'Zionist project'! They were intentionally lured there to displace Arabs and create a Jewish state!""**  
Sure, there were many Jews who immigrated to Palestine under the ""Zionist project"", and I've already acknowledged that there were some Zionist leaders who acted in very bad faith. But, there were hundreds of thousands of Jews immigrating there--there is no way that all of them were escaping to Palestine specifically in order to be ""part of the Zionist project"" and help create a Jewish state. Many of them simply needed a safe space to go, and Palestine was one of the only options. When immigrating to Palestine, I can bet you a good majority of them weren't thinking ""Oh yay! Now that I'm escaping persecution and moving to Palestine, I can't wait to be part of this movement that helps turn Palestine into a Jewish state!"" No, they were mostly just concerned with escaping for their lives, and probably couldn't give a sh\*t in the moment about whether or not a Jewish state would eventually be created. And even if they did go there as part of some ""project""--does that mean that because of their so-called ""intentions"", they should be forced to leave? What were they going to do in the 1940's? Were they going to invent some lie-detecting technology to brain-scan every Jew who arrived, to determine whether or not they were there with the intention of ""displacing Palestinians""? Would this any better than America refusing Mexican immigrants because they're worried that the immigrants are trying to ""take all their jobs"", or refusing Muslim refugees because they're worried that they're going to try to ""impose Muslim law on us""? Regardless of why they came there in the first place, once they were there, were they going to *send those Jews back to the countries that they themselves were displaced from, or where they were violently abused and watched their family members get killed?* Were they supposed to just leave and go back to those countries? Because that seems pretty anti-progressive to me.....

Okay, now let's go into some arguments that aren't necessarily related to the creation of Israel, but people may follow up with afterward that bring us back to the original point.  
After reading all of my arguments above, you might say, ""**Okay, but no state technically has a right to exist! A state just shouldn't have been created at all!""**  
Okay then, why am I not seeing you spending even a fraction of your time advocating for other countries to be dismantled? If you're spending this much time arguing that Israel shouldn't have been established because ""no state has the right to exist,"" I better see you arguing the same energy for all countries--especially other countries that are built on ""stolen land,"" as you say. (Reminder that Jews are also native to the region! Doesn't mean Palestinians aren't, but Jews are too!)  
Now in response to this, you might say **""The reason I'm not putting energy into dismantling other states is because they aren't committing atrocities the way Israel is! They've been killing and displacing Palestinians for decades now, and forcing them to live under apartheid!""**  
Israel has done some pretty atrocious sh\*t, I'm not going to deny that. There are several things that I seriously think they could have dealt with better. But, if you look at some of the things that have happened, there is almost *always* some type of explanation as to why Israel reacted the way they did. Going all the way back to how Arabs declared war on Jews in 1948 after the partition plan--the partition plan was created so that not a single Arab would have had to be displaced more than around two hours away from where they lived. But they declared war on Israel, Israel fought back, and as a result, several Palestinians were displaced either by Israeli paramilitary forces (who acted in terrible faith and were trying to get even more of the land, which they ultimately succeeded at), or were tricked out of their homes by Arab leaders who convinced them that they should leave and that they would get their homes back once the Jews were defeated. This entire war taking place right now is in response to the deadly attack on 10/7. I think that Israel has gone overboard with how they've reacted and has created a humanitarian crisis (though I'm not a military expert so I can't exactly say what they should have done differently), but do people really expect them to just not react *at all* after a terrorist attack like that? Also, all those checkpoints people complain about? The blockade? Those were created in response to suicide bombings that Palestine enacted on Israel, and rockets being fired into Israel from Gaza. Do you expect Israel to just not protect their citizens? Of course, some of it has gone way too far and can be argued as being collective punishment, but at the core, those things exist specifically to protect Israelis from being attacked, which I don't think any other country receives criticism for.  
And then if you say **""But Palestinians acted that way because they're oppressed! Occupied people have the right to exist the way they do! Again, they wouldn't be acting that way in the first place if Israel hadn't stolen their lands and displaced Palestinians from their homes!""**  
...then we're back to square one and you can go back to reading this post from the very beginning to see how this entire situation wasn't a ""stolen land"" situation and didn't really have a better way that it could have worked out.

So, if anyone actually has any ideas as to *what should have happened in 1948 instead of establishing the state of Israel*, I am seriously interested in possibly having my view changed."

I recently tried to look up some data on what each candidate actually did as president, and frankly, I had hard time finding a single reputable source aside from the websites of each campaign. All I remember about Trump is tax cuts and appointing three judges, causing the abortion bans. All I remember about Biden is supplying weapons to Ukraine. I tried looking up what Kamala Harris did in her political career and found very little. 

I think people should stop paying any attention at the debates at all and just see what each candidate did in his presidential term (or, in other elections, their term in whatever positions they occupied before).

I grew up around the extreme condom pushing 90s in response to the AIDS epidemic. If a woman is taking birth control pills or has an implant it doesn't keep you safe from STDs. When I was in uni I found out that a certain population group is fond of ""skin-contact"" - no condoms, because the women all take the pill. That was hearsay. But in my mid 20s I finally had sex and the man was from that population group and preferred not to use a condom. 

Maybe I was playing Russian roulette here, but he agreed to STD testing and we used a combination of rigorous natural family planning methods (I said I wont take hormones bec of the mood effect) and we stayed STD and pregnancy free for a year. So I know nfp works... but STDs still existed and would be a threat. 

In light of what ive explained isn't that just a consequence of a breakdown of trust? I don't care for which sensations ""feel"" better. To me condom off or on are similar feeling. It feels like condoms are the gateway to unsavory behaviours rather than birth control in and of itself. "

As such, I don't entirely understand the Christian mindset. From my understanding, Christians should be advocating teaching God in school and it wouldn't violate the first amendment.

Christians are convinced that God and Jesus is fact. Fact should be taught in school. It isn't advocating religion to simply state facts (for example, a religion that mentions heliocentrism doesn't mean teaching heliocentrism is religious). 

As for how to get into heaven, that is just the civic and hygiene component of a public education. Along with teaching sex education, how voting works, and home ec, teaching how to avoid eternal damnation is just as useful piece of facts and isnt religious.

They may be incorrect about the facts, but that is a factual dispute, not an ecumenical one."

In the early 2010s, I loved this trend because it gave me the feeling of using devices from the future.

However, after prolonged exposure, I noticed that even the best minimalist designs started to become ordinary, and this ordinariness eventually turned into disgust over time.

Minimalism is being used everywhere, from search engines to the magazines you subscribe to, from homes to shoes.

The main reason for this is its safe and easy design language; it's safe because the majority of society doesn't complain about the design of the product you produce. Additionally, minimalism has a simple design language that even a primary school child can use.

After a long time, I believe this trend is starting to dull designers artistically."

It really doesn't matter if a restaurant makes something in a special way, if I would prefer it with a certain spice or topping and have the foresight to bring it with me that's fine.

It doesn't matter if your favourite grandmother only made spaghetti in this way, if I'm making it then I'm making it my way.

Reading disrespect and all kinds of other things into people's preferred tastes is very entitled, and not something I can get behind at all.

I'd even say that if someone was doing this to get a reaction, as some online do, it's still more about drawing attention to how ridiculous the overreaction is thank doing anything actually harmful.

1,2024-03-07,CMV: The Dark Triad Personality is a Human Superpower and Modernity Will Exacerbate That Further.,u/Zero-zero20,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b8tjj8/cmv_the_dark_triad_personality_is_a_human/,changemyview,"I will begin by giving definitions for each of the terms involved in this discussion. For this I will lean heavily on definitions given by the American Psychological Association (APA).

APA defines Narcissism this way;

* [""excessive self-love or egocentrism""](https://dictionary.apa.org/narcissism)

The same source gives Machiavellianism this definition;

* [""a personality trait marked by a calculating attitude toward human relationships and a belief that ends justify means, however ruthless. A Machiavellian is one who views other people more or less as objects to be manipulated in pursuit of their goals, if necessary through deliberate deception.""](https://dictionary.apa.org/machiavellianism)

Then they say that Psychopathy is a synonym for anti-social personality disorder and that term is defined this way;

* [""the presence of a chronic and pervasive disposition to disregard and violate the rights of others. Manifestations include repeated violations of the law, exploitation of others, deceitfulness, impulsivity, aggressiveness, reckless disregard for the safety of self and others, and irresponsibility, accompanied by lack of guilt, remorse, and empathy.""](https://dictionary.apa.org/antisocial-personality-disorder)

I contend that people that have these qualities have an advantage in 2 things that define many people's lives; careers and dating. I also believe that these advantages will become even greater as time progresses. 

**POINT 1 - Careers**

The modern workplace is a mental jungle. Things are constantly changing, competition for positions and power borders on absurdity and at times we are called to make tough decisions that regardless of our best intentions, end up hurting other people. In such an environment, one might argue that empathy and emotions are proving to be more and more of a liability. Also, with our senses being constantly bombarded with information, it is getting increasingly difficult to stand out from the crowd and show your abilities. With this being the case, individuals that rank highly on the dark triad scale stand have a massive advantage over those with more modest rankings. Many with this personality type have no qualms about stepping on others to ""get the job done,"" they have no problems hoarding the limelight to themselves to get attention/recognition and they can discount the negative effects their actions may have on others, so long as they achieve their objective. While I have seen this happen in reality, I have also come across this observation in literature. For instance Kevin Dutton, a research psychologist at the University of Oxford (don't know if he's still there) makes the following observation in his book, [The Wisdom of Pyschopaths](https://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Psychopaths-Saints-Killers-Success/dp/0374533989/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3J04NHLAF4YLF&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fewboR5jOJdES_tc3d-WvoO9exhbMEpO1BuT4gYsUap_Sgee3jsXS4QXYBvLRBIOIWSrAJlOmz_n3wL3sWC3PM8IN3vA9sH8TpYpR38-hopu89lG7f11Cw9xi5yKH33Ar_5CJlVYZhYH9tHka2S0wkrAkTZX4ayc8x3eIU1vRDgWzV_-2vMQIa_9yatVkfOon7Tfj9VAnJsJ71jqr9SJmEASNV47vyfcpAKjB4cGwiI.uTzqclwp-JcuyL_flo001n7E1Yy1oVm1WlwX5TpGSQM&dib_tag=se&keywords=the+wisdom+of+psychopaths&qid=1709808015&s=books&sprefix=The+Wisdom+of+Ps%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C603&sr=1-1);

* ""I put it to Hare that in recent years the corporate environment, with its downsizing, restructuring, mergers, and acquisitions, has actually become even more of a hothouse for psychopaths. Just as political turmoil and uncertainty can make for a pretty good petri dish in which to cultivate psychopathy, so, too, I opined, can the high seas of trade and industry. He nodded. “I’ve always maintained that if I wasn’t studying psychopaths in prison, I’d do so at the stock exchange,” he enthused. “Without doubt, there’s a greater proportion of psychopathic big hitters in the corporate world than there is in the general population. You’ll find them in any organization where your position and status afford you power and control over others, and the chance of material gain.”""

And then, In the book [Leadership BS](https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-BS-Fixing-Workplaces-Careers/dp/0062383167) by Jeffrey Pfeffer, the Thomas D. Dee II Professor of Organizational Behavior at the Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, the author makes the following observation:

* ""The evidence suggests that modesty may not be such a good thing for getting to the top or staying there.""

He then goes on to say;

* ""Although sometimes considered a form of personality disorder, narcissism and narcissistic behaviors are quite common, particularly among leaders. Michael Maccoby has noted that many of the most well-known and well-regarded CEOs, including Bill Gates of Microsoft, Steve Jobs of Apple, and Jack Welch of General Electric, exhibited narcissistic traits and behaviors. Maccoby also includes John D. Rockefeller; Robert Johnson, the founder and leader of Black Entertainment Television; J. Craig Venter, the CEO of Celera Genomics; and Jim Clark, the founder of Silicon Graphics and the onetime CEO of Netscape among a long list of narcissistic business leaders. Other narcissistic leaders include David Geffen (cofounder of the Dreamworks movie studio), Michael Eisner (Disney), Kenneth Lay (Enron), and many politicians, including Joseph Stalin and President George W. Bush. For all these individuals, attention-seeking and a sense of entitlement nearly define their personalities.""#

Also, Sandra Matz of Columbia Business School and Joe Gladstone of UCL School of Management published a paper titled, ""[Nice Guys Finish Last: When and Why Agreeableness Is Associated With
Economic Hardship,](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-pspp0000220.pdf)"" in which they put forth the following argument;

* Our findings suggest that being kind and trusting has financial costs, especially for those who do not have the financial means to compensate for their personality predispositions and the attitudes to money associated with it.

Even Bob Sutton, the author of the book, [The No Asshole Rule](https://www.amazon.com/Asshole-Rule-Civilized-Workplace-Surviving/dp/0446698202/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1QUTSYGYCNN0B&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.FNsS4f0LgR1KmUAUh9b9BWdJZ5PNBHdQEmVLjuZrzG5sq0l8Jo1e_Ahy4bTqE8l7GeV4zgNPESvqAcTUmuQPvYCP496kx7VW5CMqVyNG2W8xlAsezuBokc35QqPtFqZ9R-tTTT3H3xnzkpyGGdyGAgJ2Mg-MJmK8AlgqobRo0lypT02Nk4QiGXblQh5sq8FtCkfhYVZ12Cji5TOOX6kZsKoMJkqAGJsBBIkJxVm0UN0.Stj-yomBgfYPlLgOVbaPkatSgWwuK0Qo_dxdd8zQcRs&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+No+Asshole+Rule&qid=1709807145&s=books&sprefix=the+no+asshole+rul%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C438&sr=1-1) and a colleague of Pfeffer admits that though a lot of the tactics DT people use are seen as ""bad behavior,"" [the evidence suggests that they do work.](https://youtu.be/_LdSB-udpco?t=109)

**POINT 2 - REPRODUCTION** 

I have separated reproduction from relationships because most people tend to make the argument, ""It's not good in the long run."" While that argument does hold some element of truth, I don't think it's completely true (if you can't get passed the door, you will never even be considered for the job.) Not too long ago, someone on this very sub talked about how frustrating it was that dating had become like the job market. While many of you will disagree, [this is an observation that many in academia concur with, especially if your default medium is OLD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmhILSGA2bA). Since that is now the case, it should perhaps come as no surprise that just as Dark Triads tend to profit in the career world, they also do well when it comes to short-term encounters and reproduction. They are more willing to perform actions that are acceptable but uncomfortable such as putting themselves out there and being bold, but they are also more willing to go down more nefarious paths such as using deception and manipulation. The literature also seems to suggest the same thing.  In a 2010 paper titled ""[Who is James Bond? The Dark Triad as an Agentic Style,](https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2365&context=soss_research)"" the authors make the following observation;

* ""Traditionally, narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism are considered undesirable personality traits. However, work is now converging on evidence that suggests that these individuals are successful in certain careers like acting and successful in **their sexual lives.**

Later in the paper, they continue;

* ""The Dark Triad traits have been traditionally considered negative. However, a   
growing body of literature is emerging that argues that despite the costs of being   
characterized as narcissistic, Machiavellian, or psychopathic, individuals might actually   
be able to extract what they want from their environment via an exploitive or agentic   
social style.""

[Then in another paper published in the year 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886918302642), the authors state the following;

*  In humans, high extraversion, delinquency and leadership have a positive relationship with number of children. This suggests that traits that are associated with status-seeking and risk-taking may correlate with number of lifetime offspring. The Dark Triad is characterized by boldness, aggression and increased search for status and power hence these traits may also have an association with increased fitness as measured by the number of offspring.

Even when physical features are placed under control as they were in a 2013 paper titled, ""[The Dark Triad personality: Attractiveness to women](https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/The-Dark-Triad-Personality.pdf)"" the authors still came up with the following conclusion;

* ""In conclusion, the results of our study demonstrate that the Dark Triad male personality is attractive to women and **this effect is not mediated by these men’s greater perceived Extraversion or Neuroticism.**""

I boldened the last part to highlight that it's not as simple as ""just be confident."" Though many of these tactics are unpalatable, it would be delusional to claim that they do not work.

The many effects that have led us to this point (i.e. Commoditization of human beings, individualization, wage-stagnation) are not slowing down meaning these things are only going to get exacerbated. If that then is true, then people with the dark triad personality (especially those that aren't violent) are set to have another golden age. If your goal is to accrue money, fame, power or a variety of partners, consider adopting some of the dark triad attributes."

People make ridiculous rules about who gets to say it, and who doesn't with no two people agreeing. It might start off with only black people, but then what about half blacks? How black do you have to be? What about Latinos? Why do some of them say it with no backlash? Some even say black brits or Africans don't get to say it.

Some say everyone (yes even whites) gets to say it while singing along to a song that includes the word, some say still no. Some say you can say it but only amongst your black friends if they're cool with it, and not around other black folks that may overhear and get offended. Some say still no.

So yeah it's a complete joke and should be disregarded altogether. Nobody should lose their job over it, nobody should be ostracised for it. At least not anymore than anyone else. A white news reporter should be just as culpable for saying it on air as a black news reporter. If both get fired equally for it, that's fair.

Pre-Columbus America had a very large native population, more than 100,000,000 and people seem to falsely assume this population was evenly spread when it wasn't. The vast majority of them lived in established civilizations in Mexico and South America, which were destroyed by the Conquistadores. Spain was enslaving native Americans and putting them to work in the gold mines, they were destroying entire cultures of people who are now completely lost to history with no mercy at all. The viruses that they introduced and wars they waged there is what killed the vast majority of the natives. And then they established a state where the Spanish people were the upper class, and the natives were the lower class. I'm surprised how nobody has noticed it, but that caste still exists today and there is systemic racism in Mexico against natives. The upper classes there be looking a little bit light skinned ngl. 

Compare that to the north American history with nstives. Compared to what the Spanish did, it seems like a (hyperbole) peace and love brotherhood. There was wars against the native Americans, a bunch of them, over a long period of time, each with different reasons, treaties were made, treaties were broken, it all took place over a much longer period of time, we didn't just show up and start taking literally everything and conquering the the entire continent like the Spanish did. Attempts were genuinely made to coexist, even though they didn't work out. And also, the population of native Americans in North America was MUCH lower and oftentimes nomadic. Way less people were killed by the English than were killed by the Spanish, although people tend to group it together "

Older cars have more room in the engine bay and throughout the car to make repairs or add modifications. Older cars are often exempt from emissions testing.

You can tune older cars by hand by rebuilding/adjusting the carburetor and adjusting the timing of the distributor all with just a couple of hand tools. The spark plugs are also easier to access to check engine health and tuneup.

If you do want to have an engine with fuel injection, whether it’s an engine swap or otherwise, putting it into an older car shouldn’t be too difficult to do if there’s enough aftermarket support.

Older cars are more likely to use pushrod camshaft systems or if there is a DOHC camshaft design being used, it will usually be more simple than the newer DOHC motors with VVT or cylinder deactivation.

You could also say older cars are more unique, collectible, cooler and potentially valuable than newer cars.

Modern cars often have tighter engine bays, more complicated electronics, sensors to have to deal with. All of this added complication can make it more difficult for car enthusiasts to modify or repair their cars."

You're going to have a lot to unpack here.  The year is 2024 and the USA is still angry and divided about the whole ""national anthem"" thing of sitting/kneeling during the national anthem. 

Now here's the thing, I'm attacked by Conservatives daily, told to go back to my home country love it or leave it, saying it's about patriotism, etc.

I get it.  It's not like I'm from the county of England that gave America people like Thomas Paine, the direct ancestors of Abraham Lincoln AND Benjamin Franklin, and literally made up the majority of the passengers on the Mayflower including two who helped found Plymouth.

Not only that, but I share a birthday of June 18th with three big events in the foundation of America:

The Massachusetts Bay Charter being revoked,

The British leaving Pennsylvania,

and the actual declaration of the War of 1812.

So to Conservatives, don't worry about me being Anti-American, or uneducated. 

Now let's see about that National Anthem shall we?

The United States, and by virtue of being attached to all of the major American sports leagues, Canada, are the only two nations who are not Communist nations who have a tradition of playing a NATIONAL anthem 365 days a year, 7 days a week; and depending on the sport, several times a day ranging from high school sports right up to the Major Leagues. 

Name any other country on a map, and that country will most likely not play their national anthem during domestic events. 

Reason being, it's a National Anthem.  It's predominantly used for visits from world leaders, or events like the WORLD CUP.

It can be played during all of those league matches between Toronto, Vancouver vs (insert American team here) because that's an international game. It's not meant to be played before a game between Los Angeles vs Los Angeles. Why? 

And it's not just that.  Before the Star Spangled Banner was the National Anthem, ""My Country 'Tis Of Thee"" was the National Anthem.

Both National Anthems are literally British.

The Star Spangled Banner is a British drinking song from the Anacreontic Society known as To Anacreon In Heaven and if you didn't know, My Country 'Tis Of Thee is quite literally God Save The Queen.

Oh, and it's not about freedom or patriotism because you know what, any of those countries not Communist that we brought up earlier, they have freedom, some of them more freedom than the USA. Oh, you're not going to like that sentence but it's true. 

Try and change my view.

",u/rlast1956,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b92mzc/cmv_why_the_top_10_of_the_wealthholders_pay/,changemyview,"I just posted a new article on my blog on this topic.

The article proposes the idea that, within our American political and socioeconomic sphere at the moment, the mindset of the electorate places higher priority on issues such as race relations and illegal immigration, among a number of other factors. These concerns, while not minor in any sense, can be seen as chaotic “noise makers” to hide the real problem, which I will argue, is class warfare.

In the United States of America today, the top 10% of the population controls nearly 70% of the wealth (68% in 2022). That means that the amalgamated group of 90% of Americans represents only 32% of the nation's wealth! (think about that for a minute). 

Just as important, if you look at the liabilities (debt) side, this problem becomes even more poignant. The top 10% of Americans are responsible for only 24% of the nation’s liabilities (although they control some 70% of the wealth). The remaining 90% of us -- the less affluent -- are responsible for 76% of the total liabilities (think house/rental payments, car payments, educational expenses, taxes, maintenance, etc.). So, in effect, less disposable income and higher debt levels are an affliction of the 90% of us who are considered the working class!

And worse yet, the ultra-rich in that top 10% group tend to pay little or no income tax because the tax code allows myriad loopholes that they can legally use to prevent having to pay taxes.

I believe constantly reminding the public that we could easily wipe ourselves out if we don’t plan and prepare properly with somewhat regular, somewhat public exhibitions of the sheer power of nuclear weapons, we can impress upon all voters the need to vote and act with long term thinking in mind by tapping into our survival instinct.

People feel good when they have a child because it ticks a box off of the standard life fulfillment list. 

If we were all being realistic we wouldn’t have children because they are usually more expensive than the average person can afford at the time they are starting a family. It is also just a stressful thing to do and the modern world is not structured to give you time to properly raise a child.

This isn’t a I don’t want children post, I still do in the future. I just want us to start being more honest about why we have children."

I enjoy rap music a lot. But I realize that it (a lot of it) idolizes a life of violence, drugs, crime, negative sex, sexism, and abuse. 

Doesn’t that hurt the community that idolizes them? When they try to emulate them in style and lifestyle 

How can communities move on from that when they idolize rappers that glorify this behavior?
I get that they’re sometimes (usually?) rapping about experiences they had, which are relatable to a big demographic of their audience, but sometimes their careers hinge on a certain image that sells. 

But isn’t it enticing to think “if I’m a drug dealer now, I can eventually become a rapper, just like so many of my favorite artists did” that is the path a lot of rappers took, and rap about. 

I know an argument that argues if rap increases propensity of its listeners to commit crimes, then video games increase the likelihood of mass shootings, which i kind of get. But i think in video games it’s easier to see it as fantasy and the level of idolization is severely decreased.  

Shouldn’t the rap industry make a very strong effort to diminish its output glorifying crime and negative behavior, due to its possible impact in the communities they target? 

Music has power, it can jumpstart revolutions. Does the greed of the music industry contribute to keeping minorities in a cycle of crime and poverty by attempting to sell them a broken dream?

The Barbie movie should not have wasted the opportunity to spark nostalgia amongst now-adult enjoyers who would've reminisced their childhood playing with the Barbie® toys.

When you say, ""I hate the rain,"" you are blinding yourself from all of the positive aspects of it, and thus forcing yourself to suffer. This is the power of language. So, when you throw around words to describe disgusting emotions that should only be used for disgusting things (like Nazis), you create  a prison for your mind when it comes to the casual use of the word. This is why I teach not to use the word ""hate."" ""I don't like the rain,"" doesn't have any different meaning, it just allows for a more casual interpretation.

4,2024-03-07,CMV: Anti tobacco organizations such as Truth are shady and negatively impact the public,u/Street_Onion,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b9b7ya/cmv_anti_tobacco_organizations_such_as_truth_are/,changemyview,"I’d like to preface this by saying I’m not pro smoking or pro big tobacco, and fully recognize and denounce the behavior of the big tobacco companies in the 20th century. 

Most of us here are old enough to have witnessed the drastic shift of attitude towards tobacco in the late 20th century. Following the tobacco trials, several groups such as the Truth Initiative sprung up with seemingly endless PR budgets and damning claims about the effects of tobacco consumption and the behavior of tobacco companies. These groups are almost entirely funded by the tobacco companies themselves, albeit against their will. This was part of the penalty agreed upon after the tobacco trials. So what’s so bad about them?

Firstly, these groups consistently use hateful language and imagery to describe people who choose to partake in the consumption of tobacco products. These groups often characterize tobacco users as [gross, ugly, or stupid](https://campaignsoftheworld.com/print/your-beauty-up-in-smoke/). The specific ad I linked both utilizes ageist rhetoric and pushes shallow values to denounce smoking. While these are primarily intended to serve as warnings to nonsmokers, they convey it in a way that demonizes tobacco users, many of which are victims themselves. This demonization evokes a sense of shame in tobacco users, which is proven to only [worsen the problem.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4312064/) There are much more effective ways to discourage tobacco use without ostracizing those who choose to partake.

Additionally, these organizations often resort to misconstruing information or blatantly lying in order to push their narrative. When these organizations first began, they primarily focused on traditional tobacco products such as cigarettes or chewing tobacco. These products contain numerous carcinogens with plenty of studies to prove it, so it wasn’t difficult for anti tobacco groups to convince us they were bad. However, when tobacco free alternatives such as e-cigarettes or nicotine pouches emerged onto the market, anti tobacco groups had to resort to misrepresentation. 

As professor Michael Russell famously stated: “People smoke for nicotine but they die from the tar”. Nicotine, by itself, has rather [benign health impacts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4363846/). The harm from nicotine consumption mainly comes from the method of administration- not the molecule itself. The biggest risk nicotine itself poses is addiction, which is a characteristic of almost any psychoactive compound. Caffeine, alcohol, sugar, and nasal spray are all addictive, but you don't see addiction warnings plastered all over their packaging. After the popularization of eCigarettes, anti tobacco groups didn't yet have the necessary studies to ""prove"" they were harmful. However, they didn't let that stop them. 

With the low hanging fruit (cigarettes) [mostly out of the way](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/adult_data/cig_smoking/index.htm), anti tobacco groups directed their focus onto tobacco alternatives, such as vapes or nicotine pouches. Due to the aforementioned lack of studies regarding these products, Anti tobacco organizations (I'm just going to call them ATOs) were forced to get creative. This led to a series of scare tactics that shifted ATO rhetoric from fact based harm reduction to outright misinformation. 


As far as vaping is concerned, ATOs began focusing on nicotine and diacetyl. Common anti vaping slogans included ""One JUUL pod is equal to 20 cigarettes"" or other statements to that effect equating e-cigarette use to traditional cigarettes. The studies they cite for these claims are only looking at total nicotine content, rather than actual health impacts. This was a blatant attempt to misconstrue vaping as 'just as bad' as cigarettes. While vaping is undoubtedly harmful, there are countless cases of cigarette users noticing significant improvement in lung function shortly after transitioning to vaping. This is known as harm reduction, and it should not be discouraged. Attempting to frame vaping as an equal or even worse harm than traditional cigarettes eliminates a potential route for harm reduction or even cessation for cigarette users exposed to this rhetoric. Diacetyl is another molecule found in e-vapor that ATOs has focused their efforts on. Back when JUUL first became a household name, headlines were full of fear mongering about an elusive disease- ""Popcorn Lung""- attributed to a chemical called diacetyl detected in *some* e-liquid flavors. Despite a lack of evidence or cases of popcorn lung solely attributed to vaping, ATOs took this and ran with it. They cited popcorn lung as a major risk factor for vaping, despite traditional cigarettes containing [hundreds of times more diacetyl than e-vapor](https://ukhsa.blog.gov.uk/2018/02/20/clearing-up-some-myths-around-e-cigarettes/) and ZERO cases of popcorn lung attributed to smoking. 

Following the theme of mysterious illnesses haphazardly attributed to vaping, the EVALI ""epidemic"" is perhaps one of the biggest lies purported by these ATOs. You might notice that despite the fact that more and more people pick up vaping every year, you've entirely stopped hearing about EVALI. While EVALI was still dominating the headlines, ATOs immediately blamed nicotine vapes and used it as a talking point for years. Nowadays, the CDC doesn't even track EVALI cases anymore. The culprit, as it turns out, was not nicotine vaping, but rather black market THC products that share no ingredients with nicotine e-cigarettes. Regardless, ATOs never issued an apology for the misinformation they spread, and many continue to falsely list EVALI as a danger of vaping nicotine. 

Recently, tobacco-free nicotine pouches have gained popularity in the US. These pouches eliminate most of the risk factors posed by other routes of administration: They are not inhaled, contain no carcinogens, and use only food grade ingredients and nicotine salt. These are an obvious method of harm reduction for tobacco users. Despite this, ATOs have already begun their smear campaign regarding these products. Due to the lack of actual risk factors, ATOs are forced to direct their efforts exclusively towards nicotine when it comes to pouches. The demonization of nicotine as a molecule actively dissuades people from seeking Nicotine Replacement Therapy such as gum, patches, or lozenges, under the logic that 'its still nicotine'. 


But what about our kids? ATOs tend to use children as ammunition to convey scare tactics. Yes, minors should not have access to nicotine, and yes, big tobacco did market to kids in the 20th century. However, the majority of current underage nicotine use is not the fault of big tobacco. Tobacco ads are all but nonexistent. The portrayal of it being 'cool' in movies has long been outlawed. Social media is littered with anti vaping ads. Kids know its bad for them. If you went home and found your kid drinking underage, you wouldn't blame the alcohol companies (who do many of the things big tobacco got in trouble for). But what about the flavors that entice kids? Adults like flavor too. Your bubble gum cotton candy hard seltzer is definitely designed for adults... right? You get my point. 


Overall, there is definitely a need for anti tobacco education, however it needs to be just that: education. Instead, we have ATOs that would rather misrepresent studies and utilize scare tactics under the guise that the ends justify the means. The remaining tobacco trial money would be much better used on the actual victims: the American people."

1,2024-03-07,CMV: Israel's Creation Was Clear Cut Colonization,u/Straight-Maybe-9390,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b9bfmu/cmv_israels_creation_was_clear_cut_colonization/,changemyview,"I see a lot of people overcomplicate this situation in an attempt to make it harder to define what the founding Zionists did as colonization.

I think this is wrong, I think that when you cut through all of the fog, Israel's creation was almost textbook colonization. Political Zionism started out with the goal of colonization, and it executed that goal 50 years later.

**To change my view you'll have to point out historical falsehoods in my following argument which fundamentally alter my timeline or overall analysis.** 

&#x200B;

Zionists began planning to take the region of Palestine as early as the 1880s, the very founder of Zionism, Herzl, referred to this goal as 'colonial.'  
  
To make it clear that Herzl meant colonial as in, British colonization, forceful oppression and settlement of a foreign land, etc... We have to examine some quotes from him and a time-relevant definition.  
  
In a letter to Cecil Rhoades, the infamous British imperialist, he Theodore Herzl writes to ask for his assistance with Zionism. He explains that he is specifically righting to Rhoades of all people because:  
  
""How, then, do I happen to turn to you, since this is an out-of-the-way matter for you? How indeed? Because it is something colonial""  
  
A few sentences later he makes it even more clear that he is talking about Palestine:  
  
""What is the plan? To settle Palestine with the homecoming Jewish people""  
  
At another point in his journal, we find him clarifying that Zionism's goal from the start has been the complete control of Palestine.  
  
""Then I went into my plan more deeply, saying that it was not a matter of colonization on a small but on a large scale. We wanted the territory as an autonomous one.""  
  
Herzl makes it clear that he wants the colonization to be established with military force:  
  
""I said I wanted only the kind of colonization that we could protect with our own Jewish army. I had to oppose infiltration.""  
  
Herzl expressing his deep shock that any fellow Jew would fight back against his colonization efforts:  
  
""Having just returned from a trip, 1 hasten to answer your kind letter of September 7. I had already been informed that Mr. Scheid is working against me. From your letter I see that this is true. I am asking myself what might motivate this gentleman to proceed in this way. The movement that I started may not have the approbation of all Jews; but for the present it is incomprehensible to me that  
people who have to do with colonization should be fighting it.""  
  
Herzl's response to a journalist asking him what he should write about:  
  
""Oh yes, write about the solution of the Jewish Question through the colonization of Palestine""  
  
(All from the Complete Diaries of Theodore Herzl) 

As for the proof that he was using colonial in the way I am alleging: 

The Century Dictionary Volume II (1885) gives an example use of the proper usage of

'colonization': ""The increase of our trade and manufacturer, … our growth by colonization and by conquest, have concurred to accumulate immense wealth in the hands of some individuals. Burk, on Present Discontents""  
  
It defines 'colonize' as: To plant or establish a colony in; occupy with a colony or colonies: as, England colonized Australia”  
  
“Given to emigration and the founding of colonies in new countries: as, the British are a colonizing people”  
  
Colonizing Example: “Rhodes too was in early times a colonizing, and so a famous power -one”  
  
Yes, the guy who Herzl wrote a letter to requesting help with his settlement of Palestine, the guy who Herzl described his movement as 'colonial' to, Cecil Rhoades, is literally in the definition of the word colonizing from a reliable dictionary published in almost the exact same year that Herzl wrote his letter.  
  
There's more.  
  
Herzl very clearly stated that he wished to do exactly as Rhodes had done in his infamous imperialistic conquests:  
  
""Such an arrangement I have permitted myself to submit to His Royal Highness. It is this: First we create a corporate body in England which will take the preparatory steps and, moyennant finances \[for a financial consideration\], acquire lands and settlers’ rights from the Turkish government. On the basis of such concessions the actual Chartered Company• will then be formed —and, circumstances permitting, with its legal headquarters at Karlsruhe and under the protection of His Royal Highness Grand Duke Friedrich. There will automatically result from this a political relationship of protection by the Empire, one to which there can be no objection from third parties. No express declaration on the part of the Imperial government is required for this; in fact, we could be disavowed without further ado, as operating on our own, just as the English government was able to do with Cecil Rhodes at any time.""  
  
Herzl was borderline in love with Rhodes:  
  
"" Naturally there are big differences between Sir Cecil Rhodes and my humble self, the personal ones very much in my disfavor"" 

One could try to argue that Herzl technically didn't found Israel, however he was the founding member of the First Zionist Congress, he literally created the blueprint that Zionists followed for decades and decades. His name is the first mentioned in Israel's '48 Declaration of Independence, at the very beginning. To try to deny that the organization he created and that worshipped him did not follow his ideology would be dishonest. Now back to history.



^((No more quotes from Herzl are necessary to prove my point, but just know that there are 100+ instances in his diaries where he describes Zionism as colonialism. ))

  
Around 1919\~ Britain gained governance (not ownership) over the region of Palestine during WW1. And in 1920, as a result of Zionist influence and political pressures, they issued the Balfour Declaration, where they agreed that they would oversee the coexistence of the local Palestinian Arabs and migrant European Zionists.  
  
The Brits did not want the Zionists forming their own state, but the Zionists went there with the intention to do just that.  
  
As a result, between '20 and fall '47, the relationship between them and the Brits became strained, with the tea drinkers going so far as to impose strict immigration bans against further European Jews.  
  
During this same time, Palestinian Arabs were also relatively upset, as Zionist leaders predicted they would be (Ben-Gurion and Jabotinsky, or see the Plan Dalet). There were tensions, a few riots, etc... But no outright war up to this point.  
  
In response to the aforementioned immigration bans, Zionist groups began to run illegal immigration operations, and even went so far as to conduct terror attacks against British officials.  
  
Having had enough, the Brits referred the issue to the UN in the fall of '47. Various proposals were considered, including the Arab High Committee Proposal which was a one state, Palestinian ruled solution in which no more Zionists would be allowed to immigrate, (I have a little prediction, you haven't read this far in, you'll reply with some claim that I've already addressed here) but those already there would be granted the same rights and protections as Palestinians.  
  
Some will try to claim that Zionism's touted public acceptance of the Partition is proof that they wanted peace, however according to the founder of Israel himself, they did not plan to stick to the partition plan, and just saw it as a stepping stone.""Does the establishment of a Jewish state \[in only part of Palestine\] advance or \[slow\] the conversion of this country into a Jewish country? My assumption (which is why I am a fervent proponent of a state, even though it is now linked to partition) is that a Jewish state on only part of the land is not the end but the beginning.... This is because this increase in possession is of consequence not only in itself, but because through it we increase our strength, and every increase in strength helps in the possession of the land as a whole. The establishment of a state, even if only on a portion of the land, is the maximal reinforcement of our strength at the present time and a powerful boost to our historical endeavors to liberate the entire country""  
  
(Letter from Ben-Gurion to his son Amos in 1937).  
  
However the UN decided on resolution 181, in which they suggested that the UN security counsel oversee the splitting of the region in to a Jewish territory (55% of the land) and a Palestinian territory (45% of the land).  
  
As Zionists knew they would, Palestinians were unhappy with the idea of foreign colonizers being granted control over 55% of their home, and a civil war broke out between the two groups in the region.  
  
As a result, the UN never actually split up the land.  
  
They fought until May 14th, 1948, when the British Mandate (rule) officially came to an end, and the area became technically ungoverned.  
  
The Zionists moved fast and aggressively, declaring themselves an independent state and seizing a great deal of Palestine by force. The Palestinians, in league with volunteers from various Arab nations, fought back against the invaders but lost. Resulting in the Zionists ultimately ending up with control of 77% of the region of Palestine. (Note that of Israel's current land mass, 6% was bought from Palestinians). Zionists had taken 94% of what is now Israel by colonial force and violence.   
  
Thus, Zionists colonized Palestine. 

A random point I'd like to preaddress:

* ""Israel was a refugee country."" No, Israel **created** a refugee crisis. It was founded by European Jews who actively chose to go to Palestine with the intent goal of colonizing it. After it was colonized, many middle-eastern countries expelled their Jewish residents thus making them refugees.

Honestly I'm pretty convinced that this ban is what America needs because there are so many bad actors and some hostile nations on social media who are collecting information and trying to influence people's political views and their votes in the upcoming 2024 election (and Russia was proven to be doing this during the 2016 election)

The last thing we need is for more hostile nations to interfere with arguably the most important upcoming election in recent American history which is why I support the ban despite the implications that the ban could be in breach of the first amendment.  "
3,2024-03-07,Cmv: Overtime pay (time and a half) should include the value of employee benefits,u/stu54,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b9fjhi/cmv_overtime_pay_time_and_a_half_should_include/,changemyview,"The purpose of the legal requirement of higher pay for hours worked beyond 40 per week is to propect employees from employers who would rather work people to death than pay to train someone new.  Pushing workers beyond 40 hours per week is made marginally more expensive by these laws.

 Employers have found a way around this (that also dodges some payroll tax).  If about 1/3 of your compensation comes from benefits like 401k matching, healthcare, etc... then the added marginal cost of overworking employees and remaining short staffed drops to zero.

This is why every workplace in America is chronically understaffed and the 40 hour (or less) work week seems to be slipping away.

If overtime pay was adjusted to include the value of benefits then employers would have to reassess the cost of remaining perpetually understaffed and pushing workers to 50+ hour work weeks.  "
1,2024-03-07,CMV: Humanity never repeats a never-ending cycle,u/CrazyBar6116,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b9fjyz/cmv_humanity_never_repeats_a_neverending_cycle/,changemyview,"The cycle is not noticed today, because we thought it stopped the moment our technology got further and further superior, before the 40s, it was wished not to be true because of how much it undermined human will, and how much power societal emotions had on people. It used to be internal or external, when there was a period of misery, there was external war. The only difference I noticed is that while before the 40s societal culture was changing every 25 years, now it's every 5 years, and since we (relatively speaking) stopped pursuing worthless wars, our fights became internal, and the difference between an internal individual fight vs an external war is that one further alienates people and the other unites people against the common ""enemy.  
My theory is this, I believe aliens are real. I think officials realized in the 1960s that society can have smarter and more addicted consumers if they can give the sense of loneliness and dissatisfaction of the status quo big enough for the revolutionary personalities to feel like they need out of survival instinct to change the world. They realized how humanity repeats a cycle of post-war fake happiness (1950's), post-fake happiness by enlightenment with true happiness (1960's), post reflection and internal existential crisis(1970's), post internal war fake happiness (1980's), post internal war by enlightenment and true happiness (1990's), post-reflection and internal existential crisis pandemic (2000's) (unlike the 1970's and practically every decade before it, this time the cycle has changed because of wider inequality, there was everything of everything, the internet was actually used correctly and you had bubbles of interests, rarely anyone used the internet seriously and it was used for what it actually was intended for).  
Then again post internal war fake happiness yet again (2010's) and then post-internal war by enlightenment with true happiness (2020's) (this one we have today in our society is giving 70's vibe gravitating towards late 1960's if the economy was managed better). Do you begin to see a pattern? Confusion-war-fake happy-true happy- confusion-war-fake happy-true happy then again and again and again. Even in history, you'll see the same pattern; it just used to be every 25 years and now it's every 5-10 years.  
Stuff like this is unsaid, and untalked about because modern culture's view of community is that somehow we are all united no matter the years. Yet, the reason we never get out of this cycle is that everyone misunderstood what a community is, a community is simply a group of free-spirited individuals with compassion. And in a world where anything unusual is flagged as ""weird"", humans are a force of habit and it's this exact reason we can be easily understood, and easily manipulated especially on a communal level because everyone overestimates how much they need others and underestimates their own potential.  
this is my take, I really think a lot about this, I just don't say it out loud because of how it looks, I know it's an overgeneralization and not 2 people are the same. this is mostly the cycle sensors go through I feel like, if you agree or not agree I would love your input nonetheless."

(go by the health ministry). However,  this is very likely to have been undercounted due to bodies being destroyed by bombs, buried under rubble, or not accurately recorded due to the chaos of the situation. 

But I prefer to use the standard of casualties, as yes someone may be alive after a bombing, but they may have a terrible quality of life due to being wounded. As it stands right now, there are over 100,000 Palestinian casualties from the war, 30,000 dead/ 70,000 wounded.  On top of that, these measures only account for deaths directly related to the war, not other factors that were exacerbated because of the war. For example, people dying due to a lack of medical care, such as people with illnesses like diabetes, cancer, etc. People dying due to starvation, people dying due to illness, people dying due to exhaustion, people dying due to a breakdown of society and a rise in crime, etc. 

Over 50% of all buildings in Gaza have also been destroyed as of January, this does not include buildings that are damaged or buildings that have been destroyed since then. Even if the war was to stop tomorrow, it would take decades and hundreds of billions of dollars to bring Gaza back to the SoL that it was before October 7th. We also have to remember the situation can get a lot worse, if this lack of aid continues, hundreds of thousands will likely starve or at the very least suffer from extreme malnutrition. 

If people understood the true cost of the war in Gaza, then I don't think a single reasonable person would be supporting Israel. The cost of the war is completely unacceptable and is akin, to Nazi Germany's response to the Warsaw uprising. "

4. Before the next selection they suddenly pretend to care about voters again and they may also put into action some of the things that they have promised.
If there is no way for them to have another legislation period they also do not try to cater to voters at all anymore.

The most pathetic thing is when a president can potentionally be re elected,  already holding a position of power, pretends that he can only put into action his promises if you give him another vote.

My understanding is that the director, basically speaking, is in charge of cohesion. That said, here are some examples of issues I had with the show:

* At the battle of the Northern Water tribe, I did not feel as though the danger shown on screen matched the line deliveries. I sensed no urgency, no panic, nor disorientation nor a number of other emotions fitting for the flow of the battle at the time.
* Still at the battle, the formation of waterbending women at the ready blindsided me. Why did they pop up all together like that? When were they swayed to abandon their culture? Were they already practising military formations or something of the sort to have lined up in the way they did?
* We are given the sense that the Avatar has existed for a long time. There being only 1 avatar shrine on Kyoshi Island makes sense. The Southern Water tribe village is too small to have any shrines for avatars, so still makes sense. But did I miss why there's seemingly only 1 shrine in the Northern Water tribe and in the fire temple?

Given these examples of my gripes with the show, I think the commonality is the director. Am I mistaken about who did their job poorly? Am I the one who didn't understand what the show was telling me? "

108,2024-03-08,CMV: lyrics are probably the least important part of a song with regard to it becoming popular,u/AlwaysTheNoob,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b9qbad/cmv_lyrics_are_probably_the_least_important_part/,changemyview,"To clarify: the lyrics are the words themselves - not the tone of the voice, not the rhythm and melody in them - the actual words.

So why do I feel this way?

A song has a lot going on.  Overall production value - how it's been mixed and mastered.  Instrumentation.  Vocals - this encompasses both the words themselves, but also the sound of the singer's voice.  

So why do I think the lyrics are the least important part?

1) Far more often, I hear people humming beats than actual words.  This is also my own personal experience; I'll get music stuck in my head far more than lyrics.

2) People get lyrics wrong all the time and still love the song.  Remember when everyone thought Taylor Swift was singing about Starbucks lovers, only to eventually realize the line was ""long list of ex lovers""?

3) Bands can reach international stardom without even speaking the same language as the majority of the people who they're playing sold out shows to.  You think everyone showing up to a sold out BTS stadium show speaks Korean?  You think everyone showing up to a sold out Rammstein show in the US speaks German?

4) Performances of instrumental music are more common, and sell better, than acapella groups with *very* few exceptions (looking at you, Pentatonix).  This indicates to me that people are drawn more to instrumental music than lyrical prowess.  

5) People often completely ignore the lyrics.  How many times have you heard someone say that it was years before they realized that a song was actually obscene or violent or something, but they never realized because everything else about it was just catchy?  Example: Foster the People's song Pumped Up Kicks is obviously about a kid shooting up a school, but it was massively popular on radio and people just liked dancing to it at festivals.  I saw a lot of posts, long after it came out, about people going ""hey wait a minute...""

6) My observation of what makes it into the mainstream is that songs with extremely simple and cheesy lyrics but a catchy beat and good production values will outperform a song with clever poetic lyrics but it sounds like it was recorded in someone's home studio and doesn't have a musical hook that gets stuck in your head.

So there you have it.  My reasoning for thinking that the actual words to a song are about the least important factor in it becoming popular.  Change my view! "

Everyone else will always be better at getting their way than you. So other people will be getting sex and you will not. Other people will gain positions of power and you will not.

I would seriously rather just sit in front of a huge screen TV. Turn the volume up really loud and watch a really good version of it on TV.

I mean, it is interesting to see the actual artist, but listening to a CD or watching a music video gives you a better listening experience at least. I will give you an example. I’ve been a big PJ Harvey fan since the early 90s. She’s probably one of my favorite artist. I finally got to go see her around 2017 or so. It was the worst concert I’ve ever been to. I had to leave after 10 minutes because it was so loud, and it was a standing room only, and I was being squished by everyone around me. I could not see her, I could barely hear it, and I was highly disappointed.

I think if you’re more in the front row, it might be a better experience, but in general, if you weren’t really want to appreciate the music, just watch a Music video or listen to this CD with headsets on."

Whenever I’ve tried to discuss this with folks on other platforms, they seemed to take it as a personal attack, or accuse me of eugenics. 
Also, throwaway account because of said hostility. 

For the record, I condemn eugenics and anyone who suggests certain races or religions should not reproduce. It’s an absurd, nazi concept. (And I don’t want to get ahead of myself, but the fact that IVF is only available to those that can afford it, and minorities are disproportionately impoverished, seems like actual eugenics to me)

I am not trying to advocate for banning the practice at all, (I’d even support making it universally available regardless of wealth rather than the current system), and I certainly don’t agree with the Alabama court ruling. 

**I am advocating that we be allowed to talk about it, and we acknowledge that widespread use of IVF could have serious consequences, even if those consequences occur after our lifetimes.**

For the millions of years of human evolution that preceded modern times, the only people reproducing were the fertile ones. I don’t want to start rambling about the basics of evolution and the proliferation of advantageous genetic mutations vs the stifling of unfavorable ones, but as long as we agree that reproduction has happened the same way for 10s of millions of years before us (P ejaculate in V), that’s what’s important. 

That makes IVF an unprecedented deviation from the way human eggs have been fertilized for tens of millions of years. As we continue to discover just how ignorant we are about our own biology, it seems like we ought to have a bit more humility about the significance of this. Pretty recently, for example, we discovered that the egg actually detects and influences which sperm cell fertilizes it- in simple terms, the egg selects the sperm. Not all methods of IVF involve force-injecting a sperm cell into an egg, but it is one way, and it circumvents the egg’s input entirely. To the scientifically illiterate, this might sound minor, but female eggs didn’t evolve this “skill” for no reason, and we don’t seem to care much what that reason was.

Perhaps some people who need IVF have healthy eggs and motile sperm, but the mother’s cervix and uterus are oriented in such a way that fertilization and implantation are tenuous and often result in miscarriage, so they need IVF to allow the embryo to develop enough in the lab to succeed in the uterus. For all of human history until now, the genetic mutation that encoded her reproductive organs to form in this inhospitable (for lack of a better word) way would not be passed on to the next generation because she wouldn’t be able to conceive. The same goes for men with Erectile dysfunction. 
I’m not suggesting that these impediments make them unworthy of the opportunity to have children, but I feel like we are glossing over the fact that a not-insignificant number of people who would otherwise not reproduce are now doing so. And, to circle back to something that we should all agree on, the only people who *can* use this delicate new technology are the wealthy. Sure, the wealthy have always had easier access to medicine in general, but *creating entire human beings who would otherwise not exist* is not the same. I struggle to understand anyone who insists it is. And, in any case, just because poor people can’t readily access medical care like a rich person doesn’t mean they should also be barred from IVF. 

If you don’t share any of my concerns about potential consequences of interfering with evolutionary fundamentals on the microscopic level, then we should at least agree that the rich should not be the only ones allowed to do so, right?

1,2024-03-09,CMV: Existing high speed rail should be used more for light freight and parcel transportation ,u/Soyuz_1848,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bag2z1/cmv_existing_high_speed_rail_should_be_used_more/,changemyview,"Currently small parcel and ""white goods"" (non-coal, non-fuel) transportation heavily relies on road travel. High-speed rail is a cheap and fast way of transport, especially for time-sensitive goods such as fresh food, express parcels etc. 

We can utilise existing high-speed rail infrastructure **without** adding any extra dedicated freight train in the following ways:

(1) Using the CIT train for fresh, large-quantity goods. Every day in early morning, an empty train runs through the railroad to inspect the rail conditions. This train, called the CIT (comprehensive inspection train), is not taking any passengers. So if the first train of every day is non-commercial, why not make it a dedicated freight train? 

(2) For not-so-urgent, or not same-day small parcels, we can just use the empty, unoccupied seats on a commercial train. A dedicated delivery person is not needed if the parcels need to be transported the whole way, aka from the first stop to the last stop. We can just have the station staff load them before passengers board, and unload after all the passengers leave. 

(3) For really urgent, person-to-person small parcels, and not ""whole-way"" ones, we can have a dedicated delivery person to carry the parcels and charge a high price for it. For example, imagine there is a train service from large city A to large city B, 800 miles apart, from 11:00 to 16:00. Unless it's really peak season, the train is guaranteed to have empty seats. The delivery company can just offer a same-day delivery service, with the delivery person collecting the parcels from 08:00 to 10:00, and they are guaranteed to arrive by 18:00 on the same day. Such a super-express service is a lot faster than conventional delivery so we can just charge a premium price for premium door-to-door service. One delivery person can carry up to 40~50 kg of parcels with a trolley, and upon arrival they can use electric tricycles of the delivery company to deliver the goods to people's doorsteps. The delivery person can just collect other parcels from 18:00 to 20:00, and take the slow night sleeper train (the type with a bed) back, and deliver the goods back next morning. The only cost occuring is the delivery person's salary and intra-city delivery costs (the trains already have empty seats). If we charge at least $500 for 100 kg of small parcels (50 kg same-day from A to B, and 50 kg next-morning from B to A), the service will be profitable.

I apprecciate the enthusiasm but I know things won't change. I've been rejected my whole life and I'm getting older and older. I'm doing well in college, almost finished it and I'll probably get a job next year. But since I failed in this part of life, every other thing I accomplished seems wothless to me. Why should I even care about other things when I'm not going to be loved at all ?  
You may also say I should decide if my life is a falliure or not, because more or less it's about what I want. I wanted to experience relationships and love. That's pretty unlikely to happen. But that's what I wanted. So it means I failed.  
I have no longer any friends to hang out with, for many reasons. Some people went to live elsewhere, some other people didn't really get along with me. I don't like to conform to gender norms and stereotypes, I need my own time before I can trust and do some moves with girls. I'd want an equal relationship but that seems to be completely impossibile. I'm pretty lonely and there are no places where I can meet new girls. I'm not particularly good looking, (I'm skinny and 5'8 tall). So I'd honestly say there's zero chance of a change.  
Even if some woman can be interested in me later in life, I'd still be unexperienced, that makes it impossible to me. I'd be too weak and the woman could compare me with her previous lovers and I'm sure I'd be liked less. I'd be fine with a woman having her own past if I can have my own, I don't have any, every freedom of choosing has been removed form me, because no matter what I do, rejection is the only possible result. How can a lonely life like this not be a falliure? Now I know there were great men in the past who died virgin, like Isaac Newton and othere, they had great minds and were very useful to society, I don't know if they were really happy with themselves or no.

This is obviously provocative, especially given the conflict in Gaza and the upcoming Ramadan. These settlements are illegal and widely condemned by Israel's allies and critics alike. It's well known that these settlements are a major roadblock to a cohesive Palestinian state and a significant detrimant to any kind of peaceful solution in the region. This recent move is further proof that Israel is only willing to pursue a violent solution to the problem, by further aggravating the Palestinian population and using its military might to force Palestinians out of the West Bank. 

Can someone show how this latest act is consistent with the belief that Israel has the intention to pursue a peaceful solution to the conflict?"

The stance that ceasefires must critically evaluate the intentions and historical actions of groups like Hamas stems from an understanding of the fundamental differences in objectives between state and non-state actors within conflict zones. Hamas, labeled as a terrorist organization by numerous international bodies, has explicitly stated its goal of replacing Israel with an Islamic state. This ideological underpinning is pivotal in analyzing the group's strategic approaches, including its stance on ceasefires. The argument posits that, given the upper hand, Hamas would likely not opt for a ceasefire unless it directly advanced their strategic goals, underscoring the group's commitment to its long-term objectives over temporary humanitarian considerations or diplomatic engagements."

I know there are some who dislike Israel and will never be satisfied with anything Israel does, no matter what.  
  
My point: Once I put those posts aside though, most of what I see (perhaps incorrectly) seems to be anger over the general idea of what is seen as an unending occupation of a people. I totally get that war is terrible and innocents die in virtually every war. (We can debate whether the number is being minimized or not, but the general idea that innocents are killed occurs.)  
  
What happened to Israel on 10/7 seems horrific on so many levels and I can't imagine the pain, fear, anger, and uncertainty that the residents of Israel experienced then and likely still feel today. There is no excuse for the killing of innocents and I do understand why Israel needs to eliminate Hamas to restore a sense of safety for the Jewish people.  
  
However, I am also struck by the fact that I have yet to see evidence of an endgame for Israel that would grant freedom to the people of Palestine. In most wars, we tend to accept casualties during hostilities but balk at occupation. The invasion of Iraq in early 2000s was generally supported by citizens of the US and many other (but by no means all) nations. However, after the hostilities, when the US didn't install a new government (or better yet, allow Iraqis to form one of their own choosing) but instead stayed, support fell and citizens of Iraq became increasingly disillusioned, angry, and resentful of what was seen (correctly I think) as an occupying force.  
  
I find myself torn on the war. On the one hand, I honestly want to support Israel in it's legitimate quest to get rid of a terrorist group that is threatening it. On the other hand, I can't get over the fact that there is no day-after for Palestine at the moment. It seems to me that if there was a stated desire and set of achievable conditions for a sovereign state for Palestine, it would be much harder for reasonable people to not side with Israel.  
  
A one-state solution (with full rights for all non-Jewish citizens currently living in Palestine) would also seem reasonable but I would think that might undermine the character of having a Jewish state. I would personally find it fine from the perspective of an outsider, but what I read (and perhaps it is wrong) is that this is generally seen as a non-starter in most of Israel. However, if that is preferable to those living in Israel, that would also work for purposes of my view.  
  
I don't claim to be an expert on any of this though so I hope to get educated as to other views. Thank you for taking the time to read this.  
  
If I have unintentionally offended with poor choices for words, I would appreciate if you let me know so I can become better educated on how to phrase things in a neutral fashion.

Regional airports are cheaper to make and cheaper to operate in pretty much any area besides some absurdly densly populated areas of the world - such as Japan. Even China's is actively losing tons of money due to how they built it to go out into their remote provinces.

Also they are fundamentally just fixed in where they service. If you want to expand the rail network you need to physically build a rail, if you want to change the city or airport being serviced by a airport, that is just administrative paperwork.

'Art is valuable because it's based on human emotions/experiences and AI art is created by soulless algorithms' is an argument I've heard more times than I can count - but it doesn't take into account a very basic fact: Humans are still the creators of AI art. It's generated based on human input and based on the emotions and experiences of its creator as much as any other kind of art.

""Almost all pieces of AI art that have ever been created were the product of bored idiots clicking a few buttons"" - the same is true for photos, yet I haven't heard anyone argue that photography can only ever create worthless art.

It was under Israeli rule that hamas began to grow and flourish. Under Israeli rule Hamas became wealthy enough to finance public projects like mosques and cultur centers, it also had welfare programs for the poor. It was under Israeli rule that hamas was able to become popular among the population.   
It was under Israeli rule that hamas was allowed to have real estate property, newspapers and TV channels.  
It was under Israeli rule when hamas was allowed to participate in elections.    
Immediately after Israli disengagement from Gaza in 2005-06, hamas miraculously seized power from the Palestinian Authority by force.  The weird thing is that the PA was armed and backed by Israel before the disengagement, one can only wonder where did hamas get the weapons to overpower the PA so soon (cough cough Israel cough cough).

In 2008 Israel launched a military operation in Gaza, only 2 years after the 'disengagement'. Wow, the same organization that Israel financed all those decades and that was allowed to seize power in Gaza turned out to be hostile and willing to engage un terrorism against Israel? Wow what a surprise, who could have thought?  

So now in 2008 Israel launched a military operation, and is going to remove Hamas from power once and for all , and bring back the friendly PA (another puppet of theirs from the West Bank)? Yes? Right? That's look like the sensible thing to do. Hamas was only in power for 2 years, on a territory that Israel governed since 1967, surely Israel can easily displace them, right?  
Except for some reason they don't. And then they will have another war in 2014, and now in 2024. Needless to say that those wars are hugely in Israeli favour with kill ratio of like 1 to 10, and it's usually thousands of Palestinians who find themselves displaced and not the Israeli ones, and in this latest ""war"" more than a million of Palestinians were displaced.  

And of course between those ""wars"" Israel constantly bombs Gaza, because somehow hamas is able to launch rockets from there, even though the territory under complete Israeli blockade and control. And of course those rockets that hamas launches have minimal impact, they maybe kill one person a year if at all, but Israeli bombardments as usual erase whole apartment blocks with many civilian casualties.   

And now we are suppose to believe that hamas was able to execute such a wide scale attack on October 7 that involved hundreds of militants, without Israeli intelligence knowing all about it?

238,2024-03-09,CMV: I think that the way humans have bred dogs is kinda fucked up,u/StaggeringWinslow,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1baodif/cmv_i_think_that_the_way_humans_have_bred_dogs_is/,changemyview,"I love hanging out with dogs, but I'm not comfortable with the selective breeding that we've done in order to produce most dog species. 

This is probably the weirdest opinion that I hold (I've never met anybody else who shares this opinion). But I think the logic makes sense. I'm aware that this is a subjective moral opinion, but I'm open to counterarguments. One of the key underpinnings of my perspective is that I think mammals, including dogs, are sentient beings deserving of moral consideration. 

OK, so let's start with pugs. A lot of people would agree with me when I say that the way humans have bred pugs is fucked up. We created an animal that leads a life of almost constant pain and misery - they die young, they can barely breath, they can barely *smell* (the primary sense for dogs), they're essentially crippled, they struggle to simply survive - and why did we create these wretched creatures? Because we think they look funny. That's it. They exist solely for our amusement. 

We didn't create pugs, as a breed, because we cared about the wellbeing of the animal, or because we respected the dignity of the animal. That was not, at any point, a consideration (although some people are trying to row this back with new breeds of pugs, and I admire that). We were simply trying to create an animal that looks funny to us. I think this is profoundly fucked up. 

But then we can extend this logic. Look at chihuahuas. They are famous for behaving kinda... strangely. 

Imagine if an alien species abducted a bunch of humans, with the aim of breeding a tiny little version of a human. Eventually, they manage to produce a subspecies of humans that are 1/20th the size of a normal human - 1 foot tall humans with tiny little bodies, with tiny little legs, with tiny little brains. With skeletature so deformed that their eyes protrude out of their skulls. That breed of humans, with their tiny brains and fucked morphology, would undoubtedly behave in really bizarre ways. They might be oddly aggressive and deranged. We would, rightly, assert that those humans had brain damage. If we apply this to humans, it sounds like a horror movie. But when we apply it to chihuahuas, most people just say ""hahaha look how weirdly this dog behaves"". 

We can extend this logic further. Look at pointer breeds. We've created animals that, when they detect a certain scent, feel an overwhelming urge to contort their body into a certain shape. Why? Because it benefits humans. These animals were created primarily to serve as tools for humans. The wellbeing of the dog itself was not really a consideration. Imagine that an alien species bred humans until they exhibited this behaviour - humans that felt an overwhelming urge to contort their body into a particular shape when they detected a particular smell - for the sole benefit of the aliens. That would be a fucking horror movie. 

Dogs love humans, but they love humans because we specifically bred them to love humans. There's something deeply disturbing about that. Creating an animal that instinctively wants to adore us, and then cooing when it adores us? I don't find that cute. Again, let's go back to the alien analogy. If the aliens selectively bred humans until they had a subspecies of human that feel instinctive, overwhelming love and affection towards the aliens; an intense desire to serve the aliens, to perhaps even sacrifice their lives for the aliens... is that cute? Or is it horrifying? 

The logic is less clear when we get to other dog species, like golden retrievers for example. But even they suffer health problems because of the way we bred them, and it's still the case that we bred them into a form that pleases *us*, with barely any consideration for the wellbeing of the animal itself. 

I don't hate dogs; I love them. But to TL;DR, I think it's fucked up for humans to selectively breed animals, with the sole goal of creating a creature that amuses/obeys/worships humans."

By salience I mean the conjunction of public interest in the issue and the degree to which the issue impacts the general public. Sugar tariffs, for example, are a low-salience issue. The US has high tariffs on cane sugar, in part because of intense lobbying by producers of corn syrup. As a result, corn syrup is widely used as a sweetener, because is is cheaper than sugar. I'd imagine that if you polled the American public, they would disapprove of this (foods made with sugar are generally considered to taste better than those made with corn syrup). Still, very few would attend a rally or switch their vote in an election based off this issue.  
  
Now let's look at a high salience issue: healthcare. It's almost a cliche amongst left-leaning Americans to point out that the US is the only industrialized nation without universal healthcare in some form, often with the implication that this is due political manipulation by the wealthy. But this reasoning excludes so many other factors that are more important. The US has majoritarian electoral institutions that force left wing voters to vote in coalitions with more moderate ones. We have a patchwork of institutions (Medicare, Medicaid, employer sponsored health plans, etc.) that give health coverage to the majority of Americans, thereby reducing the impetus for any universal insurance scheme. I think that Americans, by and large, are more predisposed towards individualism and laissez faire economics than people in many other countries.  
  
Money in politics is a convenient scapegoat. It's easy to blame the failure of any policy proposal on big oil, the defense-industrial complex, or whoever the latest bogeyman might be. But if you want to see real change, buying into this delusion that politics is just a game of wealthy donors picking their preferred policies off a silver platter, is self-defeating. There's only one way to gain and keep elected office, by convincing a majority of the electorate that they should pick you to represent them. It is voters, therefore, who are ultimately responsible for the state of American politics."

* Most Americans have negative overreactions to sex and nudity that are disconnected from any potential harm.
* While sex and nudity can cause harm, e.g. a flasher is sexually harassing people, not everyone who is nude is a flasher. Being able to differentiate nonsexual nudity from sexual nudity and from someone using nudity to harass is a skill most Americans lack.
* This lack of differentiation then gets scaremongered into overreactive policies and everyone being accused of being a sexual predator, in a similar way to 9/11 lead to random innocent people being accused of being terrorists and security theater becoming the norm, with the usual preoccupation with protecting 'normal Americans' from outsiders via norms and propriety - ""we don't do that here"" - rather than real harm reduction focused on real threats.
* Children are as usual weaponized as an excuse to police the actions of others, instead of teaching children age appropriate lessons about sex and nudity to prepare them for public life.
* Not talking openly about sexuality nor educating people beyond the mechanics of sex leads to many Americans not understanding what their own sexuality is and being unable to understand sensual, sexual or romantic expression and how these interact with the public realm.
* This becomes a cultural vicious circle: people are told nudity is bad, told that it's not normal, so they don't expect it, so they feel surprised and scared by it, so they feel it's bad.
* Younger Americans are often additionally hamstrung by absorbing discourse around private sexual consent that does not include the public sphere, leading them to think that they can 'not consent' to other people doing things they don't want to see. Combined with young people's general distaste for older bodies, this becomes ""that old person is creepy"" as code for accusing them of sexual harassment.
* Some in the US kink communites have tried to assuage the fears of the average American, unfortunately lending them further confidence that they are correct because the kink community 'agrees' with them, ignoring that this came from pragmatism.
* The US rightwing are even more poisonous with their fears about sexuality, even going so far as thinking dancing in public is evidence of pedophilia if they think the dancing is too sexy (or black).
* People in other countries are also just as bad as the US or worse; this post isn't saying *only* the USA has issues with puritanism.

in my mind, someone who isn't L G B or T, and is only asexual doesn't experience the same institutional oppression as someone whos identity does fall under the LGBT umbrella. i do believe they are a marginalized group that experiences oppression from almost every direction (since neither queer nor non-queer people seem fully accepting), and i do believe they deserve community and that said community has MAJOR overlaps with the queer/LGBT community, but it relates to (part of) why i feel intersex people aren't inherently queer either: if you are not L G B or T, and look the role, you are most likely not going to have the same issues as the LGBT community. if you can go out, live your life, dress as yourself, kiss your spouse, get married, adopt, etc etc with no repercussions/discrimination, i don't feel like we're fighting the same battle here.

i have no problems with aro, ace, or intersex people identifying as queer for the record (i am using ""non-queer"" to refer to people outside of the LGBT community due to subreddit rules). the argument of them stealing resources from ""real"" queer people is garbage, and there's no such thing as being ""queer enough"". but to me, if you still identify as straight, you do not experience the same things as an LGBT person does. i may be biased due to recent mass discrimination against queer people in my country, but it feels like discrimination against aro/ace people is different from discrimination against LGBT people. **it is real, and absolutely a problem that needs to be addressed.** i am by no means trying to say asexual people don't have their own issues (that's actually my whole point, they DO have their own issues! from the hypersexualization of society to the fact non-queer women are expected to have kids to the stigma around virginity to the SA ace people face, there's so much they face that's EXCLUSIVE to them), just that they don't have the same overlap as LGBT issues do. 

to me, it feels like a group that's fighting for their right to NOT be sexual is inserting themselves into a group fighting for their right TO be sexual and it just. doesn't make sense. we can all be friends and hang out, but there is a difference here and it really makes it harder for queer people to fight for our rights when you suddenly have an influx of people going on about gross gays kissing at pride and no kink at pride. idk y'all. i want so badly to understand and accept ace people as a part of our community since this seems like the popular opinion, but it just doesn't make sense to me"

The court have made the argument stronger by reaching the merits and saying Trump never engaged in insurrection. Under the Brandenburg standard, incitement requires directed to producing imminent lawless action. The Colorado courts erred in bringing up older statements from Trump before January 6th and giving them too much, in one case bringing up a 2016 campaign rally statement. It's difficult to claim any statements made weeks or months or in some cases years before January 6th were imminent. The Colorado courts also erred in concluding some of the things he said on January 6th were engaging in insurrection. They bring up numerous statements, which didn't call for any lawless action at all. The Supreme Court should have said under the Brandenburg test, nothing Trump did was incitement and Trump did not engage in insurrection.

[https://youtu.be/igBvtzs0m6k](https://youtu.be/igBvtzs0m6k)

Honestly, I am just more interested to hear how those who support the IDF defend this video as it shows an IDF soldier openly bragging to other soldiers about how he killed an unarmed civilian hiding behind his bed and they high five and congratulate him. 

I always thought that some rogue IDF soldiers were bloodthirsty and looking for revenge (and the IDF was giving them impunity to do so). But I wondered whether most of the soldiers on the ground (or even those doing air strikes) killing civilians believed that they were hitting genuine military targets. For example when IDF soldiers stormed Al Shifa, I thought it was possible that those soldiers genuinely did think it was a Hamas military base. But then again, I always found it hard to believe that the snipers firing at anyone who entered or exited Al Nasser hospital thought that was necessary. 

But regardless after seeing this footage and what was shared on the 72 virgins uncensored telegram channel, I think this gives a real insight into how the IDF regards Palestinian civilians when they think the cameras are not rolling. It's honestly it's disgusting how they celebrate and high five each other know that he just killed a defenceless helpless man who was pleading for his life. Just fucking disgusting.

My university degree is in history, so I'm familiar with concepts of historiography, how history is constructed, etc. But I studied later eras so maybe I'm missing something?

But the basic argument seems to me to be ""things were different in different places so we can't use a single term to describe it."" I don't buy it. Slavery functioned differently in 19th century Brazil and 19th century United States - can we not use the term slavery anymore? Colonialism worked differently in the New World vs. Africa, vs South Asia. Can we not use the term colonialism because of that?

My arguments:

1) Clearly there were commonalities between the the economic and political systems of various regions in Western Europe in the years 1000-1500 (or pick whatever range of years you want if you disagree with those specific years.  
  
2) These systems had enough in common to be seen as distinct from systems used in other parts of the world at the same time. For example, Medieval England and the Holy Roman Empire had much more in common than Medieval England and Song China.  
  
3) These systems were distinct from systems used in the Roman and post-Roman times in Western Europe that predated it, and distinct from early modern systems that came after.  
  
Therefore it seems reasonable to have a broad term that encompasses the economic and political systems used in Western Europe in the years 1000-1500. And it's okay to use the term ""feudalism."" While at the same time we can acknowledge that the term is imprecise, and differences occurred across time and geography from an idealized model of feudalism. "

48,2024-03-09,CMV: Astrology-believers claim a uniquely toxic discursive space and should be called out more,u/deville5,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bav8fm/cmv_astrologybelievers_claim_a_uniquely_toxic/,changemyview,"Socially, romantically, intellectually, and professionally, I find the widespread interest in Astrology (meaning horoscopes, readings, and star-charts based on Zodiac signs; NOT Vedic or Chinese) to form a unique style of intellectual/relational social discourse that is toxic and off-putting.  It is a religion that does not call itself a religion, a belief system that obnoxiously injects itself into conversations in ways that other belief systems do not.

I have not once, not even one time, after having diverse friends and peer group that include many Indian and Chinese people, heard an Indian or Chinese person, deeply familiar and into their own form of astrology, bring it up in conversation in a tone/context that assumes that everyone else at the table believes in it, too.  Why would they do that?  What I have observed more than once is a white person who is into Astrology lecture an Indian or Chinese friend on their own culture, because, let's face it, educated Indian and Chinese Americans are extremely unlikely to actually defend their systems scientifically.  

""But everyone knows that Signs aren't scientific,"" you might say, ""it's a belief system and everyone knows that.""  No, everyone does NOT know that.

Within a diverse peer group (many backgrounds, many religions) the number of times someone has brought up reincarnation or karma casually as an explanation for events: zero.  Number of times people have brought up Jesus as an explanation or solution: zero.  This despite many devote Hindus, Buddhists, and Christians being among us.  There's etiquette.  If you bring up your faith-based perspective, you do it in a qualified way.

But number of times someone has dropped in, in professional contexts sometimes with significant stakes in the decision being discussed, ""Well, what are his signs?  You need to be careful with that.""  Or the simple, seemingly innocent question, ""What's your sign?""  when meeting someone new.   
 Thousands.  Not exaggerating.  Comes up several times a week.

I'm sick of it.  For many of us, being asked ""what is your sign?"" feels similar to being asked, ""So, do you have Jesus?"" or, ""What do you know about your past lives?""  No-one asks that in my professional and social circles.  Newsflash for people reading this who are into Astrology: a LOT of us, all around you, strongly believe that there is absolutely nothing to this, and we would be willing to respect your beliefs more, and depending on how often you bring it up, YOU more, if you offered the same courtesy and qualification that other religious/spiritual belief systems offer, where you don't bring them up as predictive, descriptive, or otherwise 'real' around culturally diverse peers.  

**Change my view:** people into Astrology who casually bring it up all the time and believe in it as a pseudo-science should be called out and shamed as intolerant and obnoxious until they start shutting up about their essentially religious beliefs the same way the rest of us do.  And white people lecturing Indian people about how Vedic astrology is 'actually real' should be shamed as committing racist micro-aggressions (although, in my experience, there's nothing 'micro' about it).  It's so annoying, day in and day out, first date after first date, awkward work meeting after awkward work-meeting.  ""What's your sign?"" is not an innocent question.  It's a probing question, full of assumptions, that assumes that I share what is, in world-historical terms, actually a pretty obscure religious belief system.  In my experience, in the diverse communities I am a part of, no-one else does this at scale or regularly.  Is there an argument, perhaps, for why beliefs in the predictive power of Zodiac signs actually SHOULD hold this privileged space, SHOULD be brought up outside of the usual decorum/qualification that accompanies religious beliefs?  I'm all ears.  I'm kind of miffed about this right now, and being less angry is always nice.  "

I’ve used the search bar and read through some of them. But I didn’t see anything specific to what I’m talking about.

If someone is in danger of something caused by nature, or something that was merely just an accident, then that’s outside the scope of what I’m referring to. I’ll also add that someone who has accepted a position of responsibility, like a police officer or parent, is outside my scope.

Basically, if say someone is being attacked or robbed, I don’t have a moral responsibility to step in and do anything about it, even something as simple as calling the police. I don’t have any responsibility to stop the crime. The only one who has a responsibility to stop the crime is the one committing the crime.

I came to this view when reading others’ points in other discussions. There were discussions around if someone walks in an alley at night and gets attacked, do they have any responsibility. Basically some people were saying that they shouldn’t be walking in the alley at night. It’s basically the same as saying people are responsible to lock their doors at night. On the other hand, there were points that if someone attacks you at night in an alley, they are solely responsible. And that makes more sense to me. We can say that it’s not realistic to think it’s safe to walk in an alley at night, or to expect that there won’t be dangerous people out there. But that’s not the point of the argument. 

I’ll add that the whole “walking alone in an alley at night” example was brought up in regards to how some women may dress, and that if they aren’t dressed modestly, they shouldn’t be offended if they get catcalled. But then the opposing argument is that a woman is not responsible for the actions of another, and that makes more sense to me.

So if one were to be attacked in an alley at night, we wouldn’t blame them for making the choice to walk the alley at night. We would blame the attacker. Similarly, if a bystander could’ve stepped in, even called the police, but chose not to, we wouldn’t hold them responsible for the crime.

Now perhaps there is some compatibility between the two ideas of someone being responsible to take caution to protect themself and an attacker being responsible for their own actions, as well as a bystander being responsible for their choice not to call the police. I’m not sure. But someone wouldn’t have to protect themself and someone else wouldn’t have to step in if people don’t attack. So the attackers are the ones solely responsible for the attack occurring.

Of course, I do have some cognitive dissonance with this view because I feel I would step in if someone is being robbed or attacked. But perhaps I’m not motivated by moral obligation. To add all this, this view goes squarely against the mantra of the namesake of my username. So maybe someone can change my view. Thank you!"

Now to counter the arguments for these ads:

# Ads work, they lead to increased sales

This is generally true, but that still doesn't take away the fact that in many situations a person watching an ad, either for the first or the 1000th time, it does not lead to the person buying the advertised product. For example if a guy sees an ad that is only relevant for women he will never ever buy the product, even if he sees the ad a 10000 more times. All this is not to say ads don't work because they do, but they don't work in every single situation of a person watching the ad. Let's say ads work 50% of the time, then the other 50% are a waste of everyone elses time.

# Youtube and content creators need to make money

Yes, but should the only options be an overpriced subscription OR stupid ads? I think there should be a third option: pay an amount of money per video, or maybe per minute that you watch a video. This, or something similar, will ensure that you pay proportionally to how much you use the service. Also content creators can make money from receiving donations from their viewers, so ads and subscriptions might not even be necessary.

\---------------

# My agrument against those ads:

1. Ads work, but not well enough to justify the downsides. Some more people will buy the product, at the cost of everyone else who got their time wasted watching stupid ads.
2. The amount of time people spend watching ads is worth much more than the amount of money that was made by those ads. By watching a 30 second ad I pay with 30 seconds of my time. Assuming a €20/hour wage, my 30 seconds would be worth € 0,17. But how much money does a youtuber get from someone watching their video? About € 0,01, yeah fuck that. So instead of paying 30 seconds of my time which then gets the youtuber 0,01, I would rather just pay.. € 0,02 of my money directly. I don't want to watch stupid ads. There is the option for a subscription but it is overpriced, especially if someone doesn't watch many videos, so no. I really wish there was the option to just pay a small amount of money PER VIDEO instead of paying with your time.
3. Time is inherently valuable, money is not. If I pay someone my money, they will have that money and in total nothing is lost. If I pay someone my time, it will not always result in them having more time. If I pay a youtuber 30 seconds of my time by watching an ad, the youtuber will not have 30 seconds longer to live. The 30 seconds are not moved to another person, they are just gone. All the youtuber gets is €0,01 which comes from the advertising company. So by watching an ad: time, a valuable resource, gets wasted. Ads make this world less productive.

# If ads can't be gone for good, they should at least be less repetitive.

I see an ad 999 times and get very, very, very, pissed off because at that point its not tolerable anymore. When TV starts showing commercials, I immediately hit the mute button because I'm fed up with all those stupid ads that ive already seen a thousand times.

If ads repeated themselves less often there would also be more space for more new ads, which will be more productive both for the advertiser and the person watching tv/yt

# View:

Paying an amount of money based on how much you watch is a better alternative than an overpriced subscription or having to waste time which is a valuable resource. If its not objectively the best option, it is still an option that should be there as a third.

Note that watching ads costs you money too. When you are watching an ad, your phone/computer/tv is using electricity for no productive reason."

Before IVF, infertile folks... for obvious reasons... were less likely to pass on the genes for infertility, but now, with IVF, we are selecting for this trait and concentrating it in the human gene pool. Folks talk about reduced fertility in modern populations... certainly IVF is one factor?

For the same reasoning that governments limit cousins marrying to protect from genetic conditions, it may be wise to limit IVF too to prevent further promoting human infertility! Though if human depopulation is a lofty goal for stopping climate change and such, this could be a good thing. Maybe IVF is ironically a conspiracy to reduce the human population, not increase it!

It also possible for two religions to both hold an equal likelihood of being true compared to each other, while the other religions have a lower likelihood of being true.

*now for the good part*

The first logical rule to this process, and axiom for my hypothesis is that all religions are essentially non-falsifiable belief systems. However, not all non falsifiable belief systems are equal which I will demonstrate using the same argument that Plato used to argue for his world of forms. 

 The internal consistency and internal logic of the belief system itself. Some religions are more internally consistent than others. Some contradict themselves quite often. Some much less. If a religion does not have an internally consistent belief system, it cannot be correct. And if a Religions belief systems and moral values cannot be applied to every possible situation than arises, it is also much less likely to be correct. Every major religion today lacks the internal consistency and applicability that neoplatonism offers, and therefore neoplatonism is most likely to be the correct one (unless you are an atheist, which is not a part of this conversation because it is not a non falsifiable belief system, it is simply a belief system which only believes in things that are objectively proven.)

I treat people with respect until they disrespect me. People often tell me that I am too nice. Like so nice, that I have been bullied at every job I have ever had because I am perceived as weak.

My first girlfriend that I had when I was 17, cheated on me with an older man and then told me it was my fault because I wasn't good in bed. I was a virgin before I slept with her. 

I got into a serious relationship at 19, with a guy who was 29. It was long distance the first year of dating. AFter that year, I moved 700 miles away from home to live with him and he was very manipulative and disrespectful. He wouldn't allow me to hang out with anyone else, unless they were one of his friends. Also, after I got with him, he admitted that he liked drama, after initially telling me that he wasn't into drama. He would constantly pick fights and he sometimes said racist shit (Im black and he is white) like, "" I know you are going to leave me for a fat white girl because that is what all black men want"".

&#x200B;

I broke up with him after I turned 22.. 4 years later, I met a woman who was WAY older than me and we got together. We were on again, off again for like 2 years. She would often make fun of me for being bi. She also told me one day that she was just using me for sex. She also was extremely immature.

I say all that to say this...I don't know why I keep attracting these shitty people. I know that I am not perfect either but I didn't deserve the behavior I have gotten. I have also dated several more people than the ones I have mentioned.

The right to defend yourself refers to the right of someone innocent to prove their own innocent in order to be avoid being unjustly imprisoned - the idea that a criminal also has a ""right"" to escape the consequences of their own actions by lying is absurd.

> 2\. A person is innocent until proven guilty.

Again, this rule exists to protect innocent people from being witch-hunted without any proof. I don't see how it obligates you to pretend that someone you know to be guilty is actually innocent, or why you should convinice other people that it's the case. Like if you see someone murder a person in front of your own eyes but they don't get convicted, are you supposed to just go ""oh I guess I have to treat him like he's innocent even though I know he's a murderer cause they never managed to prove it."" Of course not. 

> 3\. We need this in order to keep the legal system working; if defendants can't trust their lawyers, the legal system breaks down.

My issue with this is that this wouldn't cause any issues for any actual *innocent* defendents at all; they would feel no obligation to distrust their defense lawyer because they would have no information to disclose that would cause their lawyer concretely believe they're guilty. It's actual criminals who would be in trouble here; they would no longer be able to say ""so I murdered this person this way, what's the best way for me to not get caught."" Instead they would be forced to lie to their lawyers, which actually benefits the criminal justice system because it weakens their case, meaning the system is able to catch more criminals and be more accurate in that sense.

So in conclusion a defense attorney refusing to defend people they know are guilty wouldn't harm any actually innocent defendants and would allow more criminals to go to prison. Therefore they have a moral obligation not to do so. Am I missing something here?"

And if they somehow find the courage to do so AND  get decent police and law enforcement to actually help them their offenders are only going to get a few year’s prison at most


Schools won’t teach sex and consent and respect because apparently educating children on safe sex is the same as sexual abuse (that’s bullshit)


Thus sex offenders get away with what they do and no politician is prepared to put any real consequences for sex crimes

(Whether it’s because the politician is a sed offender themselves is unimportant because there are enough people in politics they can’t all be sex offenders)

I want to see some real consequences for rapists pedophiles and sexual offenders 

Not to mention those hypersexual incel communities that teach young boys it’s normal to objectify women (it’s not)

And whatever the equivalent is that teaches young girls to objectify boys (that’s also wrong)

Sexual crimes for all genders need to be punished more severely 

Or better yet prevented from ever happening in the first place 

And I don’t know what or when anything will change to ensure this

No matter where I look it’s excuses on all sides 

When will this change?

I offer the following lesser-known counterarguments that I believe make this moral superiority subjective at the very least, just like that of religion.

1. A vegan diet poses an inconvenience to the non-vegan majority that dines with them.

2. A vegan diet does not reconcile with the magnitude of animal husbandry to human civilisation.

3. A vegan diet makes life more difficult than it already is for many people, and is impossible for some to adopt.

4. A vegan diet ignores the ceremony of meat and animal products in catalysing human festivities.

5. A vegan diet debilitates oneself from a fundamental life pleasure.

It’s important to note that I am not attempting to say justify that veganism should not be practised, but merely offering counterarguments for when moral superiority is proclaimed.

Humans, unlike ai, can put real emotion into their art and depict abstract concepts fairly well.

AI, unlike humans, can create very realistic pictures in a very short amount of time and thus depict concrete concepts fairly accurately.

An example to explain this better; 

I like to create characters and write for fun. While I usually draw my characters myself, I've always wanted to have a realistic character. But I can't draw realistically. I don't want to base the character off of an actual human either, because then I'd associate said human with my character any time I see them and that's not fair to them. 

I also already have an idea of what this character would look like in mind - in fact, I've had this idea for years. I can't even use an actual human as the model for them if I wanted to anyway, as they're quite unique but not in an inhuman way - aka, there's no photos of someone that looks like the idea I have. Only recently, I typed the description in my head into an AI art generator. And it worked amazingly. 

But at the same time, given what has been said about AI art by actual artists out there, I'm not sure if it's a good idea to use AI at all. So I decided to post here. Am I right in viewing AI art as a tool to turn ideas into images that otherwise would just be stuck in our heads?"

Bureaucratic, economic and other measures do.",u/PenguinJoker,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bb5hct/cmv_violence_does_not_lead_to_peace_bureaucratic/,changemyview,"There seems to be a widely held view online that wars can only end with violence, or that peace is caused by violence. On the face of it, this view is illogical. Basic logic tells us that adding more of one thing (violence) cannot lead to its opposite (peace).

In proof of their view, many online cite World War 2, and say that it was only the total annihilation of Germany and Japan that led to peace. Therefore, violence causes peace.

This idea is wrong for a number of ahistoric reasons. Firstly, it's in the title. World War 2 was the second one. If total annihilation leads to peace then WW1 should have led to peace. WW1 was a catastrophic war that annihilated an entire generation, left Germany and the axis in ruins and led to their full capitulation to the allies. But! It did not lead to peace at all.

People seem to be very confused about how peace is created. Throughout most of human history, the annihilation of the enemy and their surrender led to MORE WAR later down the track. Within a generation, the war would begin again. This is exactly what happened with WW2, but it also covers the various other historical wars in Europe (eg France and England being at war for hundreds of years on and off).

I believe that our history classes have completely failed us, because they teach us about war rather than peace processes.

After WW2, it was the formation of the UN and the Benelux agreements (early precursors to the EU) that created peace in Europe. The reason peace failed after WW1 was that the League of Nations did not include Germany.

The EU, UN and Benelux were institutions that allowed countries to talk to each other in back channels to avoid war. In the EU example, they also established some of the benchmark criteria for peace: 

1. Economic codependency, particularly for the things needed to make war (steel, energy, etc)

2. Mass migration between countries, causing social and cultural exchange. E.g. Erasmus program where millions of Europeans exchange countries forming lasting friendships.

3. Organisation's superstructures - regional governments can supersede national government and therefore create a larger unified identity. This aligns perfectly with social psychology, which teaches us we love our own ""category"" but that categories are invented. E.g. A German can now identify as a European Citizen, rather than just a German national.

My explanation for peace explains current conflicts very well. Israel and Palestine have no freedom of movement or interdependence. Russia and Ukraine are not in a superstructure together.

Tl;Dr bureaucratic, economic, social and cultural connectedness are the precursors to peace. Violence doesn't cause peace. Bureaucracy does."

In the [2024 state of the union address](https://www.whitehouse.gov/state-of-the-union-2024/) Biden said:

>Women are more than half of our population but research on women’s health has always been underfunded.  

**Please address only Biden's claim about research on women’s health being underfunded. I am not interested in arguments about patriarchy, etc. Thanks.**

# Definition 1

What exactly do we mean by ""research on women's health""? The NIH defines

>“Women’s health conditions,” as defined in section 141 of the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (PublicLaw 103–43), include all diseases, disorders, and conditions:  
>  
>1. That are unique to, more serious in, or more prevalent in women  
>  
>2. For which the factors of medical risk or types of medical intervention are different for women or for which it is unknown whether such factors or types are different for women  
>  
>3. With respect to which there has been insufficient clinical research involving women as subjects or insufficient clinical data on women

&#x200B;

# Facts 1

83% of all medical research in the US is funded via NIH ([https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/budget](https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/budget)). The other 17% may be funded via private foundations and organizations, pharmaceutical companies and other for-profit entities, or via state and local governments.

&#x200B;

# Fact 2

While it is easy to find data on women's health research funding, NIH stopped reporting data on men's health research funding after 2019.

>NIH does not currently calculate or report annual funding associated with projects dedicated solely to men’s health or projects benefiting men and women.

Source: [Report of the Advisory Committee on Research on Women’s Health: 2021–2022](https://orwh.od.nih.gov/sites/orwh/files/docs/ORWH_Biennial%20Report_121823_1516_F_508c_Optimized.pdf)

This means that it is not possible to decide whether ""research on women’s health IS CURRENTLY underfunded"", but we can look at whether ""research on women’s health HAS ALWAYS BEEN underfunded"", as Biden claims. The NIH has provided this data for 2017, 2018 and 2019. For example, in 2017, the NIH budget was distributed as follows:

* Gender neutral research: 80% of funding.
* Women's health research: 14% of funding.
* Men's health research: 6% of funding.

Source: [Report of the Advisory Committee on Research on Women’s Health: 2017–2019, table 8, page 117.](https://orwh.od.nih.gov/sites/orwh/files/docs/ORWH_BiennialReport2019_20_508.pdf)

In other words, Biden was lying because at least in 2017, 2018 and 2019 **women's health research received more than double the funding compared to man's health research**. To make things worse, Biden vowed to increase this imbalance even further:

>That’s why we’re launching the first-ever White House Initiative on Women’s Health Research, led by Jill who is doing an incredible job as First Lady. Pass my plan for $12 Billion to transform women’s health research and benefit millions of lives across America! 

&#x200B;

# Fact 3

Funding of the reproductive & maternal care is certainly justified and will be always reported as women's specific research funding - but only about 7%-10% of the women's health research was in the ""Reproductive & Maternal/Child/Adolescent Health"" category.

Source: [Report of the Advisory Committee on Research on Women’s Health: 2017–2019, table 9, page 117.](https://orwh.od.nih.gov/sites/orwh/files/docs/ORWH_BiennialReport2019_20_508.pdf)

A lot of people apparently. This is a big hyper-fixation. Here are the common arguments I hear about it.

\- ""They use their unnatural physique to sell bad products and services"". OK fair enough. And people should be held accountable for that. However you should not buy a product that has not been proven to work at least somewhat just because someone looks a certain way. Especially when it comes to fitness. Be an adult

\-""BeAuTy StAnDaRDs"".

These people exploit your insecurities, yes. \*However\* your insecurities are the main source of the problem. 

And I do not say this in order to be smug or something. I am saying this because if this does not get addressed, someone else will exploit you on the future in a similar way, even if all fake natties disappear overnight.

\-""Children"". They have parents. Parents are responsible for whatever happens to their children. They should do their jobs and talk to them about how they do not have to abide by standards when they harm their health

Also, I do not consider ""Human nature"" or instinct a good enough excuse. We defy our instincts all the time. It is literally what defines our species. If we did not do that, we'd be extinct long ago."

Yes, they are likely to never find a relationship with such individual, but I think that is better than them lowering their standards, finding someone, and resenting them for who they are.

Maybe at some point they will just naturally realise that they can genuinely *enjoy* being with a normal human who understands and relates to them, and who they understand and relate to as well. But that would not be “lowering of standards” - i.e. they would just naturally realise they can find joy in and respect someone who is not unrealistically perfect.

While that is somewhat true and some moral standards are somewhat relative, I am pretty sure morality is somewhat objective based on the golden rule that you should treat others the way you want to be treated. People think this is just solely a Christian concept because many people are Western Christians, but people seem to forget that this lesson predates the Bible and the idea of treating others the way you want to be treated can be found in ancient Egyptian text (http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/saoc52.pdf), ancient Hindu text (https://web.archive.org/web/20230117102108/https://books.google.com/books?id=kzPgCgAAQBAJ), and even atheistic/nontheistic belief systems like Confucianism (http://ctext.org/analects/wei-ling-gong). All these different cultures on different parts of the globe that started at different time periods whether they were non-theistic, monotheistic, or polytheistic all kind of agreed to this golden rule. Probably not a coincidence that every single culture seem to agree to this moral code before you had more power hungry Kings, narcissists, and other individuals suddenly decide that this should no longer apply. There are even studies that say that some degree of our morals come from our DNA (https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/02/190225145632.htm).

Obviously there is some subjectivity when it comes to morality and there are situations that are morally gray or come into questioning so there is some degree of moral relativism, but to me all of this shows that morality is not completely subjective. Some degree of the idea of treating others the way you want to be treated seeped into almost every culture in humanity's early days and some degree of our genes, or the environment, or the universe or something gave us some type of steady basis for morality and to me, this seems to show that the idea of morality being 100% subjective is ridiculous!"

I can state with a high degree of certainty that the overwhelming majority of people have had a shorter or longer period in their lives during which they believed they were inferior, worthless, or undeserving of respect compared to others. For some, it's just a brief moment of self-doubt, while for others, it's a serious, life-destroying issue requiring prolonged treatment. I also believe that most individuals can overcome low self-esteem and lead a happy life through hard work on themselves, therapy, or the support of others.

However, unfortunately, there is a minority for whom low self-esteem accurately reflects who they are, how others perceive them, and their potential to achieve their dreams and life goals. Regardless of the time and energy they invest in improving their self-image, they constantly face failure. Their self-esteem simply reflects the harsh reality that, despite sincere intentions, they cannot change. They feel less intelligent because they truly are, believe they won't achieve happiness due to themselves and/or life circumstances, and think they cannot be loved because certain traits of their character, which they can't or don't know how to change, genuinely prevent it.

The best they can do is accept who they are, try to find coping mechanisms for this situation, and attempt to grasp as much happiness and peace in life as they can. Sometimes, the best we can do is reconcile ourselves with the fact that we may never overcome how we perceive ourselves.

P.S.

I believe that before concluding that things won't get better, one should try all possible ways to overcome low self-esteem (e.g., therapy, etc.). However, if despite multiple attempts and trying everything within our reach to improve how others and we ourselves perceive us, we don't succeed, it may indicate that low self-esteem simply reflects who we truly are, and we are unable to change it."

At least 6 states that I am aware of do not require CCW applicants to prove basic competency with a pistol in order to obtain it, including my home state of Washington, which I find surprising considering how liberal Washington state is and how many gun control laws they have passed recently.

If we let anyone who passed a criminal background check carry guns in public, then a couple of things could happen. If someone carrying a gun isn’t good enough with a gun, they might be unable to address misfires or jams in the heat of the moment and/or suffer from poor accuracy. Poor accuracy in a scary situation can lead to the carrier not taking down the bad guy, hitting innocent bystanders or both. If the person who is a poor shot survives an attack despite their lack of skill, they can be imprisoned for involuntary manslaughter should they accidentally kill anyone or face the social scorn and anger for being in a capacity to resolve a mass shooting but being unable to properly resolve it due to a lack of skill. “You could have stopped that mass shooting but because your accuracy is so poor my (insert loved one) is dead!”

First it’s unclear. The person, believing you to still be their friend, woll likely take whatever excuses you give at face value. They will continue to contact and try to make plans until it becomes clear you’re just lying and don’t want to associate with them anymore. So it doesn’t really spare their feelings.

Second it can often be manipulative. By not being clear that you don’t want to be friend it leaves the door open for you to take advantage of the lack of clarity. For example, I had a “friend” who began to distance themselves and reject my offers to hang out. I took the hint and stopped speaking with them. But then a year later they contacted me acting like nothing happened and that we were still cool. We spoke for a day or two, me thinking they were sincere when…they asked for a huge favor. It puts the person in a very unfair position.

Finally ending it sooner may hurt more but it also gives the person closure and lets them start to move on.

So overall I think it’s just a selfish move which allows the one wanting to end the relationship to face none of the negatives at the expense of the ex friends feelings. Then again I supposed they don’t really care about that person feelings.

Anyway, the idea I intend to use is the slave morality vs master morality.

Now to give a run down, and to avoid this post getting more rambly than needed:

Master Morality is when that which is ""good"" is whoever is the strongest, the mightiest; a high-brow version of survival of the fittest basically. 

Now slave morality is **reactionary** in nature —born out of resentment towards the Master morality — a roundabout way to gain power. A noticable trait of the slave morality is obligatory submission masquerading as virtuous submission.

Eg. A priest who supposedly denounces the pleasures of life, whilst the real fact is that the pleasures of life have denounced him instead.

A cliche example is the Early Christians taking on attributes like humility, godliness over might, in reaction to the oppressive Roman regimes.

The most important thing is that both — both the master and the slave — are still exercising their **will to power,** it's just that the slave has a subversive way of such exercise.
(The will to power can be defined as the main driving force in humans.)

With that said, what exactly does this have to do with maturity?

Well I'd start with a story:

I remember last week, a friend and I were discussing how on earth did the bullying traits and ultra-dominance we saw in secondary school, have all of a sudden, evaporated to nowhere in university.

Specifically, we were talking about the fact that people line up for things like money withdrawal at banks..etc. which stands in stark contrast to secondary school where the coolest frat guy can just override the lining up, or worse, extort whoever gets theirs, after the leg strain of standing in a line.

My friend being an optimistic lovey dovey(I'm not being sarcastic, I have a special place in my heart for optimistic people), proposed that the reason is cause:

1. People've outgrown such juvenile **impulses**
AKA, maturity
and

2. In a more contemporary context, fitting in with people you're ""lesser than"" is the new cool, as opposed to the cringeness of acting all high and mighty.

Now I immediately felt something was wrong, but with failure to articulate it in the moment, I postponed the conversation.

It was today it hit me what exactly I found wrong, and here it is:

Remember, there are ""top people"" there who are naturally supposed to override the line.

The question then is: why exactly do they choose to stand in a line? where did all those secondary school traits disappear into?

Following my friend's answer, we'd assume that they've outgrown it and become integrated members of society — a lot of people are ""integrated members of society"" — including rich people from a marxist perspective, your boss who holds your destiny in his hands, Hitler who massacred millions, Cartels who butcher people like pigs.

These are all ""top people"" — people in power positions — who control societies at large, and still, they've supposedly not ""outgrown""?

If can't be cause of maturity; everyone has left secondary school, including the top people of society that impose their power of you.

So Again, why so? Why don't this class of people impose their power?
I argue that the obvious reason is when the cute canine meets a much more humongous hound.

The reason is cause the decorum(a greater will to power) imposes itself upon those that line up, rendering them submissive and rendering useless their wills to power.

From the foregoing, remember when I said —*a noticable trait of the slave morality is obligatory submission masquerading as virtuous submission* ?— ""maturity"" is this case is a facade of virtue used to conceal that this isn't secondary school anymore, that there are bigger powers overriding your power.

Maturity is a backhanded acknowledgment of one's incapacitation of power."
1,2024-03-10,"CMV: Given the exact same circumstances, I think a very very large percentage of men would go towards inceldom.",u/Tall_Promotion_7160,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bbfayy/cmv_given_the_exact_same_circumstances_i_think_a/,changemyview,"Hear me out. First I want to clarify what an incel is. I think when people hear ""incel"" they freakout and assume Elliot Roger ""I want to kill every woman and chad"" is the typical incel. It should be clear that's not the case. I think the typical incel 100% has some problematic views of women, but not significantly more than your typical western man. I think assuming otherwise is a falacy. Because of this, I think it's fair to say that if you put all men in the same circumstances as an incel (i.e. 20 to 25 years old, never dated, never had a woman interested in them, unattractive and bullied for being unattractive etc.) a majority of men would end up closer to the incel side of things than not.

The main reason I feel this way is a misunderstanding of entitlement and how that harms people. I think the majority of people are what most anti-incel groups would label as entitled. Like if you took a poll and the question was ""Do you think you are deserving of a good partner that you are attracted to?"" The most common answer would be yes. That's a level of entitlement. In my experience speaking to both incels and anti-incels, this is the extent of what an incel needs to feel to be labeled entitled. OF course there are worse people like in every group, but I don't think I'd be off base to think that for the majority of ""entitled"" involuntarily celibate people, this is what they feel.

The thing, is it's reasonable to have this expectation as most people have it fulfilled. If you feel this way, and don't get it fulfilled you are in the extreme minority. It only becomes a negative entitlement is if you are in that minority. And if every man was in that position, they would not be doing well. They would feel the same emotions incels do because those emotions aren't unique or novel. Feelings of romantic or sexual isolation, undesirability, and immaturity hurt. Especially in your early 20s when you are (by societal standards) supposed to do that. The emotions incels feel aren't unique to virulent misogynists. They're emotions that most people just don't feel because of circumstance. "

I am totally opposed to using eugenics for the reduction or elimination of any racial group, selecting specific traits to try and achieve like blue eyes or a larger brain, or discrimination against/violence directed towards any groups of people. What I specifically believe could be beneficial is screening all prospective parents for hereditary genetic diseases so they can be aware of any potential risks, screening all embryos for genetic diseases, and terminating embryos that would result in a child with genetic abnormalities that compromise daily quality of life. There are many diseases that would fall under this category including muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, tay-sachs, Huntington’s disease, and Down syndrome. These diseases cause untold suffering to the people who are living with them, not to mention the strain on their families who often have to become caretakers and our medical systems which have to support them. By screening for these diseases in-utero, there could be a drastic reduction in the occurrence of these diseases among the general population. Families would not have to worry as much about being forced into caretaker roles they weren’t prepared for, children will get to grow up with healthier bodies, and our medical resources could be directed towards finding better treatments and even cures for people currently suffering from these diseases. If at some point simple and affordable cures for these diseases are created, then the screening process could become unnecessary. In the mean time though, doesn’t it make sense to do everything we can to minimize human suffering through the tools we currently have? To me, knowing allowing a child to be born who would suffer a terrible disease is cruel since that child had no choice in being brought into the world, but their parents would have had the choice to prevent their suffering. I’m interested to hear what others think on this topic."
112,2024-03-10,CMV: Democrats are in trouble if Republicans can successfully appeal to minority voters,u/Ok_Spell1407,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bbgewn/cmv_democrats_are_in_trouble_if_republicans_can/,changemyview,"One of the biggest worries Democrats have for the 2024 election is that they can no longer take minority voters for granted. Their grip on minority voters was always much more lose than democrats believed. For example, I think that Hispanic and Black voters see political correctness and social liberalism in a worse light than, say, suburban women. Hispanics don't like when the left tries to force terms like ""Latinx"" on them. Black voters overall do not appreciate the general lawlessness that Democrat run cities have allowed to occur. It's black owned businesses that suffer the most from it. Both groups are less supportive of the LGBT community than the population as a whole. So I think democrats relying solely on the ""Republicans are racist"" message to keep such a critical voting bloc with them is very risky. It's already starting to unravel.

Florida is a state where the Republicans have successfully loosened the Democrats domination of the minority vote. Florida is a state where normally, the demographics would be very unfavorable to the Republicans. It is a minority-white state with huge urban and suburban populations, and not too many large swaths of rural ultra conservative white areas besides the northwest. South Florida has so many Hispanics that some consider it part of Latin America. Suburban white areas, like parts of Jacksonville, Seminole County, and Pinellas County, have trended towards Democrats, mirroring a national trend. However, unlike most of the country, Republicans have made huge gains with urban minority voters in South Florida. Miami swung 20 points to the right between 2016 and 2020, and I expect it to swing another 10 points or so to the right in 2024 and go into Trump's column.

 This should terrify Democrats, because Florida is not dramatically different from other states with high minority populations. The main difference is the Florida Republican party has successfully rebranded itself from the party of socially conservative rural whites to the party of freedom, cultural traditions, and law and order. The fact that the Florida GOP has been able to effectively identify itself with Cuban and Puerto Rican voters and their traditions, combined with nonsense like people on the left pushing terms like ""Latinx"", has reduced the stigma of voting Republican in Hispanic communities. This strategy could be extremely effective in places like California, Arizona, Nevada, and Texas. And it shows just how much ground Republicans can gain with minorities. When Republicans flip the script like they have in Florida, they are the ones who stand to gain from demographic changes in our country. It is not limited to Florida. We're starting to see Hispanic South Texas shift into the Republican column. Majority-Black parts of rural North Carolina are shifting to the right, and those shifts may have been what got Trump over the finish line in 2020, and what may protect him in 2024. I see this as a developing and nationwide problem for Democrats. If they don't move to the center socially, they'll find a Florida situation on their hands nationwide. "

I’ll start by saying that I’m against nationalism of any kind. But, as a Jewish person.. I understand the desire for a Jewish state and I don’t think people who desire a two state solution have immoral views.. I respect this viewpoint. What I don’t feel has a moral defense is anyone justifying the way Israel came into existence, or its current actions. 

Rebuttals when I say this pretty much never tend to be ones about morals.. it’s always defenses based on fears and whataboutisms.. I’d love to hear a moral/ethical defense for the current state of Israel and its foundation. 

None of the following: 

1. You’re uninformed and stupid and silly and just trying to be trendy. Let me make fun of you for saying the wrong thing or bring up really specific obscure factoids to prove you don’t have good points 

2.  You got your info from social media!! (Even if the social media in question is like a long form documentary on YouTube) 

3. All the antizionist Jews have bad takes on other things so don’t listen to them 

4. I hate Bibi too!! I just support everything he does 

5. Sure Israel is bad, but Palestinians are worse 

6. Other countries do bad things too 

7. Something something Israel upholds good western values and Palestinians/arabs have bad values (which values do you mean exactly, and why do these values require the human rights violations of Palestinians.. is there even a net positive with the values? Does this mean you think Israel should take over the rest of the region so it doesn’t have “bad” values?) 

8. Indigenous/land back argument. Ignoring the fact most land back activists, myself included, agree that it is inhumane to deport current people living in a region. Even if you somehow could prove all of Jewish people around the world are indigenous to Israel and Palestinians aren’t (which, you can’t make that argument)… land back doesn’t mean what you think it means. It doesn’t mean behaving like Israel. 


I’d really love to hear one argument that supports their views from a MORAL and ETHICS standpoint. The closest we get to that is people saying it’s all necessary for the survival of the Jewish people…  which I guess is the hardest thing to argue against"

Well, I personally think that's messed up as telling a random immigrant you don't know who says America sucks to leave the country. I mean, here is my point: dealing with some of these moderators is like having Eric Cartman as hall monitor for the hallway that is free to use for everyone because Eric has successfully sucked a teacher's butt to become one. Let's say you are walking on the hallway listening to a classical music. Eric stops you and tells you to turn it off because it is 0.1db beyond the hallway rule. You know he is BSing because he personally hates classical music. However, you cannot do anything because he has the absolute power at the hallway. To make the matter worse, Eric is a pathetic person that is physically unfit, lacking friends, mentally unstable, and academically unsuccessful. Being picked on by someone like Eric via abuse of a power is not a pleasant experience.


I know by fact these hard core moderators that spend their entirety of their lives are pathetic people. Why? Because I am a pathetic person too. I recently lost my job and became a pathetic person with nothing to do and no friends to talk to. I found myself increasingly and increasingly spending time on reddit and discord. As a person who once had a job, I know it is impossible for a normal person to dedicate his life on reddit and discord. I mean let's face it, which of the following two is more likely to be a reddit / discord moderator? 1) a jobless highschool graduates living in parents' basement 2) a medical doctor working 80 hours a week.


To this day, I do not understand why some of posts get deleted. It's not surprising because they were probably deleted by a subjective reason by a stupid person. They also do not allow people challenging their authorities. Recently, I went to a forum website and saw a sitewide trending post accusing moderators of a subreddit being biased with screenshot evidence. I posted the post on the accused subreddit. Imagine what happened to the post? Deleted. Sigh...


Discord moderation is worse. Every single big servers I went basically has shitty things that reddit mods would do subtly proudly written under the rules. Some of such rules I have seen are: 1) absolute obedience towards to mods, 2) no crap talking about the server somewhere else, 3) no questioning on mods' decisions, etc... On top of all these, server owners will run illegal interactions on their servers and would demand donations from people who want to be part of the interaction."

I am starting to notice a similar thought pattern in myself with Joe Biden. If I were to only go based on what I've heard, then Joe is just a senile, dilapidated old man who can't lead, can't form a coherent sentence, he hates America, and has a weird thing for little kids and sniffing hair. It's so bad that I don't even notice much enthusiasm for him amongst liberals, and the extreme left seems to hate him for his role in the Israel-Gaza war.

But I would like to know if there is another side to the story. Is there a case to be made for Joe Biden (other than that he isn't Trump)? What are the good things and accomplishments he's made while in office? Thanks in advance."
1,2024-03-10,CMV: For AMABs sex is hard to get and fundamentally transformative,u/ImmanuelYemos,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bbiiju/cmv_for_amabs_sex_is_hard_to_get_and/,changemyview,"Note: For anyone potentially reading this. I have what I consider most likely to change my view listed at the bottom of this post

I believe for AMABs (assigned male at birth people regardless of their gender) sex is hard to get and fundamentally transformative. I think AFAB people (assigned female at birth people regardless of their gender) are uncomfortable with this fact, but it is a fact, and their uncomfortableness with this reality does not change it. I will refer to afab people as females for the rest of this post, and amab people as males for the rest of this post. 

Having sex is hard. I think probably the only real exception is females who want to have sex with males. And I think with a certain minimum reasonable standard it likely ends up being equally hard for them, but I am not sure about that.

I think sex is fundamentally transformative at least to amab people but maybe afab people too after you ignore a certain series of bad experiences. After having sex people become a lot more confident, kind, and less neurotic. 

Sex kind of induces an automatic movement of the body whereupon the higher brain functions temporarily cease, so people enter into a dissociative state whereupon they are unable to put on condoms and just shove the dick in immediately. Sometimes it enters the wrong hole due to this trance that occurs during the act. This is what people on Reddit say about why teen pregnancies occur.

It is possible that the sex trance is not something that happens above teen years, which is worrying for people who did not have sex at that age.

I believe this effect may be analogous to using mushrooms or similar drugs, and give a profound life changing experience. 

&#x200B;

Counterarguments I consider plausible

I think a potential argument against this might be that the transformativeness of sex may depend highly on the individual having sex. This is to say that for someone who waits until marriage, actually managing to get sex will have a major psychological impact on them. While someone who has sex first while drunk at a party when they are 14 may have little to no impact on them. In this scenario I feel from the perspective of the first person, especially if they didn't actively reject other sexual activities beforehand, or have any kind of moral view on sex before marriage, from their perspective sex was really transformative. 

Hardness of getting sex might in itself also be a product of intrinsic hidden standards someone has which affect what registers in their minds as sexual opportunities. I think if this is the case it applies to afabs too, but some males might be aggressive enough that they are not able to simply not acknowledge the ""opportunity"" as existing even if it is utterly repulsive, as most amab people would.

I do broadly agree with this notion. Nonetheless, the election system (as it stands) is a not-so-thin veil to conceal larger failings that are not addressed by nationwide polls.   


I think the failure of the election system mainly stem from symbolizing specific parties or politicians as certain issues or solutions. For example, Trump is viewed as a white supremacist, racist e.t.c.  
Although this characterization might be true, there is certainly a deeper challenge in the American society towards freedoms and immigrants. Voting for Trump or otherwise does not address these problems or put the country on a trajectory against these challenges. Such embedded issues within society are not determined by specific parties, but are rather symbolic. Furthermore, I would rather have decision makers in the country be as close to a normal employee as possible and not a celebrity. The character or charm of the decision-maker should be a secondary consideration, in my opinion.   


Another reason I view such elections to fail in achieving a “true” democracy, is how voters have little choice in the entire system. The voters in most countries vote once every 2–6 years, which seems a very long time frame. Furthermore, the choices are extremely low resolution. From choosing a certain party out of a few of them does not mean your opinion is well represented. Also, it seems that the political parties are engaged in a certain type of game where they try to balance the likelihood of being voted-in against personal self interests of acquiring power or advancing in their career. Remember, the original goal of such a system is to fairly represent the will of people. This seems to take now a second place to the “game”.    


Of course, there are more catastrophic issues such as lobbying which make wealthier people have more of a say. However, I do not think that lobbying is an intrinsic problem of the system and could be dealt with in the current form of democracy. 

 I do believe that giving citizens a say in a nationwide poll does not guarantee that their will is actualized. I think democracy could be better achieved by utilizing the people's true bargaining chip,   which is their labour. Civil disobedience, strikes e.t.c (if done collectively) would put the decision makers in a tougher spot since their job is dependent on how people comply with their policies and decisions. I believe collective worker action would force the decision makers to balance the public's needs rather than personal or lobbyist's ambitions.

Ultimately, every person knows deep down if what they are doing is cheating when they do it. If you have to go through a bunch of mental gymnastics to justify it, then it's cheating it.

My girlfriend has a Chase credit card with a picture of Darth Vader. I told her she's showing supporting fascism. Indeed, I think people that show support for the empire should have more social backlash, because at least they didn't understand Star Wars.

1- It's fine to like Anakin, as he's the main character of the first three movies. Obviously he eventually becomes bad, but you understand why.

2- The empire is a metaphorical representation of the regime that rule Germany during the 30s and early 40s. The empire does bad science experiments, they build weapons of mass destruction, and make people to live in a totalitarian regime, although it's obviously hard to enforce the totalitarism across the galaxy. Liking the Imperial March, using t-shirts of the Darth Vader, and other Empire representations is showing support for the worst of mankind.

3- Representing villains isn't always bad. The issue here is that the empire is a metaphor for the worst of mankind, something we sweated we would never repeat. Wanna a Thanos t-shirt? Fine. But not Darth Vader, as Thanos isn't a metaphor for something super bad in our reality.

Neither side appears to trust government, or the media- if we did we wouldn’t be worried about elections, fraud, or propaganda. Both sides are concerned for their communal safety and security (which is threatened first and foremost by our own elected leaders, and secondly by influence and invasion from outside forces.)

We care about the same things, is what I’m saying. And we both seem to agree that we definededly disagree on Key, Vital issues; like Sex, Race, and Mythology.

But those are issues that are Thousands of Years old! We haven’t solved them yet, yet they’ve always been around, and still they have never ripped civilization completely asunder (unless you count the wars and genocides). Do you honestly believe the reason we haven’t solved these problems is because one side is right and good, meanwhile the other is wrong and evil? Or do you think it’s complicated?

TBH, frankly, I don’t even think we disagree on these issues, that much, depending on how you define the word “We”.

We all (the We who are dissatisfied) want more than we have. The truly content probably don’t vote or trawl reddit feeds; They know that politics is a poison and tiktok is a dopamine button. But We who want more believe that Others stand in our way, and that the enjoyment of the world’s splendor is a human right.

We like our identities, and our individuality. That means we belong to the ‘right’ group, but also that we cherish personal freedom.

We all take offense at unfair treatment, or people putting their fingers on the scales. We’ve all heard history, and seen real life in action. We all, for some reason, think that a single person hired to a four-year contract makes any discernible difference in our abilities to seek out and fulfill our personal dreams.

Politicians have made us angry with ourselves. We argue with neighbors and family… the lesson I’ve taken from Flat Earth is that it’s dumb to argue. The challenge is hearing an opposing proposal and not seeking its weak points.

Stop asking, “What’s the worst that could happen?” The answer to that is infinitely terrible, and certain to come true if you scream about it long enough. Instead ask, “What’s the best I can make of this?” This answer may not be as boundless as the other, but it always results in a better and brighter tomorrow.

If I could completely see your side, and you mine, we’d have a clearer picture of the Real. Listening to and fixating on the talking points and the atrocities only causes us to become myopic. Politics is the sickness and the only antidote is direct, human communication across the spectrum. But maybe I’m wrong about that.

I know there are myriad counter-examples, so I’m curious to see if any are persuasive. But to be clear about my perspective: Democracy is flawed but fixable, if civilians are willing to do the work of communicating with their antagonists."

183,2024-03-10,CMV: The US is not ready for a peer/near peer war of attrition,u/yogfthagen,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bbmz86/cmv_the_us_is_not_ready_for_a_peernear_peer_war/,changemyview,"During Desert Storm, the US philosophy was, ""If you can see it, you can hit it.  If you can hit it, you can kill it.""  The US war on Iraq in 1991 was the first widespread use of precision guided weapons, and those weapons went a very, VERY long way to bringing down the Iraqi military. PGMs made up something like 3% of weapons dropped from aircraft, but accounted for 40% of targets destroyed. They definitely proved their usefulness. 

If anything, the biggest issue was knowing where the targets were.  The Great Scud Hunt in the desert was the culmination of large numbers of deployed jets and helicopters searching out hidden targets, then destroying them.  Once they were seen, they were basically dead.  

Since then, the use and availability of drones has made it so that the entire battlefield can be seen. Both sides can see basically everything, and based on the US adage, everything can now be targeted.  With appropriate inventiveness, a lot of those weapons are also using cheap, readily available drones with common, low power explosives to knock out high value targets.  A hand grenade dropped in the hatch of a main battle tank.  A mortar shell tied to a drone blowing up an almost-unique AWACs aircraft.  Simply flying a drone into a jet inlet and releasing a hand grenade is enough.  Driving a done boat loaded with explosives under a bridge to take out a major target.  Drones are everywhere.  

Even more, the ubiquitous nature of all these drones means that targets are much more plentiful, and that requires using a LOT more weapons. 

That's the issue.  The number of weapons needed. 

The US military has (some of) the most advanced weapons ever created.  Unfortunately, that means a number of those weapons are so expensive that the number produced was ridiculously low, especially for what they were.  The US made 187 F-22 Raptors, when the initial target was around 2,000, and those aircraft are basically not maintainable if they suffer serious damage.  We literally do not have the plans to rebuild many components, any more.  The F-35 has a build rate of about a hundred a year, for all purposes.  The B-2 has two dozen copies, total.  

Those numbers are ridiculously low for a full scale, long term war.  

The closest analogy might be the dreadnought war during WWI.  Battleships were the most powerful weapons in the world, but they were so rare, so expensive, and so valuable, they were almost never used.  The same can be said of a US carrier battle group in contested areas.  A carrier battle group would likely not be able to survive more than a week in a hot war in the South China Sea.  Which means it's not possible to USE it, unless you're willing to sacrifice it.  And building its replacement will take about 10 years. 

A weapon that is so valuable that it cannot be used is a useless weapon.  

Weapons procurement is also ridiculously low.  The Russians are currently firing a couple million artillery shells a year.  They have burned through decades orth of production in two years, and had to resort to buying shells from North Korea. All of NATO, on the other hand, can not produce ONE million shells in a year.  Production rates are expected to grow in the next few years, but will still be severely resource-constrained.  

The US and NATO weapons are absolute marvels.  But there's not enough of them to keep UKRAINE supplied, let alone deal with a hot war with a country whose economy is bigger than Italy. 

But unless the weapons can be produced at breakneck speed, with the understanding that they're EXPENDABLE, they're not going to be useful. 

Change my view- The US needs to develop cheap, mass-produceable, expendable weapons right now, even if those weapons do not have the same capabilities as current weapons."

Orban is pretty good with Putin so no foul there. Hungary is not on his map.

Russia is in a war time economy and they are decimating Ukraine without even a full mobilisation. He’ll probably start to escalate around Kaliningrad to see how NATO will react.

There are two options:

1.	⁠NATO doesn’t respond because they don’t want WW3 over Estonia. NATO disassembles because no one trusts in the safety mechanisms and Putin keeps steamrolling. War.
2.	⁠NATO does respond. War.

America probably won’t let Russia touch Poland as they are their EE proxy. Kazakhstan is becoming a central power as well, so Russia might be inclined to steamroll them as well.

Iran and China are looking from the side lines to see what the US does, but big chance of a war in the Middle East (Israel) and Taiwan.

Turbulent relationships are very exciting. They keep the limerence alive for a lot longer, so there’s a lot more intense attraction. Guys who aren’t that interested, or like to play games, will be hot and cold with women, so those women will be more attracted. If not, they’ll get bored and leave. So they end up in endless cycle of falling for guys that don’t really like them all that much or are manipulating them until they get tired of it.

This has happened to me several times in relationships, and women on the internet are usually hyper defensive and say it must be that I’m a loser or that I wasn’t treating her as good as I think or something along those lines.

However, very few ""moderate"" Muslims exist, and the ones that do could very well be liars.

The Qur'an explicitly advocates for the killing of apostates, blasphemers, non-Muslims in general, gays, and everyone in between. When a Muslim does one of those things, he/she (almost always he) is following the truest form of his religion, for lack of a better term. If he rapes 20 women, beheads his wife for not covering her hair, stabs his daughter for leaving Islam, and rapes and cannibalizes his wife and daughter's corpses, then he is, according to the Qur'an, a pious Muslim. Of course, the majority of Muslims haven't done any of those heinous acts, but the majority probably condone them. Their condemnations of such crimes could merely be ruses; after all, Muslims are both allowed and encouraged to lie to non-Muslims about anything - a practice known in Arabic as *taqiyya*. Then, when the time comes, they drop their façades, hack off the nearest kafir's head, and feast on the kafir's liver. This is not a lie; this is reality.

In fact, I've seen firsthand something resembling this. After Hamas commenced its second Holocaust, Muslims across the world came out in support of the butchering of 1,200 innocent Israelis. Even American Muslims, considered by many to be the most progressive and most assimilated Muslim populations in the world, supported the slaughter. A poll showed that 57 percent of American Muslims supported Hamas' latest attempt at finishing what Hitler started. That day, their masks slipped. On the topic of Hitler, while he is viewed as the embodiment of evil by most, a much greater proportion of Muslims view the *Führer* favorably because he tried to rid the world of Jews. Antisemitism in Islam is a topic in and of itself, with the Qur'an and hadith repeatedly calling Jews filth that must be exterminated on Judgment Day. The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem during WWII was a willing Nazi collaborator who raised Muslim SS divisions. Muslim countries expelled almost their entire Jewish populations following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War; the overwhelming majority settled in Israel. At this point, I believe it is fair to say that Muslims, not just the extremists, are a danger to Western civilization. They are a danger to atheists like me, Christians like my family, Jews like my friend, queer people like virtually my entire friend group; they threaten every person I hold dear. For, in all likelihood, a ""moderate"" Muslim is an extremist hiding behind a mask, ready to show their true face when their victim least expects."

I think it should be easy to CMV. I just need to understand better because from the research I did it seemed pretty clear cut and obvious.

Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007. They provided some social services and now the care of the people who live there is under Hamas. Their safety and well-being is now in HAMAS's hands.

How did they take care of their people? Well by shooting missiles at a superior military for two decades. Then when they finally hit Israel a little too hard, and Israel dropped warnings to evacuate, HAMAS told their people it's a bluff and to ignore it... This seems super obvious that HAMAS has been doing this the whole time so that a big enough tragedy happens that they get attention and resources because of the tragedy. Public opinion shift was the goal. 

I understand that whole area has a very complicated history. I mean since ancient Mesopotamia crazy events have been taking place in that part of the world. I'm sure if you ask either party who started it, their answers will go back indefinitely since the dawn of civilization.

Is it not rational to assign responsibility during the leadership shift in 2007? I mean if aliens invaded with superior technology, and warned us not to attack, and one of our leaders commanded us to attack... And we get wiped out... That's poor leadership no? As much as we cry that the land should have been ours, the new military might situation requires strategy adjustment to protect lives.

There is not a single biological advantage to being a woman over a man. Lets go through the list shall we?  
  
\- Woman on average are far weaker than men.  
  
\- Woman have to deal with child birth  
  
\- Woman have to deal with the pain of child birth but before suffering through at least 7-9 months of being a walking watermelon  
  
\- Woman possibly die in child birth (like seriously fuck off)  
  
\- Woman have to deal with periods every fucking month  
  
\- Sex for us is literally not even worth it  
  
more pain than pleasure  
  
takes long as fuck to orgasm even once  
  
we are naturally the ""sub"" in sex due to men having the more dominant private part. The dynamic of sex is so fucking unfair and humiliating, Literally have to get on all fours just for pleasure that comes after a men is already finished and bored....  
  
oh, and don't forget all this just to get pregnant and possibly fucking die.  
  
\- two balls on our chest that are designed to give back pain even IF they are small (contrary to popular belief). Aside from breast milk, boobs literally have no purpose aside sexual attraction (go figure).  
  
Like did I miss anything? Lets look at the cons of being a man shall we?  
  
\- Eye brows grow together (how terrible, a weekly shaving)  
  
\- higher sex drive, sometimes very distracting (poor things, all they have to do is stroke it a few times and they are fine. We have to damn near impale ourselves).  
  
\- stronger body odor (take more showers)  
  
\- a mere tap on the balls put them in a coma (okay I'll give yall this one)  
  
\- stronger body odor (take more showers)  
  
The blatant difference in biological suffering speaks for itself really. If babies were allowed to choose their gender with the above knowledge in mind there would be no woman. You couldn't convince me otherwise, no one would voluntarily sign up to be quite frankly...inferior with a life of more needless suffering compared to their counterpart.  
  
Hell, even our ""advantages"" are fucking pointless  
  
Pain Tolerance - apparently we have a higher pain threshold than men. On the surface this sounds good but really it isn't. What good is being able to deal with higher levels of pain if we're more prone to being damaged in the first place? I would much rather have a body thats harder to damage in the first place. Obviously this feature is for child birth (go fucking figure) and periods but aside from that it makes no difference when it comes to something like breaking your fucking arm.  
  
Flexibility - we are more flexible than men...no scratch that FOR men. After all how else are we supposed to pull off those demeaning sex positions? We're more flexible? So fucking what. Due to our lack of strength we are still capable of the half the shit men are physically. Female sports are a joke.

A key function of social platforms is engaging with other people. This can help you find a group of people whose beliefs align with yours alongside being confronted by people whose ideas and beliefs are diametrically opposed to yours.  
  
While both groups may not align in their beliefs - both groups will very likely agree that the social platform is a valuable source of support and interaction between their peers.  
  
Depriving a primarily young adult group of **one of their primary outlets to social network interaction** would ignite a backlash that would seek to ‘punish’ the (perceived) individual who is responsible for banning their valued a ocial interaction platform.

Turning the clock back to 1963….’*What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?*’ had audiences enthralled, critics buzzing and the expectations held that Bette Davis would be taking home another Oscar that year…except she didn’t.   
        
The film, as we all know, was a wild success which is the result of the combined efforts **of both** Joan Crawford *and* Bette Davis.   
    
**But** it was Davis' portrayal of the deranged,  ‘has-been child star, “Baby Jane” Hudson, that cemented the movie as a timeless cultural phenomenon. At the time, her performance truly horrified audience members who had never seen anything like it until then.   
    
Yet, when the envelope was opened at the Oscars, Anne Bancroft emerged victorious and to make matters deeply personal…it was Joan who accepted the Oscar on behalf of Bancroft.   
  
It’s Hollywood history that Crawford (with help from some well-known gossip columnists and her own connections) *lobbied against* Davis but I’d like to assert that, even though Bancroft gave a compelling performance, Bette deserved the Oscar that night.

First I will define large-scale technology as I mean and in my own words. Large-scale Tech is technology that is used, needs, and perpetuates complex social organization. So think of electricity grids and all the implements needed for that; think of plumbing, internet, computers, factories, industry, machine parts, agriculture, etc etc. 

Okay, so, how does this technology limit human freedom? how does it’s development increase that limitation? 

1st: Large-scale Technology’s (for short I will say just ‘technology’ hereafter) full effects on society and people are often if not most of the time impossible to predict.

2nd: Because of this technology is mostly seen as a positive because it’s benefits are very easy to see (machine power, faster transportation, etc) but it’s negatives are near impossible to see in full. 

3rd: In the beginning of a tech’s integration into society it begins small. One firm here, or one government department adopts it. Then, because of its advantages, other firms and departments or companies will adopt it; not only will they adopt it because of it’s advantages, but they will also adopt it because of synergy with their partners, or their partner’s systems, and because it gives them a competitive boost compared to their competitors. 

4th: The implementation of this new tech increases and increases until at a certain point one (person or business, for convenience or advantage) is almost entirely forced to adopt it because society has changed so much. And even before this point, those that do adopt it have to change to fit it due to it being new. 

In short, people are forced to fit in with society and technology due to it being adopt for it’s advantages. And while each innovations effects on technology’s whole restriction on freedom is minuscule, all of them combined is monumental. 

This whole process has happened with electricity, cars, computers, and it’s currently happening with artificial intelligence."

Given his talk of going after people he doesn't like and given how he's talking about going after the ""Vermin"" who opposes him, try to convince me or change my mind that this is just nonsense and it won't happen. I used to dismiss this as just Trump Derangement Syndrome but after January 6th in 2021 and his calls to terminate the Constitution and calling for Project 2025, I'm starting to really think that this could actually happen. I'm not saying it will for certain happen but I wouldn't be surprised if people start going to camps in the beginning of 2025 or worse. Maybe it won't be death camps but it will be like those Russian filtration camps in Chechnya or in Ukraine right now. Still scary to see what could happening.

1,2024-03-10,CMV: The Rome Statute’s prohibition on the use of starvation as a weapon causes more harm than good by prolonging wars.,u/Sensitive_Truck_3015,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bbsvr2/cmv_the_rome_statutes_prohibition_on_the_use_of/,changemyview,"The use of starvation as a weapon is one of the oldest military tactics in the history of the world. Since ancient times, armies would seek to cut off its enemy’s food supply and starve them into surrendering. This continued into the modern age. Sieges and/or blockades have been employed in the American Civil War and both world wars.

The Rome Statute, a treaty signed after WWII, specifies that the use of starvation as a weapon is a war crime. It is definitely a noble concept. However, by prohibiting one of the most effective tactics in the book, it prolongs wars, causing more casualties (both civilian and military) in the long run.

To compound the problem, food, like money, is fungible. It is impossible to deliver food aid to civilians in enemy territory in a way that does not benefit military personnel. Any food going to civilians will free up existing foodstuffs for use by the enemy. Or, to simplify things, the enemy can simply divert the food aid for its own use. Either way, the enemy benefits.

Lastly, the prohibition on starvation makes surrender less likely. Starvation is one of the best ways to pressure an enemy into surrendering. Armies march and fight on their stomachs. Starving troops have low morale and are more likely to surrender. Starving civilians have been known to force their governments to sue for peace (see WWI Russia). A surrender means no further fighting and few to no further casualties. By contrast, well-fed troops are more likely to continue fighting, causing more casualties.

I will concede, however, that armies shouldn’t be allowed to use starvation against civilians in territories that they control. Once they have secured the area, they should be on the hook for feeding the people. But by no means should an army be obligated to let its enemies feed themselves. Not only does that go against all military sense, but it causes greater casualties in the long run by prolonging the war."

It carries very strict punishments with it if you are caught whether it is in academia, journalism, or even in books that aren’t even real (like seriously, who cares). I think this is illogical for three main reasons. 

1. No idea is truly original. Everything has been said before and all new knowledge is just a reworded iteration of past knowledge. Except for certain scientific discoveries humans basically figured everything out even if not all at once. Everything time I’ve had an idea sooner or later I come to find out someone has had that exact same idea but way smarter and more detailed. Ergo nothing is really plagiarism if everything you come to with on your own has already been come up with by someone else. 

2. People subjectively apply punishment when it comes to plagiarizing. For instance people attacked Joe Biden for plagiarizing a speech in the 80s and as a result he had to drop out of the race and was effectively cancelled before they had that term for it. It took decades until Obama redeemed him for him to recover, and if he didn’t have to wait all those years before finally becoming president maybe he’d have gotten it out of his system back then and we wouldn’t have such an old president today. Compare this to Breaking Bad, which if you watch closely you’ll notice takes many scenes and ideas from the Sopranos (which is arguably the better show). This is clearly plagiarism, but Vince Gilligan hasn’t had to face any of the retribution that Joe Biden did in the 80s. This proves that charge of “plagiarism” is subjectively and inconsistently applied. 

3. There is no way to prove that two people don’t just think about things the same way. Have you ever heard of the phrase “great minds think alike”? It’s only natural for intelligent individuals to come to the same conclusions when observing the same evidence. When two people say the same things why is the first assumption that one copied the other and not that the two thinkers are equally brilliant?

But morally, the situation doesn't seem all that complicated to me. Israel is a colony forcibly placed smack in the middle of land that has been populated by the Palestinians for hundreds of years. They were more or less established as a satellite state by the British Empire and are today backed chiefly by the United States because of the strategic value that a ""western"" state represents in that region.

Because they've had the backing of these two massive powers, Israel has always been in a position of great power over the Palestinians. People like to try to point to a singular moment as the ""inciting incident"" of this conflict, but the truth is that the conflict was incited through the establishment of Israel in the first place. There were people there already, and then a bunch of Europeans showed up and took their land. 

Nowadays, Israel functionally controls Palestine as an apartheid state. Palestine is not recognized as a state by the UN, and the Gaza territory is occupied by Israel, yet the people who live there do not have the rights that Israeli citizens do. When they peacefully protest this occupation, as they did in 2018 and 2019, they get gassed and shot at by the IDF. 

And now, as a ""defensive"" reaction to the tragic attacks that took place on October 7th, Israel is indiscriminately bombing Gaza. They have already killed at least 30,000 people in 6 months, taken out the majority of their hospitals, and induced a famine in the region. 

I want to be clear, I do not condone the violence of Hamas, or anyone who attacks innocent Israeli citizens for the actions of their government. But when the Palestinian people do not have the right to peaceful protest, nor do they have any power in Israel's government, they are essentially only left with violence as a possible solution. I do not condone that violence, but I do believe that it is a predictable outcome of the abuses that Israel continues to commit.

Israel has all the power here. They could, if they wanted, choose to end the bombings tomorrow, and begin working towards a peaceful solution to this problem in good faith. That is not something that the Palestinians have ever had the power to do. They have been systematically stripped of their power and agency by Israel, and the inevitable violence that results from this is used as justification for yet more atrocities.

I should be clear that I'm not fundamentally opposed to the idea of a Jewish state, nor do I think that we should dissolve Israel or move the Israeli people somewhere else. I just think it's dishonest to treat this situation as morally complicated when one side clearly has much more power to do harm than the other does."

Firstly, hallucinations cannot inflict pain on people. However, Megha has inflicted pain on Raj a few times in the movie. One occasion that comes to mind is right before the Holi party, when she throws red abir on Raj's face, making him slightly flince, before running of into the distance. Another occasion that comes to mind is right after Vikram slapped Ishika during the date in the mountains, causing the latter to chase the former. Right after he did that, Megha slapped Raj, causing both the couples to chase each other in the mountains. He even flinced at that as well, which means that she inflicted pain on him. The human body cannot randomly inflict pain on itself, which means that Megha was a ghost and not a hallucination.

Secondly, if it was a hallucination, then Raj would have had other symptoms as well, of serious diseases such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, etc. It could also have been a sign of being addicted to drugs or alcoholic beverages! However, in Gurukul, neither alcoholic beverages, nor drugs are allowed, which means that being addicted to them is a death wish if Raj wanted to teach there! If he was schizophrenic, he would have had symptoms such as a lack of motivation, or slow movement! However, he dances un the movie, and is determined on his goal to change Narayan's mind! If he had bipolar disorder, then he would be upset all the time! However, as we see in the movie, he is not at all upset, except for a few particular scenes where it is completely reasonable to be sad in!

Finally, hallucinations can only be seen by the person hallucinating it. Throughout the entire movie, Raj is the primary person who flirts with her. This can be seen at the Holi party, during the date in the mountains, and in other places. However, he is not the only one who can see her. During the end of the movie, when Megha realises that her dad has changed and realises the error of his ways, she holds hands with him. This maked Narayan look at her. Moreso, during the dance party where the 2 schools are invited to celebrate Raj's birthday, Sameer saw her spinning in a sari, and even sang with her, proving that others too, could see her."
1,2024-03-11,CMV: It's hypocritical for someone to criticise a woman for wearing a hijab AND another woman for not covering her nipples in public spaces.,u/WheatBerryPie,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bc4zbm/cmv_its_hypocritical_for_someone_to_criticise_a/,changemyview,"(as a preface, I stand with Iranian women who are fighting for the right to NOT wear a hijab, the Muslim women in the West fighting for the right to not be harassed for wearing a hijab, AND the #freethenipple movement at the same time.)

This is directly for Christian conservatives who constantly complain about women not dressing modestly enough in public. They usually take an issue when others reveal their breast on beaches, on the streets, etc, but also take issues with women wearing a hijab in general.

The typical complain is that hijab is a tool of oppression by Muslim men. The belief is that Muslim men can't control themselves but feel aroused or attracted to women without head coverings and since men are the ones setting up the rules, they decide to pressure every Muslim woman to wear one. But this is the same reasoning Christian conservatives give for why women must cover their breasts in public. These men can't control themselves but feel aroused or attracted to women who reveal their breasts, and since it's men who set the rules up, they decide to pressure every woman to cover them up. To me it's the same argument of modesty and privacy, the only meaningful difference is which body part is acceptable and which is not.

I think that if someone wants to criticise women for wearing a hijab, they should also allow other women to reveal their breasts in public if they choose to."

ABC - ""Hundreds of truckloads of aid for Gaza stuck as more lives lost to malnutrition.""  
AP News - ""Israel is holding up food for 1.1 million Palestinians in Gaza.""

NBC - ""In the ruins of Gaza, children are starving to death.""

&#x200B;

Deliberately starving a civilian population is a form of ethnic cleansing that is rightly considered one of the greatest crimes against humanity in world history, one that echoes the absolute darkest period of Nazi extermination camps.   


No matter how horrible the crime, there is no justification to intentionally inflict starvation en masse on a civilian population. Not 9/11, not 10/7,  there is simply no moral justification. As a Jewish person, it is particularly painful to watch a people who have been placed into ghettos and starved to death place another group of people in a ghetto and starve them to death.

It's sort of like how the Christian church needed ""Satanists"" during the Satanic panic in the 1980's.

So towns will make thieves sit in public with a sign saying as much, so everyone can see the face of the thief and shame them for it.

Ultimately, the goal of all 32 teams is (ostensibly) to win the championship. The postseason is the stage to do so, but in order to make the postseason, you still need to endure months of the regular season.

I think it's ridiculous that in football's regular season, OT is a 10 minute period and is essentially a modified sudden death, whereas in the postseason, both teams are guaranteed to get a turn and it will go in 15 minute periods until there's a winner. That should be the case for the regular season as well.

Cue Donovan McNabb's hilarious mishap in 2008 where he thought there were no ties.

In hockey, you get 5 minutes of sudden death OT plus a shootout, whereas in the postseason, it's 20 minute OT periods until there's a winner. All 82 games should have that (assuming they're not decided in regulation). No chance the Stanley Cup should be decided on a weak shootout."

I.e. not which one you personally like.

My reasoning:

Cats are way easier to take care of. They mainly entertain themselves whereas some dogs need to be walked multiple times a day, and also take up more space. Most cats can easily sit on your lap whereas dogs cannot. Meanwhile, most dogs cannot sit on your lap, and the ones that can often have genetic issues due to selective breeding.

Possible reasoning against: ""Dogs are friendlier than cats."" This isn't strictly true. I think it is way more accurate to say that dogs are more loyal, where is cats you have to earn your trust. It comes down to personal preference of whether you prefer someone who will follow you around no matter what, or whether you prefer relationships there you have to work on and grows. Personally I don't want to yes-man (or dog) as a pet, but again, that's up to personal preference.

Another possible argument against would be the risk of toxoplasmosis. Both dogs and cats can transmit parasites to humans, however, the risk of toxoplasmosis is not as high as it used to be if you properly care for your cat. Cats tend to get toxoplasmosis from eating rodents that are infected with it, but that can be prevented if people follow the vets' typical instruction, which is not to let a cat go outside unsupervised. Also it's worth noting that now you can test your cat for toxoplasmosis anyway."

1,2024-03-11,"CMV: Long-term, unmarried relationships are a stronger sign of commitment than long-term married relationships",u/the_bollo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bc9q4q/cmv_longterm_unmarried_relationships_are_a/,changemyview,"I consider this a loosely-held belief. In short: Long-term, unmarried relationships can represent a stronger sign of commitment than married ones because they exist without the external social pressures and legal bindings that marriage introduces. In unmarried relationships, partners continuously choose to stay together based on mutual desire and effort, rather than being influenced by societal expectations or the potential financial and emotional costs of divorce.  
Supporting arguments:  
1. **Lack of external influence**: Unlike married couples, those in long-term, unmarried relationships face fewer legal and financial barriers to separation. This means their decision to stay together is less likely to be influenced by externalities like fear of the divorce process or financial complications.  
2. **Less ""sunk cost"" motivation to remain in the relationship**: Any long-term relationship can carry a financial and emotional burden with it; it's another form of investment after all. However, the cost of a traditional marriage (venues, catering, etc.) could encourage married people to stick things out as a kind of manifestation of the sunk cost fallacy.  
3. **Public vs private commitment**: Marriage is traditionally seen as a public declaration of commitment. However, this can also introduce external pressures to maintain an appearance of unity, even when the relationship may be struggling. In contrast, long-term, unmarried partners rely on a private, personal understanding of commitment, potentially fostering a more genuine and resilient bond.  
Counter arguments:  
1. **Marriage as a form of righteous protest**: The strongest exception I can think of is, for example, a situation where an interracial couple choose to get married in strong defiance of their family/community's disapproval. In that case the public act of getting married takes on additional meaning and importance."

Jimmy Cherizier, leader of the ""G9 & Family"" gang, has the upper hand and will likely become the new ruler of Haiti by right of conquest.

I'm looking at the idea of a ""state"" in its most primal form - how states existed since ancient times. A ruler ruled by right of conquest - he controls the territory by force of arms, and denial of that right is meaningless unless one has the military might to back it up. Functionally speaking, a state is little different than a gang except in that its leaders are often chosen by the people.

There’s nothing special about this decade and the upcoming years after. 

I’ve been seeing posts lately of people looking at the upcoming Oscar’s or trying to find watch parties and I just can’t fathom who would actually care? 

I can’t be the only one who thinks that nothing feels genuinely special/ interesting after the year 2020. 

This era is crap. 

I feel this also has to go back to the pandemic. Everyone’s collective interpretation of time fucked imo. 

Maybe. 

I’m 21 and I would’ve preferred to be this age any time prior to this decade. Maybe a period of time when intrusive social media was in its infancy, a lot of people would probably have more of a social life. 

But this is it now. Short form content and from one piece of Netflix media to another, everyone seems fine and dandy but to me it spells dead and empty. 

While I’m on the topic Netflix originals suck. 

They haven’t been good since 2014 and they entirely depend on becoming a trend in pop culture. From squid game to whatever Wednesday is. 

All the Netflix originals are super formulaic. The last genuinely good one was probably orange is the new black. Before the final season where they were essentially forcing you to feel bad over Mexican deportation. That was a bit of a trend back in 2016. 

Even as a Hispanic myself, who cares? Genuinely who cares? 

And now so deep in the 21st century here we are with this era of forced diversity. 

It’s all crap. It’s all meh. I can’t imagine a single thing to look forward to/have nostalgia for from this decade.

And onto the new generation now, being raised solely by the screen because their parents are too lazy to spend genuine time with the kid.

I am a woman who lives in a pretty conservative european country and I would say my family is also more on the modest side.
Deep down I know that I shouldn’t feel this way about it, afterall babies cry when they are hungry and they need to eat right away. 
I don’t view it as a sexual thing and I, myself have been to nudist beaches before so I wouldn’t call myself a prude either. 
I have never seen anyone nursing a baby in public before, I only saw movie clips/tiktoks about the topic. Tonight I came across some videos and I didn’t like how I felt about the topic. It made me feel uncomfortable and I couldn’t explain why. For clarification my “issue” is not with nursing a baby through clothing designed for this or with a nursing blanket. More so just “whipping it out” and letting everyone see the boobies/feeding process. And before anyone comes at me I know this is supposed to be normal, natural and nothing to be ashamed of.

I realize this is a me problem and that is why I chose this subbreddit, to read your opinions and if anyone felt this way prior having babies and having to go through this yourself.

1,2024-03-11,CMV: Quietly quitting is not beneficial for anyone,u/shoshana4sure,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bcdajl/cmv_quietly_quitting_is_not_beneficial_for_anyone/,changemyview,"First of all, I just think quiet quitting is ridiculous and a response to bad managers. I think it’s best to speak up and speak to your manager, or simply find a new job. Also, if you are going to quietly quit, don’t tell anybody that you’re quietly quitting. 

Nonetheless, I’ve always been a hard worker when I was working, and I felt that was not only beneficial for me, but for everyone. It always lead to more money and recognition and a  sense of self satisfaction.

Granted, I really never worked on the weekends or downloaded some program so I could check emails, there is a point where you can go overboard, and it starts to ruin your life, but those are just options. There’s nothing wrong with going above and beyond for a customer or going above and beyond for your boss, as long as you still have a good work life balance.


[Article] (https://joshbersin.com/2022/08/why-quiet-quitting-is-a-really-bad-idea/#:~:text=It's%20ok%20to%20put%20limits,always%20results%20in%20something%20better.$

I’ve been astounded at the flurry of articles about Quiet Quitting. It seems like the press has jumped on some kind of meme that really serves us poorly.

Before I jump down anyone’s throat, let me explain what I mean.

First of all, we all understand that employees are often burned out. Mercer’s data shows that 81% of employees have “had it” to some degree, and in any given team it can often be overwhelming. We are living in one of the hottest economies of all time (unemployment is near 1960-level lows), so people are asked to do a lot.

Second, the problem of “overwork” or “burnout” is both a company, manager, and individual issue. Each of these stakeholders plays a role.

If the company’s goals are unrealistically high, there will be burnout all over the place. I interviewed a team of top leaders at IBM a few months ago and their particular business was growing at over 60% per year. Rather than feeling excited and celebrating, they were all burned out. Why? The goals were constantly being raised, and I encouraged the senior leaders to push back.

If a manager is new, immature, or overly aggressive, the team will suffer too. In healthcare, where nurses make up more than half the workforce, we hear stories of overload, toxic work environment, and all sorts of bad behavior all the time. You, as an employee or leader, have to coach and give feedback to these managers. If they don’t get it, no amount of “quiet quitting” will make life easier. (Managers are human too, and they’re likely as burned out as you are.)

For you as an individual, it’s important to manage your own life well. As someone who works a lot of hours (but I do love my work), I know how burnout can creep up on you. You get tired, cranky, and your quality of work suffers. This is why “slack time” is built into our Employee Experience model. Everyone needs quiet time during the day to rest, think, and reinvent.

Should You Quietly Quit?

While many of the articles and memes are cute, I agree with Arianna Huffington, this is a very bad idea. The original Tik Tok Video seemed harmless at first, but then NYT, Fortune, HuffPost, USA TODAY, The Wall Street Journal, and LA Times all chimed in, making it seem like a big “trend.”

Yes, as the LA Times article was the most interesting because it points out that “hustling” is not for everyone. And we, as leaders and HR managers understand that. (I highly recommend you watch Office Space, one the best movies I’ve ever seen, if you really want to see what “quiet quitting” is all about.)

But let me give you another perspective.

While many people work for survival, the real value of work is to fulfill your values as an individual. Every job, no matter how boring or mundane, has opportunities for you to thrive. When you lean into your job, and give it extra effort, you find unexpected value as a result.

In my 45+ year career, for example, I’ve had at least 10 years of “crummy bosses” or “poorly run companies” to deal with. In every case I had to drag myself into work in the morning, deal with frustrating, boring, or difficult situations, and then decide if I wanted to stay.

At one point in my life, my kids were both young and on soccer teams, so I used to leave work at 4:30 and rush home to be their coach. I didn’t “stop working” in the office, but I did rebalance my time to spend time on their activities. Later, as they went off to high school and didn’t want as much attention, I focused more attention at work, eventually becoming an entrepreneur.

At every point in your career you have the opportunity to learn, grow, and change. It’s ok to put limits on your work, but don’t do it “quietly.” If you tell your boss that you just can’t work these hours and he or she gets upset, maybe it’s just time to leave. There really aren’t a shortage of jobs right now, and as difficult as it is to leave, it always results in something better.

If you’re just personally fed up, either tell someone or do something about it. We as employees have much more power than you think. If you are the “positive one” on the team, you may find yourself getting promoted just because you have a better attitude.

Finally, if you’re a Millennial, Gen-X, or Gen-Z worker, please don’t feel that you’re alone. We all went through this in our careers, and only by “motoring through the rough periods” did we grow and thrive later in life. And believe me, when you lean in more, you get more in return.

In my opinion, Quiet Quitting is a good recipe for failure. Let’s not talk about it too much, and focus on just making work Irresistible and giving good feedback to our managers. "
1,2024-03-11,"CMV: If Someone Looks Like a Jerk, They Most Likely Are a Jerk",u/NomadicContrarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bcdpky/cmv_if_someone_looks_like_a_jerk_they_most_likely/,changemyview,"So, I wanted to make a CMV that's a bit more conducive than the ones I have in the past, and I honestly feel like I needed some sense slapped into me regarding this particular thought of mine. I'll be 25 in a month, yet I still seem to have this high school mentality in me where I judge others by appearance and resent them, probably due to all the stuff I went through. Regardless, the topic at hand I wanted to discuss today was the idea that if someone looks/acts/talks like a jerk, they most likely are a jerk. 

I'll give an example, but I feel like this view extends beyond it so take what you will from this. 

Ever since last summer, I noticed that we had some new neighbours not too far away from us. Basically, our neighbours have 3 sons, the oldest of whom appears to be in his early 20's. To give you the briefest description, they seem to be the epitome of ""Chads"". They're good looking, I often hear/see them kicking a soccer ball around in the court beside their house, and sometimes I see the oldest coming/leaving his home with his motorcycle and with his attractive girlfriend sometimes, and the occasional acting lovey dovey with each other. 

And sufficed to say, I just feel a strong sense of uneasiness and maybe even livid rage inside whenever I see/hear them, and it got me thinking to express this perspective, cause while they certainly aren't the first to instigate such feelings, they are an example of a case that I cannot seem to escape from, unlike for example, when I saw such people at the gym and I stopped going to the gym, or if I see people on the subway and I just move to a different part of the train.

But anyways, here's why I believe that if someone, like these guys, looks like a jerk, then they most likely are a jerk.   


1. Often times these people are conventionally attractive and most attractive people people (in the States and Canada where I live anyways) seem to believe they are ""better"" than others like myself, and thus believe they could treat me like crap either implicitly or explicitly, a lot of whom actually have over the course of my adolescence and young adulthood, even when I never did anything to warrant such behaviours.
2. These people, like my neighbours, probably never had genuine struggles in life. They probably got positive feedback loops/reinforcement from those around them, and thus believe they deserve and are better than others.
3. There are also clear indicators that someone is a jerk depending on their mannerisms, the clothes they wear, and what they say. And for guys like my neighbours, they tick all the boxes. They use the words ""bro, like, and legit"", and often times these people travel in their ""packs"" that they've established since high school/undergrad.

As such, it has become very difficult for me to go outside these days, in fear that I will see people like my neighbours or similar people and become livid inside, which I can understandably admit that it can cause issues in my desire for making connections with others, both platonic and romantic. So I thought I'd bite it and post about this today, so I can hopefully get some other perspectives that I can try to remember so I don't become bitter when I go outside and see my neighbours.

 I used to have the view that I didn't feel special because as a black man, as I know I'm always gonna be being congratulated based on my race and being ""one of the good ones"" and never solely on my individual achievements as a person 

As long as i'm in America, I'm always going to have to prove to a bunch of political idiots as to why I shouldn't be dehumanized. 

Despite the thousands of media and influential POC already proving why 

And as long as that's the case, we'll never live in a 100% equal and colorblind society.

 I don't believe it'll ever happen 

So I might as well perceive myself as superior and excellent to everyone else just because I'm black.

 Or in other terms that people use ""black excellence""

Instead of what people should be using which is ""human excellence""

I might as well double down and  embrace myself as a black person (and not just a person) 

Because the whole ""won't be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character"" is 100% impossible in our society 

I want you to prove me wrong as to why we *should* perceive ourselves as equal and/or colorblind to each other.

(Or at least seeing each other as equals despite our color) 

Because I believe America will never reach that perfect utopian point of complete equality. 

So might as well brag and act superior based on something I can't control. Cause even if I act otherwise, they'll still be prejudice and stigma "

Considering the amount of close contact between humans, especially hunters and deer, a human contracting this disease seems like a matter of time. Human to human spread would be apocalyptic.

We need to have a few years of just blasting every deer you can. That's the only way I can see to stop this impending catastrophe.

I would argue playing ""the long game"" doesn't really count as rizz. Rizz is something that happens immediately in the moment. (i.e. getting a girl to go home with you in a night is rizz, spending months convincing a girl to warm up to you enough to give you a chance is not)

So I don't think rizz exists. People talk about how women decide whether or not they like a guy in the first 5 minutes of talking to a guy, and while I have no idea of how true this is, I would argue that it's closer to true than not. 

I don't think that a woman who decides ""this is an unattractive man"" is gonna change her mind under most circumstances. Rizz in that situation is not gonna change her mind into ""i like this guy, I want to give him my number; sleep with him; make out with him etc whatever"". What I do however think is that rizz exists when the woman is already at a yes. A ""this man is attractive"".

Why? Because if the man is attractive she's going to want to continue the conversation. I've been an ugly guy approaching a woman in a bar or club and it's very clear when she sees my face she does not want to speak to me, so I graciously bow out. I have attractive friends and see how women respond when they approach them. Night and day.

When I have seen attractive people fail, it's usually because they say something that someone of their looks cannot get away with. I think this is what can be observed to be rizz. Saying the things to not ruin it. So it's the opposite of how rizz and game are commonly interpreted. You can't rizz someone up, but you can maintain the energy and not throw off the vibe with a woman who is already attracted to you to not ruin it. 

I think this is valid because if you never had any chance to begin with, you're not failing at rizzing up a woman. You're never started in the first place."

If God doesn't exist then moral standards don't exist. There is no universal good and evil. There are only different actions, conditions or states.

Why is being obsessively compulsive or bipolar considered mental disorders, but feeling like you are in the wrong body or not only feeling attracted to the opposite sex normal?  
  
Clearly, the human body, with its hormones and sexual organs, is designed to just be attracted to the opposite sex and to have intercourse with the opposite sex. Therefore, when people deviate from their biology and how they were born, then it should not be viewed as normal.  
  
Being LGBTQ is objectively, abnormal because it goes against our very biology, and because it's much less common (less than 10% of US adults are LGBTQ).  
  
When I see people who are LGBTQ labeling themselves this and that and asserting a very particular identity, I find it nonsensical, as they are out of touch with their body and their biological sexual nature, having identity confusion.

However, I believe a foundation of the conflict is often overlooked as it doesn’t fit the narrative of Israel = bad, Palestine = victims. 

What should be highlighted is the values and ideology of the 2 religions Judaism and Islam. This video summarises the ideology and values of Islam in the Arab world and the attitude of Palestinians towards Jews: https://youtu.be/svIa02N6JUo?si=YyxpWpyDRR127oKq. 

Palestinian mothers openly praise and advocate for their children to become martyrs and to kill Jews in the belief their God will reward them. Palestinian and Arab leaders openly call for the death of all Jews (and Christians/Atheists etc) across the world. 

Polls suggest mass support for Hamas from the public and mass anti-semitism. According to one poll conduct by the Anti Defamation League, 97% of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza held antisemitic views, which would rank as the highest proportion in the world. There are many instances of holocaust denial as well. 

Every peaceful partition plan was rejected by Palestinians and met with violence. The ideology and values of Palestine and Islam are of violence and intolerance. That is what they teach their children, and they train them to be Jihadis and martyrs from an early age. 

In contrast, Jews prioritise their safety and the safety of their family, prioritise democracy and tolerance. Of course there are extremist Jews but I am talking about the majority of the population. I also don’t believe that Jew = good person I am talking about the general ideology of Judaism which is not one of violence or hatred.

There are violent Jews and there are peaceful Jews, but the actual teachings and ideology are generally peaceful. There are violent Palestinians and there are peaceful Palestinians. The difference is the teachings and ideology of Islam are violent, and especially anti-Semitic. 

Some will say that this extremism and violence is a response to Israel “occupying” or “ethnically cleansing” Palestine as a justification. That is a separate topic which is a false narrative and revisionism of history, but Islamic hatred for Jews and Israel occurred long before the existence of the Palestinian ethnicity going back to the Islamic conquest of the region (thus predates that argument).

I think the same applies for let's say a flat earth community or a bunch of toxic Andrew Tate supporters. You think shutting down their subreddit would make them question their beliefs? I highly doubt it. If anything it'll empower them even more to create a new community and give them more confidence on their beliefs.

I don't know if there is honestly a better solution. But I think talking to them is still much better than censoring them. Atleast there's a miniscule chance they would understand and see another pov. Making fun of them or cutting them off of society just adds fuel to their rage and psychological issues.

# Context:

* I've talked with people about this for the last 13 years all over the internet. Just yesterday somebody recommended I post about this to this sub. So this is my first time here. I read the rules and I think this post meets all the criteria.
* And I've noticed a theme across these discussions. People are not doing this basic thing, which I'll explain below as a recommendation to anyone who wants to help me see how I'm wrong about this.

# How to form a good argument about this -- here's my recommendation:

1. Give some examples of objective things and some examples of subjective things, and
2. explain your universal standards for judging whether a hypothetical thing is objective or subjective (don't mention any concrete examples), and then
3. explain how your standards place each thing in its respective category.

Most people will instead tell me that morality is subjective because X and then they don't try to apply that X standard to other fields. And when we do that, their logic breaks down. For example, people say ""morality is subjective because people in different times and places come to different conclusions."" Now apply that logic to physics and what do we get? There are people that believe the earth is flat. And even among physicists, there's lots of disagreement. So their logic says physics is not objective, but it is (in my view and the view of the person who is saying this logic). So this contradicts their logic. They would have done better if they followed my recommendation above.

# Some background ideas about this:

Moral knowledge is created in the same way that any other kind of knowledge is created, including physics. We create knowledge by guesses and criticism. (Following in the tradition of Popper and Deutsch.)

Moral ideas can be refuted like any other ideas. Ideas have purpose (goals), and one way to refute an idea is to explain how it fails to serve its purpose. Other ways include: looking for contradictions between our best theories, and creating universal principles instead of just ad hoc reasoning, which helps us avoid contradictions. In this way we can judge whether a purpose (goal) is right or wrong, based on how it connects with everything else we know about the world.

So, for example, we went from nothing, to the idea of equality under the law for land-owning white men (there were more steps in between), then we included non-land-owning white men, then non-white men, then women. with each iteration, our principles are getting more universal, and a contradiction is removed (an error is corrected).

I understand that everyone has the right to love and be in a relationship and I 100% agree that single parents should be able to enjoy romantic relationships and be in them. 

However, as a parent, your first responsibility should be to your children and to ensure that they are okay and well-adjusted. When you date and then marry someone, who your children have not only outright just rejected but do not get along with, you are fully responsible for any chaos that happens afterwards.

If your reply to this is anything along the lines of “Children do not have a say in parents lives”, “children need to deal with it and just be happy for the parent”.
Then I have this to say, your children are stuck with you on this earth, they don’t have a choice in parent and they only have one of you. They can’t leave the uncomfortable situation, they don’t have any rights, they don’t have authority. They are trapped and most of the times, they’re  trapped and made to feel bad about their feelings

We expect children to be able to process and deal with their provider and protect marry someone who they don’t get along with. Thats a lot
Most grown people wouldn’t be able to deal with that, for a week- let along your childhood

You’re not a bad parent for getting married, but you are one for creating a toxic situation for your child, and using their vulnerability to brush aside how they feel.

Also, using the “they need a mom/dad” as a reason for doing it, is highly miguided.
Youre doing it for you, not them. 
If you’re going to do it, at least be honest and say you’re doing it because your wants outweigh your child’s and you simply don’t care about the feelings of your child, as long as you are happy.

2,2024-03-12,CMV: Describing Information and More Using Only Abstraction and Concretization and Explaining Entropy with Abstraction and Concretization,u/Proud-University4574,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bcunvc/cmv_describing_information_and_more_using_only/,changemyview,"All concepts lie on a spectrum between abstract and concrete, and the relationships between concepts can be explained through this spectrum. All concepts are either the abstract or concrete form of each other. Algorithms abstract or concretize concepts, introducing new concepts to us. I'll come back to algorithms later. For example, in mathematics, abstracting ""3 apples"" yields ""the number 3"". Numbers are further abstracted with variables, transitioning into a more abstract form. Variables are then abstracted into functions, becoming even more abstract. Calculus is even more abstract in comparison. In a more general sense, physics is the concrete form of mathematics.  
  
Not all concretizations lead to a single outcome. The concretization of multiple concepts can result in concepts that are the same. For instance, computer science is a more concrete form of mathematics.  
  
The more abstract something is, the more judgments we can make about it. Philosophical perspectives work this way too. By abstracting facts into basic propositions, they can make judgments about many things. Group theory in abstract algebra, for example, encompasses all of number theory because of its high level of abstraction, allowing for many judgments. Those that interact with us physically are the most concrete form we can perceive. Are there more concrete forms beyond those that we can interact with physically? We don't know.  
  
Algorithms are what abstract concepts. Algorithms can be processors, consciousness, or natural laws. How can a natural law be an algorithm? The law of evolution can abstract a concrete organism into abstract species through probability and statistics. Are probability and statistics algorithms then? Yes, algorithms can be something abstract. For instance, computer algorithms abstract the electromagnetic environment and concretize Boolean algebra. When you apply the laws of computer science in a space other than the electromagnetic one, you end up with something other than a computer, showing that the electromagnetic space serves merely as a platform.  
  
For algorithms to emerge, other concepts must either be abstracted or concretized.  
  
For an algorithm to be distinct from the concepts involved, it only needs to behave like an algorithm compared to other concepts. For example, by concretizing electromagnetism, we create computer processors; here, electromagnetism is the abstract concept, computer processors are the concrete concept, and algorithms are the laws of physics. Computer processors function thanks to the laws of physics.  
  
Knowledge is a concept that we can obtain by abstracting data. Hence, it takes up less space than data. Knowledge doesn't necessarily have to be within the data itself. Algorithms can derive other information from data. Suppose we have data consisting of 1s and 0s, representing an image file stored on a computer. How does the computer, or algorithm, know that this data represents an image? Knowledge doesn't always reside within the data; rather, it's the algorithm itself that uncovers knowledge. Can we speak of the existence of knowledge? If we only have data, then no. But if we have an algorithm that processes the data and thereby extracts knowledge, then at that moment, the knowledge exists, and if that moment has passed, then the knowledge does not exist.  
  
The transmission of knowledge requires the concretization of knowledge, i.e., its transformation into data. When people communicate, they transform knowledge into sound data using the rules of natural language and specific templates, transmitting these sound data by vibrating the air. Here, knowledge is first abstracted into sound data through the rules of language and algorithms in the brain. However, this level of concretization is not sufficient for the transmission of knowledge; these sound data are also transmitted to the physical environment by vibrating air molecules through the algorithms of biological accents, creating kinetic energy. The abstract concept known as knowledge is now nothing more than the kinetic energy resulting from the vibration of air molecules. The recipient, through the algorithm of the ear, converts the concrete vibration into sound data, abstracting it. But this level of abstraction is not enough for the existence of knowledge; the algorithms in the brain that use the rules of language must transform this sound data into knowledge, and thus the transmission of knowledge occurs. For the transmission of knowledge, both the sender and the receiver must have processors capable of abstracting-concretizing operations.  
  
Mathematics, physics, and other fields can be obtained by abstracting. Hence, they take up less space than physics and similar fields. With less, they can make more judgments. Similarly, the weights of artificial neural networks are smaller than the dataset used to train them, yet they can generate similar data to those in the dataset.  
  
When I attempted to consider the new topics in physics from this perspective, I came to the following conclusion. In the holographic principle, the 2-dimensional space where the data that ensures the existence of knowledge is found is concretized by the universe into a 4, 10, or 11-dimensional space. I've tried thinking about other topics in physics from this perspective, but I haven't written them here.  
  
. . .  
  
I've reflected on some of the ideas I shared before and developed new ones.  
  
Let's imagine a chessboard with coins on each square. In the first scenario, the coins are arranged with heads on one half and tails on the other. In the second scenario, the heads and tails are randomly distributed. The entropy is lower in the first scenario and higher in the second. When we consider this system over time, entropy will always increase due to statistics.  
  
The information in the first scenario is less than in the second because of the lower entropy. Systems with low entropy typically have less disorder, requiring less information to describe, such as ""heads on one half, tails on the other."" In the second scenario, almost every square's state needs to be individually described, representing the information in the second scenario.  
  
Now, let's think about data instead of information. Are the data in the first and second scenarios different? No, the sizes of the data (raw data) are the same in both cases. This is because we use 64 data points to represent the two states of 64 different squares. These data go through a kind of compression algorithm, and we obtain more abstract, called information, like ""half heads, half tails.""  
  
Let's consider these scenarios over time. At the beginning, we have a chessboard with low entropy, easily describable in a single sentence. At the end, it's describable only in 64 different sentences. As time progresses, entropy always increases. The increasing ""information"" mentioned in the increasing entropy is the degree of abstraction the system allows us, i.e., the maximum level of abstraction used. If we had wanted, at the beginning, instead of maximizing abstraction, we could have used 64 different sentences, but we didn't because we maximized the level of abstraction, which makes more sense in everyday life.  
  
By the way, the ""abstraction limit"" I mentioned here is the highest level of abstraction without loss of information. There's always some loss of information in each abstraction process, but in abstractions where the limit isn't exceeded, there's no loss of information.  
  
As entropy increases, our ability to abstract decreases. If we can't abstract enough, how will we convey information? We won't; we'll only convey its appearance, its observable part. We'll convey its ""randomness."" Apart from stochastic systems, there's no ontological randomness in any system. If it's mentioned, it's because the data in that system couldn't be abstracted enough. And when we forcibly abstract, exceeding its limit, we'd see something like noise or randomness emerging. Calling these data random due to their inability to be abstracted leads to significant data loss. For example, with the sentence from the first scenario, we could indeed arrange the chessboard without needing more information, but with the sentence from the second scenario, i.e., with the ""random"" information, we can't definitively arrange the chessboard in that ""randomness.""  
  
Most abstraction processes result in information loss due to exceeding their limit. In everyday life, a natural language is an example of this in abstract concepts. Expressing some concepts in natural languages and conveying their information to others is very difficult. This indicates that the abstraction limit for these concepts is low. We can say that the entropy of these concepts is high."

In discussions that often involve skepticism, someone will often say you wouldnt apply such a high level of skepticism to every day claims. For example, if a friend said they bought a cup of coffee that morning, you wouldn't be skeptical of that.

And I disagree. We can apply the highest level of skepticism.

1) Whether they did buy the coffee or not likely wont affect anything in our lives, so high skepticism is free.

2) Rejecting their claim doesn't affect anything. It still remains an anecdote, whether fiction or not. It doesn't have to be true.

3) Having rejected the claim, nothing about skepticism says how one must act in response. We are still free to act like it is true."

You can’t buy consent to sex in any meaningful way. It’s just coercing somebody into letting you commit violation on them. You know in your mind, body, soul, psyche, etc. when you are engaged in a sex act you don’t want to do, with somebody you don’t want to have sex with. It’s not comparable to actual work which doesn’t involve sexual intimacy.  
Commodifying something invasive, personal, which exists to create families and psychologically bond partners is just a horrible formula. Sex is more than just letting somebody rent a hole, sex has the power to traumatize deeply & profoundly even in situations where it IS wanted, regardless of dissociation or firm beliefs otherwise.  
To me, buyers of prostitutes are just more civilized and socially acceptable rapists. They both get off on the power to obtain sexual thrill off of a woman who they would never gain sexual access too under healthy circumstances. They both see a woman as an object and both feel entitled to some kind of guaranteed sex.  
To anybody who might say this is insulting of “actual” rape, sexual abuse is a spectrum. People also thought marital rape was a foolish concept. Please think before you invalidate a rape because it lacked aspects like surprise or threat. Also consider the particularly predatory nature of “sex tourism”."

27,2024-03-12,CMV: A pistol caliber carbine is the best long gun for home defense in most cases,u/DaleGribble2024,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bcz9bn/cmv_a_pistol_caliber_carbine_is_the_best_long_gun/,changemyview,"Ammo for pistols like 9mm and 45 ACP can be common and affordable to buy for training purposes and for actual home defense, while 5.56, 7.62x39, 300 blackout and 12 gauge buckshot are often more expensive per round than comparable pistol ammo.

The recoil of PCC’s is usually comparable to 5.56 and the potential for overpenetration from shooting PCC’s is neglibile if shots are on target and hollow point ammunition is used. Shotguns usually have much higher recoil than rifles and PCC’s.

The noise levels of a PCC are lower than with a shotgun or an AR-15 or similar rifle chambered in an intermediate cartridge. In a test that I will link below, a 5.56 AR15 clocks in at 158.9 dB, a Remington 870 12 gauge with 2.75” shells has a 155.2 dB rating while a compensated auto ordinance Tommy gun chambered in 45 ACP has a 151 dB rating.

With the sound level in mind, you can run subsonic ammo with PCC’s and have much more bullet weight than a subsonic 5.56 as a point of comparison. Bullet expansion for subsonic pistol rounds is much more reliable than that of rifle rounds at subsonic velocities.

If you’re curious, a ballistics gel test that also tests overpenetration of rifles, pistols and shotguns in a home defense scenario can be found here from Pew Pew Tactical…

19,2024-03-12,cmv: Honestly missionaries are evil.,u/AliceInCookies,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bczc1b/cmv_honestly_missionaries_are_evil/,changemyview,"Reminds of how the US or other countries offer aid with food, but not the supplies to make their own food, so they become dependent on the aid.

""being a missionary but as i grew up i realized there’s a lot more to his job than teaching ppl the “right” religion. 

He helps build houses, work with food relief, translate between locals and foreign humanitarians, etc.""

The standard modus operandi of the Salvation Army is conditions on their assistance. 

Attend their chapel or no help - I know this from working for them, and from a client perspective.  

This is standard for Mission Services as well.

Christians have been using god to travel around the world and destroy cultures for centuries.

There's a difference between being a missionary and colonizing, though the line is so thin it's barely there.

In theory missonaries are not evil because in theory they would simply be providing service and sharing elements of their belief and culture but in practice they often use material wealth to force their religious beliefs on other while denigrating local customs and beliefs.

Religiously oriented mission work is, yes, always evil. 

No matter how kind the missionary may be, it's a fundamental imbalance of power. 

Once an individual has accepted the life-saving medical help, construction work, etc, they're captive to the preaching. 

Ministry has no place in relief efforts and it's insidious and manipulative. 

When it's taken to other countries, it's unavoidably colonial.

Missionary work, at its core, is a conversion attempt. 

It’s rooted in discriminatory evils and was actually popularized to make the church more powerful via money and political support. 

You can read all about it if you read up on the history of the church. 

Volunteering? Beautiful, helpful, everyone should do it.

 “Volunteering” for the sake of popularizing your beliefs? Not okay.

The idea of traveling the world to tell people Who Didnt Ask that their beliefs are wrong in the hopes that they'll adopt your beliefs seems sinister...  
  
Don’t even want to talk about how they specifically target poor people, and hold basic necessities over their heads in exchange for faith.

If you want to do charity you could join the many non profit and secular ones that also exist. 

No help or free aid comes without interest, and it's kind of insulting how people who are sharing your missionary experiences claim ignorance in the role they're playing like ""we gave these desperate people exactly what they needed, but we never preached to them! 

Missionaries be like “ you don’t believe in our god so you get no food”

They voluntarily join our churches after we gave them free stuff!""

Supposedly ""good missionaries do other things than spread the word of god. 

Some start homes for orphans in poor countries. 

Some provide schools for children in lower-income countries, too. 

Usually, they do this under God’s name. 

Basically, they do good things for other people for God, with God, and by God, but they keep preaching to a minimum.""

If you wanna share your religion, do it through your loving actions. 

Don't go force it on people. 

If they ask, great. 

If you ask politely and they say no, back off. 

Not everyone has to share the same passionate beliefs to have a great life.

If you want to help someone else in a poor country, go join a non-profit, work on international policy, or do a pr campaign. 

Don't go over there because you believe your religion is superior to theirs. 

Give them real help, not the help you selfishly think they deserve. 

They're not obligated to like you either. 

Help others because it makes you feel good; don't do it to brag. 

Help others using your talents.

""Brazilian and as such I can say that no, the Jesuit missions were anything but 'the best'. 

They tried to force their views on our natives, convinced them that they needed to be 'saved' and then used them as slaves (people can scream all they want that the natives did it out of their own liberty to choose, but I call bullshit) to build the missions. 

THEN these big places full of 'converted' natives were the perfect target for another group of 'heros' (bandeirantes, Portuguese men or descendants of them) that went after them and enslaved the natives to use them in agriculture and cattle raising. 

So no, what they did wasn't 'the best'at all.""

""I'm a former southern Baptist minister turned pagan - and even during my time as a minister, I had little to no respect for the missions boards. 

Most of the missionaries were brainwashed enough to truly think that they were helping others. 

But in reality, they were and are destroying cultures, families, and lives. 

It's colonization and now that I have left the faith and I've seen the man behind the curtain, it angers me even more.""

The main point of this post is: Why condemn other's cultural belief and force your own as superior? And whether the current missionaries are good or not, you can't ignore the history of colonialism, persecution, and coercion.

""Jesuits fucked up native American cultures here in north america. 

I'm aware there are differences in religions and their missionary work, make your peace with the idea that some people don't trust or like missionaries."""

LIKEWISE, I feel that if Trump were not running, the ego and machismo of Biden wouldn't make him feel like he had to defeat Trump personally and he'd be much more likely to not run.  


At the end of the day, I feel like this is a clear case of a Mexican standoff where both sides wont change because of Ego and fear of the unknown of change.  Unfortunately, each side's fear is what's keeping the otherside from doing the same kind of change.

Attempts to try and circumvent this is only going to lead further conflict. I would suspect that if their was a true attempt to circumvent it (such as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact) we would end up tied in in 30+ state cases and the Electoral College and certification would at least attempt to override it anyways, ending up also in court and for all those cases, the law would technically be against those pushing to use the popular vote as a decider. The case that it is collusion/fraud against states that were not part of the compact would be pretty easy to make.

46,2024-03-12,CMV: There’s no valid logic behind man paying for dates,u/FormerBabyPerson,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bd0maj/cmv_theres_no_valid_logic_behind_man_paying_for/,changemyview,"Now I don’t pay for dates to start. I always go Dutch because it makes the most sense. When it comes to paying for dates the most common reason I see is that it’s traditional gender norms. The response to this is something along the lines of if you’re accepting gender norms for this then you should accept them for other aspects of the date. 

From there someone brings up that men should pay for women because they pay for their makeup and clothes and take the time to look good and also because there’s a risk involved when meeting a man. I’ve also seen women say the risk of pregnancy and stds is a reason men should pray. It’s a bit absurd to me but it seems popular enough a and  if we’re being logical about who should pay and we’re using that as a baseline then:

1. We would need to calculate the amount of money both people have spent on their outfit and make up, then divide that by the amount of uses they are likely to get out of it.

2. If you’re getting paid for the amount of time you spent putting in effort before the date such as getting ready, then that would apply to both people as well as the time spent planning the date (doing research, making reservations, etc)

3. The charge for the risk of an std and pregnancy would only applying the event that sex is happening. Also the charge for risk of an std would negated if the person is able to supply a clean bill of health.

4. We would then calculate whose time is worth more. If I make 50$/hr and you make 30$/hr do we deduct the difference so now you pay me $20 for every hour I’m spending with you?

If we were to use logic there would be nothing that says a man should pay for the date. It would depend on numerous factors that would basically make the date a transaction. At least a few people seem to think otherwise so cmv"

Another one could be that a man drags the sun across the sky behind a horse drawn chariot.

Serious discussions does not mean college debates or similar discussions (even those those discussions may be ""serious"" in a different definition of the word).

My view is this way because I feel being able to make predictions is more important than anything else because we use those predictions to build new knowledge or develop new technology.

He definitely hasn’t helped himself with his smugness, lack of remorse or compassion, lying on the stand, and having to be repeatedly admonished for witness tampering. He’ll likely receive the Bernie Madoff treatment. 

He’s not Bernie Madoff though. Bernie Madoff was cold and calculating. He was an unabashed thief and knew his scheme would eventually ruin many lives including his own. He was riding the wave without caring how hard it would crash. His deception was calculated and he knew he was making victims of people he deceived. He knew they’d eventually lose everything. 

I genuinely believe SBF had every intention of his victims getting their money back. He knew full well what he was doing was reckless and illegal, but he wasn’t doing it to defraud, he was doing it to cut a corner and make more money. He didn’t see himself as stealing, he saw himself as doing something only he was brilliant enough to understand. I don’t believe SBF ever fully grew up. He may have been fiercely intelligent but his maturity never surpassed that of a 20 year old. The more you look into his relationships with partners, family, and colleagues, the more you’ll see this. 

To me, SBF was someone who was convinced that after becoming a billionaire in his 20s, he had the world figured out. He believed his scheme would pay off in the end. He believed his clients weren’t sophisticated enough to understand what he was doing with their money. He told them their money would be safe, because in his mind, it would. Sure he was holding their sack of cash over a flame, but risk taking is how he got rich. In SBF’s mind there was no risk not worth taking if there was a profit to be had. 

If Bernie Madoff was a murderer, SBF caused a fatal drunk driving crash. There’s a difference between intentional acts and extreme recklessness. Both should be punished, but one should be to a lesser degree. SBF may not give much of a reason to sympathize with him, but he’s not a monster, he just never grew out of the mind of a teenager. "

I could never fathom why people choose to let words offend/hurt them to such an extent that ensures the power of said word will never cease to exist.  
  
When people tried to explain why the n word ending in -ga was derived from the orginal -er, the reasoning behind it was to ""take away the power"" from the word. However, this clearly isn't true, since people continue to get deeply offended by both uses of the word by anybody who isn't black.  
  
So, I'm not quite sure I understand why the continued existence of the term, by adding a new variation of it, would ever be considered a *good* idea.  
  
Then there's one's like the ""r-slur"". This term used to be a medical term to describe people with an impaired intellectual and adaptive functionality. However, in 2010, Obama signed a law into legislation that federally adapted the medical term to change to ""intellectual disability"". You'd think that by ""taking away the power"" of the orginal term, it would no longer be offensive to people, right? Wrong.  
  
Once again, taking away the ""power"" of a slur doesn't do anything, it actually seems like people are MORE offended by the uses of them than ever before.  
  
So it begs the question: Why do we continue to fuel the power of these words by allowing it to offend us? They are just words. If we stopped allowing ourselves to be offended by these things, then people would stop these ""slurs"" as easy-access tickets to use against us to offend/upset/anger us.  
  
P.S. I just want to say that for people who will assume I've never been discriminated against, I am a Hispanic and when people call me a Mexican or say the common slur against me that is used against Latino people (both have happened), I don't get offended. There's no point. If I don't give power to the word(s) when used against me, it is useless againt me."

They claim companies are trying to ""deceive consumers by selling smaller sizes of their products without lowering prices.""  
The premise I'm accepting is that the recent USD inflation was caused by the government injecting massive amounts of capital into the economy over the past 4 years. I think that's widely-accepted. I'm also not stating any opinions or making any claims about those decisions, or the Fed's interest rate response.  
Bill that is proposed: [https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-senators-introduce-bill-to-crack-down-on-shrinkflation](https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-senators-introduce-bill-to-crack-down-on-shrinkflation)

&#x200B;

**Argument**: This is merely cheap political trick meant to deflect the blame for inflation onto businesses, and their proposed legislation would actually hurt poor and working people.   
When inflation occurs, it impacts costs for businesses, not just consumers: Fuel, space, raw materials, manufacturing equipment...everything. If now costs 20% more for a company to produce a loaf of bread, they are they are left with two choices: Raise the price of a loaf of bread - or - reduce product costs/quantity by making the loaves smaller (or some combination of the two). The goal is to adjust one or both of them in order to find a new price/quantity balance that is most attractive to customers.  
**My claims are:**  
**1) The US government deserves the blame for ""Shrinkflation""**  
Reducing quantity/sizes is a perfectly ethical and reasonable response to inflation. It is the only way businesses can still deliver their goods to the customer at an affordable price. It's also completely predictable. We cannot blame businesses for their costs increasing, and we cannot blame them for needing to maintain margins to operate their business and continue to grow. Given the two options available, we actually want to allow businesses the option to reduce quantity on some goods because it helps keep them affordable. We want businesses to make adjustments to meet the price sensitivity of consumers. Any response--whether raising prices or reducing quantity--is a direct result of inflation.

   
**2) Their recent invention and marketing of the term is just a political effort to deflect blame onto businesses**  
I was immediately suspicious about ""Shrinkflation"" because I read and heard it across the media landscape all at once. There were coordinated tweets and articles for the campaign. Coining and marketing ""Shrinkflation"" helps obfuscate the causes of inflation, which is very beneficial to Biden ahead of the election. I think it's also safe to predict that if these businesses chose to raise prices instead, Senator Warren, et. al. would be blaming corporate greed for price gouging and making products unaffordable.  
Additionally, labeling laws require packages to have the volume or weight, so consumers can see clearly how much they're getting. When politicians claim companies are 'deceiving' consumers, they undermine their own labeling regulations that companies are adhering to.  
**3) Their proposed legislation would actually hurt poor and working people.**  
This legislation mandates that companies cannot reduce product costs, so the only option remaining is to raise prices. This will disproportionally harm the poorest Americans, who are most-impacted by rising prices of basic goods."

Trump has no path to victory because he has no voters to flip. Let’s go through the list

- the young vote? Biden. Yes, young people hate biden but they hate trump more. No one is stupid enough to think trump would stop the killing in Gaza, so young people aren’t flipping over night. 
- the black vote? Lol. He won like 2% more black vote than any other GOP candidate before. But if a 2% swing I s the best the GOP can do, there’s no chance to win enough to call it more than the margin of error.
- Hispanic vote? Same logic as above. Maybe trump wins a little more with the Hispanic vote in Florida, but Florida’s been red since bush.
- women? Lol.
- college educated? Lmao.

So that leaves us with white men. Yes, trump does well with this group, but that’s not new. Trump needs to flip a demographic he didn’t get last election. I don’t see it. 

And no, from a legal perspective he can’t use the courts and process to flip the election. Most states passed bills to prevent this from possibly happening and the ones that didn’t aren’t generally swing states. Even if trump wanted to put in the legal work to flip the election at the courts, he doesn’t have the lawyers to do that. 

His only shot is the SC doing some actually treasonous shit. For which I doubt they’d do because, as trumps gonna learn, the SC is soulless. I hate it, but they don’t need trump in office to retain their seats. There’s nothing he can offer them."

I know people really dont like to think about this, but its absolutely true.

Then, a man comes along.

Countries that require men to have mandatory military service are the most misandrist places I’ve ever heard of. My friend from Singapore who is literally required to serve 2 years in the military always tells me how his female coworkers ridicule men for having a marginally higher bonus for giving up 2 years of their lives and serving like substandard humans. Similar thing happens in South Korea, where women (mainly the feminists) make fun of a guy’s masculinity if he doesn’t want to serve (somehow it’s still know as a misogynist nation 💀). In many countries’ histories, it was a well known fact that you needed to be conscripted to vote, but somewhere along the line, women gained the right to vote, and men still have the additional responsibility of having to serve in the military. In Switzerland, getting born in the wrong body means that you either give up your 20s, or pay a 3% additional tax (tax could never apply to women, because that’s obviously oppression). Before you bring up pregnancy, there’s a one word response for it: CHOICE. Men are required to slave away for 2 years of their most productive years while women get quotas for top leadership positions in companies (ex. Singapore, the worst in gender equality). People appreciate Finland for having a female PM, but honestly, it’s just an insult that someone who isn’t obligated to the same responsibilities is in a power of position. 

I’m pretty happy I’m no longer a citizen of a country that requires me to be a slave and protect a group of people who villainize and hate me, but I shouldn’t have to sign up for some dumb draft just to be eligible for student scholarships, when 50% of the population don’t have to do so.

Aside from most of the popular stories being fake - the page is just host to those looking to virtue signal (including the OPs). 

Despite the page being touted as a place for impartial judgement, it is exceedingly clear commenters that love to claim YTA do so for entertainment and not to provide actual advice that considers the complexities of real life. It really is heaven for those that enjoy putting others down - without having to suffer the consequences of someones feelings + the added bonus of anonymity. 

The top voted comments for each post are almost always unanimously in agreement - despite an alternative argument *mostly being available. When stripped down, it feels like people on this page love to point and express why someone else sucks - and then have others consolidate and affirm their opinion. Even in posts with NTA being the right answer, commentors will point out who else in story was the AH instead and why, also taking the time to shame often fictitious characters. 

It has devolved to the point where some posts are written with the intent of baiting out a certain answer - where OP is trying to validate his own feelings on a moral standpoint - whether the post is real or not. Some posts are absolutely stupidly bias, garnering “fake post” responses (Im talking like “my gf cheated on me, so i left her. aitah?”). Whereas other posts could be meticulously written, where OP has done something terrible, but is so well justified in the context of the story that people vote NTA. 

In the end, the reddit page just feels like a place for posters and commentors to flex their perceived moral superiority for entertaiment- with most, im sure, self aware enough to realize that most posts are fake (and not to be taken too seriously).

1,2024-03-12,"CMV: Goku was not a bad dad, he is at the very least a much better dad than Vegeta",u/Tall_Promotion_7160,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bdcxis/cmv_goku_was_not_a_bad_dad_he_is_at_the_very/,changemyview,"I'm tired of the Goku slander. He was in all measures a good dad to Goten and Gohan, much better than Vegeta was to his kid and people consider Goku to be a worse dad than Vegeta.

The first place people point to Goku being a bad dad is letting Gohan go to Namek. As far as literally every knew, Namekians were peaceful, the exception being Demon King Piccolo and Piccolo Jr. who were literally evil in manifest. He was not aware of Freeza's invasion of Namek or Vegeta attacking. As far as they knew, it was safe enough to send Gohan and Krillin by themselves. This isn't a terrible idea, as it's essentially sending your kid with on a trip with his uncle. The whole Freeza thing was just bad luck.

The next point is Goku refusing to come back to earth following Namek getting blown up. I think this is the only instance where Goku could be considered a bad dad, but keep in mind, Goku was training to learn one of the most useful techniques in the series. At this point, Goku is still earth's protector and has to get stronger. He also learns to control SSJ during this time, which is pretty useful and reasonable to want to do after facing Freeza.

For the Cell Saga, people point to Goku letting Gohan fight Cell as him being a bad dad which I think people only feel this way when they don't understand the plot. Gohan was built up to have a large amount of latent power that could come out when pushed hard enough. The only person who could push is Cell. Sure Gohan doesn't want to fight, but Goku did the equivalent of a dad trying to get his kid interested in sports when the kid  doesn't want to. Is it the wrong thing to do? No. But I don't think it makes goku a bad dad, and in the end, Goku was right. Cell pushed Gohan into surpassing everyone and becoming Earth's new protector.

The last thing I'll mention is Goku being dead for 7 years. This one is ridiculous as the entire reason for Goku remaining dead is to prevent people who want to kill him from attacking the planet and his friends/family. Piccolo Jr, Raditz, Vegeta, Freeza, the androids, and Cell all only did what they did in order to get Goku, and when Goku was dead, there was 7 years of peace, so again Goku was right. Sure it sucks he didn't get to see Goten for the first 7 years of his life, but he was staying dead to keep everyone safe. And don't you think after all Goku's done he's earned a rest after literally dying to save and his son?

Compare this to Vegeta who's a deadbeat when his son is born, then beats the shit out of his future son for trying to keep everyone safe, then never even holds his present son until he's about to kill himself after having a Super Saiyan midlife crisis and turning evil. Like he get's better but come on.

1,2024-03-12,CMV: It is unproductive to create philosophical ethics systems,u/MaybeJackson,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bde2g1/cmv_it_is_unproductive_to_create_philosophical/,changemyview,"I'm a philosophy major in college, and I'm coming to the conclusion that the creation and adherence to ethical systems is unproductive and inevitably deplorable. Therefore I believe normative ethical systems should not be followed or created. I instead propose that we follow our natural intuitions on decisions, with a singular caveat that I will explain further below\*\*\* 

There are two reasons I believe this: 

1. **Ethical theories are ultimately built off our intuitions of what is right or wrong**. Take Kantian Ethics, for instance. Emmanuel Kant proposed that we should adhere to ethical maxims, and as defined in the categorical imperative, that these maxims must be universalized. An example of a maxim Kant believed in is to never lie. My question is: what is the reason for never lying? Kant would say that it is to not ""use people as means."" Okay, why not use people as means? For whatever answer is brought up, you can always ask ""why"" again and ultimately you end up at intuitions. Same thing goes for utilitarianism. Utilitarians would say to pull the lever on the trolley problem, to save 5 lives at the expense of one. Why? ""to maximize happiness"" why maximize happiness? ""because happiness is the end to all actions"" but why should we pursue that end? why is that good? Again, the answer is the intuition that it feels like the correct thing to do. 
2. Since all ethical systems are ultimately built off of our pre-existing intuitions of what is right or wrong, systematizing and adding consistent normative rules to those intuitions ultimately ends up complicating things so much that the systems created have many moral holes. A principle like ""maximizing happiness"" may initially seem to align with our intuitions of what is right, but ends in scenarios in which we would have to murder innocent people to steal their healthy organs for those in hospital. Telling the truth may seem like a good maxim to follow, but it then entails telling a murderer where your hiding family is in the event of a break-in. **If our most famous and acclaimed ethical systems end up justifying acts that most would find deplorable, then there may just be something wrong with creating normative ethical systems.** 

\*\*\*There is an obvious counter-arguement to following moral intuitions however, and that is the fear that if we follow our initial gut instincts, mass harm may result. An example could be an angry mob wanting to lynch an innocent person for their idea of ""justice."" This is why I believe there should be a singular ethical maxim, which is that **we should hold sympathy for all people, regardless of our exterior opinions of them, all of the time**. Sane people never rape, murder, oppress, lynch, or commit genocide against those they hold compassion and sympathy for; it only happens when they lose their feelings of sympathy. So rather than creating ethical systems that aim at defining what is right or wrong, we should instead just aim to maintain sympathy, and afterwards make decisions based on our intuitions of what is right.

879,2024-03-12,CMV: It's not unreasonable to be sad or even depressed over a lack of sex.,u/Tall_Promotion_7160,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bde6ww/cmv_its_not_unreasonable_to_be_sad_or_even/,changemyview,"So hear me out, human's at the end of the day are animals with a drive to get that special serotonin boost that comes from sex. When someone is unable to get sex, they are doing something that goes against every evolutionary imperative we have. 

Aside from that being able to create and maintain relationships with other human's is a normal social skill that if you are lacking it makes you abnormal. No matter how you slice, it, it is not normal to be unable to form relationships. If this applies to friendships, it should make sense that it apply to romantic relationships as well. 

Romantic relationships are considered a normal part of social development that starts at youth. There's a reason why if someone is a 40 year old man who's never dated or had sex (exculding celibate or asexual people) they will get weird looks. Relationships, and by an extension sex is something that most humans expect to have at some point in their life, and it's a decently reasonable expectation. When you are say 20 and all your friends have dated and had sex, it can be distressing as you see the people around you progressing in a way you are failing to.

You begin to question what is wrong with you and why women don't like you in that way. I know some people say ""if you can't get laid it's 100% your fault 100% of the time"" but some people are just genuinely unlucky. If you believe it's possible for bad things to happen to good people, it's not consistent that someone unable to date is 100% at personal fault. 

Anyways, like I said earlier, you question why and what's wrong with you. Your self esteem takes a hit because it's literally a judgement of you and your attractiveness. It also get's worse as years go on. I'm a 23 year old virgin, I felt a lot less distressed about my inability to attract a woman at 18 than I do now. It's like interest, but sadness. 

I think it's only logical that this can lead someone through pretty rough paths emotionally. "

As such, Israel will not stop for threats that aren't similarly existential, and American support isn't a significant enough proportion of its defense budget and capacity to be vital.  
Israel can only be dissuaded by some carrot that meets its needs, and I can't think of anything but allowing Israel to strike Iranian targets (probably IRG bases) or doing it directly. Hamas, PIJ, Hezbola, and the Houthis are all Iranian proxies (such that Lebanon and Gaza can be described as Iranian colonies) and the Octopus Doctrine is an Israeli strategy (formulated by Naftali Bennett). It's possible that Biden is offering it behind the scenes, but I can't see any benefit to doing so and significant benefits to doing it openly (looking strong to Tehran and voters).

And one of the major solutions I see being talked about is that men need to focus more on platonic friendships and hobbies. 

Now. I'm pansexual, but happily in a relationship with a beautiful woman who I love and treasure. And for the sake of my argument here I'm going to list the things I've gained and the needs I've had met being in a relationship that Ive never had through platonic relationships. 

And I'll be up front. One of the major things I feel will be needed to change my mind is an outline on how the average man can have those same needs mostly met through platonic friends without needing to find new ones in more ""progressive"" populations that are less homophobic and averse to male on male intimacy among other things. 

So to start. 

We split rent for a one bedroom space. This means we can go out more often and afford a better quality of life. My friends have never wanted to share a room.

We share chores and housework. When she's working I make the meals. When im working she does. We both do the dishes. But I do stuff like laundry and cleaning the toilet because she doesn't like those things. So she takes care of the chores I don't like. My friends don't live with me. They live with their partners. 

We can lean on one another financially. She works freelance, no clients equals no pay. She still pays her bills but I can make sure we both have good groceries for the week because I know she'll get the next batch.  And vice versa. My friends may offer a meal or a couch to stay on. But I can't rely on them. 

We can lean on one another emotionally. If she's having a bad day or her anxiety flares up I can be there to hold her and calm her down. And when I'm feeling hurt or upset or lonely. She's there to hold and cuddle me. My friends only really cuddle or hold their partners and family. 

We help each other with our body image/self esteem.   She compliments me when she sees me naked. She makes me feel like I'm attractive and desirable and I do the same. My friends don't want to see me without clothes. 

We help one another with our self esteem and aesthetic choices. We can go clothes shopping together and point out things that one another would look good in. And I can ask her if I look like shit and get an honest answer. My male friends don't see clothes shopping as social and my female friends don't like a guy tagging along. 

There's plenty more I could think of if I gave this some time and effort but the overarching point is that there are numerous benefits to being in a romantic relationship that simply aren't reasonable to ask for from platonic friends

Men making more friends won't change the fact that society still largely expects people to ""pair up""

Embryonic stem cell research briefly came into the public consciousness through the South Park episode ""Kenny Dies"", which unfortunately peddled the misconception that it gets its cells from aborted fetuses, [a misconception 2/5 of respondents claim to believe to this day](https://news.umich.edu/survey-nearly-70-percent-of-public-supports-embryonic-stem-cell-research) (and I'm not sure pretending to would necessarily be much better). Right off the bat, it doesn't; fetal tissue is not pluripotent enough, it needs IVF; but at least it drew attention to the fact that the stakes are *life and death.*

&#x200B;

Now, fast-forward to '04. Despite the life and death stakes, the compromise the public agreed to by re-electing Dubya was ""ok, you have the right to conduct this research, but we draw the line at funding it with other people's tax dollars."" Which frankly plays right into big pharma's hands, as we've no way of knowing if they'd sabotage cures that are less profitable than treatments. So every argument used against public funding; or at least every argument against public funding a majority of its opponents failed to challenge; is fair game.

&#x200B;

And one of those arguments was ""life begins at conception.""

&#x200B;

I'm not sure if that argument is popular. Abortion access is popular, but that could be more because of the perceived self-defense angle than any objections to the at-conception argument; most supporters of abortion access don't actively distance themselves from the self-defense angle, with the exception of myself and a few others.

&#x200B;

Yet all of a sudden, now that in-vitro fertilization is being held back by the exact same thing, *now* it's ""oh, they wouldn't say sperm cells are life, that would hurt men."" Where were such people during debates over embryonic stem cell research? Even if they only opposed *public funding* for it, they should have called BS just as vocally against the ""life begins at conception"" crowd in that context as in any other. To do anything less is deceit by omission, which is never accepted in *any* other context. If someone pretended homophobia were religion's fault, even to save lives by reducing religiosity and getting more stem cell research funding, homophobes and non-homophobes alike, theists and anti-theists alike, etc... would have *all* condemned them. Yet if one were to treat deceit-by-omission as a ""partly your own fault"" moment for someone who can't have kids because of the ""life begins at conception"" BS they let slide in other contexts, it'd be considered insensitive.

&#x200B;

Likewise on abortion. Most of those who consider the self-defense angle valid; and at least some of those who consider the ""1st to 2nd trimester fetuses are insentient, and 3rd trimester fetuses are so often medically necessary to abort we should trust doctors over ignorant local voters on this one"" argument relatively more valid; treat getting pig and human embryos mixed up as proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the millions of voters who still oppose access to abortion just want an ""excuse to control women"". To control them in which direction is never specified. Toward the housewife lifestyle? Aborting until one's BF finishes college would make the housewife lifestyle more likely to be feasible, not less. Toward monogamy? Casual sex with rich guys could more easily keep her out of poverty than monogamous sex with a middle class BF should the condom break. Even without these caveats, I'd still think the burden of proof needs to be a lot higher before claiming to know someone's motives. And then we wonder why voters to whom these assumptions are not applicable start asking themselves what else abortion access supporters could be wrong about? Would *you* trust the judgment of someone who made false assumptions about yourself?

&#x200B;

To be fair, a majority of respondents *do* claim to support this research, and a narrower majority to support *some* public funding, but it's a *hell* of an afterthought. They didn't think it reflected poorly on Dubya's other policies that they came from the same campaign that ran on opposing gov't funding for this. They didn't think it reflected poorly on McCain to be Dubya's successor, Romney to be McCain's, or Trump to be Romney's. They didn't howl from the rooftops about how South Park got it wrong, *even when otherwise criticizing South Park*. (Critics of the messages to episodes like The F Word or Death Camp of Tolerance dared not use South Park's inaccuracies on ESCR to further bolster their argument against South Park's messages even further, for instance. Downplaying the hatefulness of sexuality slurs is pretty mild compared to smearing something that had the potential to save millions of lives.) Again, even if you think they don't care about the lives that could've been saved, they should've at least cared about the de facto deceit by omission that is failing to refute the ""life begins at conception"" argument in that context.

&#x200B;

I support in vitro fertilization, but I feel it almost unnecessary to point out. Popular opinion almost *overwhelmingly* supports it right now. I'm worried I'd feel bad about dogpiling any further on its already outnumbered opponents.

Yes, he was great in his prime, and went on to brutally destroy his opponents in this said era. 

The problem is, his prime didn’t last very long. It was only a few years later when we started to see Mike Tyson crumble and not perform to his greatest ability.

Teddy Atlas once said that Mike Tyson had it all, but when faced with a formidable opponent in front of him, he’d always find a way out because he couldn’t rise up to the elite status. A good example of this is against Evander Holyfield. He struggled in that fight, so decided to bite his ear to look for a way out without it looking like he ‘quit’. 
I believe Atlas said that Mike Tyson is 0-5, because everytime an opponent showed heart and determination, it was almost always too much for Mike to handle."
66,2024-03-12,CMV: Society is disgustingly unforgiving and punishments of all kind are far too extreme,u/Sentient-Bread-Stick,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bdhvx7/cmv_society_is_disgustingly_unforgiving_and/,changemyview,"This applies to everything. Social issues, crimes, ideological differences, etc, but to keep this simpler it will be focusing on the legal justice system and crime.

The purpose of punishment is to stop something negative from happening again. If someone is not going to do a negative action again, there is no point in punishing them, and doing so is cruel and unnecessary, no matter how wrong or unusual their actions were. By that point, it is no longer justice, and instead just pointless vengeance, which accomplishes nothing.

Take crime as an example. If someone commits a crime, the most important thing should be why they committed it. Once the motive is known, the appropriate actions and if absolutely necessary, punishment, can be taken. If someone has no need to do something again, they do it need to be punished.

I am not suggesting to let people go without consequences. Rather, instead of punishment they should have to fix the crime.

Say someone shoplifted an item from a store. They get caught and are arrested.

Three example motives:

1. Their motive was that they were having major financial problems and felt they had no choice but to steal to afford basic needs.

2. They are a kleptomaniac and genuinely have trouble controlling how they steal things.

3. They stole for no apparent or logical reason (such as to spite the store, or as a dare, or something like that).

In the first scenario, the thief should not be punished in any way. They felt they had no choice but to steal. They should instead be given financial assistance to keep them stable.

In the second scenario the person should not be punished, but it would make sense to have them pay for what they stole. They should then be given help, such as a psychologist of some kind, to help them stop having uncontrollable urges to steal.

The third scenario could have a punishment (assuming it’s not a first offense, in which case they should only have to pay for what they stole) such as in addition to paying for damages a short amount of time in jail, possibly a week at absolute most for second offense and more jail time each time they repeat the crime.

If someone committed or is committing a crime for any reason, no matter how extreme, they should be able to stop and turn themselves in and ask for help for a major reduction in punishment, especially if it comes from a psychological or emotional urge or feeling they want to stop. Someone who is willing to change and not repeat their crimes should not be punished since punishment for something that will not happen again is pointless and cruel.

(This part will probably get backlash) If someone commits an extremely violent crime and refuses to stop, such as mass murdering or if someone is in the middle of a major armed robbery (among the lines of organized hostage group heist), and refuses to turn themselves in even after being given the offer, then taking them in to prison is pointless, because punishment would not solve that. If someone deliberately commits harmful major crimes (to clarify, this would be like if someone is actively robbing a bank or a mass murderer caught and on the run) and refuses to ask for help after being given a chance, then it shouldn’t be wrong to harm them back.

In other words (aka no sugarcoating) if someone is unnecessarily constantly committing hyper violent and won’t even try to stop, it makes more sense to kill them than arrest them. 

That (though a bit oversimplified) covers the “extreme punishments” claim. However, that is only half the issue. This is not the legal system, but societal expectations:

With our current society, someone can spend fifty times what they deserve in prison yet still be rejected and hated by society. Someone who has changed as a person or solved the situation causing them to commit crimes is still punished socially. Ex-convicts are less likely to get hired, are unable to vote, etc.

Society rejects people who have committed crimes, which makes it harder for them to re-enter society, which makes them more likely to commit crimes, creating a loop of injustice.

People need to be more forgiving, ESPECIALLY when someone has already faced punishment and/or has changed or improved. No matter what they did in the past, if they’re a different person now, then they’re a new person, and should be viewed as such.

As I said in the very beginning; this is not limited to crime and the justice system and applies to almost every social issue.

Basically:

Almost every kind of punishment people use is far too severe and extreme and society is too cruel and unforgiving on people who have already faced those punishments."

We were not meant to be naked, erotic, and reproductive beings for eternity.

We were meant to be beings of one of the two sexes, clothed beauty, spiritual beauty, and non-erotic love.

These laws are disguised as “protecting weak and vulnerable minority groups” but they are really just tools to silence free speech. Hate speech is a subjective term. What you find offensive might not actually be offensive in the eyes on others. If I were to say “hey you are fat you need to lose weight for your health”, one person might be appreciative that I’m looking out for their wellbeing, while another might be severely offended. See what I mean? Who are you to dictate what’s considered hate speech? The only correction would be to give that authority to government which would become a dictatorship. Anytime a government is trying to control what you can or cannot say is most likely an authoritarian regime. The ones currently trying to impose these laws are in fact authoritarian who are disguising themselves are virtue signaling angels.

I can't stand Trump, DO NOT want him as President, but I'm a political conservative.   Here is what bothers me about all these legal cases against him:            
  
Almost all the crime was stuff Trump did WHILE President, but he was out by January of 2021. Why did it take so long to file all these cases ? It seems like when it became obvious he was going to run again, and that he had a chance of winning, all of the sudden all these cases get filed ? Anyway, here are the facts:  
  
New York State: Real Estate Value Fraud   -   ""Crime happened way before 2016 ""  
Case filed In the fall of 2022  
  
Manhattan: Stormy Daniels Hush Money   -   sex happened before 2016. Also, Stormy specifically said she did not enjoy the sex, one of the great moments in TV news history.  Thnx Anderson Cooper.  
Case filed In March 2023  
  
Department of Justice: Mar-a-Lago Classified Documents   -   Docs moved to Florida in early 2021.  
Charges filed in June 2023.  
  
Fulton County: Georgia Election Subversion   -    Crime happened in late 2020.  
Obtained indictment in August 2023.  
  
Trump was going around hinting broadly in public and NOT SUBTLE that he was going to run for President again in the Summer of 2022. Didn't actually declare his run until Nov. 2022. You see what I'm saying ?   Sure was a hurry to file a bunch of cases AGAINST TRUMP AFTER 2022....Sure was a legal emergency, eh ?  
  
My final point is this, Trump lost a civil liability suit over supposedly raping this Carroll ""lady""...and penalty was Almost $92 Million.   I sure didn't see much hard evidence, just her testimony.     But Bubbha Clinton had the State Troopers bring Paula Jones up to his Hotel room, that is hard evidence.   Then he flashed his EXTRAORDINARY pee pee...and his legal penalty ???   Not even 1 Million dollars.  92 Million versus 1 Million ???   In what world is that fair ?    Imma continue to pray that Trump falls into an interdimensional Portal so I never have to see him on TV again..."

There are far too many hypocritical people telling others how to live, especially in a harmful way. This advice is then used further and creates impossible scenarios which are further used to dismiss issues people are facing.

My solution:
Heavy penalties (eg. Jail time) if the following conditions are met:
1. You have enough influence and reach (eg. At least 10000 people will be able to read or hear what you are saying)
2. You are advocating a lifestyle that you either have never consumed or are doing the exact opposite of what you are telling others to do
3. You have not had a permanent change of view. If you have you must make it clear why your previous lifestyle was wrong.

My targets:
1. Priests telling you to follow the bible while not doing the same themselves
2. Influencers pretending to live luxuriously while struggling to get by
3. Politicians signing anti abortion bills while having abortions themselves
4. Economists creating budgets for poor people while knowing nothing about it

232,2024-03-13,CMV: The North American tipping system is broken and being exploited,u/lookingforfinaltix,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bdlapx/cmv_the_north_american_tipping_system_is_broken/,changemyview,"I will preface this post by saying I am located in Toronto, Canada. The reason this is relevant is because in Ontario, waiters and waitresses now make minimum wage (by-law). The reason tipping was instilled in the first place as because employers could pay their waiters/waitresses below minimum wage and the employees depended on tips to make a livable wage. Now, they make $15.50 CAD minimum per hour. Despite this change, tipping culture has not changed, and it has actually gotten worse. Regardless, this is still a minute point in the grand scheme of my argument. 

My best friend's girlfriend has been a waitress for 4 years. She is 21 years old, relatively attractive, caucasion (highly relevant), and has built a reputation that has enabled her to work at some great restaurants. For those of you familiar with these chains, she works at The Keg, the Firken chain, and at a few nightclubs in Toronto. She was studying bio-medical sciences at a prestigious university in southern Ontario but recently dropped out. When I found out why it blew my mind and I instantly wanted to make this post. 

According to my buddy, his girlfriend made $121,000 this past tax year as a freaking waitress. I couldn't believe it. She made so much money, that she has started loaning friends and family her money and charging them interest that is cheaper than the bank in return to grow her money. Last weekend, she made $1800 as a waitress, and makes anywhere between $1000-$2500 every weekend. When I asked how, he told me its all in the tips. 

Firstly, she works at a couple nightclubs in Toronto. However, the clubs also serve food. She is not a bartender. These clubs are considered 'luxury' and are the types of places to charge $40 for a simple dish. Most tabs run between $200-$1000 not including the alcohol. Same thing goes for The Keg. A relatively expensive steakhouse where a dinner for two with wine runs about $150-$450. She makes 15-30% in tips on EACH BILL. She's working 8-12 hour shifts, serving 2-3 tables per hour. When I do the math, it all adds up. For example, if she serves 3 tables at the Keg (which gets busy almost every night at dinner time), even at the lowest end of the average ($150), if she gets a 20% tip, she's making thirty dollars in tips per table. IN her 8-12 hour shift, DURING WHICH SHE IS ALSO MAKING MINIMUM WAGE, if she serves 30 tables she's making $900 in one f\*\*\*\*\*\*\* night just in tips! That is not including the $124 she makes for an hour shift in minimum wage she doesn't need to split with the rest of the waiting team. On the weekend, she's doing even better numbers at the night club where she works 6:00 pm - 3:00 am.

I don't know about you folks, but I don't think this is right. While I am all for her making her money, I just find it blasphemous that she can make that much doing an entry-level job. It only takes a small amount of skill and interpersonal traits to work your way up into these restaurants (along with some attractiveness and racial bias). My friend has told me that since she is caucasian, all she has to do with flirt with the immigrant customers and they tip her like crazy. She is making the same amount of money as a pharmacist, dentist, engineer, etc. All jobs that require highly specialized skills and years of school and training. If you can, change my mind that this is not an exploit of the tipping culture we have  created in North America. I don't think anywhere in Europe can someone make this type of money as a waitress.

 Western support has practically come to a halt and the Russian millitary is only getting stronger and stronger, it is said that Russia has been able to recruit ~30,000 people per MONTH, their advancements in doctrine and weaponry are only increasing, and the Russian defensive lines are nearly impenetrable for Ukrainian forces. Also, it seems that the Ukrainian millitary can no longer put up a adequate resistance. Ukrainian air power seems to be practically nonexistent, casualties have been extremely high, the average age of a Ukrainian fighter is 43, new Ukrainian troops are given about 3 weeks of training, and then sent to assault heavily fortfited positions, now I'm sure that Russian troops are equally poorly trained dip-shits, but Russia can easily replace its losses with more dirt poor minorities while Ukraine cannot. 


 Without the west Ukraine is cooked, and I don't think people really care anymore. With the Isreali-hamas conflict attention has shifted away from the Ukrainian peoples dire calls for help, and with the possibility of Trump winning the election Ukraine has never needed more attention.

I know a lot of redditors don't like the pope, I'm not a huge fan of him myself, but I think he was onto something when he called for peace. I believe that a Ukrainian victory is impossible at this point, and brave men are being sent to there graves to what seems like delaying the invetiable. I think that a negotiated peace with Russia is the best option now and that it should be done sooner better than later.

Thanks for listening to my rant, in reality I know nothing about war, and I'm probably spewing a bunch of retarted nonsense. Please excuse my bad Grammer and spelling, English is not my first language. I'd really like to hear your guys opinions on this, if I'm wrong and my opinion is dumb id like it a lot if you could throughly explain to me why. "

Social Security is rapidly approaching a demographic crisis and the program will require drastic changes to remain solvent.

When the program first started, Social Security had 42 workers paying into the program for every 1 retiree collecting.

Due to retirees living longer and younger generations having fewer children, that ratio has decreased to 3-1 and is projected to decrease to 2-1 within the next two decades.

The average income in the United States is around $63k.

The average Social Security benefits are around $30k.

This means that once the worker to retiree ratio hits 2-1 every worker will need to be taxed 25% of their income in Social Security alone for the program to remain solvent.

The current Social Security tax is 6.2% (12.4% including employer contributions), less than half of what is required to keep the program solvent.

And this is even after assuming the Income Cap is completely eliminated.

Drastic changes will therefore need to be made to Social Security above and beyond eliminating the Income Cap.

These changes will likely require some combination of:

1.  Reducing the benefits

2.  Increasing the tax

3.  Raising the retirement age - which effectively reduces the benefits and raises the tax

TL;DR

Social Security has decreasing ratio of workers contributing compared to retirees collecting.

This will eventually force drastic changes to the program involving some combination of tax increases and/or benefit cuts."
1,2024-03-13,"CMV: With very few exceptions, the writer or an aspiring writer MC in a novel is a sign of laziness and lack of ambition of the author (and, by proxy, the story)",u/green_carnation_prod,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bdpbt4/cmv_with_very_few_exceptions_the_writer_or_an/,changemyview,"In many areas of our life there is an unchecked and accepted bias similar to this one. For example, most psychological studies rely on psychology student samples. This generally means that psychological studies might not be actually as accurate as we would hope in representing all other groups of people that they aim to represent. However, I can see how this might be difficult to fix: for a university researcher, getting a sample of psychology students is much cheaper and significantly more feasible than convincing anyone outside of the psychology programs to participate in a study at a university lab during work days.

Therefore, while this bias is unwanted and unfortunate, it is somewhat understandable. 

This is not the case with a writer who writes about writers. A writer is not bound by people available to them - they can do research and write about any profession they want, especially if it is not a big part of the story (i.e. it doesn’t matter who gets haunted by a ghost of a 19th century murder victim, a writer, a frontend developer, a lawyer, or an event manager). Choosing to write about a full-time writer is most certainly a lazy choice, not the lack of resources matter. 

There are also cases when the MC being a writer is extremely relevant to the plot, and therefore makes sense. An overdone example, but John Watson being a writer is not just lazy writing — it is part of why he is useful to Holmes and what makes him Holmes’ equal partner rather than just some dude who gets dragged around from a crime scene to a crime scene (not knowing how to modernise this part of his character, in my opinion, is what made Watson suck in the BBC Sherlock, Watson ceases being an equal partner to his friend and becomes an annoying nagging dude with some military training - which mostly is not useful either). In Misery, the MC being an author is extremely relevant because this is very much the reason why the main villain kidnaps and tortures him. 

However, this is not how it usually works out when the writer decides to write about a writer.

This applies broadly from peeking over a shoulder during a test to copying homework.   


When you break it down, nepotism and having any sort of backdoor connection to access a job/position/whatever is fundamentally the same thing - it is access to a resource that others do not have, that allows someone to defy the rules of an institution. You cannot morally justify nepotism while also condemning regular cheating. By proxy, if nepotism is allowed (and it is - across all strata and fields of work), then cheating, no matter how it takes places, can also be justified. "

But despite that, there are situations and people that cannot be resolved just by talking, in which ideals clash and can only be resolved through some sort of conflict (not necessarily warlike), which is part of nature. Conflict exists and therefore enemies do too.

The second was put on by a local beer company.

In the first one, myself and about three hundred other candidates showed up with our resumes ready to sit down with someone and chat. Many of us in attendance were sick of online applications and were really hoping to get some face-to-face time with managers with the goal of scheduling later interviews. Obviously we couldn't be hired on the spot (especially for a government job), but I think many job seekers were hoping, at minimum, to talk to a manager about their work experience and skill set so that they could be referred to a specific position and then schedule an interview for that role at a later date. 

However, that is not how the job fair turned out. We would approach a table of an organization like the city prison or the parks department and be given a piece of paper that had instructions for how to apply online. There weren't an interviews to be offered, nor could we schedule any with a manager or recruiter. I found this useless. I and everyone else in attendance knew we could apply online. There wasn't any actual benefit to being there if we couldn't at least schedule an interview with someone. 

In comparison, last year I also attended a job fair for a local beer company where I walked in with my resume, talked to a recruiter about the roles I was interested in, and was given an on the spot interview for an open role with a manager. This was much better because it resulted in me bypassing annoying online application systems and the chance to stand out amongst other candidates.

In doing a little bit of research, it seems my experience with the government sponsored job fair is somewhat common. Applicants turn up, resume in hand, dressed professionally, all prepped, but are simply told to ""apply online."" There is no real benefit for the candidates in these situations.

The part I don't agree with is the many comments stating that the soon to be husband should reconsider his friendship with his friend because he cheated.
In my opinion being a bad partner does not automatically equate to being a bad friend, father, sibling etc. Cheating is horrible and I am not trying to excuse it but I couldn't rationalize cutting off a friend for it, unless they roped me into it or had me cover for them unknowingly.
Edit: So far in this thread cheating has been compared to murder, kicking a dog, domestic/child abuse, and rape. Basically if your not ostracizing a cheater you might as sell support all of that as well. Also your partner will probably end up cheating on you.

With a spoon's curved shape, I can smoothly glide over my bread or toast, getting a nice even spread without any tearing. Plus, the deeper bowl of the spoon holds more spread, so I don't have to keep going back for more. It's just way more efficient, you know?

When I use a knife, sometimes it feels like I'm wrestling with my bread, trying to get the spread to cooperate. The straight edge of the knife just doesn't hug the contours of the bread like a spoon does. And don't even get me started on spreading softer stuff like cream cheese or jam with a knife – it's like trying to spread butter on a hot pan!

But with a spoon, it's like magic. I scoop up the perfect amount of spread and effortlessly glide it over my bread, getting an even layer every time. Plus, I have more control over how much spread I'm putting on, so I don't end up with a lopsided sandwich or a soggy piece of toast.

Overall, spreading with a spoon just makes my life easier. It's quicker, smoother, and way less frustrating than using a knife."

Allow me to illustrate the current system: 

Let’s say you have a test coming up for a history/anthropology class. For weeks, your teacher has gone over multiple regions, languages, geographies, and so on. It will be a comprehensive test requiring the in depth study of numerous places and time periods. You study alone, or even with friends for several hours and look over notes and assignments. You go to take the test. Regardless of score, you’ll forget the content within a few months. Your overall takeaway from the class was minimal. This is the reality for most classes in school.

Here’s the better idea:

You have the same test for the same class. Your teacher has spent much less time covering the content and only skimmed over what all will be on the test (a list of regions, important people, etc.), overall giving a very broad and shallow view to the test material. Now when you study, you essentially must collaborate with others, and divvy up the researching of material relevant to what you will be tested on (ex. One person studies a historical figure, another studies a cultural group, another studies a geographic region, etc.). Then, you will be tested, not on the broad ideas from class, but from specific details you were supposed to figure out. Ideally these tests will be taken as a class, where everyone can contribute their own findings. As long as people found the information required of them, the class should pass the test easily. 

It may be rough at first but instead of taking away nothing from the class, you’ve gained research and collaboration skills and have learned to work with others while contributing to a group, which is a far more useful life skill than rote memorization.

It may sound crazy but this idea reminds me of a scene from Naruto where the ninjas are taking an exam. The ninja are all from very different cultures/cities and have different techniques/cultures. They are all given the same test that has hyper specific questions that no one knows *all* the answers to, yet a correct answer to each individual question is known by at least one person. Essentially, the whole class together would get 100%, but individually, they’d fail. The test was really to see who could gather intel the best, and those that did passed. 

Tests for younger students/general education should test collaboration, information gathering, and teamwork.

I’m shy, so naturally, everyone either ignores me or treats me with the barest minimum of kindness and respect. And that makes sense, what is there to like about an introverted person? Friendships are transactional. People who are entertaining or have something to offer make friends. People who aren’t, don’t.
 I’m unable to talk or act normally until i’m comfortable with someone and have validation that they like me. But how would anyone like me if I don’t talk? I’m not funny, I’m not entertaining, and even though I have a very interesting life story I’m so introverted that I come across as one of the most boring people you know.

The only introverts who can make friends are the ones who are good at acting like they’re not introverts. But if they’re so good at acting and entertaining that they’re seen as valuable/extroverted/desirable, they might as well just consider themselves to be extroverts.Truly introverted people usually can’t do this, and I understand why no one wants to be friends with them, because they aren’t likable or friendly. The only introverts who have friends are ones who’ve known their friends since they were kids when undesirable personalities were more acceptable. Or people who befriend them for ulterior motives like looks/wealth/connection. But I don’t consider those people real friends.

Even if they took away all guns, there would still be tons of illegal guns in circulation, and now it would only be criminals with guns in their possession. The idea that we should remove certain weapons such as AR-15's because of mass shootings also isn't valid because: 

1. Anyone could use a handgun in the same way, as they are the same fire-rate & easier to conceal.

 2. Handguns are the leading cause of gun-related violence in the U.S. and it isn't even close, so it wouldn't make sense to view AR-15's at the worst because of isolated incidents that are MSM.

I also don't believe that ""only handguns"" would benefit our society, here's an example why:

* Let's say someone breaks into your home (and you live in a state where they are in favor of a  ""stand-your-ground"" law).
* Let's say they have a handgun ready to use against you. If only handguns are allowed, why would a homeowner want to be at the same playing field as the intruder? They would want to be at an advantage by knowing they are going out of their way to have a better weapon (such as an automatic) to ensure their life is less at risk. You could argue that the intruder could as well, but if handguns are the leading cause of gun violence and most accessible, it would only be logical to assume the odds of them having handguns are increasingly higher than another weapon.

Also, the U.S. isn't like other countries, so trying to compare it to another country with gun control/less violence isn't exactly a good argument in my opinion. If you believe it is, that's fine, but that route won't be able to change my mind, I'd prefer to focus on the U.S. only."

The moment we start taking pet topics off the table, it’s a slippery slope. As Ricky Gervais said “people only care when it’s ‘their thing’”.  

That being said, you wouldn’t walk into a business meeting and launch into your most offensive joke. You should be aware off, and conscious of, who your audience are to make sure everyone is laughing together, and that people understand the intention of the joke.

With that caveat, if you were with me on a night out, there is nothing you couldn’t joke about in front of me. There are no lines in the sand and everything is fair game.

From the pernicious effect of social media to climate change to poverty, capitalism is apparently to blame, according to a chorus of people on social media.

Polling data show that people who self-affiliate with the political Left decisively favor ""socialism"" over ""capitalism"", when asked.

[https://news.gallup.com/poll/357755/socialism-capitalism-ratings-unchanged.aspx](https://news.gallup.com/poll/357755/socialism-capitalism-ratings-unchanged.aspx)

**Why I think the anti-capitalist view is misleading**

Using my own examples above, **social media** does indeed create negative externalities, but does it create positive externalities as well? Is a more government-controlled system more fair or impartial in the way it disseminates information? I contend that social media companies are cynically increasing engagement without regard to the long-term impact, but that capitalism, as a system of economic rules & exchange, is not intrinsically at fault.

Regarding **climate change**, is capitalism to blame? Would a more economically (and thus, politically) controlled system release less carbon? I'm not convinced. The communist states of the 20th century used similar energy sources to what was nationally or regionally available. They were perhaps uniquely unconcerned with the environmental impact or on the impact on their own populations. Thus, a non-capitalist system is not necessarily a greener one.

On the topic of **poverty**, the trend line is in favor of market-capitalism over command economies. Per capita GDP is higher in market economies. The experimentation with socialist/communist systems in the 20th century is so abysmal that one wonders why anyone with a historical background would consider such systems. In my estimation, the systems that are most generous to the poor are either a) vibrant market-based systems (eg Singapore) OR b) have access to extensive hydrocarbons (eg. Norway). In either case, the possibility of government largess to the poor is higher than in the socialist systems of the past.

Perhaps there is a non-capitalist, non-socialist system that the ""late-stage capitalism"" doomers are referring to?

Anyways with that out of the way, I’d like to explain my opinion. Religion doesn’t have any practical explanation such as science, there’s no scientific or observable proof that heaven/hell/etc. exists, and I feel as if people made up religions to feel better when their loved ones die or when they think about their inevitable death. I think people view existence death as so scary and unexplainable that they want something equally unexplainable (religion) to cope with the uncertainty. I think people are putting way too much blind faith in something that may as well be a daydream. It’s a nice thought but realistically, doesn't make sense.

Likewise, basically every rapper is sexist and homophobic (at least in their songs). These are just some examples.

I'm not saying that they SHOULD be canceled or that you can't be a fan of them or their work. (I'm a fan of some celebrities that aren't perfect, myself.

Looking at Haitis history more objectively, it's not as dramatic as made out to be. They were colonized (like half the world have been at some point) but broke free surprisingly early. 

France colonial tax-system lifted in the 1940s, which is an eternity in a market economy. During the same decade, countries such as Poland were occupied by both Nazi-Germany and Soviet, and Ukraine or China faced mass-starvation. Japan were nuked, both Hiroshima and Nagasaki are thriving cities today. India were occupied by the UK, Australia started as a prison-colony, Vietnam and Cambodia faced proxy-wars. 

Countries such as former Yugoslavia or Rwanda (to take another majority black-nation) have faced civil-war and genocide and rebuilt faster than Haiti. Ex-soviet states like the Baltics had to endure 60 years of soviet-style communism and Stalin, but kickstarted their economy in the 90s and caught up to the west quickly. Unfair taxation-laws from the 1940s are nothing. 

Earthquakes, common occurence in many regions of the world. Japan has massive earthquakes and they simply built their society around it. Disease is a problem, but it's mainly caused by poor sanitation from the locals themselves. 

Haiti has in-fact a lot going for it on paper. Excellent geographic position were they are surrounded by non-hostile allies. Compare that to what nations such as Ukraine, Taiwan or South Korea deal with. *Massive* amounts of foreign aid yearly. Beautiful geography and the potential to attract tourists. Export-products such as sugar and fruit. Both France and the US have an interest in Haiti being stable, since it will reduce the influx of refugees. 

There is no conspiracy. The core-problem is the Haitian-population and their blame-shifting to historic events that are to old to be relevant today."
1,2024-03-13,CMV: I don't about/have zero sympathy for Palestine and Palestinians,u/FlyingNFireType,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1be70qj/cmv_i_dont_abouthave_zero_sympathy_for_palestine/,changemyview,"Palestine and Israel conflict is historic and complicated but also not really and boils down to basically Muslims want Jews dead. Palestine has never wanted a state, the area that is currently Palestine used to belong to Egypt and Jordan before they abandoned the area and their citizens there after losing a war to genocide Israel... 

So basically the reason Palestine exists is because 1 Jordan and Egypt (and several other Muslim countries) failed to exterminate Israel and 2 Jordan and Egypt didn't give a fuck about that area or the people in it... to this day their borders are closed to Palestine and Palestinians trying to cross are met with just as much if not more force as Palestinians trying to get into Israel. 

The whole reason Palestine is somewhat under Israel management is simply because everyone else fucked off and Palestine attacks Israel too often for Israel to just ignore them (though they still did their damndest to try). 

I truly believe all Palestinians have to do to have peace and a state is not attack Israel for like 10 years, no rocket attacks, no suicide bombers, no paragliding insurgents that kidnap and rape people. That's really think is all it would take, yet I know it'd never happen. So yeah when I hear about the plight of Palestine or the Palestinians I just roll my eyes I don't care they made their bed, they wanted war and well they got it now they come bitching and moaning to the west because they can't win the war they fucking started... give me a break. I don't get why anyone who isn't a rabid anti-semite is in support of Palestine it jus makes no sense and a ceasefire isn't a fucking solution it's just a pause until they get another good terrorist attack in (and they will keep trying to endlessly).

So yeah if you don't hate jews and don't want Israel to cease to exist why are you in support of Palestine? I don't even think Israel could really do much more to minimize casualties logistically speaking while still accomplishing their military goals."

Even if climate change means human extinction in a century it’s a stupid idea (and human extinction any time soon based on climate change is highly unlikely based on everything I have read — but I digress).   
Why do I think it’s a dumb idea? It’s not like building bio-domes on Mars is gonna be any easier than building bio-domes on Antarctica, or flotillas in the Pacific Ocean, or bio-domes in the middle of the uninhabited Sahara Desert, or bio-domes in the Amazon. It’s not like it’s gonna get colder with less oxygen than Mars in the next hundred or even five hundred years anywhere on our planet. We would need to build a terraformer to make colonizing Mars practical, and so far we can barely safely land a rover there yet someone like Elon Musk is saying he anticipates starting a colony on Mars in his lifetime.   
If you ask me it smells fishy, as if space travel is a large scam on governments and taxpayers, as if maybe all that money goes towards other things, or maybe it’s about building space lasers for warfare, or maybe it goes towards some kind of extraterrestrial/extradimensional reverse engineering project… or something. Whatever the case may be it simply doesn’t make sense that we “need” to colonize Mars practically ever.    
So please tell me why colonizing Mars (or even the Moon) is anything less than a dumb idea. The only smart idea for doing it that I can think of is, like I said before, scamming money or space lasers or something. As a practical thing a Mars or Moon colony just sounds totally stupid."

Democide globally has killed 262 million people, largely in the 20th and 21st century. Gun deaths yearly are around 250k. Homicides worldwide account for around 170k of these which include self defense shootings and police shootings. Ignoring the fact that these figures are caused by cultural/societal problems such as cartel activity and not access to firearms, it would take 1,541 years for gun homicides to catch up to the democide caused deaths of the past 100-200 years at our current rates. That is also ignoring that democide is also currently outpacing gun homicides. And it is also not taking into to consideration that the majority of the world also currently has strict regulations on guns. If gun homicide rates were proportionate to the amount of and access to guns, America would be leading the pack at #1 leaving the runner up multiple factors in the dust. But yet, America is not even in the top 30 for gun deaths per 100,000. This including self-inflicted deaths puts us at #32.  


This alone shows me that if your goal is to preserve life and the rights/safety of the people, every person with this goal should logically be in favor of the right of the people to keep and bear arms without restriction. Countries historically have used these small gun laws here and there to eventually weaponize it to disarm their populace time and time again all while having little to no effect on crime, and often a negative effect on crime. A large radical sweeping ban/infringement would not work in the way they want it so they go for the boil the frog approach instead, the long game. Raise the next voter base to be more and more against guns. The best course of action that I've observed for these types of government entities is to opportunistically use and encourage tragedies, and use them to get people emotional/irrational and in turn to support your cause of expanding control.  


Currently here in America guns are a huge talking point, as I'm sure everyone here knows. The statistic commonly used is around 40k gun deaths per year. Sometimes more, sometimes less. Most of this is due to self-inflicted injury (to phrase it non-triggeringly), and while these are tragic I think we could agree on this is due to mental health, and the rates of these events do not go down as gun control goes up. What you're left with is a statistic of 10-20k per year killed in homicides. This again includes police shootings and self defense shootings. A single event of genocide our own government committed against Native Americans killed around 4.7 million. Going with the largest number of 20k per year, it would take 235 years which is about the same length as the existence of our country for gun deaths to approach this number using this 20k per year number. In reality it is even longer, and even longer still if you exclude self defense shootings, and police shootings. Our government also continued to oppress Native Americans even after this conflict was concluded. And then later went on to oppress Native Alaskans in the 50's as well. Slavery destroyed the lives of over 15 million people, and people of color went on to be discriminated against long after slavery was ended. There are so many examples just here in America that dwarf the deaths of guns.  


Ignoring past events still, I would argue that people using guns to defend themselves against criminals 2.5 million times per year in the US more than outweighs the detriment of 10k-20k deaths per year. This doesn't necessarily mean a shot was fired, that someone was shot, or that someone was killed. It often is just as simple as brandishing the firearm or shooting a warning shot.  


And on that note of how small the number of deaths are in comparison to acts of our own government, other statistics that exceed and in most cases dwarf it are:  
Vehicle related deaths \~40k/year  
Accidental poisoning \~102k/year  
Medical malpractice \~250k-440k/year  
Obesity \~300k/year  
Overdoses \~106k/year  
and to expand on overdoes, prescription medication \~15k/year (about equivalent)  


And further, of these gun deaths approximately 3% of them are committed with rifles. Yet these rifles are the largest topic in the US. These ""assault weapons"" which is being displayed as AR-15's and other similar scary looking rifles despite no such classification existing, which have the same semi-automatic functions as many commonly used hunting rifles, and are actually underpowered (chambered in .223 and 5.56) and are also considered inhumane to use against certain game because it is not deadly enough and could just make them suffer instead. This to me really displays the intention of the argument made by anti-gun groups, as if their goal was to save lives rifles would be nowhere in the conversation, they would be going after handguns. But they know that is ridiculous and no one would go for that, so they are taking the win they could conceivably get, using it to set precedent and move on to other types of firearms the more they are able to radicalize people.  


And of that 10k-20k deaths per year, a very large amount of it occurs in inner cities where both gang violence and heavy gun regulations are prevalent. So the solutions I see being proposed by anti 2-A individuals/groups are never to solve these cultural and socio-economic issues, but is instead to ban all guns. They may not outright say this, they want just a little regulation here and there and when they inevitably do nothing they will ask for more, and eventually end up with a Australia situation. Some of them are brazen enough to just outright say it even. And that's not just speculation, that is what we see happen time and time again."

I think these necessary household services should be treated similarly to education, law enforcement, libraries, etc. Now I'm definitely not an expert in economics but to me, the drawbacks of these services being profit driven outweigh any benefits. I've known people to forgo hiring professionals in favor of DIY electrical jobs which are dangerous not only for themselves but any future owners of the same house. And it's hard to blame them when these expenses can be financially debilitating and can't always be planned for. Also who knows how fair these prices actually are. I've read way too many stories of people getting screwed by companies embellishing issues in order to make an extra buck. In theory these issues could be solved if these services were socialized. 

I know there are plenty of benefits to certain goods and service being on the open market and benefiting from competition but I've never really understood why only certain public goods (law enforcement, emergency services, etc.) are government/tax-payer funded and others aren't. I also feel the same about some household items like toilet paper and paper towels (also healthcare but I know that subject is super polarizing). 

I'm sure there's a ton of relevant information that I'm unaware of that would change my mind, this is just something I've been thinking about tonight as I woefully contemplate this quote to fix my A/C.

First of all, you gain weight depending on how much calories you **absorb**, not eat. So 500 cals of cake will be more than 500 cals of chicken breast, because absorbing caloreis from sugar takes is more efficient than absorbing it from meat.

Calories you see on lables can often be off. The law allows a 20% margin for error, so you might be overeating if you count calories. And if you count calories by looking up 'average calories of a chiken breast in a vacuum' you can be even more off. Same if you order restoraunt food, the numbers are likely to be very off.

Things like apple watch and most commercial treadmills, exercise bike, etc SUCK at counting calories. They are practically random number generators. Formulas that tell you your 'ideal calories' lie, they talk about a spherical person in a vacuum, not you.

And even if you have a lab in your house, it's still not worth it. Because if you want to lose weight to stay healthy, then you shouldn't just reduce calories, you should have a healthy diet. What's the point of losing weight on a healthy diet anyway? 

I don't understand why people make smug faces and prefer to be ""sceintific"" telling about calories, instead of giving advice that actually works. A proper balance diet, excluding products that lead to overeating, and keeping those that you can eat ""as much as you want"". Nobody is overeating boiled chiken breasts."

You can’t take away the rights of any category of criminal, because suddenly that category will be overflowing with people who totally 100% definitely committed that horrible crime.

""in a workshop once with people who had all been sentenced to death by incarceration—life without parole—and everyone in the organization was remorseful, actively engaged in education and activism efforts, and also (shockingly!) had strong opinions on the life circumstances that had led to their crimes and how they could have been significantly altered by things like funding schools and after-school programs, stricter gun control, juvenile justice/diversion programs, healthcare and housing. ""

Like… murderers are never going to legalize murder. 

That’s a strawman argument. 

There a lot of other things on the ballot that their votes could sway significantly.  
  
And I’m not saying everyone who has committed murder is secretly a good person or that I would agree with everything they would vote for—but that’s also true of people who have not committed crimes or have not been incarcerated for them! 

Right now, the worst non-incarcerated person you know has full voting rights, and someone who was convicted as an 18-year-old under Richard Nixon has gone 50 years without the ability to express their an opinion on topics that fucked up their lives beyond repair! 

Including things that are ACTIVELY fucking up their lives, because when politicians outsource prisons to private companies, provide or deny money to address in-prison sexual assault or drug addiction, ban or promote abusive practices like solitary confinement, etc, that affects… drumroll please… incarcerated people!  
  
Anyway. Yeah, human rights are human rights and humans deserve rights.

Back in the 17th. 18th and 19th century it was dearly needed, as women were delegated to being nothing more than housewives, without the ability to own land and property. 

But now we are in the 21st century and the opposite problem is happening, men being raped and people telling them they are lucky, a man fighting a woman back in self defense os viewed in scrutiny, and 97.4636% of movies and TV shows I watch contain the dreaded ‘girl power’.

 An example of this is one of my favorite TV shows, resident alien, its second season took a detour for a few episodes to talk about girl power when it wasn’t even mentioned in the previous season. 

So, my question is, is feminism even needed anymore, in first world countries like America, because I know in islam countries women are treated like dirt. "

58,2024-03-14,"CMV: Subjective Human-Created Meaning is Cosmically Significant, and is Enough to Prove That the Universe is Not Meaningless",u/MaybeJackson,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bef2ym/cmv_subjective_humancreated_meaning_is_cosmically/,changemyview,"To explain my view, I am going to type out my philosophical proof, then explain the steps, and finally address a couple obvious counter arguements.

**The Proof:**

Humans create subjective meaning through the creation of art, literature, music, etc.

The definition of meaning is ""an important or worthwhile quality; purpose."" In other words, an added value (quality) upon something. This definition leads meaning to necessarily be subjective. 

**Therefore, Humans Create Meaning.**

\-------------------------------------------------------------

The universe is defined as all existing matter

Humans are existing matter

**Therefore, Humans Are Part of the Universe.**

\-------------------------------------------------------------

Humans create meaning

Humans are part of the universe

**Therefore, the Universe Cannot Be Meaningless.**

&#x200B;

**To expand a little bit:** 

I believe that all philosophers before me (as far as I am aware) who have written about the question of meaning have gotten it wrong. This is because every existentialist, absurdist, or nihilist, regardless of whether they do so intentionally or not, necessitates within their philosophy a separation between humans and the rest of the universe. Camus for example, declares that the universe is ""silent"" when we ask it questions of meaning, like ""what is my purpose?"" or ""what matters?"" But humans want meanings, and the clash between the universe's silence and our desire is what he dubs ""the absurd."" However, like I explained above, a ""clash"" necessitates two separate entities. A car for example cannot collide with itself, it must hit another object to clash. I believe this is fundamental error, and the reason no philosopher yet has effectively argued in favour of the cosmic significance of human created meaning.

 What i mean is that since humans cannot be separated from the rest of the universe, when we create meaning, it is a reflection of part of the universe itself being meaningful**. The universe is not silent on existential questions, we have just been looking in the wrong place. One only needs to turn to themselves or others to find answers to the questions they ask.** 

&#x200B;

**Obvious counter arguments:** 

*""humans are so tiny and the universe is so vast, nothing we do matters""* 

I don't believe the scale of the universe is a valid counter argument. To explain I have an analogy. Imagine you are in a potentially infinite library. It is so massive you don't even know. Imagine you are also trying to prove there are no red books within such a library. To prove there are no red books, it would not be sufficient to show 100,000,000 blue ones, because the existence of blue books does not disprove red ones until you have searched every book. Similarly, there may be a trillion planets without humans on them, but you only need to find one to prove a creature in the universe has created philosophy. To prove the universe is meaningless, finding trillions of dead planets and space proves nothing. We have evidence of part of the universe being meaningful right in front of us, no matter how large you scale the universe, that meaning does not become insignificant. 

*""saying subjective meaning is real is like saying the imagining of purple elephant makes it real""* 

I also believe this is a false counter argument, because meaning by definition is subjective. Meaning does not need to be able to mined and physically showcased in order to exist. The same way the phenomenological experience of happiness cannot be extracted, meaning cannot either. Maybe you could shift the definition of meaning to be an added quality that needs to physically exist, but that just does not make sense and is moving the goal post.

So take religion, for example. I am not saying that when Muslims or Christians talk about their holy book, because it is meaningful it is is all true. A human generating a claim about the physical existence of god does not prove it just because they thought it, the same way thinking of a purple elephant does not prove the existence of a purple elephant. but since meaning is not a physical property, but rather a subjective value added onto physical properties, the subjective human process of the creation of meaning is enough to prove its existence. 

*""but humans will die, and then there will be no more meaning""* 

Imagine a table with a bunch of fruit, and a hammer. Does removing the hammer from the table prove it was never there? No, of course not. it was there, then it was removed, and so it is no longer there. Likewise, meaning does not have to be permanent to existence. It can be here while humans exist, and then stop existing when we do as well (assuming there aren't also aliens also creating meaning.) "

If you need to commit holocausts worth of civilian casualties for an ideology, way of life, or just simple influence, then you don’t deserve any of those things.

Just someone convince me that we America hasn’t been the worlds biggest terror organization for a century now. 

I used to see the CCP as the most evil thing the planet has ever seen now they appear as an angel to me standing next to the US.

Like I knew America has been deeply flawed for most of its history but I bought into the whole “after WW2 we changed our ways and during WW2 we didn’t have a choice” line of thinking.

But now I know that Japan was already going to surrender most of the US military, war cabinet, and Washington in general believed the nukes were unnecessary. 

And I can just go in but I’m short I just want someone to justify Americas actions and tell me that tens of millions of civilians dead due to the United States is somehow justified through any ideology.

Because I know now in my adult life that nobody just wants to kill all of us Americans, sure slot of people want this government to fall.

And I really hope the government wouldn’t let millions of us die to preserve its power and dominance. 

So what is it that we were preserving committing some of the worst atrocities in human history.

Because you know what, poverty is rampant, everything’s expensive, the American economy is ass, roads are messed up, education is terrible. God even ISPs are monopolized here and WiFi is stupid expensive compared to basically everywhere else, all our rights have been slowly chipped away at, and I still pay one of the highest tax rates in the world ain’t that somethin. 

So just tell me what are we defending, because I can tell you that from all the people I’ve talked to from all over the world because you know we can do that now, nobody so far has even hated me for being an American even though at this point I wouldn’t blame them if they did. So it’s not my life that’s being defended, it’s not my quality of life being protected, and if it’s an ideology I hope we can agree killing innocent people in the name of an ideology is about one of the most heinous things that can be done by human beings, and is the definition of terrorism.

So if it’s not those things what is it. "

But the ones you most often hear in abortion debates are horrendously bad and only work on those easily manipulated by emotion.

**One shouldn't be obligated to feed a parasite attached to their organs**

The fetus isn't a parasite. And the female body is designed to carry and nurture a child. But the main difference is that the ""parasite"" in question was in some way brought about by the actions of the body that it depends on to live. Yes, I know rape exists and it is an exception (also makes up 0.02% of all abortion cases). In the overwhelming majority of cases, the mother was in some way responsible for making another life dependant on her for survival. 

A better analogy would be if you severely injured someone due to negligence and only you could supply blood to them and save their life. 

**I wouldn't be legally required to give my victim any blood**

The law doesn't reflect what is moral and doesn't try to. Just because you wouldn't be forced by law to give blood to save your victim's life doesn't mean it isn't the morally correct thing to do. In any case where the mother wasn't raped, she is 100% responsible if she gets pregnant. Just like any person would be responsible for a person they injured. And if I had the choice of being pregnant against my will (mother's side) vs dying/never existing (baby's side), I'd rather be pregnant.

**It's just a clump of cells**

You and everyone you know is just a clump of cells. But if the argument is that it doesn't have consciousness, then the answer is that consciousness will most likely develop. The potential of future consciousness is significant. It's the reason why I can't go around pulling plugs on every comatose patient.

They ignore that while the ""rat utopia"" was ""supposed"" to hold up to 4000 rats, that's like saying a prison that can hold 4000 people is a utopia because technically all their needs are met. These rats were born, grew up, and died in an unchanging, unstimulating place. 

These were rat concentration camps, not Utopias. It's argued that the effects that appeared in the mice, such as cannibalism, reduced reproduction and increased homosexuality, are being observed in humans today. This view ignores the oppression and existence of homosexuality throughout history and tried to reframe it as a modern issue, caused by modern society. 

The implication is not only that homosexuality is some kind of mental disorder caused by society, but that it will inevitably escalate to cannibalism or something worse. 

The experiment is also talked about as if it's a perfect 1:1 of real human society. The implication being that everyone in the modern world has their needs met, that the only reason someone would be struggling is because they're one of the deviant rats, that they're crazy, their mind is rotting, they can't afford to eat because they're reclusive and don't participate in society, not because they're poor and oppressed. This obviously isn't true, people aren't homeless and gay because their mind is rotting from living in a utopia.

Another implication of the experiment is that you shouldn't help the poor, the hungry, the less fortunate, because if you give them what they need they'll turn into the deviant rats and destroy your society. It's used to justify the unnecessary suffering around us, the idea being that if we get rid of suffering people will create their own and make everyone suffer. This obviously isn't true, and can be shown to not be true in places that have proper support for their less fortunate, where homelessness and crime rates are much lower making society better overall. 

The rat utopia experiment only exists to empower and justify fascism, it serves as  ""legitimate"" science showing that if society doesn't conform to the harsh but ""stable"" fascist beliefs (ex. some people are more deserving than others from birth, some people deserve to suffer/be homeless/ have no support, there is an inherent upper and lower class that goes beyond social status, etc) then it will eventually crumble. This obviously isn't true, as can be seen by the way fascist regimes crumble as soon as they're no longer able to impart fear and violence against their subjects.

*Every* violent act of resistance or terrorism has carried negative long-teen consequences to Palestinians’ quality of life, without actually managing to obtain anything other than international sympathy. The negative consequences include military retaliation, harsher restrictions, further radicalization of  Israelis which obviously affects the Palestinians and only aids in perpetuating the cycle of violence.

Now, I’m not saying all of Israel’s policies are a consequence of Palestinian terrorism, but, depending on your outlook, have either elicited or at the very least provided a neat excuse for a response. Notice how most Israeli restrictions just chronologically follow Palestinian violence. For example, the wall dividing the WB from Israel came about after the intifada. The siege of Gaza came after the kidnapping of Gilad Shalit. The 2014 war came after the kidnapping and murdering of 3 teens by Hamas. All these acts have *MASSIVE* repercussions for the average Palestinian. Not to mention smaller-scale attacks with smaller-scale responses.

I’m asking Reddit to provide me with examples for times when Palestinian led violence against Israelis has managed to secure any kind of actual, practical advantage for the Palestinian civilians. "

We made an abrupt decision recently to sell our $480,000 home. This is a house that I literally put my life savings into as a down payment. At the same time I put $30k on my student loans leaving an amount similar to the price of a decent car left on the loan. 

Last week we accepted an offer on our house and started looking for a much cheaper house in my hometown. We found a place we loved and started the loan process. Now I didn’t have great credit, but was somewhere in the upper 600’s due to a small credit card balance and a hand few of missed payments to student loans and some random medical bills. 

Skip forward, a few days and we do a hard pull on my credit and to my surprise my credit score dropped over a hundred points no longer allowing us to continue with the purchase. 

Now my solution is simple. I’ll make a payment on my student loans and pay off a measly $2500 in medical bills from Akron Children’s hospital and wait 90 or so days for the credit companies to update. I can chalk it up to a “whoops” or a “my bad”, a minor inconvenience for myself and my family, but It’s the fact that we are even able to be punished for something as stupid as student loans or medical bills and not rewarded for things like never missing a rent payment, mortgage payment or car payment in over 10 years. The fact that only half of the people my age even own a house, but we were all so easily approved for and brainwashed into taking on giant student loan debt with the facade of success attached to it.

Facing eviction in just 10 days due to poor credit, a situation far too common yet deeply personal. Poor credit isn't merely a number but a reflection of financial struggles, often beyond one's control—unexpected medical bills, student loan payments, or simply the high cost of living. These factors make securing affordable housing nearly impossible, as landlords favor tenants with better scores. This systemic bias towards credit history overlooks the reality of life's unpredictability, leaving many vulnerable to homelessness, a stark reminder of the urgent need for a more realistic approach to housing.

I'm a high school math teacher and have been an educator for 9 years. I've been in various environments, charter schools, public schools and private schools. I have also worked in admin and leadership roles. So I have a decent amount of experience.

More recently, we've noticed lowered expectations from students and a decline in traditional consequences. For example, many schools have adopted a no zero policy (no grade can be entered lowest than a 55, if a kid earns a 24% on a test, it'll go in as a 55) no detention, no suspensions, etc. 

Not only does this exist in education, but I'm seeing it in law enforcement also. When you look at cities like San Francisco, Portland, and even NYC (where I'm from) you'll see how lax the government and law enforcement is on crime. Criminals ruined San Fran and don't really face consequences for it, so it continues. 

Is this intentional? Like what is really happening? Is this a really of liberal policies? Is this a conspiracy? 

TLDR: I'm convinced there's SOMETHING going on intended to f%&$ our society up by removing consequences. "
1,2024-03-14,CMV: Burnout is Worth it,u/SpaceTurtleYa,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1beo48z/cmv_burnout_is_worth_it/,changemyview,"Disclaimer: this isn’t for everyone nor is it healthy. It is a risk that I have decided is worth the price. This isn’t “good advice”, it’s a sweet spot that works for me personally. I don’t claim to know better, which is why I am here opening myself up to other perspectives. I have an amazing support system and knowing they’re there when I need them makes me feel like anything is possible. That’s a really big factor here. 

Live within your limits out of fear of burnout, or live outside your limits out of fear of being limited. 

There are plenty of pros and cons to both. I graduated Magna Cum Laude. I got the job. I got the relationship. I finished some cool projects. 

I got the burnout too and you know what? Fucking worth it. 

Now I am operating within my limits and it is just miserable for me. I miss waking up at 8am to go to class and getting home from work at 1am. It has been 3 years since I graduated and started to slow down and limit myself. I am 28, male, and I have ADHD btw. 

There is so much more stress and feelings of incompetence since I started to slow down. Rather than aiming for the stars and seeing how far I get, I sit around “resting” in between occasional blurbs of accomplishing something. Entertaining myself, treating myself, it all feels hedonistic and empty. 

Think about it this way. Burnout happens, and suddenly I am like a flea trapped in a jar. Once you heal from the burnout, it’s time to jump as high as you can again. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life holding back because of an imaginary lid that used to or is about to be in the way. I’m a sprinter. Trying to get me to pace myself and run a marathon is like clipping my wings. Far more depressing than any burnout I’ve ever experienced. 

When I pace myself the lid just gets lower and lower until I’m burning myself out just trying to do chores around the house. So i burnout either way, slow and steady is just way more depressing and boring. When I shoot for the stars the lid is pushed higher and higher. It’s easy to find rock bottom, and recovery is a science. But my limits are…

In every other instance I have ever seen, either the ""death"" was an obvious (and lazy writing) attempt to force audience reaction because it was completely unnecessary for story progression and had no further consequences afterward, or their ""surprise survival"" was a blatant backpedal because their reappearance was disruptive to the story progression and their continued participation had no measurable impact.

What it actually means is ""rely on your social skills. You've practiced socializing enough to think of the right thing to say on instinct, so you don't need to overthink how people will react to you."" That's ridiculous advice, because if someone needs this kind of advice in the first place, they're probably socially or emotionally stunted. Telling them to ""Be themselves"" is just telling them to repeat the same actions that lead them to failure in the first place. If ""being yourself"" is the solution, but being yourself has never worked for you before, then it also means there's nothing you can do to improve, and things are hopeless. The only people this advice actually helps, are those who are already socially skilled enough to navigate social situations on instinct, who really didn't need the advice to begin with.

To illustrate this, imagine you tell someone ""be yourself"", and then do a roleplay exercise to practice, where you pretend you're strangers making first introductions. To be themselves, they walk up to you, no introduction, and start yammering on about the latest season of Power Rangers, and go on about how some of the episodes awakened new sexual fetishes in them.  They do this, in order to be true to their own ideas, taste, and what they feel like, without regard for pretenses or social expectations. Your advice was the absolute opposite of what they needed, because their real problem was that they are a repulsive, narcissistic, socially incompetent person, which was entirely predictable from the start, because they asked you for such basic advice in the first place.  
What ""Be yourself"" boils down to, is ""Git Gud, scrub"". It's trite advice with no depth, substance, or anything that would lead someone to make actually correct decisions."

This is a really American takes but I’m American—land of the free and home of the belly rolls, but I would rather give my data to this country, where there are stringent data mining laws, than another country where they just say “fµck it.” Nepal, China, Italy, the Australian government, India and Germany (potentially) have banned it.

I mean, is anyone wondering why a company that literally is created in a country is BANNED in that same company, but it is worth a billion dollars and has mass global influence? Is anyone fµck!ng thinking or is everyone so addicted to this app? The CEO doesn’t even let his children on it. It’s like feeding me food but refusing to eat it yourself; that’s why kings had food testers to see if it was poisonous. Something on that app is poisonous. Study after study suggest that it has bad for mental health; and we’re just saying fµck it.

“It sets a bad precedent,” we gave them an ultimatum. We did the same thing to Grindr. I would rather have one country have my data than two. I would rather have the asshole Himbo of the world have my data than the actual global Mac daddy of suspicion have it. If I wouldn’t even live in that country, why would I want my data given to it? Come on.

For those who say TikTok is used for spread of information, the amount of times misinformation is spread on that platform is almost as much as the amount of times information is spread on that platform.

Do you think that TikTok has all the truths? Or is it just people spitting their opinions like any other platform? If this was about “hiding information” then they would ban ALL social media platforms. It’s more likely that it is data mining.

“But it is social activism, they are silencing voices ,” good. Some of y’all need to be silenced; you talk too damn much and don’t say anything. And you mean “important” like those weirdos supporting the “Letter to America,” because it mentioned Israel and Palestine, but refuse to read the rest of the document where talked about: death to gays, death to people of color, a weird personal beef with Bobby Brown, enforcing religion (everyone has a right to choice who or what they serve, if anyone and this is coming from a Christian.) Or “important” like people suddenly saying that North Korea wasn’t a dictatorship country because “America said it was and everyone America is bad,” despite numerous people and videos detailing this issue. Or do you mean “important” for shaming westerners for visiting countries because “this is a form of colonization,” and that “they shouldn’t be visiting unless they are there to do work on improving the land,” never mind the fact that they might have family there or just doing business travel or whatever. TikTok is full of self righteous people who judge others as “unserious” from their high horse while wearing a jester’s hat.

A lot of you have this “world bad syndrome” and it came from TikTok.

But please, if what you have to say is so powerful and important, then you will find a way to say it on other platforms; this would not silence you. TikTok is not the goblet of truth. It’s showing things from people in your echo chamber, the people you follow, who share your ideology—like any other platform"

1- She has a problem with T in the LGBTQ movement.  
2- She, therefore, is Anti-LGBTQ.  
3- Hitler and the Nazi party were Anti-LGBTQ.  
4- She, therefore, is a Nazi and a Holocaust denier

  
This is clearly very flawed logic and a clear example of a witch hunt that is ironically done to a woman. The LGBTQ activists behind this campaign are extremely dishonest. It is also very unfair to the Jewish population who suffered in that heinous event. Comparing their suffering with not letting an individual to the women's shitter room is frankly ridiculous. "

There are a lot of discussions of other athletes who are thought to have unfair advantages due to their hormonal balances. Finally, there are tons of controversies around performance-enhancing drugs giving people hormonal advantages.

Instead of competing by gender identity, or drug testing, we should simply create hormone classes like there are weight classes in the combat sports, such as boxing and MMA. This way, athletes like Semenya can compete, but it would just be with others who have similar hormonal advantages. Debates around gender identity could be put aside without any official stance on the topic because it neither confirms not negates gender identity to have hormone-classes compete against each other regardless of gender. It might actually reduce doping because, however much you dope, you are only going to end up competing with others who ""weigh in"" at similar hormone levels and, for the lower hormone classes, it probably wouldn't be worth doping. 

The one issue I could see is that, if somebody goes through puberty naturally and develops height, wingspan, or other physical advantages, then they reduce their hormonal advantage to compete in a particular hormone-class, then they would still have a physiological advantage in their skeleton, but we didn't prohibit Michael Phelps from competing when he had numerous genetic/physiological advantages over his competition."

The rest of the world doesn't consume things like beef at nearly the same rate we do. Overconsumption of meat has been linked to things like colon cancer. Meat isn't inherently bad for you and we need the nutrients but North Americans aren't exactly known for their self restraint...Not only that but the 3rd leading cause of climate change both through destruction of forested land and methane emissions. Cutting our meat consumption down a bit will also cut down on emissions and save us from potentially harmful consequences.

**Now obviously hunting is not viable for everyone, I am not suggesting we get rid of livestock in general!** Those of us who can should though....Doesn't have to be things like deer either because we obvi gotta avoid overhunting, tags are issued based on population levels anyway. certain areas have an abundance of pests that can be eaten and farmers will kill em if you don't to protect there crops and livestock. Rabbit stew anyone? Pigeons can also be eaten...think of em as small chickens (not dirty city pigeons don't do that, I mean like farm pests that feed on grain)

The animals get to have a free life and the process is quick and clean if you know what you are doing. One deer can fill a freezer for the entire year!!! One! The limit for things like grouse is like 15 per season??? thats 15 whole chickens in your freezer. Sure you have the spend money on hunting gear and permits but in the long run it saves you money! The average household spends anywhere from 3,000-5,000 on meat per year...Dropping a deer off at the butcher is 200. you can also learn how to process your own meat too. Small game is quick and easy to process by yourself at home. You can be confident your food isn't full of god knows what hormones and antibiotics that contribute to bacterial resistant strains....Plague round 2 anyone? 

Chronic Wasting Disease is a problem in some areas so its always wise to submit heads at drop off locations for testing! it hasn't made the jump to humans but don't give it the chance! Some areas are worse than others, keep track of CWD populations. Its thought that CWD jumped from livestock to captive deer populations and THEN spread to wild deer....Most diseases we deal with come from livestock! Thats another reason we should slow down the rate we consume and produce meat on an industrial level...diseases are bound to spread and make the jump to humans. We have seen this time and time again! Wild meat will have that risk too but its less likely to cause jump to us and cause a pandemic!!! Your biggests risks with wild meat aside from CWD are parasites...these are easily cooked out. just be smart with meat handling.

Last point: people are too far removed from their food source, some develope moral superiority over hunters as if outsourcing the slaughter to someone else somehow absolves them of anything. You are still responsible for a life taken, at least show some respect to the animals that died so you can eat! I have way more respect for vegans who stick to their morals, a vegan can not like hunting and i'd respect their opinion...I do not respect the opinions of those who stuff their face with chicken nuggies and then get mad when I put in the work to take some grouse home. You wouldn't be able to eat if someone didn't dispatch the animal on your plate. I think if people had a closer relationship to their food it would solve so many of the issues discussed above. Your overconsumption directly contributes to overproduction which contributes to climate change and disease. "

If you can't be bothered to read this or the TLDR just skip to 7:03 on this video because it shows how statements from Israeli officials on aid going into Gaza is a complete lie when you actually see what is happening on the ground and there is data to support it:  
https://youtu.be/XlBuV3RZy4k?t=423  
Is food insecurity in Gaza Israel’s fault? Or is it because Hamas is stealing the aid going into Gaza? In this post I will look at evidence to see what has led to a ‘humanitarian crisis’ in Gaza.  
How many people are starving in Gaza?  
It is hard to quantify this for obvious reasons but according to A senior UN aid official (maybe you don’t think that this is a trustworthy source) warned that at least 576,000 people across the Gaza Strip - one quarter of the population - faced catastrophic levels of food insecurity and one in six children under the age of two in the north were suffering from acute malnutrition.  
(https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68471572)  
So whose fault is it?  
Evidence of Hamas stealing the aid:  
So there are videos reportedly of Hamas stealing aid. As soon as aid enters certain areas of Gaza, armed masked men jump on the aid trucks; possibly Hamas. There are some claims items such as flour are being resold for $90 on the black market.  
https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-aid-trucks-stolen-by-gunmen-and-looted-as-convoys-start-crossing-from-israel/#:\~:text=In%20October%2C%20the%20United%20Nations,the%20posts%20were%20later%20deleted.  
But is it Hamas stealing the aid?  
USA officials claim that they have seen no evidence that Hamas is the ones stealing the aid.  
https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-envoy-israel-hasnt-provided-specific-evidence-hamas-is-stealing-aid-shipments/  
Then who is stealing the aid?  
Supposedly, criminal gangs (possibly connected to Hamas but once again no evidence to prove this) have taken advantage of the scarcity of food in Gaza to make a profit. They are stealing aid and selling it at extorted prices. They do this by getting a hold of the trucks before they reach the distribution points.  
https://www.ft.com/content/9c7253aa-d201-487a-bf5c-901b142eb7e4  
White House Senior Administration Officials have also claimed that some of the aid is being stolen by criminal gangs.  
https://www.miragenews.com/white-house-discusses-gaza-humanitarian-aid-1186008/  
Who is the aid going to?  
There seems to be 3 outcomes for aid that goes into Gaza:  
We know that some of the aid is reaching the areas it is supposed to be distributed at as we can watch various videos of this.  
We know some of the aid going into Gaza is being stolen by criminal gangs as we can watch videos of this and this has been reported by US officials.  
We know that some of the aid is being looted by Palestinian civilians before reaching the distribution points as well. Now some may use this as a reason to criticize Palestinian civilians but I think that is rather ignorant as many Palestinians will be sheltering in areas with no distribution points and risk being killed in traveling to distribution points.  
On a side note this is similar to what happened in Mogadishu (Somalia) in the 1990s when there was a famine: some groups stole aid to sell at extorted prices and some civilians looted aid out of desperation. So these events are not uncommon in a population suffering from a mass food shortage.  
https://www.refworld.org/reference/annualreport/hrw/1993/en/92972  
Claims of food theft were also reported in 2011  
https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/17/world/africa/17somalia.html  
Now while I think it is extremely immoral that criminal gangs would extort a famine to profit from (in Gaza and Somalia), I try to avoid judgment (even though it definitely is immoral) on those doing the crimes as I have never lived through a famine and been put in a situation where I have had to survive/make money (or ensure my family survives) in such dire circumstances. While I am disgusted I also think how many in these criminal gangs feel it is the only way to keep them and their families alive. Hopefully, you or I will never have to be put into such a tough situation to find out if my desire to survive would overpower my moral values.  
Were Hamas police officers stealing aid?  
Eylon Levy, the Israeli spokesperson to western media, has used a picture of Hamas police on an aid truck going into an UNRWA distribution center to prove that both Hamas is stealing aid and is working directly with UNRWA.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8YCr1c2zMI  
https://twitter.com/EylonALevy/status/1751308605586858407  
Now does this picture prove Hamas police are stealing aid? No not really, the picture originated from the Hamas police facebook page. It was actually a PR photo posted by the Gaza police force to show that they were safely facilitating aid. Now some of you may be saying this proves that UNRWA and aid distributors are complicit with Hamas but answer me this: Do you expect UNRWA employees or other aid distributors to guard the aid? Are aid distributors supposed to fight off criminal gangs and dozens of looters? Is it really that ridiculous that they would accept help from the Gaza police in an attempt to have some protection?  
Were Hamas police stopping aid from being stolen?  
Now we can speculate and say that Hamas (or the police) were stealing the aid but there is no evidence to prove this and once again US officials have said there is no evidence that Hamas is stealing aid (https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-envoy-israel-hasnt-provided-specific-evidence-hamas-is-stealing-aid-shipments/).  
So you can believe Hamas or the hamas police officers are stealing aid if you like but there is no evidence of this. However, there are reports that a lot more aid is being stolen now by criminal gangs (or looters) than earlier in the war because the Gaza police have refused to continue protecting the aid because IDF soldiers keep on shooting the Hamas police while guarding the aid.  
https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/as-israel-drives-out-hamas-lawlessness-hampers-gaza-aid-efforts-2438be11  
“UN officials have accused Israeli strikes of targeting police guarding aid convoys, as well as police stations and cars. Officers have also not been paid in months due to the war.”  
David Satterfield, the US ambassador appointed by Mr Biden to co-ordinate humanitarian aid to Gaza, said recently: “With the departure of police escorts it has been virtually impossible for the UN or anyone else… to safely move assistance in Gaza because of criminal gangs.”  
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/03/01/palestinian-blue-police-gaza-aid-convoy-israel-attack-hamas/  
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/02/22/gaza-aid-deliveries-looting-police-hamas/  
“The gangs exploit the fact that Hamas police officers are unable to go out armed and in uniform to protect the aid trucks”  
https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-02-22/ty-article/.premium/as-hunger-spreads-in-gaza-gangs-looting-aid-become-increasingly-brazen/0000018d-d06c-df79-a5cd-f07eebd30000  
Should the Gaza Police be allowed to protect the aid (if they are really doing so)?  
The Gaza police is Hamas-run (as Hamas is the government and control every public sector in Gaza) and composed of Hamas members but also politically unaffiliated people and the remnants of the Palestinian Authority force.  
Now some may feel as the Gaza police force is composed of some Hamas members (some of whom are likely militants) that it is justified that the IDF kills anyone in a Police uniform distributing aid. Some may argue that as long as the police are not using the aid trucks to fire at IDF soldiers (and there has been no evidence of this) then it is important that aid is distributed safely (as long as that is what the police are actually doing) to the starving population. Perhaps as many police officers are not Hamas members or militants, it is worth allowing them to distribute aid properly as long as they are doing so. This I suppose is just a matter of opinion: Is it more important to kill all Gaza police protecting aid as they might be Hamas militants? Or is it more important that aid is distributed correctly and not stolen by criminal gangs (for exploitation) even if it means that some potential (and it is unlikely to be known if they are militants or not) Hamas militants aren’t killed (as long as they are distributing aid)? I suppose this comes down to how important it is from a military perspective to kill all Gaza police officers (many of whom are not Hamas militants).  
Now is Israel to blame for any of this?  
Now you could say that the IDF killing Gaza police is partly responsible for gangs stealing aid and selling it at extorted prices. But is there anything else?  
First we have to look into how much aid is getting into Gaza now versus before war:  
Before the war, 500 aid trucks were going into Gaza carrying aid and commercial goods, including things like food, water, animal fodder, medical supplies and fuel. What proportion of this aid was food and water is unclear. But what we do know is that before the war even started approximately half of the people in Gaza were food insecure and more than 80 percent reliant on humanitarian aid.  
https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/01/over-one-hundred-days-war-israel-destroying-gazas-food-system-and#:\~:text=Since%209%20October%2C%20Israel%20declared,insecure%20and%20more%20than%2080  
So there were already high levels of food insecurity before the war even started and reducing aid going into Gaza would worsen that. The UN claims that 500 trucks a day of just humanitarian aid need to go in at a bare minimum. Some may claim that these numbers have been exaggerated by the UN but these calculations assume that one aid truck could feed 4,000 people a day which seems like an overestimate if anything. However the most aid trucks allowed in on a single day since the war began was 300. There have been days where less than 10 trucks go in (less than 2% of the aid needed for that day). (https://www.npr.org/2024/02/21/1232605200/humanitarian-aid-gaza-israel#:\~:text=Roughly%20500%20trucks%20of%20humanitarian,spokesperson%20for%20UNRWA%2C%20the%20U.N.)  
Additionally in February less than 100 aid trucks went into Gaza a day on average. From January 1st to January 6th, only 21 per cent (5 out of 24) of planned deliveries of aid containing food and other lifesaving supplies reached north Gaza (where 300,000 people are still living) as the majority were rejected by the IDF. (https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/01/over-one-hundred-days-war-israel-destroying-gazas-food-system-and#:\~:text=Since%209%20October%2C%20Israel%20declared,insecure%20and%20more%20than%2080). According to the WHO, Israel blocked all aid going into Northern Gaza from January 23rd to February 27th. This is where starvation is at its highest levels and Israel started allowing aid into Northern Gaza once these reports came out as there were also reports of children starving to death in Northern Gaza (https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/04/middleeast/gaza-children-dying-malnutrition-israel-ceasefire-talks-intl-hnk/index.html).  
But is it Israel’s fault a lack of aid is getting into Gaza?  
Well aid takes a long time getting in due to lengthy inspections by Israel (some may say this is necessary, others may say this is done purposely to starve Gaza). The long queues for inspection have led to bottlenecks at the Rafah crossing, the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) said last month, adding that among items deemed “dual use” by Israel are power generators, crutches, field hospital kits, inflatable water tanks, wooden boxes of children’s toys and, “perhaps most depressingly, 600 oxygen tanks.”  
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/11/middleeast/why-only-a-trickle-of-aid-is-getting-into-gaza-mime-intl/index.html  
“Israel forces aid organizations to purchase food from Egypt and prevents them from buying it in Israel, which would allow for a more efficient and rapid transfer of goods. Israel also prohibits the private sector in Gaza from purchasing food, which could significantly increase supply.”  
“the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, listed several reasons why aid cannot be efficiently distributed. Among other things, he noted that trucks are inspected several times before Israel allows them into Gaza, and even then, long lines form due to the conditions at Rafah Crossing. The little food that does get in is very difficult to distribute due to the constant bombings, destroyed roads, frequent communication blackouts, and shelters overflowing with of hundreds of thousands of IDPs crowding into smaller and smaller areas.”  
https://www.btselem.org/gaza\_strip/20240108\_israel\_is\_starving\_gaza  
But what about the aid providers themselves, are they not to blame?  
Israel has blamed the lack of aid in Gaza on the aid providers themselves and some aid deliveries are postponed and cancelled by those providing aid themselves but how much and why? In January about 10% of aid missions (in the North and South) were postponed by aid organisations themselves ‘due to internal operational constraints’. But in North Gaza, 71% of aid deliveries were denied by the IDF or initially facilitated then impeded and in the South of Gaza 32% of aid deliveries were denied by the IDF or initially facilitated. So in my opinion, the IDF is more to blame for aid not getting into Gaza than the aid distributors themselves as far more aid deliveries are being denied being let into Gaza by the IDF than are being suspended by the aid distributors themselves.  
Statistics for January:  
Aid to North of Wadi Gaza: 16% of planned aid missions were facilitated. Of 61 planned missions to the north, ten (16%) were facilitated by the Israeli authorities, two (3%) were partially facilitated, 34 (56%) were denied access, and six (10%) were postponed by aid organizations due to internal operational constraints. In an emerging pattern, the access of an additional nine missions (15%) was initially facilitated, but subsequently impeded as routes designated by the Israeli military proved to be unpassable, or due to the imposition of excessive delays prior to the departure of the missions or at checkpoints en route.  
Aid to South of Wadi Gaza: 57% of planned aid missions were facilitated. Of 114 planned missions to areas assessed as necessitating coordination to the south of Wadi Gaza, 65 (57%) were facilitated, one was partially facilitated, eight (7%) were initially facilitated but then impeded, 28 (25%) were denied access, and 12 (11%) were postponed internally. The 25% denial rate represents an increase compared with December 2023, where two (12%) of 16 missions were denied access. The 12 postponed missions, all destined for or returning from hospitals and humanitarian sites, were an emerging trend related to the geographical spread of military activities. The denials Included critical resupply missions to hospitals and to address unexploded ordnance (UXOs).  
Additionally, IDF Checkpoints that inspect aid often opened later than planned (even though the planned times were already inadequate)  
https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/humanitarian-access-snapshot-gaza-strip-end-january-2024  
Israel has also reportedly rejected items going into Gaza with no clear reason (even those with no ‘dual-use’ functions)

Why can’t Israel starve Gaza?  
Well other than the fact it is deeply immoral, it is against several international laws to starve a civilian population as a method of warfare:  
“The starvation of the civilian population as a method of warfare is a serious violation of the laws and customs of war. This conduct has been prohibited under IHL since the adoption of two Additional Protocols (AP) to the Geneva Conventions.”  
https://starvationaccountability.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Factsheet\_1\_Prohibition\_of\_Starvation\_EN.pdf  
“by 1919 the Report of the Commission on Responsibility set up after the First World War listed “deliberate starvation of civilians” as a violation of the laws and customs of war subject to criminal prosecution.\[2\] The prohibition of starvation as a method of warfare is codified in Article 54(1) of Additional Protocol I.\[3\] This provision was generally considered new at the time of the adoption of Additional Protocol I but since then has hardened into a rule of customary international law. Under the Statute of the International Criminal Court, “intentionally using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare” is a war crime in international armed conflicts.\[4\]  
The prohibition of starvation is set forth in numerous military manuals.\[5\] Starvation of civilians as a method of warfare is an offence under the legislation of many States.\[6\] This rule is also supported by official statements and other practice.\[7\] This practice includes that of States not, or not at the time, party to Additional Protocol I.\[8\] Contrary practice has been generally condemned or has been denied by the accused party.\[9\]”  
https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/customary-ihl/v1/rule53  
Some have asserted Israel is weaponising starvation as a bargaining chip to get its hostages back. Again whether you think this is justified or not, it is clearly against international law (see above). Even if you think every adult in Gaza is linked to Hamas and has the ability to free hostages, 40% of Gaza are children under 14. Therefore, starving Gaza would lead to 800,000 children (under 14) not being able to eat. That’s 800,000 children who have no control over whether hostages are released or not being punished for the actions of Hamas.  
Statistically, only about 2% of Gaza are militants, obviously more people in Gaza will be connected to Hamas but we can realistically say that a majority of Gaza has no control over hostages being released. You may claim that these civilians should be focused on getting Hamas to release the hostages. Maybe, but they are probably more concerned about not dying and Israel plans to continue to attack Gaza even if the hostages are freed. Additionally, the people who have control over whether the hostages are released or not (Hamas, IJ etc.) have food stockpiled so preventing aid going into Gaza practically hurts everyone apart from the people that have the ability to free the hostages.  
So let me just make this clear: Stopping aid from going into Gaza will punish those who have the least amount of control of whether hostages are released or not. And even if starving the population of Gaza would force Palestinian civilians to encourage Hamas to release the hostages; it is still against international law.  
It is also important to note that many genocides (perhaps even most) have been committed through forced mass starvation/dehydration. Israel allowing some food into Gaza does not mean that it is not purposely causing mass starvation. For example, during the Holodmor in Ukraine (where 4 million people were killed through mass starvation), the Russians allowed the Ukrainians to eat some food just not enough to keep them alive.  
Is there any evidence Israel is using starvation against civilians in gaza as a weapon of warfare?  
There are several statements from Israeli government and IDF officials supporting starvation being used as a weapon of warfare (which is against several international laws). Here are some of them:  
https://twitter.com/ME\_Observer\_/status/1743067758374334571  
Knesset member Tally Gotliv : ""Without hunger and thirst among the Gazan population, we will not be able to recruit collaborators, we will not be able to recruit intelligence, we will not be able to bribe people, with food, drink, medicine, in order to obtain intelligence, and we know that finding the abductees is a supreme and super important goal alongside the goals of fighting.""  
Israeli General Giora Eiland’s in an article in Yediot Ahronot calls for genocide  
“The international community warns of a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and of severe epidemics. We must not shy away from it, as hard as it is. After all, severe epidemics in the south of the Strip will hasten victory.”  
https://twitter.com/davidsheen/status/1726206510286647501?s=20  
Israeli Army Colonel, Deputy Head of COGAT: speaking in a video filmed in Beit  
Lahia — one of the areas of Gaza which appears to have suffered particularly severe levels of  
destruction — and broadcast on Israeli television on 4 November 2023, Colonel Yogev Bar-  
Sheshet stated: “\[w\]hoever returns here, if they return here after, will find scorched earth. No  
houses, no agriculture, no nothing. They have no future;” another Army Colonel recorded in  
the same video, Colonel Erez Eshel (Reserve), also commented that: “Vengeance is a great  
value. There is vengeance over what they did to us … This place will be a fallow land. They  
will not be able to live here”.  
Tally Gotliv, MK for Likud Party  
“A brave government must announce that there is no deal\[11\]!! That’s it. There is no second chance for a terrorist organization that is playing with Israel. And from now, bombing without mercy! Full siege on Gaza! Until the Gazans beg we take the abductees and give them water and food supply. That is the language.”  
https://twitter.com/TallyGotliv/status/1727654112659915154  
Amihai Eliyahu, Minister of Heritage in an interview to Israel Cohen and Kol Barma (Twitter, 5 November)  
""We would not give humanitarian aid to the Nazis. There is no such thing as non-involved in Gaza.”  
Question: So what? Should we drop an atomic bomb on all of Gaza?  
https://twitter.com/YakiAdamker/status/1721050987526336964?s=20  
What about food that is produced within Gaza?  
“Most cultivated fields have been destroyed, and accessing open areas during the war is dangerous in any case. Bakeries, factories and food warehouses have been bombed or shut down due to lack of basic supplies, fuel and electricity. Stockpiles in private homes, stores and warehouses have long since run out. In these conditions, the family and social support networks that helped residents at the beginning of the war collapsed, too.”  
https://www.btselem.org/gaza\_strip/20240108\_israel\_is\_starving\_gaza  
Israel used the temporary ceasefire as an opportunity to destroy agricultural land used to grow food.

Starvation problems made worse by Bakeries being bombed  
https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog\_entry/bakeries-smashed-in-gaza-bombardment-exacerbate-hunger-crisis/  
What about the Israeli protestors blocking aid?  
There are some Israeli protesters blocking aid into Gaza. They have successfully delayed aid getting into Egypt and caused many trucks to be diverted but there is no evidence to prove they are causing a significant level of disruption.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMjB4y32mXM  
It is clear however the IDF and Israeli police could be doing a lot more to prevent this from happening. They are certainly a lot more rough with Israeli citizens protesting the war. Can someone please explain to me why the Israeli police are far more rough when dispersing orthodox Jews opposing military conscription than they are with protesters blocking aid going into a starving population.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyNt5f\_AKAA  
Why are the protestors blocking aid?  
Protesters believe that no aid should be allowed to go into Gaza until the hostages are released. Is this wrong? In my opinion using mass starvation as a weapon is abhorrent under any circumstances but even if you think it is justified, it is still against international law on many levels.  
TLDR/summary:  
There are several factors leading to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza:  
Palestinian criminal gangs stealing food to sell them at extorted prices.  
Only 20% of the aid that is needed to go into Gaza at a bare minimum is being allowed in. This is partly because aid distributors themselves have suspended deliveries (about 10% of cases) but mainly because Israel rejects aid deliveries going into Gaza (about 40% of cases).  
Israel takes an extremely large amount of time to inspect aid.  
IDF destroying a majority of agricultural land/farmland (bulldozing much of it during the temporary ceasefire).  
IDF destroying bakeries.  
A small amount of aid being blocked/delayed due to Israeli protesters (which the police/IDF have been very relaxed about compared to other Israeli protests).  
It seems that many in Israel are against aid being sent into Gaza at all (almost 70% of all Israelis according to Israeli channel 12 survey) including many members of the the Knesset who have expressed a wish to use starvation as a method of warfare.  
Aid was not allowed into Gaza whatsoever for the first two weeks of the war and water was cut off to the Gaza strip for 10 days.  
No aid was let into the North of Gaza for over a month leading to children dying of starvation."

A perspective has emerged, arguing that it's impossible to be racist towards white people, based on historical power dynamics and systemic inequality. However, this viewpoint oversimplifies the complex nature of racism and overlooks the fundamental principles of equality and individual experience. I contend that racism, defined as prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior, can indeed be directed at white people. This view challenges the notion held by some that racism requires systemic or institutional power to be considered valid.

  
To understand why racism can affect white people, we first need to clarify what racism entails. Racism is a belief or system of beliefs that denotes a race as inherently superior or inferior to others, leading to discrimination or prejudice based on race. It's crucial to recognize that while systemic racism—a form of racism embedded as normal practice within society or an organization—has disproportionately affected marginalized communities, individual acts of racism do not require systemic power to occur.

The argument that white people cannot experience racism often hinges on historical and systemic inequities, where white populations have held power and privilege in many societies. While acknowledging this history is vital, it's also important to recognize that racism's root lies in prejudicial attitudes that can target anyone, regardless of their racial or ethnic background. Discrimination based on race, regardless of the perpetrator's or victim's background, perpetuates the cycle of racism.

Arguing that one cannot be racist towards white people contradicts the principles of equality and universal human rights. Racism, in any form, is an affront to the idea that all individuals should be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their race. Individual experiences of prejudice and discrimination, including those faced by white individuals, are valid and do not diminish the experiences of racism faced by people of color. Dismissing or invalidating these experiences only serves to divide and hinders the collective effort to combat racism in all its forms.

The belief that white people cannot experience racism is a misconception that undermines the fight against racial discrimination. Racism is a pervasive issue that can affect anyone, and addressing it requires acknowledging all its forms. By understanding that racism transcends racial and ethnic boundaries, we can foster a more inclusive society that values and respects the dignity of every individual. Let's challenge ourselves to view racism through a broader lens, one that recognizes the humanity in everyone, irrespective of race."
120,2024-03-14,"CMV: The majority of incels aren't bad people, just guys that were dealt a bad hand in life and get mocked for it.",u/Tall_Promotion_7160,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bez3lx/cmv_the_majority_of_incels_arent_bad_people_just/,changemyview,"I think the way that ""incel"" is now becoming common insult against any man (regardless of whether or not he's an incel) is pretty concerning and demonizes a lot of men who just happen to be in a bad position.

For young people, an increasing number of men are being completely shut out of the dating field. Dating is becoming more superficial and more and more men are failing to meet the cut. If you look at statistics on young people dating, somehow a significantly larger amount of women are actively dating than men. I'm not going to say this is unfair, because it's not. It's not unfair for women to choose whoever they want to date. That being said, that doesn't really mean anything for how the men that are unable to date feel. Again, I'm not saying these men are entitled to women, but desire and negative emotions out of being unable to fulfill those desires are not going to go away just because you aren't entitled to women.

Men are romantically lonely. I know many people will say to just build friendships, but if friendships were enough for humans, no one would likely take the risk it is to get romantically entangled with someone. Most humans have a desire for romantic companionship, and in the world we live in some people just won't get that. For a lot of men, I would argue through no fault of their own. People will fight me on this and say ""if you can't find a girlfriend or can't get laid it's you're fault"" but I would like to ask a question. 

Do you think that it is possible for bad things to happen to people who do everything in their power to be good and do things right? Can a person who did everything right at their job, came in early, stayed late, and worked hard still be laid off? Of course they can. Unless you don't believe that, it's not consistent to think the same can't apply to dating. Life's just not fair, you can do everything right and still fail.

At the end of the day humans are animals and in the animal world, only the genetic best get to have partners. Sure humans deviated from that, but only after men practically enslaved women and made it so they couldn't survive in society without a father or husband and could be sold to men like cattle. It's not like that anymore and as a result, the more ""human"" dating practices are reemerging.

Some people are just dealt shitty hands and end up involuntarily celibate. Being an incel doesn't inherently mean you're a misogynist.  Hell the person who coined the term was a woman. Yet being an incel and incels are seen as punching bags and insult fodder even if they're not misogynistic. I've seen people telling just guys on reddit they look like incels. You can't tell me that they were trying to say they look like misogynists when many attractive men are also misogynists. They're talking about virginity and being unable to attract a partner. That's a sign people view these traits as something worthy of mocking, and it's not right."

zatanna has always been in underrated character in my eyes. i was first introduced to her via the justice league heroes video game for the playstation 2 and i've always liked her. i have a thing for magic themed heroes. not to mention, i love her sarcastic personality. she's like john constantine if he was american, a woman, and wasn't a colossal dick sandwich.  
  
also, i know i'm probably gonna sound like a woke dumbass for saying this but i feel like women are underrepresented in the justice league. with the exception of wonder woman, most depictions of the justice league are sausage fests. there should be another female character to balance it out and i think zatanna would fit right in.

I love a little bit of every genre, even including a good cheesy romance flick. That said, I've always had a gripe with sex scenes being forced into a lot of media.  
  
In my view, sex scenes can usually be alluded to and only serve as a way to add more minutes to your film or episode. For the sake of this argument, let's talk about the tendency to add sex scenes to stories where the same narrative beats would be hit if they'd cut down the scene and instead alluded to the characters making love. Is it really necessary to see two fairly attractive actors rolling around in bed on top of each other for 2-3 minutes? I could be part of a minority who just 'doesn't get it' whereas this is exactly what the vast majority of audiences want to see.  
  
A good narrative might use sex as a way to express something's not quite right in a relationship. The first example that comes to mind is Walter White in Breaking Bad and his sex life with Skyler. It doesn't feel like I'm watching two characters fuck to supplement adding additional scenes to the episode. It's not meant to be ""attractive"". It functions as a way to show Walter's transition from being very timid and unhappy to very ""alpha"" and confident.  
  
We don't need to watch characters get it on to feel the impact of their relationship. The same function can be served by simply suggesting through dialogue or a much shorter scene that they had an intimate moment. Intimacy can be shown in many other ways too. Sex scenes just feel super cliche, overdone and pointless in a lot of cases."

Instead of actually playing normal basketball the game becomes a free throw competition. This also drags the last 2 minutes of a game into like 20 minutes which slows the game down unnecessarily.

It's OK for fouls to be occasionally used strategically (almost any game rules will create such situations), buy when fouls are used on purpose in almost single game, this tells me that the fouls are not punished enough.

A clock run off is already used in other sports (e.g., NFL to prevent exactly this kind of foul gamesmanship).

From a humanitarian point of view, it is better for Israel, Egypt and the countries of the world to allow refugees who wish to emigrate outside the Strip, in order to rebuild their lives.

 A significant part of the population of Gaza was interested in emigrating to other countries even before the war, in order to improve their lives.  Hundreds of thousands of Gazans have left the Strip since Hamas came to power in June 2007, even when such migration was complicated and expensive.

 The desire for immigration, which was widespread on the eve of the war, is twice as widespread now, given the destruction and the absence of a peace horizon.  There is no justification for israel to continue perpetuating the fake eternal refugee of the residents of Gaza, or the international cooperation with the terror regime of Hamas.

 Accepting refugees from war zones is an accepted norm in the international system, including the recent wars in Ukraine and Syria. Israel must not agree with the exclusion of Gaza, and of Israel, from the international rules. The closing of the border by Egypt and the exploitation of the suffering of the Gazans to promote political interests is contrary to the norms, international law and the humanitarian interest of the worlds community


 As much as there is a real international interest in the reconstruction of the Strip, the discussion about the process and the arrangements of ""the day after"" cannot take place in the reality of an ongoing humanitarian crisis.  A humanitarian corridor must therefore be quickly established outside the Gaza Strip for those who wish to leave it.  The many resources allocated by the world for aid within the Strip can be directed to the establishment of temporary residence centers for the residents of Gaza - where they will also be offered options for permanent immigration, adapted to them, in a selection of destination countries."

Israel faces a unique and constant security challenge. The country's stance towards authorities that do not recognize its right to exist, and even reward terrorist activities by giving out 'martyr funds' is entirely justified. And Israel has no obligation to respect such authoraty. This context is crucial for understanding the need for Israeli settlements.

The presence of settlements in strategic areas is fundamentally about security. They ensure a military presence that deters threats from hostile groups, such as Hamas. The geography of the region, especially the West Bank's mountainous terrain and its proximity to Israel's heartland, including Tel Aviv, amplifies these security concerns. If hostile groups were to gain control of this high ground, they could launch attacks that would be difficult to intercept, even with advanced systems like the Iron Dome.

Many Israelis would prefer peace and would be willing to give up territories for a genuine peace agreement. However, the strategic importance of these areas cannot be ignored. Without the settlements, Israel's central region would be highly vulnerable to attacks from elevated positions in the West Bank.

The issue of settlements is deeply intertwined with Israel's right to defend itself and its citizens. Given the region's history and ongoing threats, these measures are not only understandable but necessary for the country's security."

First off, I'm not going to argue that Mahomes has more of a legacy than Brady at this point, or that he's more accomplished, because neither are even remotely true.

What I'm arguing is that he is, rather obviously, better at being a quarterback than Brady was. The raw stats back this up: pick just about any rate-based stat and Mahomes beats Brady.

He's clearly more physically gifted than Brady, able to extend plays and scramble for key first downs in a way Brady only rarely ever did. I don't think anyone would debate that Mahomes has the better arm as well. But beyond that, he's shown Brady-like levels of intelligence on the field. The last two seasons, we've seen Mahomes dial back some of his gunslinger tendencies to pilot a more conservative west coast offense, and he's had great success with it. He's shown that he can be the best player in the league even when not playing his preferred style.

The big difference to me is this: when I was growing up, Brady was generally always seen as elite, at least after 2007, but rarely did we think of him as the best QB in the league. Peyton Manning and Aaron Rodgers were usually out-performing him, and it was only really at the tail end of his career that Brady was seen as the best player of his generation.

Compare that to Mahomes, who has been the consensus best QB of his generation for a while now, even though he isn't 30 yet. People didn't retroactively decide that Michael Jordan was the best basketball player ever, they knew what they were seeing at the time.

I feel like that number 7 scrambles people's minds. It's so many titles that it's hard to even fathom, especially when the next guy has 4. But that's team success, and it shouldn't dictate reality. If I had to pick a single quarterback for one play, one drive, one game, or one season, I would pick Mahomes without hesitation, while Brady might be my 3rd or 4th option if I'm being honest.

It's entirely possible that I'm just biased, or that there's something I've missed. But having watched both of them play for a long time, I genuinely don't see how anyone could actually watch them and think that Brady was better."

Personally I believe things should only be taxed once. This why property and wealth taxes are wrong because you are taxing same money multiple times. Same goes to sales taxes especially when different goods are taxed differently. Now depending on your lifestyle and choices your total tax burden might be different.

But if we consider wealth creation it is done only by one single mechanism. Work is beginning of all wealth and no wealth can be created without some sort of work. This is birth of money and IMHO only point where it should be divided for redistribution. Also I believe that all income should be treated equally and taxed on same progressive scale no matter if it's labor or capital gain.

The most common way large corporations avoid paying taxes is either going to region with a low corporate tax rate or buying IP licensing (that they owe themselves) from a shell company where there are no taxes. But if only income is taxed someone must be doing work somewhere and that work will be taxed. Companies can't avoid paying taxes by this scheme at all.

To maintain same tax income and tax burden, actual income tax needs to be risen appropriately."

Something that we cannot have too much of. This as opposed to something like Aristotelian virtues, which require a balance.

Loyalty, as I understand it, compels you to do things that preserve/perpetuate something (could be a person, relationship, institution). Most eminently, loyalty is demonstrated when an action benefits that which you are loyal to, but hurts/damages/impedes/etc. yourself. Usually, loyalty is about valuing the beneficiary over others to whom one is not loyal.

I think that loyalty is the cause of many evils in this world and I would not want others to do evil for my sake, nor would I want to commit evils for some other things' sake.

Other people say they do value loyalty so I'm interested in what they see that I don't.

**Edit here that might be pertinent to a few commenters:**

I think having a history/understanding of others/relationships/institutions **is** a value. If you have gotten to know someone for 40 years, you understand what being in a relationship with that person is like as opposed to some unknown person with a silver tongue promising the world to you. This might be baked into your understanding of loyalty, so if you show me that that's how it is commonly understood, then that would change my mind."

1. I think that all gymnasts should be given a much wider range of attire choices. Male gymnasts should be allowed to wear leotards/unitards, while female gymnasts should be allowed to wear pants/shorts. It's especially important for women because often female gymnasts in leotards are sexualised, or couldn't perform if they are on their periods.

2. Remove the need for music and dance elements for women's floor apparatus. I think it should be optional for both men and women to include music or dance elements. Some people enjoy the choreography element of gymnastics while others don't. I don't see how that's relevant to how good a gymnast is.

3. Men should have rhythmic gymnastics, like this [video here](https://youtu.be/EQ-sorX193g?si=TBp0TftKxo3CYqmQ). I think it'd be a great addition for men to showcase the more artistic side of gymnastics. The physicality focused and the apparatus used will likely be different, but that's okay as it suits the appeal of a different set of athletes.

4. I don't know if this is doable, but I think men and women should have the same number of apparatus, probably five. I don't know how appealing this is but I think it's an outdated notion that women can only use 4 apparatus while men can use 6."

ICANN allows people and entities to register multiple domain names in bulk. This has led to domain squatters, essentially rent seekers who buy thousands of domain names in bulk with the hope of selling a few of them at very inflated prices to desperate entrepreneurs who are forced to pay a price to protect their brand name. This leads to   


1. Most good domain names not being available to genuine startups, despite actually not being developed by the owner. 
2. Startups forced to choose weird sounding, non-dictionary names 
3. Rent-seekers being able to profit off the hard work of people without adding any real value.   


Overall, reforms are really needed to set negative incentives on entities when they buy domain names with the sole purpose of squatting on them and not developing them. It's a bit hard to do in practice but not impossible. "

Also it was a kids animated show, it was made for kids for the most part and the showrunners and executives made the choice to get rid of that pesky, nuanced grey area that characterized the Clone’s turning on the Jedi prior to TCW to a straight “evil switch made good guy go bad.”

Matthew Stover’s novelization of Revenge of the Sith exemplifies this tension in my opinion. The author explains that the Jedi never knew the Clones were going to turn on them until it was too late in part because the immense wave of suffering and death that had engulfed the galaxy since the outbreak of the Clone Wars but primarily because the Clones felt no malice toward the Jedi. It was just an order they had to follow. There were contingency plans in place for if the Supreme Chancellor, Palpatine in this case, refused to leave office or was themselves convicted of treason. In that case the Clones would unhesitatingly remove them and anyone who supported them from power.

Which makes sense considering prior to the events of the war, they’d been training their entire short lives for this moment. Why else would the Jedi suddenly be able to call upon a group of men who had never interacted with the Republic outside a very abstract sense but were nonetheless ready to throw down their lives and their bodies on Geonosis the minute Yoda showed up?

Because they were trained (some might say brainwashed) to. It works on another level as it shows Palpatine didn’t just create one droid army, he created two. Except the one he gave the Republic was slightly more organic.

Instead all we got TCW show was “the evil switch”."

I understand that some schools may not be next to lush meadows, but a nearby park, with real trees and grass should be required within a certain distance of schools.

In all honesty, I think the time should be mandatory - the full class goes together to spend time outside where the kids spend time not focusing on school work and off of electronics. In fact, it should be enforced that no children are spending time on their phone or anything. Beyond that there should be no requirements - kids can play, or just sit and talk, or even read (which maybe gets into a grey area if its reading for school, but at that point its semantics of the idea).

This time to decompress from the regular stress of class is extremely important for developing minds. I also think this time in nature will allow kids a greater appreciation for the beauty of the planet, which is important as we hope to educate kids about the climate crisis as the grow up. The time in the sun is also very healthy.

I also think this practice should be continued through all years, though most necessary at earlier ages.

Of course, if someone has a condition that absolutely prevents this, exceptions could be made.

But even then, the fact that they are an ex is irrelevant because it’s not the problem - the problem is instead that you are emotionally cheating on your partner, which you can do with anyone.

If someone is my ex and I am in a romantic relationship then I no longer have feelings for them and don’t plan on getting back together, and I assume this is the same for most people. Those feelings towards them are something that used to be the case, but aren’t anymore so if I am friends with them it is no different to any of my platonic relationships with my other friends.

I’ve had sex with or made out with some of my friends and three of my friends are people who I dated 25, 19 and 11 years ago (I’ve been in my current relationship for ten years), and they have never been a threat to any of my relationships. Even at the start of my current relationship, when my last ex and I had only broken up under a year before, it wasn’t a problem that I spent a lot of time with him.

The people I (a man) have dated are mainly men and I know that ideas about this sort of thing are slightly different in gay and straight communities but I still think that the way some straight people see this topic is just very strange. For example, some people think that they can’t even be friends with anyone of  opposite sex/gender let alone an ex partner.

My friendships with my exes have never caused any problems in my romantic relationships because the vast majority of the ones I’ve had were healthy and secure.

But surely if it’s so taboo in general society to be friends with your ex partner then there must be a reason for it."

They cherry-pick philosophical aspects without equipping individuals with the context. 

E.g., the Power of Now vs. Sartre re: reflective consciousness. The entire “you are not your thoughts” dialogue traps people in an external-facing loop completely dismissing the interplay between consciousness and the world. It risks enabling behaviour by positioning people against self-reflection/realisation. 

Of course it’d help assist someone out of a negative inner dialogue, however it’s taking people from one extreme (internal: self-criticism) to another (external: avoidance). 

Here, the critical step would be something akin to Sartre on the dialogue between self and the other. 

Balance is needed but these books (with this only being one example) creates a culture of dependence and “preachiness”"

The reason we don’t get a lot of opportunities nowadays isn’t like the 50’s & earlier where it was mainly just because we were born black but, again, it all falls down to our negative culture.

The other movie next day was "" after we collided "" and it was almost comical with the bad boy dude and how it played on the women's emotion, they where on the front page so these movies are obviously very popular with women.

 My point really is in one of the movies the female main character said something like "" this is what is wrong with your gender "" ( to the man ) and it played to the modern woke feminst women.  But you can't really be attracted to toxic masculinty men then on the next day complain about and how you want to change men's behavior ? I know women's sexuality is not some reward system but it seems strange that you want men to change but you can't change your attraction to that kind of behavior?  

 So many of you women get so political, woke and "" modern "" after you hit 17 , you talk about  your emotional intelligence,  you go to therapy and we need to change toxic masculinty bla bla . But still the young dating market is very old school , most of the guys who have it hard to find sex/ gf is the low confidence bullied nerdy guys . Sorry but that's not going to work,  it's not working. You can keep screaming "" nice guy"" and "" incel "" al you want and yes those men obviously need to change but you need to change as well.  It's the same with feminist who want to pick and choose on what gender roles they like ,  iknow you probably like it more that men should pay on dates and be the one with confidence to ask you out ..  The dating market needs to change alot if you want a large procent of the male population to agree with your ideas."

I am by no means a comics expert, I actually haven't read more than a handful, all I know is what I've seen through various media like shows, movies, games, and so on. I say this all as a Batman fan, I also like Spider-Man, but I like DC stuff far more. If you are a Spider-Man fan, again I say this that I mean no disrespect, and I fully support you in liking whatever character you want. 

That being said, as a child I've always loved Spider-Man, Spider-Man is a super cool and a very emotionally in-depth character. But, thing is, his villains kinda suck lol. 

Hear me out. So his most iconic villain: Green Goblin. 

I don't think he's very original. Obviously just looks like the Joker. Look at me in the eyes and tell me that Green Goblin isn't just Joker but with a new Fortnite skin pasted over him. 

Same insane smile. Still wants nothing more than to torment the lead character and everyone he loves in any way possible. 

One is white. One is green.   
One is a clown, one is a Goblin. 

If you took Joker, painted his face green, gave him yellow eyes, and the whole medieval get-up, and the glider, you'd get Green Goblin. Green Goblin is essentially just the Joker but with some changes. But fundamentally at the core, they are exactly the same. All the insanity, and the same moral compass, which is to create chaos and torment the main character. 

For all the others, basically just take any animal and try to make that into a person somehow. Rhino, Vulture, etc etc.   
And I know this is my one point that's kinda lacking, cause Batman villains do this too, take the Penguin. 

And Black cat is basically just Catwoman. It's even the same animal, it's barely any different. Like, did we even try? Lol. 

I will say that the Spider-Man villains who I think are really cool are Venom, and Doc Ock. Sandman is kinda cool too I guess. 

Spider-Man and his stories are really cool, but I just don't like most of his villains very much. 

You can kill me now lol

Now, what I am saying does not align with my ideals, nor should it yours as pure utilitarianism is terrible as outlined by plenty of past examples, however I had thid thought and want you to point out where I'm getting it wrong as I obviously am: 

Hitler would have killed millions of innocent and unwilling people, but so did WW2. Plenty of people had no choice wether to fight or not. 
Hitler most likely wouldn't have caused all those deaths if allowed to take over Europe peacefully. Probably life would have been better for millions of people, the generations change along with societies.
All this to say that I personally think that in the western world we are currently underestimating the horrors of war. It is kind of like just before WW1, when all the colonial powers had gotten used to fighting against weaker opponents (ie colonies) in a similar way that today the US and Europe have (Iraq, Afghanistan) and are coming to underestimate what war is.
I mean I would probably prefer to go and live the rest of my life in Iran than have to go through  4 years of trench warfare.
Throughout history wether a country was conquered or not mattered little to the commoners, all that really changed was who you paid your taxes to.
For example: Ukraine. Ukraine was a corruption country with many cultural ties to Russia. 

Sure Russia is horrible, but would I go to war for 4 years to avoid having putin in charge? No not really.


You might say: what about all the minorities that would suffer and be abused under his rule? Well I might answer: what about all the kids that were unwillingly forced to the front line and killed afferma years of fear and terror?

The only people that really lose out in these conquests are the people in powers, but why should I care about them if they are more than willing to kill me so they can keep their riches and status.

Sorry for the rant, but please point out the fallacy in my reasoning. Because such an idea goes against my moral and ethical code, but I am answer to find why its wrong and if I should change my views.

Am I missing something?

Violinist Hypothetical: Imagine you woke up and found you were kidnapped. A famous violinist is suffering kidney failure but is now hooked up to you for survival. Only you can keep him alive. 

**1. You had no hand in causing his condition**

The most glaring problem with this hypothetical is that the Violinist's condition arose from within himself. You did nothing at all to cause him to require life support. On the other hand, pregnancy doesn't happen spontaneously. Fetuses do not appear out of thin air. Except for cases of rape, the pregnant person in some way caused the creation of the fetus. 

A more accurate hypothetical would be if you yourself caused the Violinist to have kidney failure and thus require you and only you to live.

**2. Letting someone die is categorically different than killing someone.**

The Violinist is dying and will die without any external influence. By contrast, aborting a fetus is actively undertaking an action specifically to end life. The difference between these two is so large it's kind of funny. And obviously there is less moral and legal obligation to save someone's life than there is to not kill them."

But the CTU is proof that you can have generous benefits and pay and *still* not see any meaningful change on the ground with kids in the classroom. This because on the most part it’s the responsibility of the parents to inculcate the values of learning in their kids and most kids aren’t up to the task, but also because the CTU is a racket that extracts billions upon billions of dollars from the federal and state government ostensibly for the purpose of helping kids but instead to line their own pockets. 

So if a CTU member makes far more then the average American teacher, do we see even marginal improvements amongst the student body? Well, not really. More schools continue to shuttered and closed down as parents pull their kids out to send to charter schools with teachers that actually care about the job meanwhile the CTU has went over parents heads and pulled cops from schools in the name of racial justice, knowing damn well anyone with a police scanner can hear the calls from schools to the police to come break up fights or because of gang violence.

This isn’t even mentioning their despicable laziness and stubborn entitlement during COVID-19. Long into the pandemic they were raking in benefits and pay like dragons hoarding gold while refusing to even consider teaching in-person. Meanwhile us first responders who’d been on the front lines dealing with it head on since March 2020. 

The CTU is no different then the corrupt police unions many on the Left hate that fight reform tooth and nail because it’ll take their privileges away. But nobody will admit it because

Sunday permits these quick wins because it is larger. It is more difficult in the sense there are more words that are individually more challenging, but on balance there are more revelatory opportunities. Saturday is the worst of both worlds: fewer quick wins and therefore “hints” but the individual words are more challenging."
3,2024-03-16,CMV: New Era Mortal Kombat Quan Chi has every right to becoming a villain,u/JoshuaKpatakpa04,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bgdflq/cmv_new_era_mortal_kombat_quan_chi_has_every/,changemyview,"That's right i said it New Era Mortal Kombat Quan Chi has every right to becoming the villain because i hate how Liu Kang has given him the short end of the stick and I'm going to write my reasons and justifications on why I believe Quan Chi has every right becoming the Villian.  
  
So in the new Mortal Kombat game in Liu Kangs new era we learn that everyone has different origins and the villains have been given a new shot at redemption. That sounds fine and dandy but here lies the problem How Liu Kang. We learn that Liu Kang basically made Quan Chi into a miserable miner essentially living a life of horrible servitude and almost like a slave basically. Here is his bio for further evidence.  
  
Mortal Kombat 1: ""Quan Chi was born into hard labor in an Outworld mine. He had no future, just the guarantee of certain death in its dark tunnels. To curry favor with the mine’s owner, Quan Chi informed on fellow workers who were planning a strike. It was broken and many strikers killed. The survivors were not going to forgive and forget. They plotted to kill Quan Chi. Quan Chi’s life was saved by a mysterious benefactor. In exchange for his service, she offered to free him from the mines and train him in dark magic. Quan Chi eagerly accepted. Now a master of the Netherrealm's most vile sorcery, Quan Chi plots with Shang Tsung to conquer the realms. He will not be denied.""  
  
Like Liu Kang wanted them to learn 'humility' and to become better, but the way he's done it is just bad and done horribly he's basically made him start at the bottom of life with no shot of a brighter tomorrow it's literally punishing new era Quan Chi simply because his alternate self was an evil person. To make it worse in one of the intro fights where Quan Chi is fighting Geras, Geras tells Quan Chi that Liu Kang wanted you're life to be hard not harsh. Could you imagine that two celestial beings said to you that we wanted you to go through hardships not pain just to become a better person it just sounds like fucking gaslighting someone and Quan Chi claps back at Geras that did Liu ever stop to check on him. The thing is if Liu wanted Quan and Shang Tsung to become better people instead of giving them mundane lives he could have raised them up in the White Lotus society for them to become incredible individuals. The way Liu Kang says he gave him a meaningless life too threw me off and sounds really fucking scummy aswell.  
  
Liu Kang shouldn't be angered nor surprised when he set someone will a terrible upbringing and hope for them to achieve redemption, but when they find out an all mighty God has given them an abhorrent existence they will rebel. If anything NRS actually has a good story arc for Quan Chi as he could serve as the biggest reminder of his flaws for the New Era."

When a party occupies the territory of another party, the occupier has the responsibility to provide aid to the civilians. Israel is no exception. They have air superiority and significant IDF presence in Gaza, they are occupying Gaza and therefore they have the responsibility to provide aid. America provided sufficient aid to Afghanistan and Iraq when they invaded those countries, and Israel is no exception.

2. The only reliable way to let aid in is through the land crossings, which Israel has a monopoly over. Even though Egypt technically controls the Rafah crossing, nothing can go through without Israel's green light. It's Israel's responsibility to make sure aid from other countries are allowed into Gaza.

Does Hamas has some responsibility too? Yes, but it's unlikely that they have enough aid to provide for millions of Gazans, and they don't control the land borders like Israel does. 

The situation on the ground is absolutely dire and desperate. Not providing or at least allowing sufficient aid into Gaza is immoral and inhumane. It amounts to at best collective punishment, at worst genocidal (a word I don't use lightly).

I'd like to hear why Israel doesn't have that responsibility or if they do, why they don't have to fulfill it."

1. It it likely selection-bias but online atheist communities, atheist and “anti-theist” alike, tend to act like religious faith and belief in the abstract are the root of all social problems (even when there is much more compelling evidence of deeper social and political conflicts.)

I don’t think this reflects the majority of atheists… more online people or people who see non-belief as a sort of identity. I know atheists who call themselves agnostics because of disassociating with self-described atheists.

2. Conflation of believers and instututions. How religious and religious-state institutions function and why people become religious or how they practice are not unified.

Religion is a social-political historical phenomenon not simply a grift with gullible sheep-like followers.

3. Elitism. Atheist spaces seem to avoid any discussion of harmful trends among atheists. The result is that sexist and antisemetic and Islamophobic and elitist arguments are too common and often protected for the sake of some concept of unity of atheists against theists. There has never been a reckoning with MRA and “skeptic” and colonial tendencies in online atheism.

4. Conflation of religion and spirituality. Atheists should be spiritually open and recognize that this is a basic human need (though one that doesn’t need to be satisfied through supernatural ideologies etc.)

Imo religious people are not driven by ideas and aren’t sheep… they are attempting to satisfy actual needs for meaning in life, non-commercial community, mutual aid. At best religion kind of offers some of this (but often with baggage like sectarianism or social hierarchy) but it can also just be a grift and can not possibly provide this to everyone. By downplaying this we are ignoring sincere needs of people that could be addressed more universally through social programs and reforms.  

5. Religious people are not inherently sheep, unintelligent, or the enemy.

when political forces are attempting to harness religious communities as a social base for reactionary projects or persecution, it is urgent that atheists not treat all religious people the same and instead recognize differences in religious communities and be able to have political or community alliances that isolate harmful or anti-democratic sects and tendencies."

The reason I believe this restrictions are important, are to make sure that sex offenders can never harm anyone in the future, while protecting the most vulnerable people against sexual offenders. I believe the rules should be the ones states below.

1 - They should register with the authorities at least every month after their release from prison, especially when they change address. Both name, address, place of occupation, photo and convictions should be listed in a public online list.

2 - They shouldn't be able to live within 1000 meters of schools and places where children may congregate.

3 - They shouldn't be able to own electronic devices, photo or video material and shouldn't have access to the internet, unless allowed by the official authorities.

4 - They shouldn't be allowed to attend universities, have jobs with the government or jobs with minors or as healthcare professionals. They shouldn't also be entitled to any type of social benefits, except for retirement funds or disability.

5 - They shouldn't be allowed around minors, even with their own children. Fathers can't have access to their children, even with supervision, while mothers have to surrender their children to social services if they become pregnant.

6 - They shouldn't be allowed to own sexual products, like toys, lubricants, pornographic material and contraception methods. They shouldn't be allowed to marry (unless they were married before being convicted of a sexual offence) or have intimate relationships, while being banned from having any type of sexual contact with anyone, even if consensual.

I believe that any sex offender that violates this rules should be sent to prison, unless the violation was minor. In the end, I also believe they all sex offenders should be able to get themselves removed from the registry after a period between 10 and 20 years.

I am aware that my point of view can be considered draconian or even cruel, but I believe that everything is worth it to protect children. Change My View."

Very different to stole a biscuit, now no biscuit after dinner because I stole a biscuit.  
  
And they also show that when a child is old enough to understand why they are being hit that non-physical punishment is equally as effective and less mentally harmful in the long run.   
  
Do you know who benefits the most from hitting as a punishment? 

The parent. It gives a satisfaction rush. 

Parents do it because it makes them feel good.   
  
Basically kids have two stages: too young to understand why they are being hit so physical punishment is useless for anything other than teaching a child that bigger stronger people can hit you whenever they like (Which sounds like the same lesson you would learn from abuse)  
  
And the second stage is old enough to be reasoned with so many punishment options are available and you chose physical violence because it makes \*you\* feel better, which is an abusive action.

I've been listening, yet I still don't get it.  

To be sure, there's a lot to complain about.  He helped the Saudis kill hundreds of thousands in Yemen.   He cranked federal spending up to ludicrous speed.  He surrendered America's economy and civil liberties to NIH bureaucrats for an unprecedented, illegal, and catastrophic public health experiment, which he still claims was a huge success.  Yet none of that draws criticism from the left.

Instead the complaints I hear about Trump are over trivia like hush money or mean tweets.  Or they're brazen lies like the ""fine people"" hoax.  Or they're hallucinations about concentration camps or ""ending democracy,"" whatever that means.  Or they're major crimes the Democrats committed themselves like Russiagate, the theft of the 2020 election, or the Jan 6 coverup.  Or they're like the ongoing prosecutions and efforts to prevent us from voting for him--acts of arson upon free speech, due process, and every toothpick of civic capital that has made western civilization successful over centuries.  

If Literally Hitler is such a threat, why all the lies, the civic vandalism, and the manufactured hysterics over non-crimes?  I can understand why Democrats are offended by the ""Trump Derangement Syndrome"" diagnosis, but we can all see their behavior.  There is no other term that matches the hypnotic fixation on the orange man, the diatribes that make no sense, and the desperate, destructive behavior to stop him at all cost.

I've been struggling for years to understand why Democrats find Trump so triggering.  My theory--and perhaps you can change my mind?--is they're experiencing a massive, existential cognitive dissonance as the failure of progressives' vision becomes harder and harder to deny.

America's 1789 Constitution enshrined classical liberalism's vision of a limited government that exists only to secure citizens' rights to life, liberty and property.  Liberals warned that unless strictly limited in scope, government would seize more and more power away from the citizens, intrude more and more on our lives, and devote itself to enriching its patrons rather than the common good.  

Progressivism is the belief that government activism can solve social problems.  It rose in America in the late 19th century in opposition to liberalism.  It sought and steadily got a more expansive government that imposed itself initially in setting freight rates for rail transport.  Fast forward a century or so, and it now dictates every aspect of everyone's lives, from how far apart any two humans must stand to what ideas constitute ""hate.""  

But our social problems are not only not solved, they're worse than ever.  The war on poverty ended the natural decline on poverty.  The Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914 launched the war on drugs; now overdoses are a leading cause of death.  The New Deal created federal agencies to encourage homeownership; 80 years later millions can't even afford to rent and end up homeless.  

Progressives are in a pickle.  For decades they told themselves that electing this guy rather than that, or this next campaign finance reform, would turn everything around and make government start working for the people.  Everything would have worked fine, you see, if that horrible Ronald Reagan hadn't deregulated us back to 1850 (or whatever they imagine he did).

But these stories are no longer working. The country is falling apart. Government's bloat and corruption is obvious to everyone.  Red states have had enough of policies that don't work and progressive leaders who don't learn, as they illustrated in 2016.  The left can see for itself the social collapse in blue cities.  Yet what are they going to do, admit the theory of progressivism doesn't work?  That's unthinkable, because it would undercut their whole political identity.

So they do what humans always do: scapegoat.  In this case blame everything on the bad orange man.    If we can just defeat him in November and keep the senile, corrupt, neocon Democratic machine politician in power, that will be the start of the great turnaround.  It's a cope, to avoid acknowledging the painful, deranging truth.

But hey, CMV."

I promise this isn’t some attempt to be an edgelord or a “devil’s advocate”. But if someone truly believes in the idea of bodily autonomy, shouldn’t that include the right to end your own life?

 I mean, I just think it’s unfair. We are born into this world without consent, but now we can’t even choose to opt out of it? Isn’t that cruel? I just don’t get it. 

Everytime I try to ask someone about this, the conversation is so surface level. It’s like all they know is spouting empty platitudes to make themselves feel better. All the justifications are so selfish. Such as, “Suicide doesn’t end the pain, it just passes it onto someone else”. Often that is a sad truth, but living a life you never asked for just to keep other people happy feels a lot worse to me.

Let’s say there’s a person that doesn’t feel happy with themselves or their life. But that’s because they never asked for this. They never asked to be born, to go through school, and to live as an adult. Why are they labeled as mentally unstable for finding it unfair that they’re living when they never asked for it? And it’s not like there’s specific things that are stopping them from enjoying life. Because they don’t WANT life. Whether they get a happy life or sad life, they don’t want it.

I’d say that my mindset is perfectly reasonable. After all, there are people who never asked for life but are happy they got it anyway. So why is the reverse not allowed? 

I’d say that’s like demanding someone to like chocolate even though they don’t like it just because most people like chocolate."

And if you look at the AR - 15 it causes a negligible amount of gun deaths compared to handguns. So why does nobody says ""nobody NEEDs"" a handgun when overwhelming of gun deaths, murders, robberies and mass shootings are committed with handguns instead of rifles? It's simple. The AR 15 is scary looking which intimidates people so out of emotion and fear they prefer to try to ban that gun out of all the other ones when there's no rationale behind doing so when you look at the data. 

So when you say nobody ""needs"" an AR-15, that's a terrible argument to why people shouldn't be allowed to have one.

91,2024-03-17,CMV: There's no way that a significant portion of people don't have an inner monologue.,u/HelpfulJello5361,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bgok90/cmv_theres_no_way_that_a_significant_portion_of/,changemyview,"A prominent youtuber recently made a video about [this article](https://www.bustle.com/wellness/does-everyone-have-an-internal-monologue). They reference a Tiktok trend in which people claim not to have an inner monologue, and others express their incredulity. They also reference two studies about this.

Some thoughts about this article:

First off, The Tiktok trend is a farce.

We live in an attention economy. People will lie or make insane assertions in order to get attention, especially ones that cannot be empirically proven, such as things that are ""internal"" in the psychological sense. We saw a similar trend with people who would claim to have multiple personalities. In my view as a Psych grad, this was all just people putting on a performance.

But digress.

If you actually go to one study that the article references (at least they actually linked it), you'll see some problems.

In the article, they say ""only 30-50% of people have internal monologues"".

If you have a capacity for critical thinking, you probably had the same reaction that I had: ""There is **no way** that is true"". I went to the first study.

Two main takeaways from the study:

**1) The subjects in the study are 367 Chinese undergraduate students.**

So right away you can really potentially draw conclusions about Chinese students.

**2) The questions they asked were poorly worded and not at all clearly referencing ""thought""**

The questions they asked the students were:

\> “I talk to myself when…”

and

\> “I talk to myself silently when…”

So these are not at all clearly meant to reference ""thought"". They're about ""self-talk"", which is not at all the same thing. Any reasonable person would interpret this as literally talking to yourself (out loud) or talking to yourself ""silently"" - a reasonable person would interpret this as like, muttering to yourself, or something like that.

In the rest of the study the term they use is ""inner-speech"". This is not the same as thought.

You look at the second article this article links and it's the same problem:

>Consider inner speech. Subjects experienced themselves as inwardly talking to themselves in 26 percent of all samples, but there were large individual differences: some subjects never experienced inner speech; other subjects experienced inner speech in as many as 75 percent of their samples. The median percentage across subjects was 20 percent.

They're using that term again. ""Inner speech"" and ""inwardly talking to themselves"". I don't believe subjects in studies would interpret this phrase as ""inner monologue"" or ""thinking to one's self"".

So I have a problem with this article and this study and blog post or whatever it is.

My final thought is a more straightforward one:

If it were genuinely true that 50-70% of people don't have an internal monologue, why would so many tv shows, movies, cartoons, and books repeatedly have characters using inner monologues? It's very commonplace. If **up to a majority** of people didn't have an inner monologue, wouldn't there be widespread confusion amongst audiences about what these characters are doing? Wouldn't people without inner monologues be puzzled and ask people around them: ""Hey, what's going on with this character? They're talking to themselves? I don't know what this means.""

The Audience tests/focus groups/whatever that studios do for these shows and movies would get all kinds of comments like this, wouldn't they? Or do the people without inner monologues just assume that it's some kind of cinematic or narrative device invented for the films and have no comment or confusion about it? Really?

Anyway, I find this whole thing to be too strange and ridiculous to believe. Change my view."

If a man wants to sleep with multiple women, it is fair to allow the woman to sleep with multiple men. It makes complete sense if she feels unloved and unsatisfied sexually, you are not giving her your 100%, why should she give you her 100%? Women have sexual needs too and those needs might not be met if the man is spending energy on mutliple women. There are multiple arguments that are used to justify this: The first one is an appeal to nature such as ""it is male nature to want to spread the seed, while it is female nature to choose the best mate"" , even if this was true, just because something is natural/unnatural, it does not mean it is good/bad or should/shouldn't be done, for example, it is natural to not brush your teeth with toothpaste, toothpaste is a human creation, but if you don't brush your teeth for a long period of time they'll go bad, that isn't desirable. Another argument they say is that powerful men used to have multiple women, that's another fallacy, just because some people in the past did things X way, does not mean that is good or should be done, slavery was also a thing in the past. Third argument I want to talk about is the paternity argument, while it is true that is harder to determine who is the father if a woman sleeps with multiple men than viceversa, especially in the past before modern technology and women needed to know who was the father because they needed a man to protect them , and no man was gonna take care of her if they knew she slept with multiple people, while all of that is true, it is no longer the case, and since it's not longer the case, even if it is ingrained in your biology, it is fine to ignore it, you can acknowledge things had a purpose in the past then move past them. Last argument I see is that ""if a woman wants you bad enough, she'll let you do it and she won't want to sleep with others"" I could also argue that if a man wants you bad enough, he won't sleep with other people and let you sleep with other guys, but they would view that as wrong for some reason and not hypocritical, they would probably resort to ""their biology, they are territorial, it's natural"" again appeal to nature,  I don't want to extend too much so...

I am willing to change my mind if you prove to me that it is not hypocritical or selfish for a man to expect faithfulness from women while he sleeps with multiple women, and give a good enough argument as to why women should be okay with that, refute what I said above basically."

1,2024-03-17,CMV: Supporting Israel and Opposing Palestine Should Be Considered a Progressive Viewpoint,u/AMGEmperorMundatus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bgr0ax/cmv_supporting_israel_and_opposing_palestine/,changemyview,"I do not consider myself a progressive for a few reasons. I believe that Rittenhouse acted in self-defense (though the decision to defend a car dealership during a riot as a 17-year-old was questionable). I have a nuanced view on gun rights and know that criminals can and do obtain guns illegally. However, the main issue on which progressives and I disagree is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and considering the facts, I feel that we really should agree. If you haven't figured it out by now, I am a pro-Israel Zionist.

**Israel: A Progressive Island in a Sea of Barbarism**

Overall, Israel is a socially-progressive country and the only such country in the Middle East. The Jewish state grants equal rights to all citizens, and its large Arab minority has full representation in the Knesset. Arab citizens of Israel also have more rights than Arabs outside of Arab and a much higher standard of living. Israel is also one of the only countries in the Middle East where homosexuality is legal and arguably the only one where homosexuality is both legal and accepted, as while it is legal in Jordan, the West Bank, and Lebanon (I think), many people in those countries are still willing to murder gays. Same-sex marriages are not performed in Israel, but that is because civil marriages in general are not performed in Israel, meaning interreligious marriages aren't performed either. The Israeli government nonetheless recognizes same-sex marriages performed abroad and gives same-sex couples the right to adopt. If you want to know just how accepting Israels are of the LGBTQ+ community, then look no further than Tel Aviv, which is considered one of the gayest cities in the world and annually has the second-largest Pride parade in Asia. For comparison, the Palestinian Pride parade begins on a roof and ends on either a sidewalk or in a person's digestive tract.

To say that the rest of the Middle East lags behind Israel in terms of social progress would be an understatement. Only a couple other Middle Eastern countries allow homosexuality, and social taboos still make it *de facto* illegal in those countries. In Saudi Arabia, women were not allowed to drive until a few years ago and still cannot leave their homes without a man, whether it be their father, husband, or even son. Saudi Arabia and a few other Middle Eastern countries also prescribes the death penalty for homosexuality, though Saudi Arabia allegedly hasn't enforced said law recently. That said, in the equally-theocratic Iran, the death penalty for homosexual acts *is* enforced. Plus, like I said, there are still millions of people in the Middle East that would behead you or throw you off a roof for being gay. It's so bad that the term ""conservative"" doesn't really describe them. This might sound racist, but ""uncivilized"" or ""barbaric"" are probably more apt terms. In terms of progressiveness, Israel blows them out of the water.

Based on these facts, I feel that progressives would have every reason to not only support Israel's right to exist, but also to stand with Israel in the current war and oppose Palestinian statehood. An independent Palestinian state would, in all likelihood, result in another quasi-theocratic Islamic state in the Middle East where women and non-Muslims are second-class citizens and queer people lose their heads. That progressives support an independent Palestinian state and thus tacitly supports another Islamist dictatorship baffles me. If progressives are really the pro-LGBTQ+, pro-democracy people they are, then why don't they support Israel? From what I can tell, the simple reason is antisemitism.

**Antisemitism: A Left-Wing Phenomenon**

The anti-racist movements of recent years have given rise to a new kind of hate among its supporters, most notably a ""new antisemitsm."" But hate, like war, never changes, and the ""new"" antisemitism really isn't anything new. The ""new"" antisemites say the same things about Jews as the ""old"" antisemites. They both say that Jews only care about themselves and view all goyim as beneath them; they just do so in different contexts. The Nazis said that the Jews were plotting to destroy Germany from within and undermine German culture. The progressives of today say that the Jews are perennial oppressors that have infinite wealth and privilege solely for being Jewish. The antisemites of old said that Jews kill Christian babies and use their blood in religious rituals. The progressives of today say that Jews kill Palestinians for no reason. The parallels are undeniable.

Indeed, progressives often view Jews as white, when many Jews don't consider themselves white. Granted, white supremacists tend to hate Jews for *not* being white; there's a reason why Jews are sometimes called ""Schrödinger's whites."" The fact that Jews are one of the most successful demographics in America and the wealthiest religious demographic means that Jews are often viewed as white in discussions of white privilege. In the minds of progressives, the logic is simple: White people are oppressors, Jews are white, and Jews are therefore oppressors.

The issue with this line of logic is that it is not only false but completely ignorant. Nearly every country   
 in history with a Jewish population persecuted its Jews. They forbade Jews from owning property, denied them citizenship, expelled them, and, in some cases, killed them. By far the worst instance of anti-Jewish persecution was the Holocaust, in which some 6 million Jews were systematically murdered by the Nazis in order to achieve a racially-pure society. And yet, according to one poll, one-fifth of Zoomers (who tend to be progressive) deny the Holocaust. Additionally, 70 percent of Zoomers believe that Jews are always oppressors. I believe that these two statistics are related, that Holocaust denial among Gen-Z (my generation) is a direct result of the belief that Jews can only oppress and can never be oppressed.

Now, I am in no way accusing all leftists of antisemitism, nor am I suggesting that antisemitism is nonexistent among rightists. There's a reason George Soros is one of the right's favorite scapegoats. However, the right has overwhelmingly come out in support of Israel and condemned support for Hamas among supposed progressives. The fact that progressives keep finding themselves on the wrong side of the Israeli-Palestinian debate just hurts progressive causes, and the smallest damage to a cause can completely destroy a movement."

When I was in year 6, for our civics class, we had to write essays where we picked a political issue and elaborate on our stance on it. I picked an anti-nuclear stance.

But that was 17 years ago, and a lot of things have changed since then, for the worse:

* [Australia became the first country to vote in a government to remove a carbon tax](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/17/australia-kills-off-carbon-tax) \- illustrating that progress on climate action can be reversed
* [Germany is expanding coal mining](https://euobserver.com/green-economy/157364) because of a shortage of Russian gas - illustrating that many countries are not yet ready to completely switch to renewables
* The recent wave of climate protests in Australia [only backfired because it led to us losing our right to protest](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/05/30/australias-crackdown-climate-activists)

There are many arguments to be made against nuclear power. A poorly-run nuclear power plant can be a major safety hazard to a wide area. Nuclear can also be blamed for being a distraction against the adoption of renewable energy. Nuclear can also be criticised for further enriching and boosting the power of mining bosses. Depending on nuclear for too long would result in us exhausting our Uranium reserves. 

But unfortunately, to expect a faster switch to renewables is just wishful thinking. This is the real world, a nasty place of political manoeuvring, compromises and climate change denial. Ideally, we'd switch to renewables faster (especially here in Australia where we have a vast surplus of renewable energy potential), but there are a lot of people (such as right-wing party leader Peter Dutton) standing against that. However, they're willing to make a compromise made where nuclear will be our ticket to lowering carbon emissions. What point is there in blocking a ""good option"" (nuclear) in favour for a ""best option"" (renewables) that we've consistently failed to implement on a meaningful scale? 

Even if you still oppose nuclear power after all this, nuclear at worst is a desperate measure, and [we are living in desperate times](https://theconversation.com/climate-tipping-points-are-nearer-than-you-think-our-new-report-warns-of-catastrophic-risk-219243). Several years ago, a co-worker of mine once warned me that ""*if the climate collapse does happen, the survivors will blame your side for it because you stood against nuclear*"" - and now I fear that he's right and I'm wrong, and I hate being wrong."

They say we can't refute god when we can't even agree on a definition of god.

My view: 

This ignores the fact that each one of those different conceptions is a theory all by itself, and each god theory deserves its own consideration. No need (and it doesn't even make sense) to lump them altogether, as if we need a single refutation for the lumped together God theory.

The correct perspective, as far as I know, is this:   
Every theist has their own theory of god. Each one is a separate theory. Each theory deserves its own consideration and potentially its own refutation. (Obviously there are some things that are shared by 2 or more people.)  
For each theory, ask of it, what's your purpose? The purpose needs to be clearly explained. No ambiguity. If there's ambiguity, we already have reason to reject it. This is because ambiguous theories make contradictory implications. And this is why in science we reject any theory that is ambiguous. This is the logic used to reject all myths.   
   
If a theory passes the no-ambiguity test, now it's time to scrutinize whether the theory actually serves its purpose. If it doesn't, reject it. If it does, don't reject it. And to be clear, I mean \*don't reject it yet\*. At this point it's time to scrutinize it in other ways.   
I've done this with every god theory I've ever encountered and I refuted all of them. Usually the refutation is: this is ambiguous/vague. In the other cases, the purpose is not ambiguous, in which case I refute them by showing how they fail to serve their purpose. This is a way of pointing out an internal contradiction.  
These are the standards I use to judge whether or not god exists. And it's the same standards we use for physics theories and any other theories from any other field where the scientific approach is being applied.

Take a look at [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/s/Eg6c0W7LEn) and you will see how taxing dating has become. 

Dating apps are basically useless for men, even for men who get some matches because women on dating apps aren’t even exactly looking to go on dates, at this point it seems like women are seeking validation and an ego boost from the tons of matches they get. 

The dating standards have become ludicrous at this point, and no, it is not “incel” to point out how the extremely high standards that a lot of women are holding for men is ridiculous. 

That’s the equivalent of me wanting a super model who vibes with me but I can’t even give anything in return. Thats exactly what dating has become now. Women seek men who are in the ‘top percentages’, but what do they provide in return? 

They are problematic and want to be treated like ‘passenger princesses’, and expect men to be both “modern and traditional” at the same time. 

Dating would have remained *simpler* if dating apps didn’t exist, but these dating apps and even social media has completely warped women’s minds because of the tons of attention women get from DM’s, and likes on Instagram and those sort. 

And a lot of the older men who will probably read this post will never understand the struggles of younger men today who are trying to date, because you never grew up in an era where women hold men to such ridiculous standards and even the average men are being seen as disposable and useless. 

At this point why even bother trying to date? Might as well stay single forever, focus on my career, take care of my parents and get a dog.

Change my view and tell me why dating isn’t a chore in today’s age, especially for younger men.

Go for it. You wanna get your nips out? Men can do it so go for it. You wanna sell your body for money? Go ahead. You don't need no man"" etc the list goes on. 

I genuinely think that modern feminism such as the above strips away the most important things we have as humans - respect, dignity and morality. These are all things NO ONE can take away from you but modern feminism makes it so you can give these things up all under the guise of empowerment.

If you are willing to sell your body for money, you have already lost your dignity, what else are you willing to do? And I'm not just making this up, many sex workers and only fans girls have come out and are speaking about how deeply unhappy they are but they won't leave because of the $$$ they make.  It's very sad.

I think that modern feminism wants to tear down the familial structure, and push us towards being individualistic, to make you vulnerable. When you are vulnerable you are insecure, and are more likely to consume and this is why there's so much ""you don't need no man"" because it wants to seperate men and women and male people alone and miserable. The amount of young people I talk to who are jaded towards marriage and relationships is insane. They tell me my marriage will end in divorce one day. I'm a child of divorced parents, it was a nasty one too so I was easily pulled into modern feminism messaging that I saw on social media and started to blame men for everything. I  was scared to get in a relationship. It made me think men were evil and will just ruin your life. It was very toxic.

With age I have thought deeply about these topics and through observing others snd how they interact with the world, i have learnt that there are many broken damaged people, who are deep down terrified and I really do think modern feminism is one very small peice of the puzzle as to why people are so sad.

The government trained people to handle situations through control and force, created prison towns whose economy depends on continued incarceration of people. During the war on terror domestic fascists advocated a strategy of joining the military for training and recruitment purposes. The military has had Nazi scandals… major urban police forces have also had scandals involving fascist networks within departments.

Yeah, I know dating apps are terrible. I know there is some kind of ""loneliness"" epidemic. But many men are way too tunnel-visioned on sex or even dating, when I think they are neglecting how awesome they would feel if they had a bunch of best bros backing them up.

I've basically never even seen most of them. Maybe 1-2 clips of them or so. Unless math, science and educational YouTubers count as such.

My main thesis is: The main reason many people fall victim to influencer scams is because we take their word as gospel, with nothing to show for it.

While holding them accountable is good and should be done, it does not prevent potential victims from falling victim to a scam of a similar nature again.

The solution this: View influencers for what they are. Just random dudes on the internet that post videos, skits, pranks or.... sexy content for views, sponsors and followers.

These people are not powerful, they are not worthy of worship and most importantly, they have no \*actual\* influence, like politicians, scientists, business people etc whose influence is far more significant. Most of them are just vloggers, models, you name it.

By encouraging a culture of: *These people are just entertainment. They are not nutritionists, crypto experts, AI experts, etc, unless they show \*undeniable evidence\* that they are,* we will solve basically 99% of the problems with them **straight to its root**

It is natural to want to help these people, so the internet has collectively decided on a few standard maxims to give out in response: go to the gym, dress better, wash your face, ass, and everything in between, and don't be a wannabe ""alpha male"" douchebag. 

Here's the thing: I **don't** disagree with any of that, these are all good things and you should do them. But my issue with these statements as advice is that they are too formulaic to sound human and sincere, they are solitary rather than social, and run the risk of being condescending. Let me break why I think this advice is ineffective.

&#x200B;

Hit the gym: No disagreement here. It does wonders for your mental and physical health, but it's only a beginning step that many have already taken. For the most part, just going to the gym entails doing your workout by yourself with headphones on while everyone else does likewise. Powerlifting groups, rock climbing gyms, and team sports can be better in this regard, but I never hear anyone explain it this far, leaving many who take this advice underwhelmed. See ""gymcel"" and ""villain arc"" subcultures for many people do work out but still have an antisocial mindset. Also, because dating is inevitably intertwined with perceived success as a man, getting jacked is overrated for attracting women. Studies and many people's personal experiences show that men value large muscles on the whole more than women, who *generally* prefer a leaner build that is hard to even see when you're wearing clothes. I could see how going from overweight/skinnyfat to being in shape makes a big difference, but this advice is usually given without the poster saying anything about their weight, so it's probably not the silver bullet it's presented as.

&#x200B;

Dress better: Sure, but being dressed nice alone in your apartment will only make you feel better for so long. Again, I'm not against dressing nice, but to point out that it's a solitary activity that amounts to buying shit and finding a new aspect of the self to worry about. Also, IMO the standard Reddit fashion advice to wear chinos and a button down shirt may not work for everyone who isn't trying to pick up chicks at their dad's country club.

&#x200B;

Wash your face/ass: I mean yeah, but also no shit. I actually do know a lot of women who talk about a guy being clean and smelling nice as a positive, but telling guys the absolute most obvious basics is just condescending and doesn't go into any kind of detail.

&#x200B;

Don't be a creep/toxic/redpilled/misogynist: To sound like a broken record, this is true, but it's an admonishment, not advice. It presumes that a person in despair is necessarily bad and has done something to deserve their suffering, which is never a great opener. I think social success and dating are complex and don't fit neatly into a moralistic narrative where bad people are punished and good people rewarded. We all know there are toxic guys who still date, good people without success, and guys who will opportunistically adopt the ""right"" positions regarding gender but not actually treat women with respect when the chips are down. I also think this represents how culture war posturing has overshadowed practical considerations about building a social life. Actually having female friends and acquaintances will do more to change your attitude on women than debating some guy on the internet.

&#x200B;

I don't think it's a coincidence that such advice is often given by younger introverted Reddit users to other young introverted Reddit users. This is just a hunch with no way to prove it, but I suspect that a lot of the people rattling off these sayings could be in a similar position, given that they rarely share how they individually developed an active social life or a relationship. This admittedly comes from my own perspective, given that my relationships have come from friends of friends, and I don't get how solitary activities would make a huge difference in what is essentially a social problem. I understand this is very subjective and comes down to lots of maybes and personal experiences, so it's not my intention to ""debunk"" anyone who makes a legitimate effort at helping people with complex problems. I'm not saying I'm the expert and I have the answers, I just wish people would themselves be more human and personable when telling others how to be more human and personable. "

To a large extent, this ideology makes sense. I am not saying that all jobs are amazing and that we should go to work every day with a big fat grin across the face and not complain about anything. 

And I'm also aware that most people live to paycheck to paycheck and are mentally exhausted due to a lack of WLB. But the main culprit for that is the 5 day work week. Not the work itself. 4 day work week should ideally be the norm. Anyway, I'm not getting into that tangent.

But what I'm trying to get to is we would be almost paralysed if we didn't have to work. More importantly, we would go insane if there was no routine in life. The work we do is important to us not only because of the monetary aspect. IT IS what gives us purpose. Let's take an individual who has all of Maslow's law of hierarchy of needs covered. let's say we gave him enough money every month to take care of himself without having to work a single day in his life. What do you think he'll spend the rest of his life doing?

Common ideas:

Spend time with family and friends.

Follow his passion. Start a band. Become a youtuber. Became a athlete. 

Travel the world.

But for how long can a person live like that? It might be exciting for 5 years. Maybe 10 years. But after a point, he's going to hit an existential crisis. At least that's what I think. Looking for someone to change my mind.

The key principles of New Way Libertarianism include the following characteristics that will benefit society according to the description:

- The movement would advocate for a decentralized power structure, promoting local and regional governance as a means of limiting the ability of any single individual or group to wield excessive influence also fostering a sense of community and responsibility, encouraging citizens to take an active role in shaping their futures in different areas such as private sector, education, healthcare, and public services. This would be a significant step away from the centralized power structures often associated with fascism and socialism and towards a more democratic and participatory model of governance without being coerced by lobbyists and other corporations within government so people can make their decisions on their own instead of relying on politicians with empty promises.


- New Way Libertarians would also emphasize the importance of personal responsibility and self-reliance as core values, promoting individual initiative and entrepreneurship while recognizing the role of government in providing a level playing field and basic safety nets for those in need. This would create a society where people are empowered to pursue their dreams and aspirations without fear of government interference or excessive regulation.


- The movement would focus on creating a culture of mutual respect and understanding, promoting dialogue and cooperation between different groups and individuals with different backgrounds and beliefs. The community and ordinary citizens are actively working to combat prejudice and discrimination in all its forms, whether based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or other factors that were the causes of division and conflict in the past.


- This movement would primarily focus on the divide between the individual and the state, aiming to reduce the power and influence of governments in people's lives while promoting freedom, liberty, and personal responsibility and by doing so, they hope to create a society where individuals can live according to their values and beliefs. Also, they will be able to break free from the coercive forces of government intervention and the oppressive tendencies of authoritarian regimes by challenging the status quo and holding those accountable for their actions and have peaceful resolutions with civil dialogue instead of rhetoric or other divisiveness.

- This movement will address the historical and ongoing injustices committed against marginalized communities, including indigenous peoples, people of color, women, and LGBTQ+ individuals, by working towards reparations and actively promoting social justice and equality by acknowledging and rectifying these wrongs, New Way Libertarians aim to create a more equitable and just society for all its citizens, regardless of their background. In terms of seeking justice instead of mere revenge, this movement would focus on promoting restorative justice practices, such as community service, restitution, and dialogue, as a means of healing the wounds of the past and promoting reconciliation bringing a peaceful resolution instead of a vicious cycle of violence and retribution.

- The equal opportunity and other economic and social policies envisioned by the New Way Libertarians would aim to dismantle the systemic barriers that perpetuate inequality and promote social mobility and would involve investing in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, ensuring that all citizens have access to the resources they need to thrive, rather than relying on the whims of the market or the benevolence of those in power. This movement would also advocate for policies that promote sustainable development and environmental stewardship, recognizing the interdependence of human well-being and the health of the planet and the importance of leaving a livable world for future generations.


- In terms of foreign policy, New Way Libertarians would use war as a last resort and would prioritize diplomacy, peaceful conflict resolution, and international cooperation working towards dismantling the military-industrial complex and redirecting resources towards addressing global challenges such as climate change, poverty, and disease. The movement would also advocate for a more equitable international economic system, promoting fair trade practices and opposing exploitative globalization models that disproportionately benefit wealthy nations and corporations at the expense of developing countries and their citizens.

- The questioning of government officials who were accused and caught lying to the public would be encouraged and protected, as it is a vital part of holding those in power accountable for their actions and ensuring transparency and trust in the political system and would be achieved through the establishment of independent investigative bodies and the protection of whistleblowers, who would be granted immunity from prosecution for revealing information in the public interest. Also, the citizens would be obligated to speak up against corruption and wrongdoing, as it is part of their civic duty and responsibility to maintain a just and honest society without fear of retaliation from those officials because the people need to be the fourth estate of democracy.

- The limiting of qualified immunity for certain government officials and increasing accountability for law enforcement agencies would also be addressed by the movement and would help to prevent police brutality and excessive force, as well as ensure that individuals are not subjected to unlawful searches and seizure or other constitutional violations. The New Way Libertarians would advocate for the adoption of policies such as body cameras, increased training, and community oversight mechanisms to improve police conduct and build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.

- The practice of fiscal conservatism which is a key tenet of New Way Libertarians, would involve balancing the budget, reducing government spending, and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in government programs this would be achieved through a combination of spending cuts, tax reform, and increased transparency and accountability in government financial management. At the end of the day, this movement would advocate for the reduction of unnecessary subsidies and bailouts for corporations, as well as for the elimination of harmful tax loopholes and other forms of corporate welfare, promoting a level playing field where all citizens and businesses contribute fairly to the common good.

- The focus on classical liberalism which is characterized by individualism, limited government, and economic freedom would be further explored by New Way Libertarians in their efforts to create a free and prosperous society. This would involve advocating for free market policies, deregulation, and reducing the size and scope of government intervention in the economy. The movement would also champion individual liberty and personal responsibility, recognizing the importance of allowing citizens to make their own choices and live their lives as they see fit, as long as they do not infringe upon the rights of others.

- The New Way Libertarians would place a strong emphasis on education, recognizing that an informed citizenry is essential to maintaining a free and democratic society and would involve advocating for school choice, voucher programs, and charter schools, as well as working to improve the quality of public education by promoting innovation, competition, and accountability while seeking to empower parents and communities in the education process, ensuring that children are given the tools they need to succeed and reach their full potential."

1,2024-03-17,CMV: Blackface isn't racist.,u/PM-Me-Kiriko-R34,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bh3wg3/cmv_blackface_isnt_racist/,changemyview,"This is something I've wondered since 2014 when I learned it exists.

Blackface is makeup that is, well black. Makes your skin look darker.

A politician here was criticized for cosplaying as Malala Yousafzai. She used blackface/brownface to look like the Pakistani Nobel price winner. 

I've not for the life of me been able to figure out the reasoning behind this criticism. She cosplayed as Malala to honor the woman for her bravery. She didn't slander or discredit her.

I HATE the minstrel show argument. If you watch minstrel shows and think Blackface is the problem, you are mentally ill. That is racism beyond saving. 

If you don't know, minstrel shows are racist shows from mid 20th century. White people used Blackface to look like black people and acted like African stereotypes. A common argument is that Blackface is therefore associated with these racist shows and somehow become racist by association. 

Everything has racist associations with this logic. Trees are racist because of lynchings of African Americans. Boats are racist because they carried slaves. Pesticide is racist because of Zyklon B. Hell, all kinds of makeup are associated with Blackface and are therefore racist."
2,2024-03-17,CMV: The way we view and react to racial slurs is really inconsistent,u/anfal857,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bh45k8/cmv_the_way_we_view_and_react_to_racial_slurs_is/,changemyview,"I think the way we view and react to racial slurs is really inconsistent. I think the context in which they are used should definitely matter, but others completely disagree with me. A lot of times, the outrage in response to slurs feels very, I dunno, artificial, I guess. Almost like people get mad ""on cue"" whenever a slur is detected, regardless of context. Don't get me wrong, there are many instances where it is reasonable to get angry in response to a slur being used. But those who disagree with me that context matters have given the following points: 

1) it is inherently racist for white people to use slurs, namely the n-word, because they just so happen to share the same skin color as those who have oppressed black people both currently and in the past. Therefore, there is no context in which a white person can say the n-word that is not racist.

2) forbidding white people from using slurs but allowing non-white people to use them is justified because they are reclaiming a term that was once used against them. By forbidding white people from saying them and getting angry, sometimes resorting to violence, when they use them, they get a taste of their own medicine for discriminating against minorities in the past.

While I kind of understand this reasoning, I think it is flawed. For the first point, does anyone actually truly believe that a white person saying the n-word in ANY context must be racist? I mean, I know you can advocate that we should automatically react to white people saying slurs as if they are racist even if we consciously know they aren’t (sort of like how we treat a gun at the firing range as if it’s loaded even when we know it isn’t actually), but does anyone seriously think that, for example, a white person reading an excerpt from *To Kill a Mockingbird*, singing along to the lyrics of a rap song, or playing a racist character in a film or movie is actually genuinely racist? To introduce some nuance, one could make the argument that all those things are ""racist"" for white people to do even though they are inconsequential (similar to how a person may only be physically attracted to people of their own race. It’s technically racist, but not in any consequential way), and I could definitely settle for that argument. However, people seem to argue that all these things should be treated just as seriously as someone supporting police brutality, redlining, segregation, disenfranchising minorities, etc. I do not see the utility or benefit of this. Why would we deliberately interpret a white person using a slur in the context of, say, a joke, as being equally malicious as a genuine racist using the same slur when we know they do not mean it the same way at all?  

Regarding the second point, I find even more flaws. Why is forbidding white people from using a slur in any context, or any word at all for that matter, necessary to allow minorities to reclaim them? Surely the use of a given word by a white person wouldn’t prevent, say, a black person from using the same word? Gay people have reclaimed the word ”queer” for instance, and there doesn’t seem to be a problem with allowing non-gay people to also use the word (provided that they don’t mean it as an insult). There are also plenty of words used to refer to oppressed groups that we do not condemn non-oppressed people from using provided they are not using them against someone. For instance, many mentally ill people are treated just as poorly as they were in the 1800s, but we don’t try to get people fired from their jobs for using the word “lunatic.” 

Also, before people ask in the comments “why do you wanna use slurs so bad?” I am going to clarify that I do not personally want to use them, nor would I recommend that other people use them. However, I think the responses we give to their usage should reflect the context in which they were said. I don’t think having someone’s reputation ruined or resorting to physical violence are acceptable responses. To use an analogy, I don’t think people should be shot for shoplifting. I do not personally want to shoplift, nor am I recommending other people to shoplift, but I think shooting shoplifters is an overreaction. Hopefully that makes my position clear. "
1,2024-03-17,CMV: Corporate greed is partially the fault of consumers and overconsumption,u/Ambitious_Yam1677,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bh46hh/cmv_corporate_greed_is_partially_the_fault_of/,changemyview,"Before I get into my argument, I’d like to note that I said PARTIALLY, not fully. This applies to non-essential goods. Not items such as groceries. 

When looking at rising up prices for nonessential goods, one could argue that it is also on the consumer. An example? Netflix password sharing restrictions. When this policy was implemented, people wouldn’t boycott it and hold Netflix accountable. Instead, they couldn’t live without the service, so they bought their own subscription. This resulted in the new policy and other streaming services following suit. This also applies to other items like clothing and other nonessentials. Just look at how people reacted to a new Stanley cup. People put a demand and value on regular products because they’re “trendy”. So of course when demand is higher and people put this value on items, companies are going to take advantage of it. 

If consumers did what they did with Wendy’s proposing dynamic pricing during rush hours, I don’t believe we would be having this issue. 

It’s not fair or ethical when it’s essential items like food our housing, but when it comes to everyday items that we don’t need, people still want them. They won’t put them off completely as a society. If someone has proof that consumers aren’t to blame, I’m open to it. "

So first off, no I’m not a climate change denier or anything like that.
Climate change is real and the environment is important and somethings should definitely change in order to prevent climate change-related disasters and everything.

These initiatives that individuals are supposed to take can only ever amount to drops in a bucket.

Something really exemplary of this was the push for people to stop using plastic straws.
Like, it’s futile and unreasonable to suddenly expect everyone to just swear off of plastic straws.

You’re never going to convince a significant portion of people to do that, and even if you did, that’s just one plastic product eliminated.

Instead of campaigning to lower consumption of plastic stuff, how about we just stop making stuff out of plastic that doesn’t degrade? No straws in the first place, no reason to ask people to lay off the straws.

Though I recognize the argument isn’t as strong on this level, I’d make a similar argument about recycling in general.
A huuuge amount of things that are recyclable are only partially recyclable, and we’re *still* adding mass to the trash continent at a huge rate.

Let’s just stop manufacturing things out of materials that don’t degrade and that harm the environment.

I am aware that BIG PLASTIC isn’t a fan of the idea, but even if it is analogous to a guy fighting a colossal monster, it’s still a more worthwhile pursuit than convincing billions of individuals to change their consumption habits.

I still *do recycle,* btw, but I’ve never bothered to become the best recycling individual I can be because, as I’ve said here in this post, I think it’s futile.

If I drink something out of a can or a paper container or whatever and there’s a recycling bin next to the trash can, yeah, I’m gonna put it in the recycling. I’ll do that, but I’m not about to have a study session about all the various types of recyclables in order to optimize my recycling. I just don’t see a worthwhile point in the pursuit.

the snowboard only exists because the ski resort and chair lifts exist.  without those very modern, very indulgent things a snowboard in the mountains would be like a scuba suit in the desert. skiing is a far superior activity and a far superior mountain tool.  snowboarding is for edgy teenagers in 1998.

Also look at the world record for speeds:
Ski record: 255 kph 
Snowboard record: 211 kph

skiers can get into speed riding which is much cooler than snowboarding. how is cross country snowboarding working out btw? most of the snowboarders you see are just sitting on their asses anyway, while skiers are always standing and going down the mountain.

Watching every game score between 70-100 points is not interesting. If you're scoring that much, it doesn't matter how good you are, its too easy. I would suggest a smaller rim at the minimum. Other possible changes could be to set a minimum shooting distance. I know a lot of people like dunking but I think it's kind of overdone at this point. Scout just look for the tallest people who can reach the rim no problem. You'd see more impressive shots if everyone isn't just running the ball to the rim and scoring back and forth.

This puts Biden in a position where he can essentially do anything, because the people who matter to him (democrat voters) are too scared to call him out. So we have a choice here, vote Biden and be complicit in genocide, or vote third party knowing that Trump may win and will likely spark a revolution (or he'll just lose support all around and it'll be a nothing burger but that's wishful thinking.) By continuing to elect ""the lesser of two evils"" you're falling into their trap. Two wings of the same shithawk, as they say. The right wing will always be able to create something worse to make the left seem better, no matter how far right the ""left"" moves. By continuing to elect Democrats that fall further to the right, the entire party is shifting that direction. This isn't going to stop, democrat/leftist voters will continue be guilted into voting for the lesser evil and allowing this slip to the right to continue. So really, our choices are allow this slip to continue to maintain our quality of life, pushing the issue onto future generations, or to take a stand and not vote for evil at all.

As an asexual, i think it is so cringe. That they seem to be having a hard time accepting the fact (or probably in denial) that being bi is being attracted to men & women alone. It's literally ""bi'. Meaning two. When you can speak three languages, you're not a bilingual. You're multilingual. So if you used to be bi and then you get attracted to other sexualities, that makes you pansexual. You can't say ""I'm bisexual. I'm attracted to all genders and identities"". That makes you a hypocrite and it makes you look like you're having trouble accepting who you really are"". Just say that you are bi, i like men & women, period.

I would best describe my beliefs as Christopagan. I was raised in a conservative Quaker church. In my late teens, I was introduced to Unitarian Universalism, Buddhism and Reiki. I chose to be an atheist for close to ten years.

Due to fear instilled in me from my upbringing, when I first became a Norse pagan, I feared retribution from God, and tried to return to a Christian faith. Over the past four years, in an effort to stave off cognitive dissonance, and develop some actual faith, I have began fervently translating the Bible, from various sources.

Here are some examples of things I’ve learned:

- “Hell” is ambiguous at best, as a literal place, as the words it was translated from for the King James Version are inconsistent. Some of these words include: Sheol, Gehenna, Hades, Tartarus

- Other gods are acknowledged as having dominion in the realm of mortals, in the Bible. “Elohim” is a plural meaning “gods”. It does not mean a singular “God.” “Demon,” translated, means a being that is greater in power than humans, but less powerful the Lord. At least twice in the Bible, the “sons of God,” are mentioned, implying godhood of other beings. In one instance, God divides the world into 70 nations, only taking ownership of Israel for himself.

-Contextual evidence of “the satan” being a literal cosmic entity is highly doubtful. Most instances can be explained away with context and the meaning of the word satan, “adversary.”

These are only a few instances of things I have learned. My enemy is cognitive dissonance. I want to be a Heathen, without doubt, but I worry if I go down the same path as I have with Christian teaching, I’ll just explain away the basis for my faith. I’m not trying to convert anybody to anything. Faith is a difficult thing to learn. “You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink.”"

Just this unreasonable disdain for what are genuinely trivial differences in dialect, as though the billion people using this social media platform can't have this degree of difference.

My question to those who feel female is somehow not kosher, why do you feel that your culture's dialect choice is superior to my culture's dialect choice?

I've had various foreign friends who spoke various English dialects stemming from their backgrounds with various word choices that would be considered jarring, it never once occurred to me that I shouldn't accept their ways of talking or that I should scold them as I see people do daily on reddit to the tune of tons of support."

PLEASE DON'T CHANGE WHAT I'M SAYING TO BE A TAKE I DON'T HAVE. Please try to approach what I'm saying with a nuanced perspective.

I see this as a take very frequently and there's often lots of pushback against it, but I don't think it's entirely inaccurate to say that the #MeToo movement changed dating, especially for Zoomers. Of course, the target wasn't Zoomers, the target was the older generation of ""Hollywood"" that felt that perpetuated horrific things on the women. 

However it was a huge cultural movement that affected social dynamics and discourse on dating, especially for young people. The height of the MeToo movement was in 2015, at the time I was 13 turning 14. I hadn't developed socially when it comes to dating, and I would argue that for my age group, seeing media about this shaped how we date in the way that it did inspire fear. The women that were assaulted and harassed deserved justice, but like when literally anything spreads on social media the message changes and gets diluted. The fear that came was the amount of claims of harassment and accusations of predatory behavior that came from what everyone else would consider normal dating practices. 

I don't think it's unreasonable to say that there were cases that didn't need to be escalated to the point of calling it harassment or predatory behavior. Just incidents where a guy tried to shoot his shot and failed and an awkward situation led to a woman being creeped out. I'm not blaming women for feeling creeped out as feelings are valid, but there's a big difference between being creeped out and harassed or predated on. In general I think this in general is pretty common, especially when growing up, and when you see these stories of some random woman on twitter saying she felt harassed after a guy kept talking to her after she soft rejected him at a bar, or how it felt predatory when random men would speak to her, or if a man stands too close to her it feels threatening, the lesson you learn is that woman can interpret the most banal actions as threats or predatory. 

So Zoomers are already fucked up, I don't think this is the main reason behind the failure of Gen Z men to date but it compounds. I mean, we as a society are less social in general, people are afraid to talk to each other. Many gen z women are poisoned by the internet to believe all men are inherently dangerous. Men are poisoned by media telling them that women are just waiting for any opportunity to falsely accuse them and random socially malformed weirdos on twitter and tiktok perpetuate these ideas. We're medicated to hell. Some people say porn addiction (something I think is greatly overblown but not non-existent and is more of an effect of the aforementioned). Now add in the fact that growing up we were made to feel that pursuing a woman we found was attractive is predatory, of course issues dating are going to show up, and statistically they have.

Now men are afraid to approach in a society where women do not typically approach. There is an added fear that comes with rejection that now, aside from the awkwardness and the self esteem drop already present, you now believe you have to fear a girl feeling in danger by you expressing interest in her and labeling you a creep or predator and destroying you socially. 

When you're a guy that isn't traditionally attractive, you will be rejected a more than not. So now every possible rejection feels like a minefield. This is where I personally think increased porn usage comes from. Men aren't having sex nearly as much as they desire, the sexual desire still exists and they find some way to fulfill it, yet that's not enough physically or emotionally so you deprive yourself of something most people are programmed to want, sex and romantic companionship. 

For women, the men are now pussified and too scared to approach you and every aspect of society tells you approaching isn't feminine or what desirable women do, and plus, why would you go after a man that's too chicken shit to ask you out. So the only men women date are men who are incredibly attractive to the point where they're not as concerned about possible rejection or men so attractive women show interest first.

Artificial wombs: Sperm can be created in labs. Once we can make artificial wombs, we will be able to automate human production. Humans could be mass produced in factories. This will solve the growing problem of underpopulation in many countries.  
  
Artificial Intelligence: Artificial intelligence will have advanced to the point where it can do all human labor. This will be a huge benefit from society because it will destroy the need for money. If nothing requires any work there is no need for money. People will also have their entire life free of responsibilities.  
  
Virtual reality: Virtual reality will be extremely immersive. Humans will spend the vast majority of their life immersed in a perfect simulation. The simulation will allow them to live however they want and everyone would be happy. AI could study everyone and build a perfect virtual world just for them.  
  
Environment: With everyone living in a simulation, there will be very little waste in real life. Everyone will live in a tiny room a few meters wide. There is no need for real world positions when everyone is living in a simulation.

1,2024-03-18,CMV: Anti-contact paraphiles should be publicized,u/anti-c_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bhht2q/cmv_anticontact_paraphiles_should_be_publicized/,changemyview,"
Hello Reddit. I recently got suspended on twitter for having this opinion, so I thought I would bring it here where some of the most open minded people lie around. 

So just to clarify, I am an anti-contact zoophile, the definition of anti-contact is rejecting the attraction of a given paraphilia due to a moral stance of consent. For example, i do not actively engage with dogs becuase i do not think they consent, but i do still have a sexual attraction to dogs. A pro-contact is a regular offender. 

The reason why anti-contact paraphiles should be publicized can be put into 3 main categories:

1: Normalizing anti-contact paraphilias will allow more discovering paraphiles to come out without fear/guilt, also support mental health advocation.

So in our current day and age, the view of any paraphilia is negative, due to religious history, media glorification, and bigotry. I’ve experienced it first hand on twitter when I say “I’m an anti-contact” and regardless, they call me a dog fucker, and I’ll get a few death threats every now and then. A lot of people don’t see the difference, and the negativity of all of this is bad for paraphiles.

My tweet got 1.7 million views, I had ~200 likes only and so so many more QRTS and comments. These numbers say a lot! Imagine the hate that somebody might go through in real life if they try to explain they are an anti-contact. 

Due to this lack of separation of terms, it makes people uneducated, and this lack of understanding starts to really become a problem when you have somebody who is discovering themselves at a paraphile.

3 months ago I was in that exact position. I kept a journal of my thoughts at the time, and id like to share with you some of the things that I was going through. These are genuine quotes, that I wrote using the drafts feature of Reddit 3 months ago, if you all don’t believe me I can SS it and send it in the replies.

“I just don’t know man I really don’t know. HOW do you sanely tell people around you that you are a zoophile. I don’t know I just don’t know. I’m so lost I just want answers I can’t share this without it being anonymous and I’m so lost. I don’t want to be this way I don’t ugh man I could repeat I don’t want it so many times and it just doesn’t seem to make the situation any fucking better and honestly I might end up ki… but I probably won’t but it’s been on the back of my mind and I’m really just done”

This isn’t uncommon either. I couldn’t get the proper help I needed either because of the stigmatization, I was too afraid to tell my parents and ask for therapy. In a world that anti-contacts are publicized, we will have more resources to help discovering paraphiles, and in return of it being publicized, it will get rid of the fear/guilt ego dystonic paraphiles have and they will be open to sharing instead of feeling like their life would get canceled. (And of course, this is apart of mental health advocation!)

My second reason for anti-contacts being publicized is

2: finally be in talks to settle the “consent” argument, as well as deal with pro-contacts objectively.

If you aren’t familiar with the vast zoo community on twitter, we have a giant zoophilia ‘umbrella’ which has different symbol identifiers to pinpoint a zoophile accordingly. It’s extremely divided specifically in the zoophile community, because there are only open pro-contact advocates prevalent in the zoophile community.

If we publicize anti-contacts, it will open more talks to get the “proper” documentation on animals ability to consent. Because pro-contacts advocate soo heavily that they can’t consent, we can officially settle the ficticious debate using a lot more scientist, because at the moment, zoophilic research is highly stigmatized, and is not preformed due to the fear of losing your validity as a researcher. There is a survey floating around of twitter recently that is geared specifically towards zoophiles and they mention that researchers don’t even want to touch on the subject at all. 

it will also allow debates on the age of consent (while this is not necessarily a great thing, it is interesting how accumulative age of consent in the USA is 18, while the states differ) but that’s a whole different CMV. Point being, when we debate these things, we can deal with pro-contacts accordingly based off of our scientific findings using a large credible study. Aka, objectively. For clarification, pro-contact zoos do not believe in any of the current research and demand a serious study. 

My final point(s)

3: Publicizing anti-contacts will deface the negative pro-contact community as the mainstream “paraphiles” and prevent discovering paraphiles from making mistakes they would regret. 

As I was going through my discovering zoo phase, I used mainly Reddit and twitter to find answers at first, and the only thing I could find on X were open zoophiles who actively promoted bestiality on their page, there was no anti-contact community available like the pro-contact community I had to DIG through the zoophile community to find anti-contacts because they don’t generally associate with pro-contacts.

Reddit is a lot better in that regard, but there is no community available for paraphiles here because I guess it goes against Reddit TOS or something, it’s more just informative posts about zoophilia, I needed people I could actually talk to and get specific help and ask questions, which is something you really only could get on X.

If I was a more impressionable zoophile, I could have easily been influenced negatively by their “openness” not to mention X harbors a lot of beastial videos… if anti-contacts were publicized, we would not have to filter out the zoophile community so hard. There would be a fine line that could allow people to discover themselves without the consistent toxicity that is pro-contact activism. 

Also, it will prevent the spreading of misinformation, and will prevent ASA. It took me until the start of 17 to figure out i was a zoophile, becuase i was told for so long by other communities like nofap that “porn gave me an induced escalated fetish” and that “nobody is born as a zoophile” and you can be cured of your attraction. If there was a more active community I could’ve talked to I could have easily figured out that wasn’t true AT ALL.

And I highly believe if I could have figured out about zoophilia sooner, I could have taken a moral stance sooner than I did, I unfortunately was not anti-contact my whole life because I was an idiot teenager, but I also was a misinformed teenager, if I had that anti-contact community, I could have done all those things I mentioned before, finding out k was a zoophile, not being scared of asking for therapy for zoophilia, and getting help and guidance instead of walking around as an uninformed idiot 14 year old. It will lower the rate of ASA for sure, i cant speak on CSA, but potentially it could lower it aswell.

Please, do change my mind. I’m ready for anything you throw at me, ive been dealing with my paraphilia for a few months, and if you have any general questions about that you can pm about that becuase im always extremly open about helping other discovering paraphiles

I’ve seen priests get let off easy or have their sentences shortened because they’re “a man of God” but clearly they’re not if they commit heinous crimes like touching kids. If a priest or any other high level religious figure for that matter commits a crime then wouldn’t it make sense to punish them more harshly as they have a higher moral obligation given their position in society? It would also deter other religious figures from doing the same. I hear the argument that harsher punishments for crimes like these will just make the perpetrator try to kill their victims to get rid of the evidence of assault altogether, but priests and other religious figures won’t be able to do that as easily since most of their victims are in churches or other likewise religious structures meaning that they can’t just kill them."

You provide services (akin to monetary value, hence getting paid for it) with the expectation that you get paid for it two weeks later.  However, if this was just a cash transfer, there would be an expectation that you pay back the loan with interest to compensate for the delay.

2 weeks is an eternity for those that are living paycheck to paycheck or for those who are just entering the workforce - or those that ran into an emergency situation.  And I get that it might ""force people to make wiser monetary decisions"", but shit happens, especially if you're just entering the workforce.  If an emergency occurs and you have to wait 2 weeks to get your paycheck, you're completely fucked.

Employers should either pay employees weekly, or be required to pay interest on biweekly pay to compensate for the 2 week delay.

For reference, I live in the United States, a country with essentially a non-existent social safety net system.  I'm currently dealing with an example of said emergency situation right now where I'm just entering the workforce and am living paycheck to paycheck, and my car broke down.  Since the US has horrendous public transit compared to the rest of the developed world, I'm up a shit creek without a paddle partially because the idiotic voters here brainwashed by years of propaganda by the big car and oil companies refuse to build or fund good public transit, and partially because I have to wait a week and a half for emergency money for car repairs I need *now*."

I can say I’ve participated in all 3 and I wouldn’t say that I’m a “victim” I understand I have personal responsibility but yes I’d say all 3 industries are predatory in similar ways. I will say one thing, it’s much easier to get into porn from a young age and I think that makes it even worse in some aspects. The other thing is that out of the 3 sex is the only one that people will naturally gravitate towards and for certain people the something like only fans is extremely predatory because you’re selling them a dream of a girl actually giving them the time of day (which will never happen for them in real life).

Take your typical customer service job for instance. You have to play fake nice to people who you absolutely despise, people who you can't set boundaries with, people who don't take ""no"" for an answer, and people who will try to harass, degrade, and ire you at seemingly every opportunity. All for a measly wage that might pay for a studio apartment, car, electricity, and a week's worth of Maruchan noodles and Chef Boyardee.

Now take life as a dependent (housewife, child) in a family. You have to play fake nice to people you hate and do everything they say or you are out on the streets begging for a Happy Meal and some bottled water. You will be screamed at, insulted, and hopefully not assaulted, and you just have to take it-that is your place. You are dependent on them. It's the same thing as any dead-end retail job.

A housewife is expected to be basically a sex object for security, and that is all she is. It's ""suck my dick or get out"" and has been for ages. As a ""trad"", you have to pretend to be sexually attracted to and fond of someone who berates and belittles you for a small allowance and a roof over your head.

And OF is the exact same thing, but even better. The reason behind so many young women flocking to it is the reason why so many companies have fallen to their competitors: their competitors offered less work for more pay. OF is accessible for really any woman. The desperate guys who use it are touch-starved enough to not really care what the girl looks like, as long as she puts up the same facade that a significant other does. OF models do the same thing female romantic partners do: act like a sex object for money. They pretend to like and be sexually attracted to legions of lonely men who they truly perceive as fat, ugly creeps instead of only one ""fat, ugly creep"". They don't have to actually have sex with these people (less work) and get more money from their viewers than they would a male romantic partner (more pay).

This is one of the many reasons why more men are single. It turns out, women always hated most men. Now even women who don't have a degree don't have to settle for or have sex with the bottom 70% (hideous freaks in their eyes) for stability. And personally, I don't really have a problem with it. As a man, it deeply hurts me, considering I'm not anything special in women's eyes, but logically, there's nothing wrong with it. Women just got better jobs. They still have to be harassed by the bottom 70%, but internet comments hurt way, way less than people screaming in your face and they don't have to fuck someone they find utterly grotesque."

I know I’m stepping on thin ice when I say this and a lot of people will bash me for saying this I find utterly when people say Homelander had a choice. Before I go any further I want to say I don’t condone his actions and his actions are awful now let’s begin. 

It appears people have forgotten that Homelander that like his victims, along with the Boys and The Seven are victims of Vought. Homelander was created by Vought to be the premier superhero for the cruel corporations profit and gain. During his youth he was never shown any love or affection. He was constantly tourted and experimented by the likes of Dr Jonah Vogelbaum or maybe even Stan Edgar simply because they wanted to make sure he was the perfect specimen. He’s never had anyone to teach him right from wrong, installing morals and values at him. 

Dr Vogelbaum even said Homelander was a good kid even when he suffered under Vought. None has suffered like Homelander and in his situation 9/10 the individual will never emerge ok and to say Homelander has the chance to be a better man is just ignorant. Furthermore when Homelander grew up and started his superhero career he genuinely tried to be good but he fucked on times. Do you know what Vought does they tend cover up his shit and this is another reason why he’s so fucked up. Because his shit has been covered from the beginning he has never learn accountability and responsibility further feeding his ego he can do what he wants which ruins him.

Ultimately despite of everything he has done I feel a great swell of pity for Homelander because he is a product of his environment. The man was cursed with bad karma and generally throughout his hard existence has anyone cared about him. Also I want him to win at the end of the series even tho I know it’s not going to end well for him."

My father for example, who is in his late 50s has received a draft notice, which shows the current state of things. I believe Ukraine should switch to contract army. My reasons:  
1. Forceful and violent draft does not bring motivated soldiers. It's true, it's not the first time that and it's a usual thing to recruit people forcefully. However in my opinion a person who does not want to fight will not be an efficient soldier and will likely let down his comrades.   
2. Motivation. If the pay is good, then the soldier is more motivated to fight and there will actually be volunteers.   
3. Continuing forceful draft will not gain the desired recruitment results. I know people will say ""it's a war for existence"", but the time where people were motivated is past. And those ones that do not want to fight will not fight, they will find ways to draft dodge successfully.  
4. Violent draft is not the solution here. Numerous actions by the draft officers which are clearly illegal have sparked anger in the Ukrainian male population. Such actions by some of the draft centers further demotivate men to fight. Violation of human rights will not lead to anything good, certainly not  Ukrainian victory."

We knew Russia was deathly afraid of having Ukraine join NATO yet went on and made explicit overtures to them that we would let them join. We scared Russia so bad they thought this was a real possibility but had absolutely 0 intention of ever actually letting them in. 

Now the Ukrainians are fighting a Russia the West had a hand in pissing off with the most were willing to do is send them weapons...

Like everything, you're not entitled to love or hapinness in life. Someone might argue that statistically it is virtually impossible to never find someone who loves you in your life. I'd argue that there's no impossibility in statistics even if it's below one percent, there's still a possibility that it occurs. I'd even argue that it already happened before and multiples times especially when you look at the life of some philosophers. They were not especially bad people, they were trying to fond love yet they failed. Love is like wealth, there's a bit of talent to acquire/keep it but it's mostly luck. You can be the best version of yourself, socialise and do everything correctly and yet still die alone and depressed while someone who doesn't even try might be happy for the rest of its life. And if we're talking about true love, i'd even argue the odds are against us. You might have a lot of different of relationships without finding the one or spending most of your life with the wrong person and end up alone. It might be sad, but I think I'm stating a truth here. Most of us fail at life and live unhappy lives because most of the good things are unlikely to happened to us. It is not an invitation to give up, it is not because the odds of good things happening to us are less likely that you shouldn't try to increase those odds by trying. I made this post because I see a lot of people who says things like ""you're entitled to love"" ""you just need to work on yourself"". It's not how life works. Life is like a casino, and like a casino, the odds are against you and the house always takes everything in the end.

Let's take abortion out of the debate, because this isn't about pro-life or pro-choice. 

A woman gets pregnant and decides she is not ready to have a family. So she has the baby and immediately gives it up for adoption. Mom severs parental rights, and will never see the baby again, and will never pay a dime in child support. 

Why don't men get this option? Why can't they say ""I am not ready for a child, I sever all parental rights"" and walk away like a woman is allowed to do? 

Adding to the unfairness of this situation is that there are minimal birth control options that men are in charge of. Condoms are only about 80% effective against preventing pregnancy on an annual basis, and the pullout method is about the same. These are men's only options other than having a vasectomy, which is not always reversible, so that's a pretty big commitment for a man to make. 

Women can be on the pill, have an IUD, use a novaring, have their tubes tied, get an ablation, ect... 

Why are men the only ones having no choice to walk away from an accidental pregnancy? "

\-In the opening weeks of the invasion in 2022 (especially in the north) Russia had largely not cared for Ukraine's current MLRS and long-range artillery when structuring their logistics,   
resulting in huge convoys, huge logistical nodes, and vulnerable targets which Ukraine could really only destroy with TB-2 drones as their strategic artillery and long-range assets at this time were occupied or being redeployed.   
HIMARS had been on the table for a while, but due to Russian diplomatic threats it took longer to have them sent, and by the time Ukraine had received a sizeable amount of HIMARS and their accompanying ammunition, Russia had largely adapted, ie no juicy 40km convoys and significantly less huge frontline supply hubs.

\-By September 2022 Ukraine had executed a major offensive action in Kharkiv Oblast, essentially routing a lot of the Russian units stationed there, and for a period of time the front had returned back to the war of maneuver that most people envision when talking about modern warfare.  
This offensive took place during Ukraine's plea for NATO standard tanks and IFVs, which would have performed well in their intended roles during a non-attritional advance in Kharkiv. The tank gifting nations took a while to dedicate tanks, collect them and set up training programs.  
But by the time Ukraine had received a sizeable amount of Western tanks and IFVs to incorporate into brigades, Russia had largely adapted and had created hyper-dense mine-fields and countermeasures to prevent maneuver warfare. Where the 47th brigade may have seen great success in the Kharkiv offensive, they had a rough time just getting to Robotyne.

\-During mid-2023, Ukraine had identified that Russia had made it impossible to break through the Surovokin line without a long-length attritional battle where individual hard points had to be dealt with 1 by 1. The 2 main things they had identified to need was air support and cluster munitions.  
For Europe both giving Ukraine modern jet aviation and providing them cluster munitions was an incredibly long and drawn-out political process that had to be done in response to extreme Russian objections. But Ukraine never received planes in time for their offensive (having to use old SU-24s for a limited close air support role), and they only received cluster munitions later on which were used to great effect and certainly helped, but were definitely needed at the start of the offensive and not towards the end when it had obviously failed to meet its objectives.  


It seems that the West keeps on being held up by Russia's arbitrary red tape about aid to Ukraine and has been kept a peg behind, where by the time the weapons systems that are needed finally get into theatre, the perfect scenarios for them to be used have largely been adapted to which has decreased their potential effectiveness greatly.  
I do hold this view and believe it's a solid basis to criticize the often indecisiveness of Western aid and how it can have very real and precarious results for Ukraine, I would love to hear criticisms of it/defend the point in the comments."

Someone commented, ""This is most likely the pilot's mentally-challenged son/daughter.""

Someone replied to that, ""Or just some dumbass"". 

And I'm not trying to blow out some Redditor's comment into a big thing, but I see this mentality a lot on Reddit and in real life. 

We tend to lend empathy to people who have verifiable, diagnosed disabilities or handicaps, and we tend to treat those that are just ""dumb"" as though they are self-made idiots, and authored their own intelligence. And we assign further culpability and ownership of their actions. The flipside of that is we absolve the actions of people with disabilities like Down Syndrome as though they lacked any input in the process.

There are tons of people with a far lower IQ than the average person with Downs Syndrome, and yet we seem to treat them with a level of disdain when they screw up, and we hoard our sympathy for those that we can ""see"" have a disability that has been studied, and can be named and pathologized. 

I'll admit, you have to buy into some form of determinism or compatibilism here on the free-will question to follow the logic. 

And I'm not saying we have to treat people with disabilities the same way we treat society's ""idiots"", I'm actually saying the opposite. People we're calling idiots should be treating with similar empathy to people with these visible disabilities. They didn't choose their situation any more than any of you, or anyone with a disability.

It’s mental to me, all people do is criticise the other gender, then complain when they don’t comply to their dream world, and something goes even slightly wrong

I fully believe one of the main reason there will never be true social equality between genders due to the fact that we are so critical of each other, but so ignorant to the fact we both need change.

All social media does in relation to gender is cause divisions through the spread of hate to each other. Men are bad. Women are bad. People are bad. Its not specific, so stop acting as if it is."

Take for example the Qing empire. When the Europeans came on their shores in their arrogance they stuck to their ‘traditions’ and what not and failed to adapt. The conservative thought within the empire to violently uphold the status quo eventually allowed the Europeans to use new tactics and technology to vassalise the Qing.

 This in stark contrast to the Japanese who understanding threat of the west decided to upheave and change their society to better defend and eventually even challenge western might in Asia. 

Time and time again it is shown that it is the societies that stick to their systems rigidly without adapting are the ones that get conquered. Tradition is insignificant to a foe that can counter it and if you can’t adapt and counter back you are doomed.

Conservative brainrot will be the downfall of mankind. As smart,  sophisticated people invent and discover new technologies these cavemen sticking to their useless outdated concepts will drag everyone down with them. 

Conservatism to me is the mindset of a child. The reaction to anything new or unknown is to stick one’s head in sand and pretend that what one already knows is both absolutely right and all one will ever need to know in this world. I can imagine these folks in the Stone Age whining that farming is a ‘liberal disease’ and real men hunt and live in caves. And then as the farming community survives they die as each one is either eaten by wolves or a mammoth hunt goes terribly wrong.

There’s even a video essay and academic subculture that has grown out of Millennial-age academics trying to explain political messages in Marvel movies and Harry Potter; to predict and explain social attitudes, or the rise of certain politicians.  
  
I’m sorry but this is absolute nonsense and a waste of scholarship. People who tell you that superheroes are a fascist genre or that Harry Potter inspires people to become feminist are liars and idiots. Pop culture media has very little effect on wider society and it is time these overeducated English majors admit that they choose a bad degree. These academics who proclaim otherwise are just trying to get attention, sell their latest book, and or have no ideas for a real Phd dissertation.  
  
Birth of a Nation is not responsible for segregation; Star Trek is not responsible for the Civil Rights Act; Iron Man is not the reason people voted for Donald Trump; reading HP Lovecraft does not make you a white supremacist, and Call of Duty does not make you an apologist for sexism.  
  
The truth is that popular culture is SLOWER than mass society; that people in the REAL WORLD have MATERIAL CONCERNS or PHILOSOPHICAL BELIEFS that are not explained by popular media and have nothing to do with popular media. A lot of culturally ingrained beliefs are not placed there by popular media - and therefore it is a fruitless endeavor to engineer popular media to promote your preferred ideology. Focus on Institutions, not movies! (I am a liberal socialist, btw, not an ""anti-woke"")

4. They can often be used as an intimidation tactic. In 2 ways: the first is some people are just scared of dogs in general but especially police dogs. The second is that the dogs have nails and when searching. Are allowed to jump and claw on the car, causing damage that will be on the owner to pay for. Police know this, can and do use it to their advantage.

5. Then there’s the cost of training which would go better into drug preventing than drug arrest

For one, I think it's pretty obvious that any and everybody can be racist to anyone. You'd think this is the general consensus, however, I'm not so sure that it is. There are actually people who either think this is plain wrong or think that there is *context* that matters, when there isn't.

Racial prejudice is racism. If you generalize, stereotype, judge etc. someone because of their race, that is by definition, being racist. Now, someone BEING racist doesn't necessarily make someone a full-fledged racist, as they will sometimes refer to it as a *joke* or say it's human nature to be judgmental towards different cultures. Regardless, this is why I think most people are at least a little bit racist.

To people who think that certain races cannot be racist, (e. g. believing that minority races cannot be racist to majority races because of a power differential) I hope you can expand your knowledge, as I generally feel hopeless for people with that mindset.

Now for people who think there are *levels* to it, I also believe you need to expand your horizons. I understand that context is important when understanding historical periods/events regarding racism, however, this doesn't change the fact that no form of racism is better or worse than another. Context does not matter when one is intentionally being racist. Racism is racism. Being a racist person means you live with that ideology, it's not just something that appears whenever you say something racist, it is always there unless you change it.

At least not to my knowledge. I simply just want to understand the other side of this debate. So I apologise in advance if I come across as ignorant. I promise its entirely out of a lack of experience.

I do not disagree with the point that euthanasia should be legal. I think if someone has a terminal illness and their death is certain, they should be allows to die on their own terms. Or if someone has a severe injury which renders a happy life impossible. Then euthanasia is 100% the moral thing to do.

Where I find myself starting to disagree is on the point that everyone with a chronic illness should be allowed to die. More specifically people with chronic pain. While I did look up some videos on chronic pain to see if that opened my eyes a bit, it did a little. Can't imagine living your life that way. It must be horrible. But many people even with untreatable chronic issues can learn to manage their condition. They can live happy lives. In fact the studies I've read day that in most cases people with chronic pain who are generally happy experience less pain. Well, at least it's less painful. Isn't it not better to care for these people and help them live a happy life? I think the problem is that we don't have enough empathy for these people, not that they need to die.

I apologise if my opinion is ignorant, I do feel I'm missing a key detail here or just the experience to truly understand. But that's why I'm making this post. I want to be open minded and hear a different viewpoint."

Rape is universally understood to be wrong. Rapists generally aren't normal people but have something wrong with them, like psychopathy. This isn't something that can be easily changed.

I would insult and look down on female characters on tv shows and my parents would tell me to stop it. I put on a facade that i was not a sexist, but i was unconciously.

Hence, the Patriot Act was passed which violated people's constitutional rights in the name of data collection and spying, a lot of which was revealed by Edward Snowden in 2013. 

Today, massive amounts of pro-palestinian content is being shared on Tiktok and Jewish people are again feeling threatened by something which probably isn't a big deal in reality. Using a 'china national security' argument (china already buys data from meta & google) they are proposing a Tiktok ban which will unconstitutionally stop companies deemed as 'foreign adversaries' from operating in the US, as well as creating complications for things like the TOR protocol. 

There have been many other unconstitutional laws put in place besides these, such as the blanket ban on businesses boycotting Israel across 37 states.

Jewish people have routinely demonstrated that they will strip away people's rights any time they feel scared or face criticism. I don't see how it's acceptable for them to live in a country with freedom of speech enshrined in its constitution."

!<  
So the Prime minster of israel, and the rest of his extremist cabinet, just want the war to rage on, as long as they get their paychecks, and as long as the people they dislike are dying. Doesn't matter if it's at the cost of kids, elderly, pregnant women, hostages.. They just pretend to have a mission.  
  
So let's talk about the supposed mission of ""Eliminating Hamas""  
  
The israeli gov will claim they are only targeting Hamas..  
  
  
But, for years, Netanyahu was reported to be helping fund Hamas, and in 2019, He himself said and i quote; ""Whoever wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state needs to support the strengthening and financing of Hamas.""  
  
On top of that, The current finance minister of israel, said in 2015 and i quote ""Hamas at this point, in my opinion, is an asset.""   
  
  
So how can you eliminate your asset?  
  
  
Here's this gov strategy; 

  
Keep Hamas in power. Offer anything except a sovereign Palestinian state ""for security reasons"", and disrupt any real effort for Peace. Ignore the illegal settlements (condemned by the UN), and the killing of Palestinians in the israeli controlled West bank. 

Make life unbearable for Palestinians, Facilitate unemployment conditions, cut the water sources (documented), introduce bills to control the courts, destroying the biggest buildings in Gaza to displace civilians, killing and arresting civilians who protest or show any contempt of past actions, Hamas attacks you, literally do whatever you want (Defending yourself). 

&#x200B;

5 months after Oct the 7th, Gaza flattened, at least 30k civilians dead (most are women and children as reported by the pentagon), israel killed more hostages than released, Hamas still around.   
  
  
The goal was clear, even before Oct the 7th, they never wanted Peace, or a Palestinian state.  
  
  
2023 was reported to be the deadliest year in the history of the West bank. It got to the point where Biden himself had put a ban on individuals committing atrocities there, and that's not mentioning the uncontrolled army killings, because they see no consequences, they act as if the Palestinian lives do not matter. 

As cited in South Africa's case, the army led by Netanyahu believe everyone in Gaza is complicit, as Netanyahu cited the biblical term ""Amalek"" at the beginning of the offensive on Gaza, he said ""Remember what the Amalek has done to you.""

The biblical scripture regarding Amalekites reads ""I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel. Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.'

The IDF soldiers later filmed themselves shouting ""There are no innocent civilians"". They also have filmed themselves celebrating destruction, burning aid, looting homes, posing in women's underwear, mocking traumatized people, the list goes on..

&#x200B;

Currently, famine is looming on many in Gaza, as reports confirm israel have been blocking aid to the entire north, for three month, till today when they got pressured into letting 13 trucks in.

  
Earlier this week, The US Senator Chris Van Hollen admits after crafting the national security memorandum, and after the reports, that israel is not in compliance with international law, they are blocking aid such as maternity kits, water purifiers, from entering the Gaza strip, sending back a lot of the of trucks, not to mention letting civilians block entrances of aid..  
  
He also stated that, “There is no doubt that the claims that Netanyahu made that UNRWA is a tool of Hamas are ""flat-out lies,"","" The person who runs operations on the ground in Gaza is a 20 year U.S. Army veteran”, he added. 

  
Earlier, The israeli gov claimed 12 UNRWA (Aid agency) members were affiliated with Hamas, without providing evidence, and the US cut aid to UNRWA, so did the EU, amidst famine. Now amidst investigations, there is no evidence of such affiliation, even UNRWA stated that personal were tortured to admit such links. The EU have restored funding, and the US is still pending..

&#x200B;

It has become evident that the Netanyahu government, and those with extremist ideology (Zionism), never wanted peace in the middle east (as stated in the Likud party charter) they want all the land from Jordan to the sea, and they will abuse the power given to them without oversight

&#x200B;

As history shows, if we really want to achieve peace, we must deliver justice, prosecute criminals, and figure out democratic solutions, without malicious intent from fascist governments."

Only recently have my wife and I made enough income to even consider ourselves middle class. 

My father worked for a significant chunk of his life to escape the poverty that his family grew up with. Her parents have never owned a home. 

My wife and I started significantly earlier and worked just as hard to be far away from that age and far away from that goal.

I’m very liberal minded but not exactly thrilled to regulate everything with federal government measures. One thing I think would be extremely beneficial would be to keep local economies controlled and wealth reinvested locally as much as possible.

So in my mind it would be beneficial if buying land, homes, or commercial buildings was restricted to local ownership. By local I’m not exactly sure what would be best. I’ve considered as small as city but would consider as large as state residents.

I also disagree with majority ownership of any of these assets being held by business entities of any sort. I truly believe at least 51% of any of these should be held by individual owners who are local residents.

I’m sure there’s problems with this. I’m not an economist or financial expert in anyway. I do think that moving from a state or city would require the voiding or financial payout of an asset to be provided at time of moving to the owner and the asset shopped on a market.

Again to me this advocates for owners and landlords to be responsible to people on the local area and for any and all taxes related to property or business on the land to go back at least to the state in order to benefit the local communities under that state government. Or to pressure business entities to invest in the local economy as opposed to large national corporations or foreign investors.

Shoot this one full of holes please. "

I'm willing to hear arguments about either though.

In light of the Tik Tok ban bill, a common argument I hear supporting it is that China's government has more stringent rules about what can be posted, and usually favors science/education/healthy lifestyle posts ? Whereas the international version of the app is completely unregulated and allowed to feed whatever toxic content is popular that day. The view is that this is proof China has an agenda to safeguard it's populace while causing harm to others. Correct me in the comments if I misunderstood this specific argument (and not other reasons TT should be banned).

My problem is, what else are they supposed to do? If they decide to force ByteDance (TT holding company) to make ""healthy"" content mandatory internationally, it will then be accused of deliberately curating the media feed of OVER 1 BILLION PEOPLE. Even with the best intentions in mind, someone will always take offense to not having the freedom to choose what they watch (Americans more than most people). It would be seen as an invasion of freedom of speech to dictate what people see and learn and laugh at and engage with every day no matter how well intentioned the decision is.

The only solution seems to be to let the algorithm do what it always does, show people what they want and let them deal with the consequences (good or bad). If this wasn't the case, then should Twitter and Facebook also tweak their algorithms to exhibit the same bias Chinese Tik Tok has? And if the answer is no they shouldn't, then why not? Why should Americans hold a foreign social media company to higher standards than it's domestic ones?

Curious to hear what y'all think."

From americas perspective it was continue the war and have more Japanese and Americans die with no end in sight, or end it with having just more Japanese die.

This was because the average civillian knew nothing about policies other than basic knowledge, they couldn't read or write

Now one representative/elector represents about 700,000 people. 

At this point land is worth more than people.

54 electoral votes/reps represents Cali. There are 40 million people. 

1 electoral vote reps 700,000 in California. In Wyoming, one vote represents ~166000 people.

This is unfair that a Wyoming item gets more representation, and at this point it's fuel by conservatives that wastelands with extremely small populations have more electoral power per capita than larger states

1,2024-03-19,cmv: Life isn't fair vs karma,u/DemasOrbis,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bickb7/cmv_life_isnt_fair_vs_karma/,changemyview,"So I was having a conversation with a friend the other day about the concept of karma. She asked whether or not I believed in karma, and I said that my gut reaction is no but that I am agnostic on the issue; on the one hand, karma as a general idea makes sense. There have been times in my own life where I feel like I've experienced karma. Bad things have happened to me that I felt I deserved because of some past actions or mistakes that I have made. When I treat people well they treat me well in return, etc. Believing in reincarnation can also help explain karma, because when bad things happen to good people then it can just be karma coming back to bite them from a previous life.  
On the other hand, I've always had a problem with this idea, because I feel like it almost justifies injustices. Someone is born poor, it's just their karma. It can make people care less for those less fortunate than them because they are 'just living their karma'.  They may still try to help those people to build up good karma for themselves, but ultimately they still believe that their suffering is somehow deserved.  
Then my friend said something that I found very interesting; she said that you cannot simultaneously believe that life is unfair and also believe in karma. Karma insinuates that life is fair, because ultimately, somewhere down the line karma will balance out all positive and negative actions.  
It was this statement that made me realize the real problem I have with karma. Do I believe that life is fair? Absolutely not.   
Or put it this way. Do I believe that children being starved and murdered in Palestine or Sudan, or children being born in slums in India with insects burrowing into their eyes, deserve what they are experiencing? Or do I believe that it's just as simple as people and govts are corrupt and life is unfair? I gotta say I would go for the latter.  
Ultimately, I would have to say that I agree with my friend's observation. Believing that life is unfair seems to go against the very concept of karma, which teaches that everything is balanced.   
What do you think? Are the beliefs that life is unfair and the belief that karma is real mutually exclusive? I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts.

He listened to me at night and was going to protect and guide me through life. I’ve prayed and still…nothing.

If there is a God, said God is either not all powerful or not loving/forgiving/good. 

No loving God would create a place like Earth and subject billions of people to the horrors of this world. Before you say it’s just a test or suffering is good for you it brings about growth-well sometimes… partially.

Going to the gym and pushing through a hard workout or running a marathon is difficult and is a certain degree of suffering but you get out stronger on the other side. However, a majority of suffering is actually not like this at all. You don’t get better from it you get way worse. 

For example, countless cases of abuse/trauma where the person develops an addiction, repeats the cycle or kills themselves. What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger is mostly not true. It’s just a coping mechanism or phrase people say to make themselves feel better. Sometimes it can make you much worse. And what loving God would design such an experience for humanity to endure.

The suffering of humanity in general is fruitless. Childhood cancer, people being blown up by drones, wars that line the pockets of a few elite, poverty, disease, addiction, mental illness, accidents, loss/grief - what purpose do any of those horrific things have? None. And no loving God would bring about these conditions.

God doesn’t love me. And God doesn’t love you. We’re basically all just monkey cyborgs addicted to technology on a floating spinning space rock made of water, and that’s most likely it. No heaven, no hell. No meeting God or dancing with loved ones in some make believe heaven - just this life on this earth with it’s trials, tribulations, good times and bad. But ultimately, no loving God to be there for you when you need God most.

1,2024-03-19,"CMV: If technology continues to progress at anywhere near its current rate, most humans will have no economic value within a few decades.",u/eagle_565,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bideq5/cmv_if_technology_continues_to_progress_at/,changemyview,"The industrial revolution freed most humans from the burden of manual labour, with some unskilled physical labour jobs left over (stocking shelves, construction,  etc.). This allowed for more people to do more creative, intellectual and generally cushy jobs than every before.

This trend has continued to the modern day, with less and less people in back breaking work like mining and farming, and more people working from soft chairs in air conditioned offices.

However, it seems to me that this will undoubtedly end soon, probably within our lifetimes. We're already basically at the point where AI can do basic office jobs like call centre work, and it typically does significantly better on standardised tests than the average person, which I think shows that with the right training it will soon be able to do any intellectual job better than most people.

We're even at the point where artists and videographers are at risk of unemployment due to technologies  like mid journey and SORA. Programmers are on thin ice too, with a coding AI called DEVIN being able to solve 14% of the problems on github. These technologies aren't quite at the level of the best humans yet, but they're certainly past the level of an untalented human and their ability is improving with frightening pace.

So with this new industrial revolution, where is our economic niche? After the first revolution it was in work that required intelligence or creativity, but that work is now at serious risk due to modern technologies.

If physical labour can almost all be done by machines, and our computers outperform most humans (and soon all, I fear) in intellectual and creative tasks, how do any of us provide economic value beyond what is already being provided by our machines?

(Note: it seems that skilled labour jobs such as plumbers and electricians may be safe for a while because our robots aren't developed/cheap enough yet to replace them, but it's reasonable to assume that that technology will progress past the ability of the average human given a few decades).

If age very poorly or become ugly by some other reason your value will drop alot.

It doesn't mean that men don't also want qualities such an inner beauty, kindness etc. But without ALSO outer beauty..... those things mean nothing.

It's only in western countries that lately *some* people have believed that a woman has worth and value even if she is ugly.

But in Eastern Europe, middle east, Africa etc beautiful women are still considered higher and a prime focus is on becoming more beautiful. And you are f* by society if you cannot achieve that. Saying openly that a woman is ugly or criticising her on the basis.of her looks or even making jokes....it's commonplace.

Another example, in Islamic religion a man is allowed up to 4 wives. *Technically* this was supposed to.be to help widows and those in bad circumstances, BUT in reality vast majority of the men that marry a second or third wife the next wife is ALWAYS younger and prettier. So, yes,women (in men's eyes) are considered to depreppreciate like cars.

In Caucasian where multiple wives are not uncommon all the women look super beautiful because their whole life is about beautifying themselves. Expensive hair salons, face laser treatments, lip and cheek fillers etc.

I understand that many will immediately say that there was no democracy or freedom of speech, but this is not true. In the Soviet Union at the time of its collapse (under Gorbachev) there was both democracy and freedom of speech. And it has already existed for several years.  
When people tell me about queues at stores, excuse me, I asked all my relatives and each of them said that they had never been in queues in their lives (none of them are officials and we are not from Moscow). Perhaps the reason is that my parents were never big fans of meat. But at the same time, in the end, low meat consumption most likely had a positive effect on their health, because at their age both of them are healthier than their peers. Many people may misunderstand me now. My parents were never vegetarians and always ate meat several times a week, they just never made it a point to eat meat every day for lunch and dinner.  


When I ask if they had enough food, everyone said that there was enough food. In my childhood, immediately after the collapse of the USSR, I remember very well that there was no shortage of food. Despite the fact that at this time the economy was much worse than during the USSR. When I was a child, I remember that we could leave the doors open and not be afraid of being robbed. Crime began to increase significantly only later.   
When people tell me how bad the economy was, it’s hard for me to believe it, because when I walk the streets I see how much was built during the Soviet era.

Yes, the way the economy was structured was different from most other countries, but this does not make the country as a whole very different from most other Western countries.

With the rise of the internet, there is a massive amount of information that reaches massive amounts of people quickly – with that comes the fact that more people will know about an incident quicker, and that more people will have an opinion about an incident/person. A person having an opinion that is negative of a person, is allowed and normal.

You might say that losing your career over say, a racist tweet from 10 years ago, is too big of a consequence. And I can buy that, but at the same it is perfectly understandable why people would have no interest in supporting 1) a celebrity 2) that has said something racist. It's perfectly understandable why you'd say ""oh, that's not good, I don't want to spend my time/money on that person."" And you can't hinder a large group of people from feeling that way – what are you going to do, be like hey guys!! This third of the internet is NOT allowed to want to not support this celebrity, because of that happens the consequences for him will be too big, and that's unfair! 

The ""we need to be more understanding and give people second chances"" argument confuses me deeply and seems to either come from public people who are scared of getting cancelled, or people who look up to certain public people too much and coddle them. Yes, we should be understanding and forgiving, but that is mainly important in our close, real, personal relationships. There are so many public people who have done questionable things, why in the world should we spend the time monitoring and ""giving second chances"" to several people that we do not know at all, when we could just...feel a quick Intrinsic feeling of dislike, and then move on with our lives. 

Average people lose their jobs all of the time for arguably unfair and immoral reasons. I couldn't care less about a presumably richer person getting reasonable consequences in the form of public dislike, when they have done something that the public agrees is bad."

This means all traffic in a junction when encountering a vehicle that is clearly indicating that it is going to turn left, should yield if paths cross. This includes, but not limited to:

* Non-signalized junctions
* 2-phase Signalized junctions where lights turn green on opposing sides while those not turns red
* Any vehicle clearly turning left inside the junction even when he has no ROW otherwise

My reasons are as follows:

* Left turns are a inherently risky manoeuvre to all road users in the vicinity. By requiring everyone yield to them, this lets them clear the junction faster with less interference.
* As an extension, by giving them priority, this allows them to focus on the road on their left and any pedestrians on it - on a 2-phase signal pedestrians might be crossing so it should be their main focus
* By giving left turning vehicles priority, vehicles going straight ahead must slow down to make sure no vehicle is turning left. This means green lights becomes a yield/give way sign and traffic must slow down to a safe speed at junctions, collisions will thus be less damaging should they happen
* Ultimately this would encourage authorities to completely separate signal phases so there is no conflicts on lefts

However, current rules are straight > right > left. There should be other arguments other than the simple argument of efficiency and raw throughput (otherwise the outright straightforward answer is no left turns or roundabouts). CMV."

I don't always feel like this.)

Gatekeeping gets a lot of criticism, because anyone can enjoy something, probably. But I think both gatekeeping and criticism of gatekeeping are missing the point: it's not the hobbies.

People have interests. But people who make their interests into *hobbies* don't do it by choice. They do it because they're weird people who failed at real life. Why would anyone *want* to sit around alone playing with toys? Has anybody in human history actually agreed, *ever,* that model trains or MCU theories are better than fucking? Gatekeeping is acknowledging that *if* a normal person chooses to subject themselves to weird people, it's that there's something in it for them. Weird people know this, because weird people *also* despise weird people, starting with themselves.

So yes, dyeing your hair pink and going ""lol I'm weird like you"" *is* insulting, because you *know* what you're doing. All those #positivity posts on Instagram with the pretty colours and quotes like ""well everybody's a little weird, everybody deserves love 💕"" are bullshit, and you know they are, because we both know the deal. It's nothing to do with culture or social norms. You *know* what the weird people look like. You know when you're not one, and you sure as shit know when you're one, because you'd kill - actually, literally ***kill*** - to be normal. Being weird is knowing your existence is at best worthless and at worst offensive. Everywhere you go, you're guilty by default. You're in a permanent job interview 24/7 with literally everybody in the world, having to sell your right to *maybe* be tolerated for the next few minutes. But since it's normal people, well, it's not *gatekeeping,* is it? Just normal people who don't want a weirdo killing their #vibe. 🤓

Incels are wrong, it's not about physical appearance. But they're also right: it is about genes. Fatties fuck. Midgets fuck. Men who *literally don't wipe their own arses* fuck. Everybody fucks if they're fun and charming, which means *normal.* So no, incels aren't ugly. They're unlovable because they're crazy, stupid, autistic, incapable of self-control, or any other flavour of *weird.* *Weird* means *not normal.* *Normal* means *not weird.* They don't mix. Sure, some of the weird people get to be tolerated if they're useful or entertaining enough, but that doesn't mean they belong. As soon as that runs out, back in the trash they go, and maybe someday they'll be called back to scrub normal people's toilets for half of minimum wage.

That's why HR people want degrees, by the way. If you've had to spend your time alone learning skills by yourself instead of having somebody to teach you, that's because you're weird, and weird people burden the employees. You're the reason job interviews exist. And it's also why so many artists and creators are weird people: necessity. Normal people don't need to create shit or perform dog tricks to make themselves lovable, they're worthy out the gate. ""Just be yourself"" is literally how it works for them. That's the difference between fitting in and belonging. It's why nobody likes you, no matter how considerate you are, how hard you self-improve and bend over backwards to navigate the rules: *it's not about the rules. It's that you're one of the weird people and everybody can tell.* You think normal people give a shit about the rules? The point of the rules is that they're a filter. *If* you have to be aware of them *at all*, you're already disqualified.

The weird people don't belong with the normal people, and shouldn't even be alive to begin with, and both know this. We're a bunch of apes, and it's our instinct to eliminate the shitty genes. We cringe at weird people, so we know who the defective people are, so we can throw them out. Weird people are the trash bin of the human species. Hence gatekeeping. It's instinctual, because deep down, both sides know we're all better off if we each stay in our lane. It's also why all of this is so taboo: truth hurts, and we've built up our self-concept from deluding ourselves that we're better than the other meat things.

And now we've got an entire underbelly of weird people we allow to live, in misery, being sold hope and #positivity and self-help nonsense, because it's the ""civilised"" thing to do. Hell, I guess a few are decent enough artists, but is it worth all the ones who become mass shooters?

The nostalgia for the pre-phone world is overhyped. ,u/10ioio,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1biiz2d/cmv_we_are_actually_a_more_connected_society/,changemyview,"The current thing for a few years has been to trash on the internet and social media and yearn for a time when we didn’t have the internet and smartphones, and there was more of a local sense of community. 


My honest opinion: what we actually had before was a hyper-local culture, where people only knew about things happening in their immediate vicinity, and things big enough to make the news. They were less anxious about things outside their bubble, because they were almost completely unaware of anyone outside their local bubble.


People were more connected to people that lived near them, but totally disconnected from anyone else, which in a lot of respects is a really toxic thing. I think it can lead to xenophobic attitudes, and ignorance, and it makes it easy to sweep global issues under the rug, because you’re not exposed to the day to day lives of people living abroad. 


Comparison/self-esteem is a problem with social media, but the flip side of that is the positive comparisons. Realizing there are other gay people out there is a positive comparison (oh they’re gay just like me, and they understand what I go through), watching a family in another country have morning coffee and seeing their house is a comparison that’s like “oh they’re just like me.” I think those things were sometimes difficult before the internet and you could kind of just say “well that bad stuff is just happening in another country.”


 I think part of the mental health thing is that we just can’t shrug off immense suffering as “happening somewhere else” and the shock of actually being forced to confront the sick reality of the world and acknowledge our roles in it is emotionally difficult and maybe even traumatizing, but we will never confront these things unless we first doom scroll and see the doom for what it is. Our views are heavily shaped by the fact that we didn’t grow up with it and it was a shock when these things came out.

Artists smugly roll their eyes at this and say “you just don’t get it,” and feel like they’re part of this elite group of artistic geniuses that can appreciate this garbage. But thats not the case… it’s not that it doesn’t have meaning, it’s that the meaning is often needlessly shrouded in absurd symbolism and ambiguity to give it the impression of being more “profound” than it actually is. The goal of the modern artist is to be the most “groundbreaking” “controversial” and “avant-garde” at the expense of beauty and accessibility by the general audience in all but a few cases (tired robot 👀). 

An analogy for this is Baudrillard’s Simulation and Simulacra, which I both love and hate. Baudrillard, if you listen to him speak in interviews or read some of his other texts, is perfectly capable of being clear and articulate when speaking about his ideas. But instead, in Simulation and Simulacra, he veils his argument within vague analogies that are confusing even to well read philosophers. It protects his premises from any attack and allows him to inflate what he’s pointing out, which is a legitimately real and interesting cultural phenomenon, into something mysterious, esoteric, and all encompassing. It’s not that he has nothing to say, it’s just that he intentionally makes it very difficult for the reader to grasp and grossly exaggerates its pervasiveness. If he skipped the BS and just wrote: “symbols and the ideas they represent are all serially caricaturized and lose their real original meaning because of it, here’s some examples and here’s the consequences” it wouldn’t be considered the groundbreaking mind blowing piece of philosophy it is… it’s because of the little game you play where you have to think about all of his analogies and how they’re connected to piece together the picture yourself that makes it seem so profound. 

Baudrillard’s style of argument serves the same purpose as the modern art form. By making art that’s absurd, seemingly meaningless, or inscrutable, it exaggerates the importance of its own message while needlessly obscuring it from the viewer. 

My personal definition of good art is that it’s objectively aesthetically pleasing, informationally dense, and communicates that information well. I’m not here to get into an argument about whether beauty is objectively or subjective or what you think the definition of good art should be. 

What I want to know is why something that the majority of people can appreciate as beautiful (not modern art) can’t communicate anything and everything that modern art can communicate in a way that’s easily accessible? "

But a lot of people dig themselves in problems without realizing it, and dump the ensuing negativity on their partner. My policy is: be there as a listening ear for a while, and let them figure it out themselves first, but after a month of complaining and venting about the same issue without proactive steps to solve it? Yeah I'm going to step in and help, even if my partner didn't ask for it. At that point it starts to become a burden on me, too, and not doing anything about it will just create resentment between us. 

I've had fights before with previous relationships where after a month of complaining about, for example, a colleague not providing the info they need. I will try to say something like ""have you tried sending them an email? Maybe give them a quick teams call?"" with her blowing up on me. And no, she didn't send any email. She just wanted to feel like she was in the right I guess (she was too anxious to ask for help and the issue exploded at work, so both of them where in the wrong). 

This doesn't seem to be the mainstream approach, however, as mostly everyone will just say ""let her vent dude, don't offer solutions, they don't want that."" So, CMV, is my approach bad? Why?

This is how it's always been, women and children first afterall, and in most of the world people adhere to that without questioning or complaining about it.
Not to mention somebody has to watch the existing children, preferrably out of the country. Most often mothers are the primary caretakers, so letting them keep doing that makes the most sense.

We see the same in the Middle East with Muslims/arabs. There are so many minority groups that have been persecuted and simply exterminated throughout the Middle East through Islamization and arabization. Assyrians, Kurds, Christians, Zoroastrians, bahais, coptics, Druze, etc. 

We see these groups having to hide their identities

It’s interesting because we often paint the Arabs/muslims with the same brush as people of color and oppressed minorities. We also say that Arabs lived in peace over there until the west got involved, but cmon that is so far from the truth. There has been war and ethnic cleansing in the Arab world since forever. Christianity was the main culprit for awhile until Islam took over then Christianity again then Islam again. And now it’s mainly Muslim. Except for one controversial state (Israel) 

Arabs have been colonizing the berbers in North Africa and Kurds in Iraq, Syria and Iran. 

So although the onset and creation of the state of Israel is controversial, it is interesting to see how many minority groups in the Middle East actually support Israel, unlike the average Muslim/arab in the Middle East. Sure, Israel was made by Ashkenazi Jews, but many many Jews all over the Middle East found refuge in the state of Israel. And why is it through out the Middle East we see Muslim controlled countries. They are not democracies, and if they are, they severely restrict rights and Islam is very much the ruling power. (Albeit a few) 

You may argue and say “that is their culture and we should respect it” but that is the majority (now) culture, that isn’t the only culture/religion/ethnic group.

Arabs have a history of brutal slavery and colonization. So why do we often group them in with oppressed group? 

(Gaza is a different scenario, as they are clearly oppressed today. But again, they were used as pawns by the Arab world to prevent a minority group from gaining any power … the jews) 

And let’s not forget about dhimmi hood in the Islamic religion, anyone who ain’t Muslim is seen as a second class citizen and isn’t represented, pays jizzyah tax, etc.

None of these arguments hold to close scrutiny.
Before I delve into the different arguments and why they are terrible, I'd like to state that vegetarian diet is a choice. I am not debating whether everyone should stop eating meat. This is not the subject. I, myself, as many, despise slavery yet buy byproducts of the exploitation of very unfortunate people. I still consume diary products even though they relie of code being separated their veals. I am not speaking here about actions and what to do following the discussion.

## Prequisites

This is mainly to remind that meat consumption is — at least in most cases — a matter of pleasure and comfort. Along with a few important points. 

### Animals experience pain and empathy 
From elicit:
> Research in social neuroscience has shown that animals, like humans, have the capacity for empathy and emotional responses (Singer, 2009; Preston, 2001). This is supported by evidence of neural activation in response to the emotions of others, as well as the ability to share the affective experiences of others (Singer, 2009). Furthermore, animals have been found to exhibit behaviors that suggest the presence of empathy, such as social facilitation and vicarious emotions (Preston, 2001). The perception-action model (PAM) has been proposed as a mechanism that underlies empathy in animals, with the interaction between the PAM and prefrontal functioning explaining different levels of empathy across species and age groups (Preston, 2001). However, it is important to note that the exact nature of empathy in animals, including the role of individual differences and the relationship between empathy and prosocial behavior, requires further investigation (Singer, 2009).

> Research has shown that animals, including humans, form strong attachments with each other, often exhibiting behaviors similar to those seen in human infants and chimpanzees (Insel, 2001; Prato-Previde, 2003). These attachments can have significant relational and mental health benefits (Walsh, 2009). However, while the evidence suggests that animals do form attachments and miss each other, more research is needed to fully understand the nature of these bonds.

### Meat is not a necessity 

Again

> Research suggests that meat can be effectively substituted in the human diet with plant-based alternatives, which can have significant environmental and health benefits (Neacsu, 2017; Ritchie, 2018; Bakhsh, 2021; Vliet, 2020). These alternatives, such as high-protein plants and meat substitutes, can provide the necessary nutrients while reducing the environmental impact of meat production. However, it is important to consider the nutritional complexity of whole foods and the potential need for supplementation when replacing meat with plant-based alternatives (Vliet, 2020).

I'd like to add that even on the hypothesis it could be necessary in some cases, today consumption has nothing to do with it. It's like saying fashion industry is driven by necessity.
### Meat production is less efficient
https://ourworldindata.org/land-use-diets
Meat uses 100x more land than vegetables.

## Textbook Fallacies
### We have been eating meat since the dawn of times

Classic appeal to tradition. In simple words, tradition does not nullify nor lessen the suffering caused by meat production.

### It's the food chain, baby
Appeal to nature. Again it does not nullify nor lessen the suffering caused by meat production.
Also, there is vast difference between ""natural"" food chain and current human consumption.

## Specism

Specism would have you believe that it's okay to eat animals as we are different in a way that matters.
This is a bit more thought out argument, but isn't very good either

- One big challenge in arguing that humans can eat animals because we're ""different"" in ways that matter (like being smarter or self-aware), is that this logic doesn't hold up when you think about humans who might not fit those criteria, like babies or people with severe disabilities. If we say only certain abilities make you deserving of moral respect, we'd have to exclude these humans too, which feels wrong. Thus, we cannot find a fair reason that justifies eating animals but protects all humans
-  Just because an animal might not be able to think like a human doesn't mean they don't experience pain in a very real way. Our ability to suffer, a common ground we share with animals, should be the basis for how we decide what's morally right or wrong in how we treat them.

Additionally, a well-stocked bookshelf is not just a personal library but also an expression of one's identity – an art installation where every spine holds a story not just within its pages, but of the moments in one's life when it was read.  
  
Sure, e-books are convenient and save space and I use them when I'm away from home, but they lack the soul of a physical book, touching the paper etc.

The reality that in 2024 we still have beauty pageants proves this. A competition essentially based on no factor except winning the genetic lottery. And before anyone tries to say they also need to learn other skills like umm.... walking lol..... please spare me. We all know it's about beauty and I don't care how much the contestants talk about world peace or ""dogs should be rescued"" etc.

Proving my point further that womens primary value is external appearance - this year Miss Germany was awarded to Apameh Schönauer, a 39 year old architect who immigrated from Iran.
People did not say ""she deserved it because she is warm, open and kind, has a beautiful heart, started a charity to help migrants like herself to fit on"" etc.

NO. They complained she is ugly. She is too old. She looks like a man. There are girls working at Aldi prettier than her. She makes the beauty pageant a joke. Etc.

Even though Germany tried to move in the direction of awarding based on inner beauty, opened the pageant to older female contestants, having women with disabilities as contestants etc.....the world MOCKED.

Basically this is just the most obvious example that womens worth always has been and always will be primarily based on appearance.

Beauty contest winners end up with huge privileges. Also models get ridiculous undeserved incomes and to hang out on boats for essentially doing nothing. While meanwhile ""average aunties"" struggle in Thailand and Indian street and market stalls earning unlivable wages - or in some instances even resorting to begging - simply because they don't look the part and didn't win the genetic lotto. Which means pretty much everything as a female.

People try to say ""womens worth is also in career achievements"".....but don't you think that women have been sold down the river here also?
IOW: 
- women still often earn less in corporate jobs that males for doing the same job
- traditionally female jobs such as nursing, aged care, waitressing are lowly paid
- women now are part of the ""corporate machine""
.....while some male exec at the top is often blowing their mega 💵 on some hot sugar baby anyway 🤔😏

It is wrong to criticize or demean people moving into these areas. The pressure for redevelopment is a symptom of poor urban planning everywhere else and not anything more than that.

1,2024-03-19,CMV: The main problem with online dating for men is the abundance of women who suck at reading people and communicating,u/MelonAirplane,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bilopv/cmv_the_main_problem_with_online_dating_for_men/,changemyview,"I'm not talking about height and money. I'm talking more about how personality is judged and communication.

And this is not about women, but a lot of women on dating apps. IMO, the root cause is women taking the passive role in dating + apps being sausage fests = an abundance of choice for women, and there is almost no dealbreaker too nonsensical to stop them from having enough options.

Back before okcupid was a tinder clone and you could just message people, the okcupid subreddit had lots of women complaining messages they got weren't good enough for ""not putting in enough effort."" This was normally code for ""they just tried to start a conversation like people normally would and didn't try to prove we are compatible.""

And women on the sub would post examples of ""good"" messages, and they were usually a paragraph about how interested they were in them and how much they appreciated their profile, a pickup line everyone had heard before but them so they thought it was so original and hilarious, or quoting a tv show or book.

This topic would be argued about a lot. A lot of the women would be like ""you just have to be good at sending messages"" and a lot of the men would be like ""it's not about being good. Starting your first conversation with a stranger by trying to demonstrate how much you appreciate them and how compatible you guys seem is unnatural and unnecessary. You can just have a regular conversation.""

On apps more based on pics, the standards are higher for men than for women because men don't judge women's pics as harshly. Men are writing and reading guides for how to take pics and some are even hiring professional photographers. Women don't have to do those things as often because men don't care as much about quality of pics as much as how attractive the person in them is.

Men don't as often turn their nose up at women for mirror selfies, bathroom pics, only taking pics alone, or only taking pics in one outfit.

I've read complaints from women on dating apps how most men's profiles are terrible because they're just selfies and dead fish pics. Most women's profiles I see are just pics of them with drinks and food and at the beach and bios that tell me nothing about them. That's just as useless, but men complain less because they're less judgmental about pics.

Irl my experiences have been much better. I've been approached and had women ask for my number or give me theirs more times than I've matched with anyone on an app. But if they were applying app logic in real life, they probably wouldn't have because they wouldn't have a series of pics of me to prove I'm interesting.

My point is this difference exists because app logic can't be applied in real life. You see a person and their appearance and maybe style and vibe is enough to make the decision whether or not to talk to them. On apps, there is more information, which prompts people to jump to conclusions without even realizing they're doing it, and it's more often women because they have a bigger pool to look at and cut down. People think stuff like ""this person has multiple pics smiling and out doing things with friends. They must be happy and fun,"" even though that person could be a miserable, horrible person. But because they managed to smile for a second around people for a few moments in time, a stranger looking at them through the internet has the wrong idea."

I think a lot of the defensiveness comes from buyers remorse. Along the lines of “if I spent that money, I NEED to prove it was justified or there weren’t alternatives”. This comes down to a lack of research or being critical enough of the products themselves just because they are popular and recognizable.
Now going back to this “live and let live”. Well I’ve come to believe that people who often buy overpriced and expensive products for the trendiness of the brand are sometimes disingenuous. At worst, some are nefarious and devolve into a popular contest of judging others who don’t have the same materialistic standards. In fact, some of these products have very unethical practices and the constant promotions of these luxury products or lifestyle product are worse for all of us.
To stir the pot, I just want to throw out Tesla and electric cars in the market that are constantly priced in the “luxury” market.
Instead, I think people are fully entitled to judge how people spend their money whether it be frivolously or with financial responsibility."

\-They are addictive. You could consume it in moderation, sure, but no alcoholic/ drug addict ever got into it with the intention to get addicted. Besides, why do it all when do you can not do it? Think of it like speeding or not wearing a seat belt. Most of the time, you will be fine, but the potential downsides are life ruining, just like alcohol and drugs.

\- A lot of times what leads people to consume alcohol and/or drugs is the peer pressure. Studies have shown alcohol consumption is correlated with income, and often it can be tough to break into higher status circles without consuming alcohol.

\- Its bad for your health. Research shows not consuming alcohol at all is the way to go for longer life spans.

Counter argument to some common arguments:

\- It's a social lubricant: 1. You can have social events without alcohol, and if you need alcohol to have fun with friends you're already someone who should think twice about consuming alcohol. 2. Muslim countries have lower rates of alcohol consumption, do muslims not hang out socially or have fun with friends?

\-It supports a lot of people and creates jobs: That's like saying criminals should not be rehabilitated because they support the jobs of cops. 

\-It's engrained in culture: It doesn't have to be. Cigarettes were omnipresent, now they're not. Because its bad for you. "

My understanding is celibacy is an active move of sexual abstinence. It's like a vegetarian giving up on eating meat.

If you know anything at all about human nature, you should know that humans are selfish people, that powerful people will use their power for their own ends if they can.

Libertarian belief is built around the assumption that if you allow people the freedom to regulate everything on their own, without any government intervention of any kind, we'll all be way better off. Blow away all regulations, any attempts by a greater entity to stop people from exploiting each other, and the end result will be a much better society where free markets have properly calibrated the value of everything and nobody will be exploiting each other at all!

Like, come on. You really don't think that someone's going to figure out a way to fleece you out of your money? We talk about roads a lot in reference to libertarianism, how ""we don't need the government to build roads for us"". Okay, let's say we leave road-building entirely to citizen-owned businesses. One particularly savvy roadbuilder figures out a way to convince people that HIS roads are better than everyone else's, and he succeeds. How / why? Because who gives a fuck about roads? Who is going to do their due diligence to know whether it's really true when a guy says ""well my road is made of 325X multi-plastinate gloobablop which is a far superior material""? Salesmen are great at convincing people that things are true when they probably just aren't, but if they succeed, voila, now they dominate the industry, and now that they've got all the money, they can probably use that money to shut down everyone else, out-advertise them, establish their monopoly, and now they can charge as much as they want to build their roads. You say that some other company can slide in with cheaper prices, but you're forgetting some really well-known things about humanity: people are stupid, people are lazy, people are suckers. The big monopoly company can easily push their own propaganda that their own material is superior and still have a stranglehold on the business.

I feel like anyone with the most basic understanding of humanity would understand why libertarianism would never work. That's why I've always viewed any libertarian as extremely naive and just not very smart, certainly not the least bit aware of how the world actually works.

1,2024-03-19,"CMV: Jeffrey Epstein was likely affiliated with Mossad, if not the broader Israeli government; to give Israel leverage over American and European institutions. There is shared elite consensus to cover up evidence on Epstein's suicide because of this.",u/Majestic-Pair9676,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1biot1p/cmv_jeffrey_epstein_was_likely_affiliated_with/,changemyview,"Before I start, I will state that I am NOT blaming all Jewish people or the religion/tribe of Judaism for Jeffrey Epstein's horrific actions. I do not even believe the state of Israel was aware of his pedophilia and sex crimes until it was too late. I do not and will not tolerate anti-semitism of any kind whatsoever and I hope the mods ban any anti-semitic content here.

That said, I have a lingering suspicion that:  
1. Because Ghislaine Maxwell's father was a known spy for Mossad who stole weapons from European governments; 

2. Because Jeffrey Epstein was a ""financier"" of extremely dubious background (no college degree, falsely claimed to be a billionaire, owned a private island despite a small clientele base, no records of serious work in Bear Sterns, few people in Wall Street actually did business with him)

3. Many of his clients are close to Israel and modern Zionism more broadly (in particular, Ehud Barak the former PM of Israel, Bill Clinton, academics in MIT and Harvard like Steven Pinker and Alan Dershowitz)

Jeffrey Epstein was probably working for Mossad or the Israeli government more broadly - to give Israel some ""insurance"" within Western institutions like academia, government and finance. Presumably this translated to added American and European support for Israel politically in case the Democrat base ever started to favor the Palestinians or Arab Muslims.

I'm also very concerned about the way Epstein died - the criminal negligence of the guards who in his cell, and especially the way people in certain elite circles are quick to dismiss Epstein's death as mere coincidence - I think that elite institutions fear a mass outpouring of anti-semitism will occur if it turned out Epstein was a spy for Israel. Because anti-semitic people try to spin this as ""proof"" that all Jewish people are inherently sinful, perverted and conspiratorial. If Epstein was ever revealed as a spy for Israel, it would be 100x worse than the Dreyfuss Affair ever was, because this time the crimes are real, sponsored by elite institutions all over the Western world, covered up by the only Jewish state on the planet.

Corporations do not and cannot hold altruistic views. Any attempts to convince consumers otherwise is a marketing or operational strategy in an effort to secure their existence for another quarter.  
  
Key points:  
  

- Reddit as a company has often positioned itself as a champion of online freedom. This stance is a facade.   
  

- More stringent regulations would impose significant operational costs on Reddit, disrupt its ad-based revenue model, and ultimately deter users from engaging on the platform.    
  

  
- Platforms are protected by legislation such as Section 230 which allows Reddit to defer responsibility for content its users post. This means that corporate leaders like Steve Huffman are protected from personal liability when their products are used to facilitate illegal activities or from being held liable when the user base engages in *witch-hunts* as seen after the Boston Marathon incident. 
  
- Reddit’s actions are not driven by a commitment to online freedom but by an existential crisis to maintain its user base and revenue streams. 
  
- Steve Huffman has a [pattern of lying](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36246202) from ‘denigrating the developer’ of Apollo to [editing user comments that criticized or insulted him](https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/23/13739026/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-edit-comments#:~:text=Reddit%20CEO%20Steve%20Huffman%20today,Trump%20subreddit%2C%20r%2Fthe_donald.) and even going so far as to claim ‘Black Lives Matter after a pattern of defending [white supremacy and blatant racism on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/gv7mtn/steve_spez_huffman_is_finally_claiming_that_black/).

This is often blamed on social media, where people get their news from - rather than established and regulated news organisations.

Over the course of the past 10-15 years legacy media has struggled to keep up with the competition from social media.

What should have happened is they double down on being a trusted, high quality source of information. Instead they have cut budgets, over stretched journalists, and KPI’d them on clicks rather than veridicality.

Now we have poorly researched, knee jerk pieces, designed to outrage and hijack people’s emotions, rather than edify them. Often prioritising divisive narratives that frighten people into clicking. 

As a consequence many feel they cannot trust the mainstream media, and instead absorb information from other sources.

This is fertile ground for misinformation. When trust is so low, and times are hard, people will latch onto any narrative that provides simple solutions.

People pick and choose the narrative that resonates rather than the closest approximation of the truth.

And I don't mean just high standards I mean all kinds of limiting ideology that is meant to lead to a ""perfect"" person. 

My argument stems from the basis of people putting their requirements above genuine connection. Dismissing people because they don't meet some unrealistic, oddly specific expectation you've set for an imaginary person.

Other times people just want clones of themselves. Someone to like gaming coz you like gaming. Or someone who likes sex just the way you do.  Finding prospects who match this is not only hard but will be eventually unfulfilling. 

And if not this, they want movie/Book characters. People just picking qualities they've watched or read about. You don't realize you only want him to be big and bad because of that book character you read. Or watching porn or being spectators in other people's lives and just picking random qualities and putting this unreal template for some real human to match. 

Maybe the requirements are out of fear of some kind. Fear of poverty, or unfulfilling company which is valid to some extent. But then just like I'm every area, there's always the majority of people who don't know when to quit, cannot seem to understand that two things can exist at the same time. Like not want to be poorer but still engage with people who aren't in the same wage bracket. Honestly, the absence of money is not the reassurance of a pathetic life. Things change/happen, people are still getting started in life etc.

These mostly materialistic requirements are stupid at best. Even if someone fits your mold now, they might now in the future. Again, people and life changes. These changes don't accommodate for your desires.  There will always be more books to read, people to feel jealous of, things and stuff to desire, new trends, new ways of thinking etc.

I understand compatibility. But I also understand compromise, which isn't always a negative thing. 

You will change. What you want now won't be what you want in the future. How amazing would it be if your person changes with you too?. A always fulfilling, fresh, loving relationship.

Top line disclaimer: I live in New York and while I recognize the issue of rider safety on the trains, using the National Guard to fill the gap *that NYPD is supposed to cover* is inappropriate.
  
The National Guard is not the “Easy Button” to fix every states problems.  
  
They are not school teachers. They are not bus drivers. They are not security guards. They are not there to be your police auxiliary.  

These dudes are worn out and they can’t maintain their actual unit readiness levels when they are constantly pulled to do this.   
  
They also aren’t going to stay in the guard when they are getting called up and leaving their actual jobs to do whatever the governor has decided for them to do this time.
   

The Guard has increasingly been integrated into actual deployment rotations their intended mission of being a “reserve force” is no longer accurate. They deploy just as much, *if not more*, than active duty. 

Yeah - the trains have seen an incredible increase of violence over the last several months - that’s not a problem the Guard is intended to solve or even tackle. That’s NYPD. If there is a shortage of NYPD, hire more. Don’t defer that to the Guard. 
    
Context:  
  
> Gov. Kathy Hochul’s announcement today that 1,000 state personnel — including 750 national guard troops — will be deployed to the city’s subways comes two weeks after the mayor called on her to add NYPD overtime funding into her executive budget.

This trend has continued to the modern day, with less and less people in back breaking work like mining and farming, and more people working from soft chairs in air conditioned offices.

However, it seems to me that this will undoubtedly end soon, probably within our lifetimes. We're already basically at the point where AI can do basic office jobs like call centre work, and it typically does significantly better on standardised tests than the average person, which I think shows that with the right training it will soon be able to do any intellectual job better than most people.

We're even at the point where artists and videographers are at risk of unemployment due to technologies  like mid journey and SORA. Programmers are on thin ice too, with a coding AI called DEVIN being able to solve 14% of the problems on github. These technologies aren't quite at the level of the best humans yet, but they're certainly past the level of an untalented human and their ability is improving with frightening pace.

So with this new industrial revolution, where is our economic niche? After the first revolution it was in work that required intelligence or creativity, but that work is now at serious risk due to modern technologies.

If physical labour can almost all be done by machines, and our computers outperform most humans (and soon all, I fear) in intellectual and creative tasks, how do any of us provide economic value beyond what is already being provided by our machines?

(Note: it seems that skilled labour jobs such as plumbers and electricians may be safe for a while because our robots aren't developed/cheap enough yet to replace them, but it's reasonable to assume that that technology will progress past the ability of the average human given a few decades).

Exemple that i saw some woman who are non-cis(u know what that means, i can't write it), and they were watching a video about a non-cis woman who had full grown beard on their faces. This person on the video tried to enter the woman bathroom and the cis-woman stoped them and this person really got violent(they had big muscly arms, but was wearing a dress and seem to have make up on)  and was yelling very loud. The non-cis woman that were watching had surgery and looked like cis-woman and even them asked ''if it's non-cis, then why the full grown beard? Why have such a big male asset on you with u want to be a woman?''. I follow these ladys for a long time and heard they story, they really felt gross in a male body, so i guess that's why their opinion was that.  


So, is that it? The real ones vs people who just want atenttion? Or worse, are there people using the LGBT+ to invade some spaces? Like the said ''non-cis women'' who won a woman race and their times beat the records for female but for male it was a bad timing, i think it's from 2016 but i can't find the video about the women complaining about this anymore.

The political landscape among young people in the UK is undergoing a notable shift, as evidenced by the statistics. In the 2019 general election, a striking 76% of individuals aged 18-24 lent their support to left-leaning parties like Labour and the Liberal Democrats. In contrast, only 27% of those aged 70 and above favored these parties. This stark contrast highlights a significant generational divide in political preferences.  
What's particularly interesting is that voting patterns, which used to be heavily influenced by social class, now seem to be more closely tied to age. This trend isn't confined to voting alone; there's also been a surge in public activism. From the widespread Black Lives Matter protests to the colorful LGBTQ+ Pride events, there's a growing embrace of progressive values and human rights awareness across society.  
While many governments around the world still lean towards the center-right or right-wing, the changing demographics and societal attitudes suggest a potential rise in left-wing governments over time. We might even see this unfold in real-time, perhaps exemplified by the 2024 general election in the UK, where Labour is expected to make significant gains over the Conservatives, reflecting the shifting political landscape of the nation."
748,2024-03-19,"CMV: most people who dislike centrists/moderates don’t want them to pick A side, they want them to pick THEIR side.",u/OkieFemboy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bissk6/cmv_most_people_who_dislike_centristsmoderates/,changemyview,"I want to start this off by saying that I would not call myself a moderate, I probably fall more in the classical liberalism camp. I believe that a lot of times whenever people criticize centrists/moderates they don’t even know what they are talking about, thinking that centrists want a compromise on every issue ever. This is not what a centrist is. 

While a centrist may indeed be more likely to admit that they don’t have enough information on a topic to form an opinion (that’s an incredibly wise thing to do, by the way, much better than just picking a side and not knowing what you’re talking about), that’s not what centrism is.

Centrism is having political positions on different topics which could be either considered liberal or conservative, putting their median position in the middle. For example, if you ask a centrist about abortion, gun control, higher taxes, and about universal healthcare, they might be pro-life, anti-gun control, pro-universal healthcare, and think we ought to raise taxes, that would make them, on average, in the middle. Centrists aren’t centrist on issues, they’re centrists on average.

I think most people understand this but pretend not to. It is perfectly fine to dislike centrism on that merit, but it seems that most people tend to distort what centrism is, turning it into a strawman. As seen in a popular comic which I am sure you have seen, a centrist is inbetween the KKK and members of the civil rights movement holding a sign that says “compromise?”

People on the left have used this comic to say “the kkk is the right wing and the civil rights movement is the left wing, and so they’re letting it happen!” Which is multiple straw men in one argument. The fact that this is such a repeated argument shows that they don’t hate moderates because they are moderates, they hate them because they’re not leftists. Same thing goes for the right wing.

There could be two people who have opposite viewpoints on everything, and still both be moderate. It’s not an ideology, it’s a category."

It’s propaganda made right as Gingrich took power in America, that basically has a subtle message that every liberal and socially progressive thing that the Boomers generation did was morally wrong. 

That the path to salvation lay in conservatism; in simple faith in god, country, institutions in spite of those institutions failing the public.

That the path of wanton liberalism and questioning the status quo ends in death. 

Let’s example it through the lens of our two major protagonists.

Forest is a clean cut, upstanding citizen. Even has a Nixonian bzuzcut. He’s clean, neat, no vices, believes in God. Hangs out with Elvis, with Nixon, with JFK’s. Moons LBJ, who all the conservatives hate for giving blacks rights. 

He's a proud Vietnam vet who never questions the war, law, or authority. 

Forest is a good guy, and in the end, despite some bumps and knocks in life, he's okay.

Meanwhile, Jenny is a lost soul who tries to find her place in the world, because she was sexually abused. 

She's an activist for the anti-war movement. She's a Civil Rights activist.

She's also portrayed as an emotionally manipulative drug addict and slut, who dies of AIDs just as Reagan comes to power. She dies in 1982, just a year into his Presidency. 

You could see her as symbolic of the idealism of the 60s - with the message that this idealism was at its heart immoral, wanton, sexual, meaningless, vacuous. 

And that good simple men like Forest would steer America back, just as in a conservatives’ view, Reagan steered America “back” after the “excesses” of the 60s and 70s.

It's very ""the wages of sin equals death"" and presents Forest's simple, 50s style conservation as the path to having a relatively good life.

Jenny's liberalism and idealistic crusade for causes ends in a horrible, young death.

Theres a message in this film, and it’s not subtle about it.

I also want to specify that I get it when it comes to countries where freedom of speech is limited, and I assume most of this discussion will be about the USA and I'm fine with that.  
I am a technical person and I also work sometimes with ""big data"" and analytics. People think that they are the center of the universe / watched by the government / personally monitored. Even people that don't directly think that, I will assume that at least unconsciously tend to feel similar.  
What they fail to understand is that the ""data"" that is being collected about them is completely generic and impersonal, meaning no human actually comes and looks at YOU and even cares if this data is ""intrusive"". This data becomes graphs and charts that show up in some business presentation, or viewed by machines that automatically adjust various internet factors such as targeted ads and etc.  
Saying that it's harmful is false. On the contrary, this data eventually translates into large demographic correlations that makes businesses earn more money and have better and more focused business plans, improving their sales, and eventually makes the whole country richer, and the individual can only benefit from their country being richer and have lower taxes. If it didn't harm you personally until now, it also never will.  
Let's take some common things people are ""concerned"" about regarding privacy, and demystify them:  
Sexual orientation: I understand if you'd like to hide your sexual orientation from individuals, but hiding it from major corporates makes no sense. They couldn't care less about you. The data about your sexual orientation can only be used in large demographic correlations. The only consequence is that you'll see more LGBT merchandise ads than the average person. It's not a human that thought ""hmm, this one has a different sexual orientation, let's send them some ads and dox them while wer'e at it"". It's a machine that did it and no human ever has or ever will care about more than the net revenue from these type of ads.  
Government Criticism: People say a lot of bad things about the US government all day long as vocally as they can and nothing happens to them as long as they don't physically harm anyone. What makes you any more special? How this data can be relevant in is for example collecting about what are the political opinions in each region/state, not about YOU specifically. Your'e living in a free democratic country, if you think your freedom of speech is monitored then go try living in a more restrictive country to experience what it's really like.  
The only conclusion I have left as to why people care about data privacy is that they either do, or plan to do, or want the possibility to do something that harms society. If their individual privacy is protected, why would they care about generic demographic data collected about them? It means they have something to hide. In that case I say it should be in all of our collective effort to make sure as much data is collected about as many individuals as possible for all our safety (and no, the US has too many checks and balances to become a dictatorship, steal big data from tech companies and imprison people for their individual characteristics and opinions. This is not a realistic scenario).

Anyway, this is CMV, and I'm open to changing this opinion, of course, if there's something I'm missing here, and I might. I expressed myself strongly because this is my opinion as of right now, not because I can't change it."

The organization called the attempted erection of buildings the New Nisanit settlement, and posted multiple pictures of the building and activists.

Isn't this movement in effect advocating for ~~genocide~~ ethnic cleansing? Why aren't groups like this prosecuted by law? Like they'd be in Germany for instance.

Some would argue that it should be kept out of schools, but I don't see any problem with it as long as it is kept age appropriate. It might help combat bullying against gay students by teaching acceptance. My brother is a teacher, and I asked him for his opinion on this. He said that a big part of his job is supporting students, and part of that is supporting his students' identities. (Like, he would be there for them if they came out as gay.)

1,2024-03-19,CMV: nothing ever cross the event horizon of a black hole,u/lcvella,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bivqv2/cmv_nothing_ever_cross_the_event_horizon_of_a/,changemyview,"I am no physicist, but unfortunately this question seems to be out of the scope of r/askscience , because it was removed from there when I asked, so I'll try my luck here.  
So, my view is less about the astronomical real bodies called black holes, and more about the interpretation of widely accepted results in physics, derived from established theories. Namely, the Schwarzschild solution for the general relativity equations, and the Hawking radiation. Let me start with the Schwarzschild solution, and then add the Hawking radiation later.  
It is known and undisputed that anything approaching the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole will never reach it, in coordinate time. Take a photon, for instance: if you shoot a laser directly into a black hole from a distant orbit, and then calculate when the photons will actually cross the event horizon, they never will. They will approach it, and asymptotically slow down until it ""freezes"" just above the event horizon. Of course they will still be moving, but ever slower from your point of view.  
What about in the proper time of the photons? Well, photons don't have proper time, as they travel at the speed of light. But if you take a massive object, like a clock or a person, then they have proper time, i.e. they have a rate at which they perceive time, that may be different from the rate another observer perceives time. It is also a well known result that if you throw a stopwatch into a black hole, like the photon, it will also slow down and freeze just above the event horizon, but (and I do not dispute this) in the frame of reference of the stopwatch, it will eventually cross the event horizon. I.e. if the stop watch freezes at 9 seconds for me, the external observer, for the stopwatch itself, time keeps going through 10, 11, and so forth, and it keeps falling beyond the event horizon.  
So we get to this strange place where natural language has trouble handling the intricacies of General Relativity, as we know that, from one point of view, the object will cross the event horizon in a finite amount of time, and from another point of view, it will hang over there forever. It is not an illusion, or lack of information for the outside observer, like I saw some people argue. It is a cold hard fact of the laws of the universe. Mapping t to τ, there is no time t that represents the time τ of crossing and beyond. The curve is literally a mathematical asymptote.  
Given the duality of the situation, I could agree that it is not wrong to talk about an object crossing the event horizon in idealized scenarios of pure general relativity, from the point of view of the infalling object.  
But then enters Hawking radiation and black hole information paradox. And please note that for this CMV, I will argue the black hole information paradox is a no-issue, a moot problem, but only for the information falling into a formed black hole, and not for the information that originally formed it.  
The paradox goes like this: imagine there is a stopwatch that falls into the black hole. Then, eventually, in a \*finite\* amount of time (this is important), the black hole will evaporate (and explode!) due to Hawking radiation, and all the energy/mass of the original stopwatch will radiate away from the blackhole as featureless black body radiation. This means the original information of a stopwatch falling into the black hole is completely lost. It could as well be just light, an apple, a mouse or a lump of gold: it doesn't matter, as all information that this energy was once a stopwatch will be erased from the state of the universe.  
Well, in my opinion, (and I hope you correct my ways), this is silly, because the stopwatch never had the chance to actually fall into the black hole, and the argument is trivially simple. Let's fix our frame of reference as an observer far away from any black hole, let's also stipulate that this observer will never fall into a black hole.  Well, as per Hawking radiation, the black hole will evaporate in a finite amount of time T, and as per Swarzchild solution (or Kerr solution, for that matter) the stopwatch will take an infinite amount of time to reach the event horizon. Well, T < ∞, thus, in this frame of reference, the black hole evaporated before the stopwatch could reach it. Since changing the frame of reference can't change the outcome, the stopwatch can't have fallen into the black hole, in any frame of reference.  
What I concede is this: if you bring quantum mechanics into the table, things could quantum tunnel into a black hole. Well, depending which of the many quantum gravity theories ends up being right, this might as well be true (we don't really know at this point), but my point is: people take way to seriously this notion of things falling into a black hole purely on a GR + Hawking radiation framework, and I can't see how that is possible."

I've similarly heard that you need to derive your sense of purpose and identity from something unrelated to other people—usually your career, an artistic pursuit, a love of travel, a goal for your living situation, etc. These are the ways to be ""healthy,"" and if you rely on another person for a sense of purpose or identity, you're ""unhealthy.""

I just don't think this is true. LOTS of people are hugely motivated by their social connections, in particular their relationship to a primary partner or family. Lots of people find their greatest satisfaction in life through nurturing, or through building strong connections with others. Why would it be that you're supposed to be totally happy and content alone, and that's the only way to be healthy? That sounds like some late-capitalistic BS intended to further isolate us and make us more interested in career/productivity than the normal things that make us human, like social connections. So...

Please bear with me here, as I do not know if I will articulate this well. This may come across as some incel sh\*t, but believe you me, I don't buy their garbage.

I (male), am a young law student and am in one of the best situations I could be in right now. I am tall, conventionally attractive, come from a stable family and socioeconomic background, maintain excellent hygiene, have a great fashion sense, go to the gym 3 to 5 times a week, cook for myself 2-4 times a week, have a myriad of hobbies with a tangible productive output, and have plenty of friends. I would not give up what I have now for the world. I have clearly defined goals for myself and my career, in both the short and long term. For example, I want to be able to deadlift 315lbs by the summer, and have all of the N4 JLPT grammar and Kanji memorized by July, whereas in the future, I want to work in either a large-scale corporate law firm or in a policymaking think tank. I am known as someone who wears his heart on his sleeve. At my best, people know me as someone who's smart, reliable, decisive, helpful, generous, and energizing to be around. At my worst, I can be aggressive, rude, condescending, and cutting. I have been told that while I am great at arguing any point regardless of my own views, I detach myself from the views I argue so well that I forget that I am arguing with another person. This has led to some unfortunate circumstances, but I am actively working to make it clear that no argument of mine is a personal attack against another.

A few years ago, I had Covid, and the week after, I lost one of my best friends to an accidental death. It was devastating, but I kept my head held high and pushed on for his sake and mine. It was one of my most successful semesters academically, despite everything. I know he'd be proud of me. That summer, I had a job at a fast-food restaurant because Study Abroad fell through. That gave me perspective about how a person can be alive without truly living. I saw the hours it took for regular folks to make it. I learned that I have it good, and that I cannot let my privilege and opportunities offered to me go to waste. I have to succeed. There is no other option.

When it comes to dating and relationships, I have had both success and failures. I've had some regrets which I have learned from. Don't baby people and solve their problems for them; gently guide them in the right direction. Separate yourself from people who cling too tightly to you, or they'll never grow.  I even had a great relationship last year that showed me how good things can be, despite how things ended. 

But now that you have a picture of who I am, here's my big CMV. When I face rejection from someone, I feel like it is a personal attack on who I am. I have joked with my friends that, ""The problem I have talking to women is that the first thing I do is print my resume."" Everything I have done I have actively worked to achieve. It may have taken me some time, but I have put in the work to improve myself, both personally and academically. So, why doesn't it work with dating and relationships? I am exactly the person who I want to be right now, and where I want to be as well. So, when someone rejects me, I feel that I am being told that I am not good enough. But, everything that I have done, the people around me, and my inner self know for certain that I am good enough. I don't have any issues with internal validation. I don't feel inadequate, but I feel that people misappraise me. Why am I not valued for the things I do? 

&#x200B;

So, then. Change my view. I want to know what I am doing wrong. If I am not who I want to be now, then I want to be the best person I can be. I don't want to feel personally slighted by romantic rejection anymore. Hopefully this doesn't sound like mindless, slobbering gibberish and you all have a clear picture of who I am and what I am looking for here."
84,2024-03-19,CMV: Prisons should not be for revenge or torture.,u/mika_running,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1biwc6b/cmv_prisons_should_not_be_for_revenge_or_torture/,changemyview,"I constantly see people here talking about how criminals deserve torture (e.g., his balls should be cut off), the death penalty , or the far too common prison rape jokes (e.g., ""I hope this guy drops the soap in front of Bubba""). I get that this is an emotional subject and many of these such replies may just be trolls or attempts at humour, but let's try to divorce ourselves from emotion and humour for a moment to think about the role prisons should play in a civilised society.  
In a civilised society, prisons should be for three things only, in this order:  
1) For public safety - keep the person isolated from society if they are a genuine risk to specific individuals or wider society  
2) As a deterrent - To discourage other people from committing crimes because they may get caught and face punishment.  
3) For rehabilitation - To help criminals fix their problems and become functioning members of society again  
Expanding upon each of these:  
1)   
Everyone to a certain degree is a risk to public safety, so this threat level would have to be well above the threat level of the average person. So someone who is a psychopath and convicted serial murderer definitely is a threat to society and it would be justified holding him in prison for as long as he was a risk, possibly for life. However, for passion crimes (e.g., a man catches his wife cheating and kills her in the heat of the moment) the criminal most likely isn't a risk far beyond the average person. Treat people as innocent until proven guilty as much as possible; just because someone has an anger problem doesn't mean he will kill. Only in cases where the problem is extremely serious should this be cause to hold the criminal behind bars (for as long as the problem exists at that level of severity). Ideally criminals who are serious risk factors would be rehabilitated over time (see 3)  
2) A deterrent is necessary to discourage criminals from committing crimes. The deterrent function should be for as little time necessary to get the proper effect, and should be supported by academic or reputable research studies. So if a 10 and 20 year prison sentence make little difference in deterrence factor, the 10 year sentence should be preferred, assuming the criminal is unlikely to be a threat to society when released (see 1). In cases where other deterrents are equally powerful (things like community service, fines, etc.) these should be considered over prison sentences.  
The fewer criminals in prison, the healthier society is. The crime is already done; it's a sunk cost. Regardless of how long we lock up a criminal for, there's no way to bring the person they killed back from the dead. As a society, we should try to reduce total harm, and thus should try to minimise the amount of time we keep people in prisons.  
Similarly, at a societal level, we should aim to deter crimes via better education, accessible mental health treatments, youth groups that keep children away from gangs and drugs, events in the community that help people to make friends and feel a part of society, etc. Prison should be the last resort; ideally, we should try to prevent the crime from occurring in the first place by making people feel happy, included, financially stable, mentally and physically healthy, etc.  
3) Prisons should be about making criminals better people so that they can emerge as functioning members of society and not go back to committing crimes. There has to be a balance between making prisons a place people don't want to go (the deterrent factor) and making prisons a place where people can better themselves (the rehabilitation factor). In general, the fact that the prisoner cannot leave is quite a punishment in itself; therefore, prisons should try to ensure that inmates are generally comfortable and happy, but not so happy that people would commit crimes to go to prison. It's a fine balance, but an environment full of gangs, prison rape, abuse (both from guards and prisoners), etc. is not a healthy environment for anyone, and it just turns small criminals into hardened ones. Give prisoners something that is essentially a small motel room, with carpet, some form of entertainment, their own toilet and shower, a comfortable bed, visits from family and friends from time to time. Prisoners should have access to therapists, educational materials, job training, creative outlets, to help them become better individuals who have a chance of turning their life around once they get out.  
Once criminals are deemed no longer a threat and have served their time, they should be returned to society and should be able to live a normal life as a free person. Crimes should not follow criminals forever. People should not be able to easily find out about a criminal's past (e.g., sex offender registries) because that's in the past. If it's still a huge risk, it could be part of a parole condition (e.g., a sex offender couldn't live next to a school) but this should be between the police and the criminal, not public knowledge, as all that does is lead to vigilante justice, discrimination, and difficulties for people who are still presumed guilty due to their former crimes.  
Similarly, employers should not be allow to ask blanket questions about your criminal history or run checks on employees except for things directly relevant to the job. So a bank could check for criminal charges around embezzlement, a primary school could check for child abuse charges, and so on, but no one should be able to just check whether any felony has been committed. All this does is makes it nearly impossible for criminals to become integrated into society again, making them move likely to turn to illegal means to survive. Give people a chance to turn their lives around and perhaps they will.

758,2024-03-19,"CMV: Progressives often sound like conservatives when it comes to ""incels""—characterizing the whole group by its extremists, insisting on a ""bootstrap mentality"" of self-improvement, framing issues in terms of ""entitlement,"" and generally refusing to consider larger systemic forces.",u/Sbis31,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1biwpvb/cmv_progressives_often_sound_like_conservatives/,changemyview,"Married guy here. Happy relationship, sexually satisfied, father to a compassionate son, and I find fulfillment in my career.

I don't have a personal stake in the ""Incel Debates,"" but I do know a few loved ones who fit the term and I do spend way too much on the internet readings posts and articles discussing the topic.

Now, nothing in this post is intended to deny the reality that some incels are absolutely shitty people. I would say that I know four younger men who fall into this category and one of them (my youngest brother, actually) is someone I am deeply concerned for as he is now genuinely consumed with bitterness towards the world and women. However, the other three are genuinely great guys. They aren't 9s or 10s pulling down $200k while flexing their six-packs, but they're solid. **I'll put it this way:** I met my wife, dated, and got married in the late 2000s—before the rise of dating apps and the death of Third Spaces. ***If any of these three guys had been single during those years, they would have easily been able to strike up relationships.*** 

And yet I've seen these guys 1) get unfairly tagged with the ""incel"" label and its stigma and 2) listened to their sincere emotional pain over having very few outlets for discussing the loneliness and relational hardships they face. That's really what has prompted this post.

So as someone who grew up in a deeply conservative Southern community and left it for more progressive communities, why am I seeing so many ""conservative"" arguments made in attacking single men who feel like the deck is stacked against them?

**Someone CMV because what I'm seeing is:**

* ""Incels are dangerous misogynists and even terrorists."" This sounds like my conservative hometown talking about Muslims after 9/11. When is judging a whole group by its worst elements ever justified?
* ""Incels should focus on improving themselves instead of complaining all the time—then they'd get dates."" This sounds like my conservative town talking about poor people. Is ""picking yourself up by the bootstraps"" ever the solution to something that is affecting millions of people?
* ""Incels feel like they are *entitled* to sex. No one is entitled to *my* body!"" This sounds like my conservative hometown decades ago when it fought against the end of segregation or today when they cheer for the dismantling of affirmative action. ""No one is *entitled* to a position in my company, so I don't have to hire gay people"" or ""No is *entitled* to admission to Harvard, so they should be free to only admit Whites and Asians.""
* ""Incels just have a victim mentality. No one is oppressing them."" This sounds like my conservative hometown refusing to acknowledge that it things like marginalization and systemic injustice don't rely on mustache-twirling cartoon villains—they come about and perpetuate themselves through our inaction and refusal to consider how even our seemingly benign actions could be causing harm to someone else."

AI and automation are taking millions of jobs. So what do we do to preserve the social order? REMOTE WORK AND NEW DEALSSSSS> 

1) Give NASA 750 billion to multiple trillion USD, and employ everyone who wants to be an engineer as an engineer. They can terraform Venus or something crazy with a budget like that. They'd also need support workers, designers, and manual laborers. 

2) Get rid of homeschooling and make teaching and all of education a remote job. This eliminates burnout for teachers as they can put students in ""detention"" electronically, and they don't need to deal with violence or rudeness. You can put more focus on learning and less focus on social interaction, which no offense can be more harmful than helpful. 

3) Make therapy for under 18 required (@5-7 sessions per year) and over 18 gets you tax cuts. Also eliminates bullying and bad influences. Also teaches people the responsibility to be careful of what they say over voice or text since everything is logged on servers. 

4) Repurpose school buildings to be homeless shelters and free food distribution centers. You want better living conditions get a job. You can take out a loan for a computer, WiFi access, and job training programs also available at the repurposed school buildings. If your loan amount is too high you are required to pay off the debt by working at the homeless shelter in addition to your training and job search. 

5) Privatize the hell out of everything, because whenever the feds get involved there is corruption. This will create jobs in contracts management and negotiation and law. 

6) Get the government THE FREK out of people's personal lives, EXCEPT if there is a victim. 

So what did we do? We created at least 30 million jobs. 4 million engineers,  10 million software engineers & IT (some at NASA, some at EdTech for software maintenance of virtual classroom), 5 million therapists, and the remaining 11 million support staff and curriculum developers. This would be MORE than enough to employ every citizen in the country and then some, even in the age of AI. On top of that, you eliminated bullying, violence, and misbehavior in schools while strengthening education. Furthermore, you improved quality of life for teachers and made their lives easier. Now they earn 50-80k remote with 3 months off a year and holidays. They also will have AI to do paperwork and other monotony like grading. Plus punishing a student is as easy as clicking a button, and if it happens enough they have to fail and repeat the class! The best part is repurposing schools to be homeless shelters so poor people have a place to sleep, use wifi, and eat. On top of that, they get free therapy and counseling to land jobs, and they can take out a loan for a computer and study materials. 

We should fight for remote work and for a NEW DEAL. If Republicans want my vote to support their privatization, how about fighting for this. How about implementing new deals. How about getting out of people's personal lives. How about taking a strong stance against discrimination.

1,2024-03-19,CMV: Many East Asian doctors are wildly arrogant,u/Other-Pipe1888,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bix0xf/cmv_many_east_asian_doctors_are_wildly_arrogant/,changemyview,"Mostly talking about those deeply steeped in their home culture and/or immigrants, for lack of a better term. Yes this is a gross generalization, but I'm trying to be honest in how I feel and to be clear, I hate that I have this view. No other demographic seems to yield this response in me: I've had fellow Latino doctors, white doctors, black doctors, some of whom are clearly also immigrants, as well as clearly ""American"" East Asian doctors (god I know that sounds terrible) and I've never had a bad experience with any of them. So it doesn't seem to be that they are ""East Asian"" itself, nor that they are an immigrant, nor that they are a doctor. Yet, combine those three characteristics together, and literally every single doctor I've had that matches those three factors has been incredibly rude, dismissive, and acting as though I'm the one being unreasonable for simply asking questions or wanting to be involved in my own healthcare. I should mention where I'm located is mostly white but there is a sizable minority of various Asian groups (East Asian being most sizable) and, perhaps unsurprisingly, a significantly overrepresented sample of them become doctors here. I'll also point out another potential flaw of mine and say I haven't had to go out of state for healthcare much, so it could also be a more specific local cultural thing (maybe a community reaction to bigotry? Which I'm not exactly helping atm), but frankly I wouldn't know.

Is it a cultural thing? Am I just expecting too much individualism? Laying my own cards on the table, as a Puerto Rican dude we obviously understand respect for our elders and professionals, but when discussing serious topics like cancer, chronic pain, etc., I feel entitled to have a say. And weirdly, the severity of the topic doesn't seem to matter, I end up feeling dismissed and ignored or outright hostile whether it's for a minor pain management issue or something as severe as cancer (which runs in the family and I have a lot of trauma with). Recently, my cousin (who has a lump deemed ""suspicious"" by another doctor and has been trying to get answers for MONTHS) was dismissed by a doctor with these characteristics, even refusing to give him an MRI and purposefully slowing the process because he ""didn't want to be involved in all of that"" before mentioning that he was going to dump us on a specialist...BUT WOULDN'T WRITE THE REFERRAL FOR WEEKS! The rationale? He's too young to have cancer. Well, as someone who lost a partner to cancer for the same reasoning when he was 6 years younger than my cousin, I know that is absolute bullshit. While I tried to be respectful I could tell this dude was intent on giving us the runaround, and unsurprisingly the doctor seemed utterly baffled and annoyed that I wouldn't accept 1 to 2 months as a reasonable timeframe for something already deemed suspicious via an ultrasound/prior care. It sounds just like he doesn't want to be involved in something that serious as a PCP (this is not my cousin's normal pcp, they were just overbooked and concerned about the lump so got him in with someone who's not his usual doctor).

I very nearly said shit that would normally make my own skin crawl and advised my cousin to get a second opinion immediately far away from here and with someone ""completely unlike"" that doctor. I didn't say racist shit, but I thought it and I cannot help but feel like dogshit about it. Again, if this were a one-off I would not feel this way but it is, without exaggeration, how every single experience with someone of those three characteristics has gone for me. So please, share your experiences, tell me why I'm wrong, and what am I missing here? Am I really expecting too much to be freaked out and demand prompt service for a serious issue like cancer?"

I’m referring to what I’ve seen in headlines throughout the years. Often regarding costumes.

Like the Moana Costume controversy back in 2017. Where Disney pulled the Moana costume from store shelves because of the uproar people had about it being Cultural Appropriation. 

Or like back in 2019 when there was uproar over Kim Kardashian calling her shapewear brand “Kimono”

Or the many other instances of people dressing up as various different cultures (Native Americans, etc) and there being uproars following it. 

When I was a kid I watched a lot of old westerns and I always loved the Native Americans. Seeing them on horseback, shooting bow and arrows, hearing their unique and awesome songscapes. I remember wanting to dress up as a Native American warrior for Halloween one year as a kid. I loved their culture. 

But there seems to be a widespread view that if you’re not actually a part of a particular culture, you should not engage with things from said culture (dressing up etc.). This is one thing I’ve never quite understood. As I said in my first sentence, I understand if you’re dressing up and purposefully trying to racially mock or put down a certain culture or group, but that’s not what I’ve seen these past few years, yet there still seems to be uproar around it. 

If a little girl loves the Moana movie and the culture shown in the movie and decides she wants to dress up as Moana for Halloween, I don’t see an issue with that. It seems like the greatest compliment, someone loves your culture so much they want to engage with it. But Disney was forced to remove the costume because of the amount of backlash. It seems like shouting people down and telling them they’re wrong for doing so, is doing more damage to that culture, than just letting people enjoy and admire the culture in different ways, such as dressing up for Halloween.

That’s just my opinion. If anyone has a counter or varying opinion I’d love to hear it.

AI is going to improve exponentially in the next 5 years. It will be able to act autonomously to do complex tasks. This will likely allow robots to do manual labor and allow online bots to take white collar jobs.

People say, ‘technology has always improved and people adapted’ and I understand that but this is different because what will be left for us if AI can do things autonomously? I haven’t seen anyone spell that out. And even if you could adapt somehow to this new world, this will likely take time to happen. If AI takes all of jobs in one big swoop, how can anyone have time to actually re-train?  

If ai can think and reason close to the level of humans then this will lead to massive job loss, and massively depress wages. With so many people out of work and unable to spend money this will lead to a depression, the likes of which no one has seen. 

The transition to ai hasn’t been thought out at all. We’re racing towards a cliff with no safety net. The government isn’t going to be able to keep up. It’s full of a bunch of octogenarians who don’t even know how to use Google and many of whom think Medicare should be abolished. What happened when there is 30% unemployment, 50% unemployment? 90% unemployment? I don’t know but if history has taught us anything it will, probably descent into chaos, civil strife and possibly war. 

There needs to serious regulation around AI and a plan in place for if massive job loss occurs because if they try to implement something after it’s already happened it will have been too late. "

The term Femcel refers to women and femme presenting individuals that are involuntarily celibate. Some definitions of Femcel vary as one says that a femcel doesn’t need to be celibate as they acknowledge it is easier as a woman to have sex, but a femcel being a woman or femme who has not been Able to get into a relationship. I will be talking about both of these definitions.

The main reason why I don’t think women can be incels is because typically when a woman is not in a relationship or goes a very long time without sex it is usually by her own choice. The role women typically play in modern dating dynamics is that of the pursued. Basically they just need to exist in a way to attract attention and boom, they have a dating life.

This is pretty easy to do as and it’s becoming easier as an increasing number of men are becoming more and more desperate, it’s no that difficult to find a partner.

I think this is a big difference between incels and femcels. Most involuntarily celibate men who aren’t misogynistic are willing to date or sleep with ANY woman. This is because we simply do not have the room to be choosy about how who date. Anyone being willing to date us is a blessing and we would be wrong to look that gift horse in the mouth.

The existence of a female incel is entirely up to choice. Even the definition being based off of dating rather than sex implies that. Women at their most desperate still have a level of choice. By that logic, femcels cannot be involuntarily celibate."

It has traditionally been understood that the Judiciary has the sole power to interpret the Constitution in a binding legal manner. I disagree. The Constitution states,

>""The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution...which...shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof."" 

I believe that the power to ""deem it necessary"" to ""propose Amendments"" implies that 2/3 of Congress has the power to determine what already is in the Constitution. Suppose Congress proposes an amendment stating, ""Women shall have no Constitutional right to an abortion."" Such a proposal would only *be* an amendment to the Constitution if women already had a Constitutional right to an abortion. By proposing such an amendment Congress would be overruling the decision in *Dobbs*.

Some people may argue that this doesn't make policy sense, or infringes on the separation of powers. I disagree. Congress's power to overrule the court does not leave Congress unchecked. If 3/4 of states ratify the amendment, then Congress's attempt to overrule the courts would be ineffectual. Moreover, 2/3 of Congress acting together already has Constitutional authority that would seemingly contradict the separation of powers. 2/3 of Congress can overrule a presidential veto, remove executive and judicial officials from office, and reinstate officials that engaged in insurrection. It's clear that the framers wanted super majorities to enjoy additional power that would be problematic to grant to mere majorities.

But yes it's a fact they will not be the same purity as they once were. Why would I want someone who's damaged. I need someone perfect. Your all going to say than you will die alone. If that's the path I am on than so be it. My life mission is to make others happy anyways. I know I will never be happy.

 I only take w's. Giving power to women makes me feel insecure because I don't have the control. 

Women don't know I exist because I don't have friends or anyone to talk to... not because I am bad socially. I used to have so many friends in high school (when I peaked). Yes... I am actively trying to fix this... just don't have the time or energy but still trying."
1,2024-03-20,CMV: You should not use group chats to plan group hangouts,u/CEO_Of_Rejection_99,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bj5h63/cmv_you_should_not_use_group_chats_to_plan_group/,changemyview,"Several people, including my parents and therapist, have recommended that I use group chats for planning group hangouts. However, I am very hesitant to create new group chats with friends.

My resistance to group chats begins in... middle school. I created so many group chats on Instagram, as in with every possible permutation of school friends materialized into group chat form. It got to the point where the number of group chats would be greater than the actual number of messages sent in these chats. And many of these chats were made for different stupid reasons, from circlejerking about a crush/someone I thought didn't like me (you know, anything immature middle school me would do) to just trying to get attention.

To this day, even 8 years later I am very hesitant to create any new group chats out of fear of coming off as too desperate and spammy. In fact, the only group chats I am in are ones for important stuff (band, classes, group projects, work) and more personal chats that my friends add me to.

I feel like a group chat for a casual outing such as lunch may be a little too excessive. It would require facilitating entirely new texting infrastructure (one more space in my list of chats), whereas I could coordinate the hangout individually among existing communication channels if I tried hard enough. I'm also worried about placing more pressure on other people due to the extra space a group chat would take up on someone else's phone. What is more pressurizing: seeing one line on your messaging app dedicated to me, and two lines on your messaging app: one dedicated to me only and one dedicated to a group chat WITH me?

Think of it like fixing traffic in a city. Let's say I have a few highly trafficked roads and I need to solve the traffic. What do I do? I could build a new highway, but building roads is a pain in the ass and there's no guarantee anyone will use it. People may not like the road and it may destroy properties and businesses, forcing them to go elsewhere. Building a new road requires planning, using a bunch of concrete and asphalt, and will take up space with all the traffic lanes and flyover ramps and everything. Plus, if I build a new road, then all the roads would be operating under capacity and I would need to pay more funds for maintanence without enough traffic to justify it. So what should I do? Instead, I add some turn lanes, maybe even public transit and bikes, and roundabouts, and hope the whole thing will sort itself out.

Now think of it like a set of shopping malls. Let's say I have 3 shopping malls in a town; they're all profiting and receiving a lot of customers. Now let's say I build one massive mega shopping mall. All of a sudden, all of the customers are flocking to this new mega mall, which is great for the mega mall, but bad for the other malls. Now the other malls just sit in the town abandoned whilst still having to be maintained, with not enough customer traffic to receive profit. This could have been avoided if customer traffic was concentrated in the smaller, more local malls instead of moving to the new mega mall.

Plus, there's no guarantee the group chat may be used forever. It may just be used for the one-time event, then be completely dry after that. So why go through the effort of setting up a one-time group chat when I could just communicate through individual texting channels and save digital resources?

Think of it as a one-time sporting event. Instead of using existing sporting venues in the city, I do all the work of building a massive sports stadium with lots of parking. The sporting event happens and the crowd is wild. But then, everyone eventually leaves. What happens to the stadium? It's just sitting there, never to be used again and wasting valuable land in the city. This could have been avoided if I just used the existing sports arena.

This is why I have been resistant to forming group chats with friends, aside from situations where I legitimately HAVE to form a group chat. I tend to see group chats as a waste of digital resources when I could achieve the same thing through individual messaging channels.

I would like to change this view since I'm seriously working on retooling my social skillset to be more conducive to group outings. I'm not sure if I can handle going back and forth between multiple messaging channels and being the manager of everything when I could make a group chat and everything would sort themselves out.

The night will still be there; you can think that it is daytime for twenty-four hours, but by your thinking it, it is not going to be light twenty-four hours a day. The negative is as much part of life as the positive. They balance each other.

The philosophy of positive thinking means being untruthful; it means being dishonest. It means seeing a certain thing and yet denying what you have seen; it means deceiving yourself and others.

Positive thinking is the only bullshit philosophy that America has contributed to human thought—nothing else. Dale Carnegie, Napoleon Hill, and the Christian priest, Vincent Peale—all these people have filled the whole American mind with this absolutely absurd idea of a positive philosophy. And it appeals particularly to mediocre minds. The very idea that you want to influence people is the idea of a salesman, and that’s what Dale Carnegie was—salesman turned philosopher.

The whole philosophy can be condensed into a simple sentence: if you want people to be influenced by you, just behave the way they think is the right way to behave. You prove to be their ideal, which they also want to be but have not been able to be yet. Of course, you cannot become anybody else’s ideal, but you can pretend. You will become a hypocrite. And if you are going to influence many people, then of course you will have to have many personalities, many masks, because each person is influenced by a different mask. You will have to continuously pretend that which you are not, and you will have to hide that which you are. Now this is what makes a man phony."

Next, introduce a divisive claim (true or not), like race, to portray oneself as a victim of injustice in this example. This tactic ensures continued relevance by courting controversy and sympathy, leading to pressure on the subject industry to accommodate their desires.

1,2024-03-20,CMV: The President and the Vice President of the United States should split the presidential authority,u/BackAlleySurgeon,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bj9zay/cmv_the_president_and_the_vice_president_of_the/,changemyview,"To be clear, I'm not saying Biden and Kamala should do this right now; no one voted for that ticket with the understanding they would do so. I'm saying that in a future election, say 2028, the presidential and vice presidential nominees should run on a platform where they agree to split their authority. This could be done Constitutionally; section 3 of the 25th amendment allows the president to determine that the VP should discharge his duties temporarily.

The reason I think this change should be made is that the president has too much power and responsibility, and the VP has basically no power and responsibility. These are the only two offices elected nationwide and it's bizarre to have one such office be nearly useless. The president currently controls basically all foreign relations, and the entirety of the executive power, and he nominates all the judges, and he signs or vetoes legislation (and is therefore very involved in the crafting of legislation). Further, he's an essential communicator with the press and the American people and he plays a vital role in his party leadership. It'd be rare for an individual to be good at all these things. I think the president should use section 3 of the 25th amendment to allow the VP to be the one in charge of signing legislation and nominating judicial officials. This would allow the president to focus on his executuve and foreign relations duties and, supposing the president picks an effective legislator as VP, it would support more effective legislating. Hell, as the president of the Senate, the VP would be able to do fulfill these roles even more effectively than the president. 

Most importantly, by separating these positions, voters can split blame. If a president is doing an effective job with foreign relations and criminal prosecutions, but people aren't happy with the legislation getting passed, voters can demand that the president take on a new running mate in the next election. If the legislation is going well, but the president is acting ineffectively as a leader, the VP can stay on the ticket and the president can get primaried."

Sometimes every idea. And the citations always include highly academic sources where appropriate, and journalistic sources for current events. This is the same standard that you would find in academic published papers. Actually, even papers in peer reviewed journals (nature for example) are reviewed by anonymous unpaid volunteers, which is similar to wikipedia. In every wikipedia page (especially contentious ones), there are people with different perspectives discussing and disagreeing, and constantly editing. I would not cite a wikipedia page but I would consider it similar to a literature review article, because it conveniently sumarises and compiles many relevant sources, so a wiki page is always a good starting point for reading a new topic.

Wikipedia gets more stigma than it deserves. To change my view, I challenge someone to send me an example of wikipedia misinformation (without creating it yourself). And even if you do find misinformation, we have to discuss whether the misinformation is more numerous than in peer reviewed published research. Even published research can contain mistakes and misinformation sometimes so there has to be a comparison. "

I had to go through a 4-year Physics degree from a third-world country relying exclusively on libgen and scihub.

The Matlab we used was cracked; everything we used was either pirated or FOSS, because that was all we could afford. The library couldn't afford journal subscriptions. We didn't even have proper lab equipment. (I eventually got to a university abroad, where I did have access to textbooks)

1,2024-03-20,CMV: extreme punishments for SA are a reason it goes unreported.,u/Ok_Lack_5705,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bjbjz3/cmv_extreme_punishments_for_sa_are_a_reason_it/,changemyview,"Very simply, there are people who don't want to see more people be hurt, and couldn't live with themselves knowing they're why someone is in prison. It's a lot of weight to put on someone to say ""if you report someone for this they will be imprisoned and be SA'd by other prisoners, potentially for years.""

 If you're not a vengeful person that's not something you're going to want to do. There is no lesser charge. There is no ""this person was aggressive and made me uncomfortable but I don't want anyone to hurt or imprison them."" There is no ""this person has never had any sex education and doesn't know what they're doing is wrong and I want to get them help."" I think this is especially relevant for teenagers. There is no ""this person is doing to me what an adult has been doing to them their whole childhood and they need help.""

As a victim you're stuck in the position of having to decide whether what someone did is worth them being killed or the same thing happening to them. There's no ""I'm okay but I fear this person could hurt other people and I think they need therapy or something to prevent that."" 

These sorts of things are seen as so horrible, regardless of context, that even the victims feelings are completely ignored for the sake of blind punishment. 

This is especially relevant in relationships, where someone really can't risk mentioning that their partner is being aggressive or not respecting boundaries without also risking that partner being seriously injured or killed by vigilantes who hear about it and don't care about context. 

This allows the situation to escalate to actual SA because the only options the victim has are to leave or to risk worse things happening to their partner. 

There is no ""I need help talking to my partner about these behaviors before this becomes something worse but I don't want them to get in trouble."" 

When victims bring up these concerns they're often told they're enabling abuse and allowing others to be hurt, so it's not an issue that's easy to discuss. The only course of action for a victim is to use the government to enact revenge on their abuser, and if that's not the solution they want? Then there's nothing.

Realistically there are 2 situations a buyers agent can provide value nowadays; one is for some first time homebuyers (26% of transactions), and the other is in complex transactions (foreclosures, tax deed auctions, short sales, etc.) and those only make up about 5% of all transactions. The other 64% of normal transactions can be handled by the buyer working with a RE Estate Attorney. RE Attorneys can provide assistance with Purchase Agreements, Mortgage Contracts, Closing Documents, etc. at a fraction of the cost.

The primary reason that buyers agents are still being utilized despite provide very little value relative to 20 years ago, is because of the broker compensation structure laid out by the NAR. As the buyer, I can either have the seller pay for my buyers agent, or allow the listing agent to gobble the commission from both sides of the transaction.

My understanding of this rule change makes it so the buyer can either pay their agent up front with cash even if there is no transaction (not likely to happen because in America we pay after services are rendered), pay their agent with cash after the transaction OR negotiate the payment as part of the loan amount (most likely to happen). That said, as a buyer with an agent that needs to get paid out of the sellers pocket as part of the deal, I am at a significant disadvantage against the buyer that isn’t using an agent because I need to factor an additional $25k into my offer to pay my agent.

I think what we’ll find is that buyers agents just aren’t worth the cost and loss of negotiation power for 64% of home buyers when you can hire a RE Attorney to help you through the transaction process from start to finish for a couple grand. I believe that long term either buyers agents will adjust their comp to remain competitive by charging fixed rates contingent upon transaction, or RE Attorneys will begin expanding their practices to fill the gaps."

Nobody is expected to spell out their entire sexually history if not asked, and the gender distribution of that sexual history should make no difference.  
Framing the disclosure of bisexuality as a moral obligation fuels harmful stereotypes, like infidelity or bisexuality being a 'phase.' This expectation not only stigmatizes bisexuality but also misunderstands it as something alarming, instead of a normal aspect of human diversity.  
Arguments demanding disclosure often rely on homophobia and myths about STIs, suggesting wrongly that bisexuals are riskier partners. This stance not only targets bisexuals unfairly but also stigmatizes STIs further, placing undue responsibility on bisexual individuals and exacerbating their discrimination.  
If a woman “isn’t attracted to bisexual men” then she wouldn’t have sex with one, regardless of whether she knows he’s bisexual.

Macroevolution suggests that over thousands/millions of years, sufficient genetic differences are accumulated to the point where two populations that originally came from a common ancestor are no longer able to reproduce with each other. While I agree with this part, I believe that this fails to explain how organisms develop biological features like additional limbs.

Evolution suggests that differences in features arise through small mutations in the genetic code, which are passed down over time as they either aid the survival of the organism or are benign and do not affect the reproduction of the organism. If that is the case, then we should see (even today), animals and plants that are kind of ""halfway"" through this process, with features and appendages that may not be functional but do not necessarily affect the survival of the organism.

Same goes on with average men that wants a 9/10 or 10/10 woman who cook, clean, does what he wants, stays home and is virgin.

That is their right, the owe a relationship to no one, BUT they can't complain. Nor can we blame them for it being ""too high"". If this person is not finding someone, that is because of their own limitations. I saw a lot of people (let's say hetero women for a better understanding, even if it goes for everyone) saying men are jerks because they won't go with her, while she only want the type of men described above. That triggers me everytime.... The exact same happens for people (let's say hetero men) who asks women to lower their standards because those are unrealistic.

I also think that you can have any preferences without it being labelled as hateful. By example, if you don't want to date black person, you're not racist. If you don't want to date short person, it shouldn't be considered offensive. I saw people being accused of being fatphobic because they didn't find fat (OBESE in this case) women appealing for a relation, and that is awful. Same goes on for a lot of other topics: transgenderism, money, bisexuality, broadly physical appearance, degree, etc, ...   Every preference is valid, even by example wanting a partner that drinks only lemon juice. That is that person's right.

Now, if that person complains about being alone, that's on them. If they exclude 99% of the population, they shouldn't complain about that 1% not wanting them, as they ALSO have preferences. And yes, if you are a tall, fit, beautiful and rich guy, you will be excluded by way many women as a poor, short, fat and ugly man. That is life. Therefore, as the short man depicted here, you can have as much criterias as the tall guys without having as much offers. But he shouldn't complain and put the fault on wome because he is alone, simply for he reason that he can either lower their standards, either work on him to develop his social skills or his look, either actually look for dates, on an app for example. There are people that don't want to work on them, don't want to lower their standards, and don't want to live alone, but they HAVE to make a choice. If they don't, they end up a lot of the time by putting their loneliness on the people they want because those people don't want to be with them.

Exeptionnal case: you can't work on you. By example if you have a disease. Then it's sad, but you can't say ""that's not my fault, i have a disease"" for people to find you attractive. If they don't want to be with you, that's it. You can't force them.

Just a last thing: it's not because beauty is partially a social construct that you should ignore it and make as if it isn't a valid criteria.

I think successfully seeking out sex always aligns you with societal consciousness such that it makes you a more normal and better person.


I think this is a pretty straightforward view. Some people say that having sex can make someone into a worse person but I don’t agree. Being a better person and a more normal person are identical things. I think engaging in the social interactions necessary to have sex leads to this improvement, and likewise the physical act of sex, although quite difficult, when performed successfully forcibly aligns you with the other person, and by extension with the society. 

I think any and all successful efforts to build social skills or meet more people in order to have sex have the effect of aligning someone more with society. Likewise the physical act of sex when successful will always align people more with society.

I do not consider nonconsensual acts to count, and while I think face to face commercial activity also aligns people, it doesn’t do so nearly as much, and as such I’m not counting paying for sex, because I don’t think it forcibly aligns people in the same way. "

1,2024-03-20,CMV: Explicit content creators (such as OF models) who stream on Twitch and Tiktok at the least permit and at the most promote grooming children for adult relationships,u/judo_panda,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bjileh/cmv_explicit_content_creators_such_as_of_models/,changemyview,"There is nothing wrong with sex work when it is between two consenting adults. And I understand the for sex workers that are content creators, your number of subscribers / viewers is the top priority for your method of business to flourish. That being said, whenever a model primarily uses platforms that are specifically most like Twitch and Tiktok, where there are virtually no barriers for teens to access and thus have large portions of their userbase being below adult age, then they knowingly and willingly groom minors into unhealthy relationships with them in the pursuit of more viewers and subscribers.   


It would be no different than handing out flyers (that don't show any nudity) for sex work (prostitution, stripe club, adult entertainment, etc) at a public park that has a playground. The model is in a public space (or in the above case, a public facing platform) that people of all ages have access to, and so is \*legally\* allowed to conduct their business barring any breach of decency laws / regulations. BUT, in these online spaces, they're able to develop parasocial and asymmetrical relationships with each one, influencing them until they're able to become a customer.   


My position is that most of these content creators may be against what is typically or classically considered sexually grooming children (developing or building trust, and an emotional connection with a child or young person so they can manipulate, exploit, and abuse them) AND that they in fact engage in the practice through these preferred methods and platforms of social media, either ignorantly (they do their ""best"" to restrict or limit access to their content for anyone under a specific age) or knowingly (they don't care as long as numbers go up, and it's up to either the children or parents of those children to not engage with their content).   


Going back to the public park example, I'd say most content creators that I'm talking about would be the ones throwing entire packs of flyers into the air at this public park / playground, and it's completely up to children or parents of those children to navigate around and ignore the advertisements, and completely unburden themselves of that responsibility for the chance of getting more views from potential future customers"

",u/mysteryman403,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bjjd5t/cmv_jobs_requiring_constant_physical_labour/,changemyview,"I don’t understand how people breaking their backs everyday, putting their bodies through hell, can get paid minimum wage. The future impact this sort of work has on your body after decades of wear and tear is astonishing. 

The medical bills and terminal pain that physical labourers experience in their old age is NOT worth getting paid minimum in their youth. Minimum wage is not worth the cost of the medical bills they will be experiencing in the future.

I have the opinion that people working on the loading dock and busting their butts deserve to be compensated the same as someone like a banker, a lawyer, or even a neurosceintist. It’s not fair that physical labourers get paid insanely less, but then also have to deal with expensive medical bills in the future. I can see why Lenin or Karl Marx had the opinions they had, it’s because their way of thinking is a lot more fair for **EVERYONE** . I can imagine people being against a communist system if they were born into privledge, and don’t want to share their wealth.

I happen to work at a loading dock for Walmart and this job is nothing like I expected. When you receive a job offer from the #1 company on the Fortune 500 list, you expect the job to be at least decently cushy, and to compensate well. That’s not the case. My co-workers recently informed me that we make the absolute bare-minimum income that they can legally pay us in this province. It’s a living heck hole in that loading dock area and most of my co-workers are at the bottom of society, barely scraping together a living. Tell me how the CEO can make millions of dollars while we’re working harder than him?! How does that make sense. This isn’t happening just with Walmart too, this is many billion dollar companies around the world.

I want to abolish the far-right economic system we have right now, and I want to bring in more aspects of communism. That doesn’t mean I want to be full communist but I do want workers to be compensated like it is a communist society. There is no way that you can tell me a banker works harder than I do, when I’m sweating my balls off carrying 50-100 lb boxes, **MY ENTIRE 6 HOUR SHIFT** . Professional athletes get paid millions for training everyday and there’s an argument that me and my co-workers are arguably putting our bodies through much much worse, but get compensated so much less. 

Lebron James makes $45 million a year. He plays roughly 100 games in a season (including playoffs), and each game is 48 minutes. 100 x 48 = 4800 minutes. 45 million / 4800min = $9374/minute.

$9375 x 60 min = $562,500/hour

That’s how much Lebron gets paid. Now let’s calculate how much I get paid per hour compared to him, and why don’t you capitalistic, fantastical economic ‘geniuses’ explain how that’s fair. Spoiler alert, #ITS NOT . But I digress. 

$15/562,500 x 100 = 0.00266%

**Let me say that again for the neoconservatists in the back** . My salary is 0.00266% of Lebrons. And all he does is throw a rubber ball through a metal ring… it’s complete bush league.

I’d like someone to argue against the fact that physical labour jobs need a LOT more compensation, and that a communist economic system is a lot more fair than a ‘free market’ one. I’m not saying we should be getting paid the exact same as Lebron James or a neuroscientist but it shouldn’t be anywhere near what it is now, and it frankly shouldn’t be anything past double our salary. Because there is no argument for them working double as hard as me, when I’m working as hard as I possibly can every day. I work so hard that I have been taking adhd pills from my coworkers every shift just to get through it. 

P.S. it’s funny that they call it a ‘free market economic system’ when I’m literally a slave to the system, sacrificing my youth and body for chump change. Us physical labourers are anything but free.

People are always assuming that because MMA is more violent and there is little to no rules in terms of striking, that means it’s more dangerous. They say stuff like “well boxing is just punching compared to all the kicking,kneeing, elbowing etc.”

What they fail to realize is that after every knockdown, you are given time to collect yourself, then get back into the fight… *seconds* after your brain was just about factory reset. You’ll see this happen multiple times in a fight. Whereas in MMA if you get knocked out, they jump on you and finish the job. It usually takes about 1-2 extra punches before the ref calls the fight (sometimes he calls if before they can even throw *any* extra punches). I am convinced that getting knocked out multiple times and continuing to fight is way more dangerous than this

1,2024-03-20,CMV: Societal Expectations and the Realities of Childbearing Lead to Unsustainable Birth Rates When Women Have Equal Decision Power,u/Excellent_Chest_5896,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bjl2w3/cmv_societal_expectations_and_the_realities_of/,changemyview,"The conversation around birth rates and women's autonomy in decision-making is complex and multifaceted. I've been observing a trend across the globe, where societies that empower women to have the same decision-making power as men regarding childbirth see a decline in birth rates, often falling below replacement levels. I believe several key factors contribute to this phenomenon, and I'm interested in hearing different viewpoints that might challenge or broaden my understanding.

1. Physical and Emotional Toll of Pregnancy: 

Pregnancy and childbirth are incredibly demanding on a woman's body, with potential long-term impacts such as stretch marks, changes in body shape, and sometimes incomplete recovery. The emotional and physical stress of carrying a baby, the risk of miscarriage, and the possibility of health issues at birth add layers of fear and anxiety. Even in the best-case scenarios where the baby is healthy and not overly fussy, the relentless demands of newborn care present a significant challenge. This is the reality for just one child, whereas maintaining replacement levels theoretically requires at least two children per couple.

2. Long-term Commitment to Childrearing:

 Beyond the initial stages, raising children involves years of constant care, financial investment in childcare, education, and extracurricular activities, not to mention the day-to-day expenses of food, clothing, and healthcare. This ongoing commitment requires a substantial amount of time, energy, and resources which come at the expense of having a higher quality of life possible otherwise. 

3. Modern Economic Pressures:

 In today's economic climate, the expectation for women to contribute financially to the household has become the norm. Balancing work and family life becomes an even more daunting task, leading many to prioritize career and personal development over having multiple children. This economic dynamic, coupled with the desire for a certain quality of life, often results in the decision to have fewer children.

4. Role of Men in Family Dynamics:

 While men are increasingly expected to share in domestic responsibilities and childcare, the reality often falls short due to the demands of full-time work and traditional gender roles that still prevail in many societies. This imbalance can place additional pressure on women, further complicating the decision-making process around having more children. But even with a full engagement of men, there simply isn’t a way to make bearing children an equal burden for most of families, given physical nature of the process. 


In presenting these points, my intention is not to critique the changing roles of women or the dynamics of modern family life but to highlight contributing factors to the demographic trend of declining birth rates. This trend raises critical questions about the sustainability of current societal models, the future of the workforce, and the implications for social welfare systems.

As a man, I don’t think I’d consider having kids, if a uch was the natural way for above reasons.

3,2024-03-20,CMV: Flattening teacher salary schedule would significantly help with teacher retention.,u/testrail,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bjq67p/cmv_flattening_teacher_salary_schedule_would/,changemyview,"Admittedly I am not an educator. I'm a guy whose been corporate in my entire career for over a decade. My wife has been on a teachers contract her entire career. She's been in 3 different districts due to us moving, and I've always been dumbfounded at the salary structure and the perverse incentives it creates.

I recently stumbled across interesting information, that 7% of schools are now on 4 day school weeks in the US, as a way to attract educators to their schools without compensating them more. It seems there's potentially some clear unintended consequences for this method of retention.

Another thing I came across recently was the Salary Needed to Live Comfortably report, which is based off MIT's Living Wage Calculator, which shows that many teachers don't achieve living wages until about year 20.

Anyways, putting all this together, I'm left wondering if you increase retention if you changed the currently salary structure. It seems actually paying anything close to what they deserve is a pipe dream at best, so I'm left with more ""creative"" solutions. If you look at a salary schedule for a school district, you'll see based on experience level (step) and education level, an two educators can teach the same class with the same class size and be paid 150%+ different. (For my wife's school $38K vs. $100K). This is massively different different than the private sector, which typically only span a 40% band based on the same parameters for the same job role.

The issue I see is that an educator can be well into a decade of there 35 year career and still not achieve a livable wage. Over the course of a career, that individual will have earned $2.5M in today's dollars (COLA's not included), but it's significantly back weighted. At the 15 year mark, they'll have worked 43% of your career, but only earn about 30%-35% of their career salary.

In practical terms, this means you spend the entirety of your 20's - mid 30's not earning a living wage. This means you're not able to get on the property ladder. Not make any investments and experience any compound interest. You're forced to make difficult choices about family planning, etc. Eventually around the age of 50 you'll start earning more, but you'll lose out on all the above.

What if, instead of this significant back weighting you flatten the structure. Have a ramp up from years 0 - 5, then just pay the median salary of career earnings out from years 6 - 35. Meaning beginning in your late 20's, you'd achieve that living wage of ~$75K annually. Then the pay changes based on a COLA, and less on a step basis. You'd be able to reasonably get into a property ladder, and potentially put some of that money to work for you.

My thinking is, you see significant attrition of educators by year five. They burnout and go do something else. Part of the allure of that is that they can find an entry level job in the private sector that compensates as much as a 5 year educator fairly trivially. It would be significantly more difficult to replace that compensation of the median career earnings. Thus create a pair of golden (or at least bronze) handcuffs.

What do you all think? Is there something I'm missing?"

Either A. They will call me an idiot and tell me that I'm not worth the effort. (Cop-out) or B. They will just say that what they said is true because ""everyone knows it's true"" or some version of that statement. 

I like to bring facts and data into a debate because it seems that the person with more evidence on their side is the correct one, yet whenever I bring up these facts conservatives will brush them aside and just tell me that I'm wrong, despite the evidence.

Recently I was talking about the fact that migrants commit less crimes than citizens and despite all the facts and data all that was brushed aside for feelings.

They can't be trusted to handle anything or be able to hold any sort of infrastructure without going berserk or getting out of hand.

Their goal is to eradicate Israel. Israel's goal isn't to eradicate Palestine or else they would've already been dust. Like yes, both have been brutal to each other in history, but Israel can at least govern themselves and is way more qualified to govern over Gaza than Palestine right now. I'm not claiming that Israel has anymore sovereignty over Palestine in regards to Gaza, but for Palestine to act like they do in the present moment is just lunacy.

Palestine didn't claim sovereignty over Gaza before the war in 1948-49, so they have no legal claim to the territory.

Secondly, they literally turned down the partition that WOULD HAVE granted them sovereignty over both Gaza/West Bank, but denied it because of greed. They constantly engage with Israel, constantly lose, and now their back is against the wall and they're playing victim and acting as if they deserve all territory.

You can try to say it's ""illegal"", but the areas are *disputed*, not *occupied*. Once again, Palestine has no sovereignty or legal basis to claim either territory as *occupied*.

You can bring up the bombings, but it's not as if Israel is targeting civilians, it's war, and civilians are going to die. Hamas pulled the *Ferdinand Assassination* (not literally, but same cause and effect) and then Palestine acted like they were surprised when Israel retaliated.

It's also not ""illegal"" to not provide Palestine with basic resources. At most, this is only *unethical* (debatable), not *illegal.* The risk that enemy forces will appropriate civilian aid is a completely valid and legal basis for which to refuse aid in Gaza. Using human shields is illegal though, but guess what, unless someone actually enforces violations of international law, it really won't change anything. 

""International law"" being enforced will not change anything. There will not be any peace deals made because of someone stepping in because someone broke international law. This argument is usually given by someone who doesn't know much about what's going on, but instead refutes to MSM headlines to formulate their opinion on an ongoing affair.

Lastly, refusing to surrender isn't going to make them friends with Israel, so I'm not sure what they think they are gaining by continuing to engage in this war."

Most people are doing significant self improvement to get people to be attracted to them. It's natural. So imagine, you're a person who is constantly being told you're not good enough despite following people telling you how to improve that is fruitless and you seek a reason why. That's when people do searching and find incel communities and lots are very toxic.

So I know people will say that ""you wouldn't become an incel if you weren't misogynistic"" and I'd simply ask this; are there no men in relationships or otherwise incredibly good with women that aren't misogynistic? Of course, yes there are. So why  are they not incels. I know this is a controversial to say, but misogyny isn't that big of a turn off to lots of women, enough women that being a misogynist isn't going to severely impede your ability to get laid or get a girlfriend. I mean go to your average frat house. They certainly aren't bastions of respect for women. You can't tell me that men who do becomes incels are just inherently misogynist. 

The issue is that whatever good qualities they have just aren't good enough to outweigh the bad qualities, possibly including any problematic views on women. It's the incel communities that spread lies and toxicity that radicalize them to become so misogynistic that now any chance they had is gone.

I know there have been other people on here who have ranted about this, this is quite an old topic I KNOW but I wish to give my piece on it.  
  
So from NRS they simply made Bi-Han to be evil so he could a conniving power hungry man who wants to take over earthrealm with no redeeming qualities, which ruins his character. It ruins his character because it ultimately will set in people's perception on Bi-Hans character for a long time. Even way before all of this Bi-Han wasn't all that perfect he was a ruthless, heinous cold individual who killed without mercy.  
  
Yet despite all of that he still retained his humanity and redemptive qualites in the original timeline and NRS's first timeline. Bi-Han had honor to a degree, he loved his clan the Lin Kuei, he loved his brother Kuai Liang hell in Sub Zero mythologies he legit redeemed a netherrealm demon named Sareena from Quan Chi's grasp pretty much saving her. To top it off in the game Bi-Han even fended off the forces of Quan Chi and Shinnok from endangering Earthrealm which is quite an accomplishment for a mere mortal.  
  
When NRS annouced they would be revamping Bi-Han for the new game I was pleased because I felt like we were gonna see a decent adaptation of the ninja. But I was wrong they made Bi-Han to be this dickish, megalomaniacal, arragont and callous person which wasn't needed. I pray to God that NRS brings in Sareena and she uses her pussy power to bring back and redeem Bi-Han, but i feel like they're gonna kill him and make him into Noob Saibot

Pay for tap/utility water in other countries and get wicked diseases if you drink it (so you have to buy bottled water for even more) when in America you have safe to drink water.

Liberals tend to think right-wingers believe incoherent things because they are “crazy” or unintelligent. Everyone is entitled to their opinion… but I don’t find this convincing. 

Ideology and intelligence have no connection… otherwise, explain Nazi scientists and the countless other examples of highly intelligent people with reactionary beliefs. 

Instead I think on a whole right-wingers believe and say wild and incoherent things because it gives them a pretext for what they want. US liberals and conservatives more or less believe in logic and rule of law and individual rights and due process. The far right only believe in might makes right and hierarchy. “Owning” someone makes it true, repeating the same lies over and over until people have to talk about it makes it true.

And yes everyone - especially politicians - lies… but unlike liberals or conservatives I think right-wingers don’t see it as betraying a principle, just as a tactic. If what you want is for everyone to shut up and do what you want them to do… then a lie is totally justified for those ends.

By analogy, you need vitamin C to live, but you're not an obligate limey.  You can get it from other sources, and your body won't know the difference.

I don't have to know what nutrient balance it is cats get from meat to know that it's not *magical* nutrients.  If the right balance could be struck from other sources (and with time, money, and research I trust it could) cats could eat it.

Given that not every cat can eat every conventional food, a vegan diet that is 100% suitable for 100% of cats isn't a reasonable goal.  But a vegan food that is 75% suitable for 75% of cats?  We're probably already there.  To categorically state that a vegan diet that is 100% suitable for 75% of cats is impossible requires a belief that meat is magic."
1,2024-03-20,Cmv: selling intellectual property and still expecting royalties is greedy. ,u/GamblinOwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bjx42z/cmv_selling_intellectual_property_and_still/,changemyview,"Hi. 

I’m really looking for an explanation. This is something I’ve been looking into and am outraged by. But I was thinking maybe there is a facet of this I don’t understand. Hence I brought it here for a better understanding if you will and possible kind change. 

Qualifiers:

1. In bit against royalties in general. You make a song usually with other musicians and managers and split .003 cents every time it’s played? Fair enough. No complaints form me. That’s business. 

2. I’m not against hard work either. It deserves to be rewarded. Doesn’t always happen but it should… an artist puts in all this work in a song and says… I want $X dollars for it. Fair enough. Paid for your labor fair and square. 

What is baffling me is the way it’s evaluated price wise and the way it’s being “sold” or leased….percebtages. Conditions. 

There are billions of songs. That’s the market. Similar to any other product. Supply and demand. At its most basic. If an artists songs get hypothetically 10k streams or less each over a 10 year career, it’s a fair estimate to say future songs will fall in line with this estimation. That sets the value of the song. In actual dollars. If the artist has sentimental attachment to the song… they shouldn’t sell rights. At all is my current understanding. Keep it yourself and all the royalties. 

BUT if you open it to the market and it should be at a price that’s arguable in dollars. Not sentimentality. If your selling it, sell it. Be done. No other product works this way were the seller can yank back rights if the product becomes a success after sale. 

This type of thing I believe leads to the creation of ai bots. A way to create a buisness in music that is definite for non musicians. You pay the ai and done. The song is yours. 

What i am looking to have my mind changed on… is what makes it acceptable to sell a product and then yank back ownership when it suits you? "

I grew up always knowing this, but I was confused why my mom seemed particularly ashamed of the fact that one of her ancestors owned slaves. 

The matter came up in conversation recently and some peers were kind of astonished that this isn’t something I feel a need to “make right,” or feel really anything about whatsoever. My ancestors owning slaves is a statement of basic fact that I don’t feel any real connection to whatsoever.

The idea that I’d even consider this to have any connection to or influence over my life is frankly absurd to me. One of my friends was even saying how like his brother in law or something found and reached out to descendants of slaves his family owns, I can’t even bring myself to explain the violations of privacy and just general pointlessness I see in this action. 

I am going to make the following general statements, which I hold to be true, to help clarify some things. The first two shouldn’t need clarification but I don’t want to have to type them out later:

1. My ancestors committed a horrible crime.

2. Slavery is evil. 

3. Modern black people in America suffer from lingering effects of centuries of slavery. 

4. “Slaves” is plural in the post, we are talking about a lot of slaves. This was a southern aristocratic family whose name is on the constitution, several people have Wikipedia articles and were involved in state government. Big time slave owners. 

As for why I don’t care: I cannot point to any direct influence this has had on my life. As far as I am aware, my specific lineage was disinherited. I grew up in a rather typical middle class family. The slave owners’ nonexistent influence over my life obviously dwarfs the influence I ever had over their actions. 


If one could assign an exact dollar amount to which I have benefited then I’d be willing to have a more serious inquiry into whether I owe anything to anybody. Any “debt” I have is basically completely speculative, and I really emphatically doubt any action on my end would ever be viewed as a complete atonement anyway. 

Moreover, I really doubt that anyone’s lineage is really completely perfectly morally upstanding by modern standards if you start going back 5 generations anyway. Two wrongs don’t make a right, but the history of mankind is really a history of oppression and exploitation. I don’t view this as anything terribly different than what groups have done, or would have gladly done if given the chance, throughout all of human history. "

If moderators truly want compensation and think they deserve it, they should just leave and let Reddit crumble.

However I think they know that if they leave nothing changes and some new mods will take their place.

If there are any mods that think they should be compensated, they are not there for the good of the sub. If someone really cared about an open community, they wouldn’t really care about compensation. Therefore they should resign and let someone who’s more keen to take over.

Let's start:
1. A prime argument of the trans movement is genitals don't define gender. So why let it define gender by changing it?
2. From what I've read, MtF surgery is costly and very poorly done in regards to any sexual functionality (compared to an intact penis or a natural vagina).
3. In addition to point 2, I've read trans vaginas (correct me on terminology if needed) are often a nightmare and require consistent care and cause complications. 
4. The concern of being able to find a partner is moot because either, they are cool with you being trans or they aren't. Haven't seen a large case for ""I'd be with you but only post bottom transition"" rather people are accepting or they aren't.

I am also posting this here as well because I am interested in hearing from people who disagree and/or perceive what I am saying to be inaccurate or outright false.)

To preface this, I am referring to the kids that know exactly what they are doing. Not a four year old child that heard a swear word for the first time in their entire life and tried to repeat it not even knowing or understanding the word that they are trying to say.

I remember seeing a Twitter video a long time ago of an adult that was walking down the street and a group of kids were swearing at this adult and threatening to beat this person up. The adult felt disrespected and antagonized and consequently responded by at first attempting to ignore it and then swearing back at the kids. 

Another adult noticed this and jumped to the defense of the children by not only cursing at the adult and telling the adult “they’re just kids” and attempting to reprimand the adult for cursing back at them rather than “leading by example” (which is hypocritical for one because he was literally doing to this adult what he was attempting to reprimand them for doing to these kids) but threatening to beat their ass. In front of these kids.

And the kids were literally laughing at this adult knowing exactly what they were doing while this person was being yelled at all.

I think that’s bullshit. 

I’ve seen it happen online too. A group of Stan accounts will gang up and antagonize someone for not liking their favorite pop star and if that person is clearly an adult and attempts to defend themselves or talk shit back, they they’ll be like “I’m only 14 bitch, get a life loser! You’re fucking arguing with a 14 year old you [insert obscenity of choice]!”

And I think that’s bullshit.

I remember seeing another video of a grown man that was trying get to his destination and a random kid was following him and antagonizing him and trying to physically harm him. The grown man pushed the kid down in retaliation and the kid started crying and screaming like he didn’t start that entire interaction and wasn’t following the guy kicking at him and putting his hands on him and shit.

Some people were in the comments like “it’s just a kid! He’s a grown ass man!”

So if a kid is 17 and 364 days old and doing what I described in the op, it will only be “okay” to curse back at them in exactly 24 hours from that day? 

Lul.

I find that mentality ridiculous.

Because these kids know exactly what they are doing. Shit that they shouldn’t be doing and saying, and then utilizing their age as a safeguard because they know that some people will give them a “pass” or try to defend them simply because of their age alone.

I’ve even seen people do that with kids that commit violent crimes against elderly people. Kids beating the shit out of their grandmother because their grandmother did not allow them to go out after dark.

Kids that will say hurtful shit to their parents like “I hate you and hope that you die!” because they didn’t get their way and you’re just supposed to pretend that shit doesn’t hurt you as a parent  because “they’re just kids”? 

So essentially if you’re a kid you get a pass to say some of the most hurtful, disrespectful shit ever and do the most unruly shit because “kids will be kids”. 

Lul.

I’ve seen kids mock their mother for being an abusive victim and use it as “ammo” for hurtful shit they can say to their mother whenever they don’t get their way. Shit like “that’s why daddy beat you!” So I guess the mother isn’t “allowed” to feel negatively, resentful, or outright hatred towards their child simply because little Timmy is “just a kid” and “just upset”.

Because that makes it “okay”. Even if he knew exactly what he was saying and said it for the sole purpose of hurting his mother, right? 

ROFL.

I highly doubt that I will ever change my view because I have experienced a lot of what I discussed above personally but I am curious to see if anyone has something to say that I never thought about before and am open to discussion because I would like to understand why people who have this mentality are like this and propagate this notion.

3,2024-03-21,CMV: Police do not make us safer in the US,u/Heidelburg_TUN,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bk0u4b/cmv_police_do_not_make_us_safer_in_the_us/,changemyview,"The idea of policing that you’re taught as a kid is that police are there to protect average citizens from people who want to hurt them. They’re the “good guys” who fight the “bad guys”. They’re essentially superheroes, as far as this description is concerned.

This contrasts with the bleak reality of modern American policing. Police do not make us more safe, plain and simple. There are plenty of ways to argue this. First of all, there’s little evidence to suggest that increased police presence in an area consistently correlates with a decrease of violent crime. Generally speaking, the best way to reduce crime rates is to address the things that create conditions for crime, such as poverty, food insecurity, oppression, etc.

Second of all, police present a very real danger to a lot of Americans. There are estimates that 250,000 people are injured by police each year, and around 600 people are killed by police each year. (https://policeepi.uic.edu/u-s-data-on-police-shootings-and-violence/). Despite these numbers, it is very rare for police to actually be prosecuted for crimes, with many officers remaining in their positions afterwards.

Beyond the threat of physical violence, police routinely violate Americans’ constitutional rights. They do this through unreasonable searches and seizures, through unlawful interrogations, by unlawfully detaining people, and plenty of other despicable conduct. 

Finally, the police are not good at actually solving crimes once they do occur. As an example, murder solve rates are at record lows for the US right now, with just over half of all murder cases going unsolved. This is very low compared to other industrialized nations. Moreover, murder is one of the crimes that tends to have a high solve rate, due to how seriously it is taken by the justice system. Odds are that if you have something stolen from you, or you’re assaulted physically or sexually, the police either won’t be able to help you or just won’t even try.

So to recap: the US police do not in and of themselves reduce crime rates, they are not good at solving crimes, and they put many people in danger every year, and violate the constitutional rights of many more. 

I believe that the police as they currently exist should be abolished, and that public law enforcement should be completely re-thought in a way that creates higher expectations for police and actually makes life safer for the average person."
1,2024-03-21,CMV: The Kansas City Chiefs Should Stop Doing the Tomahawk Chop,u/Heidelburg_TUN,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bk28ub/cmv_the_kansas_city_chiefs_should_stop_doing_the/,changemyview,"I should say off the bat that I'm a Chiefs fan and that I have been one my whole life. Also, while I do believe that no one should be doing this chant, I'm speaking specifically from my perspective as a Chiefs fan who has been to many games, since I don't know much about what the Braves or Seminoles do.

We gotta get rid of this thing man. I don't know how I personally feel about our name and branding co-opting native imagery, because I think that's a bit more subjective and not as obviously offensive, but the tomahawk chop is just very plainly not cool.

It's not based on any actual native american ""chant"" in existence. It's very clearly just a non-specific imitation of what native american ""chanting"" sounds like to a non-native. It comes from the same place as imitating chinese language by saying ""ching chong"". It's ignorant and offensive, and pretty blatantly so.

Before anyone tries to argue ""tradition"", it doesn't exactly have a long history, as far as anyone can tell it originated with the Florida State marching band in the 1980's, and the Chiefs and Braves adopted it in the early 90's. We're talking about a ""tradition"" younger than my parents. Crucially, the Chiefs didn't even create it, and the franchise existed for 3 decades before they started using it.

Now I want to be clear, I don't think that the people doing the chop are all trying to insult native people when they do it. I think they're trying to express support for a team that they love. But the effects are the same, every time the Chiefs play, you have to listen to a racist chant before the game starts. 

It'd be one thing if it were just the fans, but the organization explicitly supports it. We have a fuckin drum in the stadium, and we invite celebrities to come bang on it, so before every home game, Rob Riggle or whoever shows up and hits the drum and they play the tomahawk chop music. I think they call it ""the charge"" nowadays. At the very least, the organization has to stop doing the chant before every game.

As far as the fans go: look, I get it. I grew up doing the chop myself, because I was a kid and I didn't think about it as a negative thing. For a lot of people, it's a fun thing that we do that no other NFL team has, similar to the Vikings' Skol thing. But we already have something like that. At the end of the national anthem, when they sing the line ""and the home of the brave"", the fans yell ""CHIEFS"" over the word ""brave"". I know some people think it's disrespecting the anthem or whatever, I don't care, I disagree, and I think it's dope.

Ultimately, the chant is pretty blatantly racist and that should be reason enough for both the organization and the fans to stop doing it."
673,2024-03-21,CMV: Netanyahu Never wanted Peace,u/HourDrive1510,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bk2irj/cmv_netanyahu_never_wanted_peace/,changemyview,"\>!DISCLAIMER: This post is only a conversation with the decent people left within our society who just want peace.!<

  
So the Prime minster of israel, and the rest of his extremist cabinet, just want the war to rage on, as long as they get their paychecks, and as long as the people they dislike are dying. Doesn't matter if it's at the cost of kids, elderly, pregnant women, hostages.. They just pretend to have a mission.  
So let's talk about the supposed mission of ""Eliminating Hamas""  
The israeli gov will claim they are only targeting Hamas..  
But, for years, Netanyahu was reported to be helping fund Hamas (as per [TimesOfIsrael](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/) & [NyTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/10/world/middleeast/israel-qatar-money-prop-up-hamas.html)), and in 2019, He himself said and i [quote](https://twitter.com/haaretzcom/status/1711329340804186619?lang=en); ""Whoever wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state needs to support the strengthening and financing of Hamas.""  
On top of that, The current finance minister of israel, said in 2015 and i [quote](https://twitter.com/rulajebreal/status/1720923597873549554) ""Hamas at this point, in my opinion, is an asset.""  
So how can you eliminate your asset?  
Here's the government strategy;  
Keep Hamas in power. Offer anything except a sovereign Palestinian state ""for security reasons"", and disrupt any real effort for Peace ([Osslo accords](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/oslo-israel-reneged-colonial-palestine)). Ignore the illegal settlements ([condemned by the UN](https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15424.doc.htm)), and the killing of Palestinians in the israeli controlled West bank.  
Make life unbearable for Palestinians, Facilitate unemployment [conditions](https://www.btselem.org/gaza_strip/20190606_forced_unemployment), cut the water sources ([documented](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/11/the-occupation-of-water/)), introduce bills to control the [courts](https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-s-supreme-court-overturns-a-key-component-of-netanyahu-s-polarizing-judicial-overhaul-/7420408.html), destroying the biggest buildings in Gaza to displace civilians, killing and arresting civilians who protest or show any contempt of past actions, Hamas attacks you, literally do whatever you want (Defending yourself).  
5 months after Oct the 7th, Gaza flattened, at least 30k civilians dead (most are women and children as reported by the pentagon), israel killed more hostages than released, Hamas still around.  
The goal was clear, even before Oct the 7th, they never wanted Peace, or a Palestinian state.  
2023 was reported to be the deadliest year in the history of the West bank. It got to the point where Biden himself had put a ban on individuals committing atrocities there, and that's not mentioning the uncontrolled army killings, because they see no consequences, they act as if the Palestinian lives do not matter.  
As cited in South Africa's [case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOW_1exsHE8), the army led by Netanyahu believe everyone in Gaza is complicit, as Netanyahu cited the biblical term ""Amalek"" at the beginning of the offensive on Gaza, he said ""Remember what the Amalek has done to you.""  
The biblical scripture regarding Amalekites reads ""I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel. Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.'  
The IDF soldiers later filmed themselves shouting ""There are no innocent civilians"". They also have filmed themselves celebrating destruction, burning aid, looting homes, posing in women's underwear, mocking traumatized people, the list goes on..  
Currently, famine is looming on many in Gaza, as reports confirm israel have been blocking aid to the entire north, for three month, till two days ago, when they got pressured into letting 13 trucks in, which is way short of what is needed (500 trucks per day as estimated by UN).

  
Earlier this week, The US Senator Chris Van Hollen admits after crafting the national security memorandum, and after the reports, that israel is not in compliance with international law, they are blocking aid such as maternity kits, water purifiers, from entering the Gaza strip, sending back a lot of the of trucks, not to mention letting civilians block aid entrances..  
He also stated that, “There is no doubt that the claims that Netanyahu made that UNRWA is a tool of Hamas are ""flat-out lies,"","" The person who runs operations on the ground in Gaza is a 20 year U.S. Army veteran”, he added.

  
Earlier, The israeli gov claimed 12 UNRWA (Aid agency) members were affiliated with Hamas, without providing evidence, and the US cut aid to UNRWA, so did the EU, amidst famine. Now amidst investigations, there is no evidence of such affiliation, even UNRWA stated that personal were tortured to admit such links. The EU have restored funding, and the US is still pending..  
It has become evident that the Netanyahu's government, and those with extremist ideology (Zionism), never wanted peace in the middle east (as stated in the Likud party charter) they want all the land from Jordan to the sea, and they will abuse the power given to them without oversight  
As history shows, if we really want to achieve peace, we must deliver justice, prosecute criminals, and figure out democratic solutions, without malicious intent from fascist governments.

&#x200B;

And before you go,   
Here are my 3 main questions/concerns to be answered thoroughly for you to change my mind;

&#x200B;

1-  Why would the israeli army [bulldoze](https://twitter.com/i/status/1748013404663537974) trees in the middle of the roads, render all water treatment plants nonfunctional or [destroyed](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/world/middleeast/gaza-water-plant-photos.html), blocking aid trucks from entering maternity kits & water purifiers?

  
2- According to all humanitarian fronts ([UN](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1147656), [IRC](https://www.rescue.org/press-release/famine-imminent-northern-gaza-children-are-being-starved-israels-blockade-and), [ICP](https://www.care-international.org/news/ipc-report-half-gaza-experiencing-catastrophic-hunger-famine-imminent-northern-governorates) and more), 1 million civilians in Gaza right now are facing stage 5 of famine (the highest), why would the israeli gov still blockade the aid when they can control how it is distributed and got the armed forces to secure that?

&#x200B;

3- Some people are yelling ""release the hostages"" on posts of dying kids (as if these kids got them), do you think it's acceptable for the isreali gov to starve kids/innocent civilians to death if Hamas can sort themselves out and not surrender?"

But nowadays I think I embrace fantasies more because that's all I really have to make me satisfied when putting others into consideration. 

While yes, I'll never understand and learn compromise, acceptance hardship, heartbreak, and resilience unless I interact with other people. But I shouldn't have to experience those in order to become a better person, especially when some people aren't able to recover from those things

Now, I'm content with the IRL and online friends and connections I've made now.  So it's not like I refuse every person I find appealing as only a fantasy

But there either people that I miss, or people that I want to meet or interact with, but can't for whatever reason

And for most relationship and/or friendships, if you even express that you fantasize about someone that isn't them, very rarely are they ever gonna understand my feelings and accept that I have these fantasies, even though that's all they are. Just fantasies

But overall people are disappointing, they rejoice and embrace you in one day, then abandon and discard you in the next. I wanna understand why I should overcome my reliace on fantasies In favour for embracing the ups and downs of reality

In the first year, massive amounts of land changed hands, however after Russia dug in and figured out better strategies and tactic, there has been virtually no movement.

In the last year, thousands upon thousands of men are being slaughtered to capture single villages and towns. The Ukraine is becoming more and more in debt and operating in a wartime economy, detrimenting public services to fund the armed forces.

I see argued lots that we just have to send more military aid, however what does the west have that can beat minefields, guided artillery or FPV drones? I've recently just watched video of a russian soldier inspecting the inside of a disabled Abrams, the supposed holy grail of tanks.

So, as Putin says he is willing to do, there needs to be talks in Istanbul and a perminant ceasefire. And Ukraine has to accept that it is going to lose a lot of territory. I fear that eventually, especially if Trump is elected, that the Russians are going to break through the Ukrainian lines and do a lightning run to Kiev. Then the Ukrainians are negotiating on the back foot.

1,2024-03-21,"CMV: ""Off-brand"" products should not exist",u/attlerexLSPDFR,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bk5zhh/cmv_offbrand_products_should_not_exist/,changemyview,"I recently went to a local supermarket and saw something that really made me upset. Store brand Girl Scout cookies. I have been very passionate about this topic for years but those cookies really pissed me off.

Right now you can invent a brilliant culinary creation, maybe a yummy cracker or some new fruit juice blend. Almost immediately someone can reverse engineer the product, make it with cheaper low quality ingredients, slap some stupid name on it and sell it for less.

Off brand products take money out of the pockets of people who create good products. One of the other examples that seriously pisses me off is Off-brand Nutella. This is a product with such a rich history, created to give our troops a sweet treat in their rations overseas. It's an American staple and is instantly recognizable (Unless you're allergic to nuts 😭). Reverse engineering Nutella and selling ""Chocolate Hazelnut Spread"" diminishes the history and iconography of that product, as well as stealing money from the people who invented it.

This is not how capitalism is supposed to work in an ideal sense. The idea of capitalism is that five people make chips, or a hundred people it doesn't matter. They each make different chips with different ingredients and sell them at different prices. If you value having the best chips, you can decide to prioritize spending the extra money to get the best ones. If you just want chips and don't really care about the quality you buy the cheap ones. The personal choice of the consumer drives competition.

Instead, as soon as the best type of chips is discovered someone will make the same chips with poor quality ingredients, cover it up with chemicals to make it taste the same, and sell it for less. This reduces the power of the consumer and reduces competition.

I believe that copyright and trademark laws around food should be greatly strengthened to prevent this from happening. I think products must have a certain amount of variation from the original to be sold.

What will change my view:
- If you can convince me that Off-brand products do not take away sales from the original brand
- If you can convince me that Off-brand products do not reduce economic competition

Your biology knows nothing of it, and when you see a beautiful woman on a dark night, alone, your biology takes over your so-called morality and religion.
But then too, it is not certain that raping the woman is certainly bad. Perhaps she was also waiting for it. Perhaps she was getting frustrated that nobody is raping her. There is a deep desire in every woman to be longed for, and the more drastically you long for her the more satisfied she feels. And rape is the ultimate in longing for a woman. You are ready to commit a crime just to have her. You may be imprisoned for years in a jail, you don’t care.
In most of the cases you and the woman are both brought up by the same idiotic society. They have told the woman to remain away from men, they have given her a certain psychology to avoid men. Even if somebody is attractive to her, she has to say no.
In all the languages the poets have been saying for centuries that when a woman says no she means yes.
All psychologists agree that a woman is raped because deep down she desires it. It gives her a great ego, that she is so beautiful, so lovable, that people are ready even to commit suicide – there are countries where for rape you will be sentenced for your whole life or you may be crucified; still the man wanted her.

People keep recommending Macbooks to students, but honestly I feel like students are the last people who should buy a Mac. The cost of the 13 inch Macbook Air is already inflated at 1100 USD for a machine with 8 GB  RAM and a measle 256 GB of storage, and the second you start upgrading the specs Apple dials the bullshit up to 11. increasing system RAM by 8GB is 200 dollars and going from 256GB SSD to 1TB is a whopping 400 dollars. Outside of battery life, this thing would get destroyed by a thin and light Windows machine of around the same price like the Legion Slim 5 or Asus G14. Plus both of these 2 examples have far better displays and a discrete GPU.

The Apple watch is meh at best considering the poor battery life and ugly tiny spiderweb app drawer thing that's pure eye torture. But I guess the regular Apple watch 9 is a bit understandable. The Ultra is a huge dumpster fire though, it's advertised as an outdoors watch but it still has sad battery life at 36 hours which is a joke compared to established outdoors nav watches like the Fenix 7 pro series with up to 37 days of battery life. Worse yet it's supposed to be used by divers but it requires touch interactions for most things... For a watch that you're supposed to use underwater...

Apple's products aren't competitive at their respective prices at all, which makes it  extra strange that people recommend them to students."

15,2024-03-21,CMV: Haskell is not a purely functional programming language and Monadic IO is simply a hack to enforce a linear-type based programming style,u/VarencaMetStekeltjes,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bk8ufj/cmv_haskell_is_not_a_purely_functional/,changemyview,"Essentially, I believe that Haskell has a wealth of impure functions in it. I also don't believe this is mere semantics but has real impact for code reasoning and readability.

We can consider `GetLine : IO String`. Now everyone agrees that under the hood, the compiler simply calls an inpure GetLine function here; that's not in dispute of course but I argue that even inside of Haskell, this binding is not pure, and returns a different `IO String` every time. It is not referentially transparent. How can we say his `IO String` is the same every time when there's a different string in the “box” that is the `IO` type constructor every time depending on user input? The language is designed so that two things apply:

- We cannot simply obtain the string inside of the box. Or at least, we can, it's called `unsafePerformIO` which does nothing more than that and of course immediately allows us to construct impure functions, and even violate type safety and constrct `unsafeCoerce :: a -> b`, but this function is banished to it's own module and one “should” not use it, but it shows here that all we need to do creatly create impure functions is simply get the `String` out of the box.
- `Eq a => Eq (IO a)` is purposefully not defined. This is extremely weird. Normally this would obviously be defined. It is for every other other Monad. Obvously `Eq a => Eq [a]` is defined and `Eq a => Eq (Maybe a)` are defined. How many other monads are there for which this is not defined? It makes no sense not to define it except that it would allows to observe inside of the language that these functions are not pure by that `GetLine == GetLine` would be clearly false, and on top of that would immediately prompt for two lines to be entered at the terminal and not continue up to that point. It would be true if both lines entered were the same however.

So Haskell essentially claims these functions are “pure” by not giving us the functions that should by all rights exist that allow is to verify they are impure. The claim is that suppoedly the `IO String` returned every time is actually identical. If that be so, then proof it. Why is `Eq (IO String)` not defined then to show this? If they were actually identical then this would be an easy task. Well, obviously because any definition thereof will show they are not either not identical, or in the alternative simply all `IO String` are identical to one another. It's impossible to make `Eq` test for that every case of `GetLine` produces an identical `IO String`, but a different one from `GetLine >> GetLine`. Because they are not identical, and every case of `GetLine` returns a different `IO String` and on top of that performs a side effect to obtain it.

Referential transparency is typically defined as a function that has the same result no matter how many times it's called and that program semantics remains the same no matter how often it's called. “same” here with regards to arguments is a bit vague and `Eq` obviously plays a part in it. But is the claim that a `Rand :: -> Integer` function which produces a random integer which does arithmetic where two different integers produce a different outcome is “pure” and “referentially transparent” so long as we don't define `Eq Integer`? That seems bad.

In fact, a Haskell program very much does behave differently depending on in what order and how many times we call `GetLine`. It simply happens that by not giving us `unsafePerformIO :: IO a -> a` and how `IO a` in general is designed. The language forces is to write code in such a way that it is impossible to write code in such a way that the evaluation order and number of times impure functions are called is indeterminate.

It's no different from sayign that instead we had `GetLine :: RealWorld -> (String, RealWorld)` and the same for all `IO a` functions and the type system did not even have Uniqueness types and instead the programmer simply manually obeyed the convention of swearing to always pass the `RealWorld` value  exactly once to every function in a lazy language. This programming style then forces the optimizer to evaluate these functions in a set order, and a set number of times and these functions are obviously not pure and return a different value when called each time; but the programmer simply ensures that it's not possible for the optimizer to call them out of the intended order. What the Clean language does this this, except it deos have Uniquness types and enforces this constraint upon the programmer. What `Monad IO` does is the same. It simply behind the screens enforces this constraint in how it's built and `(IO a realworld) >>= f a realWorld` behind the screens. That's. That's nothing more than what `IO a` is in the compiler internals. `IO# a RealWorld` where how `>>=` is defined enforces that `RealWorld`, a zero-size dummy datum is used as a Uniqueness type.

So, in summary. I don't believe that Haskell is a purely functional programming language. It's simply a language with a type system that forces the programmer to stick to a particular coding style for it's impure functions that ensure the optimizer cannot order the impure functions out of order. In theory this style can be used in any language with lazy evauation and impure functions. Haskell simply enforces it. But in order to enforce it, it has to make some bizar decisions which only exist to enforce this style such as not defining `Eq a => Eq (IO a)`. Or simply honestly having the general rule of `Monad m, Eq a => Eq (m a)`> Does this lack of this blanket implementation exist for any other reason than to not mess up `IO` and `ST`?"

Men are often depicted as bumbling idiots or aggressive jerks, while women are portrayed as smart, competent, and virtuous. This perpetuates the stereotype that men are inferior or inherently flawed compared to women.   


While there has been progress in promoting parental leave policies that support women in the workforce, men still face stigma and barriers when taking paternity leave. Many workplaces offer limited or no paid leave for fathers, and men often feel pressure to prioritize their careers over family responsibilities. This lack of support for men in caregiving roles reinforces traditional gender roles and perpetuates the idea that parenting is primarily a woman's responsibility. In many education systems, boys are falling behind girls in academic performance. Despite this, initiatives to address the educational gender gap often focus solely on girls' empowerment, neglecting the specific needs and challenges faced by boys. This bias in educational policy and practice perpetuates stereotypes about male incompetence and undermines efforts to support boys' academic success.

The anti-trust laws make sense on the surface, but end up posing a threat to a nations economy, instead of helping it.   


You can try to split up apple/microsoft/google, but how could that happen when their services and software function as a foundation for so many things? Splitting these companies up would cause issues with most of the software in today's world due to the many integrations.  


  


The idea is that by splitting these companies up, more room is made for innovation and competition. But these laws were made when the main concern was the national economy, the nation benefits equally whether this or that steel manufacturer is better.   


When these laws were made, taking U. S. steel out would just mean another provider would take up the demand, and this provider would almost certainly have been in the US, having no effect on the US's power as a nation.   


But splitting up a company like Apple or Google, it's highly unlikely that a US based company would take its place, and it'd almost certainly be Chinese companies that steal the apple's position. Then there's not much that could be done, besides banning the companies entirely. Weakening the tech giants of the US inevitably weakens the countries power globally.   


Back when anti-trust laws were made, competition was typically national at most. Now competition is global, and by weakening our own Tech companies, the position of the US in the tech industry is decreased enormously.   


If the US were to lose its lead in tech, the country as a whole would quickly lose its status in the world. Whichever company dominates tech will dominate the future. If the US isn't in the lead, then China will likely take it.

I'm pretty sure it is wrong, but I'm hoping for a change that is more than just competing theory.

My understanding is the branches of government are independent, and each branch is vested with power. That means each branch is responsible for interpreting the constitution.

Many think when SCOTUS strikes down a law, it is no longer the law. My understanding is that their authority only extends to their branch. It doesn't take the law off the books, and it can't stop the executive branch from arresting people under the law. Judges will immediately release the person (as directed by the SCOTUS ruling), but the president isn't violating the constitution by doing so.

It wouldn't be a constitutional crisis. It would be bad and miserable, but that isn't the same.

420,2024-03-21,CMV: Russian propaganda machine holds a major role in the pro-Palestinian movement,u/motoci,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bkcjwv/cmv_russian_propaganda_machine_holds_a_major_role/,changemyview,"**To start with, this is not a debate praising or critisizing any faction belonging to Palestine, Israel, Russia or the West.** There is a lot of misinformation circulating on all sides and I'm trying to avoid sourcing any unfounded statements/articles.

 My argument is that it is in Russia's leadership's interest to desguise their attempts of destabilization of Western leadership by disguising their propaganda in criminalising Western support for Israel. 

Let's take the US as a first point of discussion. A good portion of the left wing leaning people who would likely vote for Biden are reconsidering their vote accusing him for complicity in what they call genocide commited by Israel against Palestinians, since the current US administration has been maintaing the strong military cooperation with Israeli Defence Forces. Despite the financial contributions the US along with its European partners pay to the Palestinian territories ([US gov fact sheet](https://www.state.gov/u-s-support-for-the-palestinian-people/) from 2022), this hardly gets mentioned in the media, be it mainstream or the independent sources that make it to the wider public. While the Biden administration loses credibility among the demographic that supports him and often seems to take action or at least make statements responding to this political pressure in a way to keep his electorate, Trump is out there telling the public that he is a man of peace and that all wars will end the day he takes the presidential office. It goes without saying that Trump holds the more NATO-skeptic view of the two presidential candidates, especially after statements such as only defending countries that meet a budgeting criteria and continous efforts to stop aid to Ukraine which plays in Russia's benefit. 

Same goes in the UK (where I live). I know a lot of people who are promoting boycotts on companies that are in any way related with either Israel or the United States and are criminalising the current conservative leadership for their support for Israel. Despite the internal power struggles, the British Conservative Party has maintained its role as one of Ukraine's closest partners since the 2022 full scale invasion of Ukraine, so once again the public losing trust in the leadership could potentially lead to a change in the UK's foreign policy that might affect Ukraine negatively and thus, Russia positevely.

As for Russia's position on the Israel-Hamas war, we have Sergey Lavrov (Russia's foreign minister) taking [a clear stance](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FEoobEVZfRY) way before Oct 7, we have a souring relationship between Israel and Russia, and we have a [peace convention](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/29/palestinian-unity-on-agenda-as-hamas-fatah-leaders-to-meet-in-moscow) between Palestinian factions held very recently in Moscow.

My last argument is a clear record of Russian propaganda diguising itself in various forms of activism. In my home country (Romania) there is a popular far right party called AUR (Alliace for Union of Romanians) whose claimed main objective is the unification of Romania and the Republic of Moldova to regain historical borders. However, their leader (George Simion) has interdiction to enter both the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine (both have territories under Russian military occupation) because authorities from both countries deemed him as an asset of Russian propaganda. Members of AUR have claimed that Romania should set as an objective to take the territories from Ukraine that host Romanian ethnics. Despite AUR's claimed ideology, their actions align more with Russia's interest and they even got themselves the nickname 'Alliance for Union with Russia'. Also, there have been multiple claims of Russian involvement with environmental activists and NGOs to shift public view in their favour, such as [influencing European public against internally sourced gas exploitaitions, in order to keep Europe dependent on Russian gas.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/19/russia-secretly-working-with-environmentalists-to-oppose-fracking) Therefore I believe Russia will hide behind any side of the political spectrum to manipulate the people in the West.  


This is not to say that people who express their support and concern for the Palestinian cause are ill intended, however I think at least some of the information on the they are receiving and forwarding is playing in Russia's interests and it makes sense for Russia to invest into this information/misinformation capital.   


As a sidenote, I have travelled to both Israel and West Bank zone A (full Palestinian Authority control) a couple of weeks ago. While the main focus of my visit was on historical/archeological sites, the subject of the current conflict was unavoidable. The views on the conflict that were shared with me by Israeli Jews, Israeli Arabs and Palestinians do not reflect anything that I have read or heard in the West, no matter from what side of the dispute. It was as if here in the West we are talking about a different conflict and it made me even more skeptical about how I read into news regarding external affairs. However, my CMV is about what gets to the wider public rather than debating on the actual tensions, therefore I kept my views and experiences on the matter out of my arguments."

Besides that, I really can't see how women feel so oppressed because of their sex in 2024. The gender gap exists, yes, but it is largely explained by men having obtaining higher paying jobs because of their increased tendencies to leverage professional networks, negotiate salaries, and work to get credibility. Men aren't simply just being paid more than women because ""men good, women bad"". 

And if you look around, women are increasingly represented on executive boards of large corporations and legislative positions. 

So why do some women continue to play the role of the victim and have a hostile attitude towards men? Why are they still making incidents of oppression from years ago relevant if we've worked to fix those mistakes and progress as a society? I'm a man and a feminist but feminists won't even give me the time of day and will automatically assume I'm the enemy because I'm a man. There are so many men out there willing to hear and understand women, but we're always met with hostility and aggression.

We've become so divided, that we all need a compromise so the United States won't split up. 

I think that we should have 4 terms of 2 moderate presidents; one being a republican and the other being a democrat. Both of these presidents would lean slightly towards their own party. I feel like after this, we could gradually become less moderate with presidents and just have conservative and liberal presidents from then on; I think that might be the only way for the US to stay afloat.

Although there's only a few decent points for my theory, I think that the best point is a look at the last three presidents: Obama, Trump, and Biden.

During Obama's terms, a lot of people loved Obama, but in my own beliefs, I don't think he was that special. There were people that despised the guy; this is a good example of one of the first big divisions of the USA.

Trump is disliked by a lot of people. He's brash and arrogant, and in my opinion, he needed to stay off of twitter because he said too many stupid things on their. He still had some good policies, and he stuck to most and completed most objectives. Due to his own arrogance and being brash, a ton of liberals hated him, and I can see why. 

Joe Biden in my opinion is awful. He's affected so many things in a negative way, that has hurt most people; gas prices have gone up, inflation has increased by a large amount, and most recently, he's let a lot of illegal immigrants through. All of these things have hurt a lot of common folk, and I don't know of anything he has done that was helpful. If there's anything I didn't think of about Biden that has impacted people positively, please let me know.

There's two common things that are in all of these terms: All three have been very clearly conservative or liberal, and the nation has been very divided. I think a general compromise is what the USA needs."

The USA and their allies invaded Iraq after George Bush claimed there where weapons of mass destruction.

The USA were craving for retaliation and politically motivated George Bush new that he had to strike back if he wanted to get re-elected. Hundreds of thousands of people died as a result of this war, as the article stated not all deaths where the result of US weaponry, but you could state that all these deaths could've simply been prevented by not invading the country.

We are right in the middle of a new war in the Middle East. With the Israel-Palestine conflict. Current president Joe Biden stated that he gave Israeli president Benjamin ""bibi"" (why would you give a cute nickname to such a man) Netanyahu the advise to learn from the USA and the mistake they made by jumping to conclusions and the amount of civilian casualties during the war in Iraq. 

If the USA confirms that they made mistakes during the war in Iraq, and the facts state that there where people killed during this war, why isn't former president George Bush being held accountable?

I am open for discussion with anyone, but let's keep this discussion about the Iraqi war and not about the current situation in the Middle East, I only used that reference to show that the USA recognizes that they made mistakes in the past.

There are a few ""most likely"" scenarios that I could see happening this year

If Trump is disqualified from running in the 2024 election,there will be violence because Trumpers will think the ""deep state"" is suppressing their voice for political reasons. 

If Trump dies before the election, there will be violence because Trumpers will accuse the ""deep state"" of foul play. 

If Trump loses there will be violence, because there are bound to be some anomalies like in 2020 and the bar for evidence of cheating is very low. 

If Trump wins there will be violence because the media has been telling people- correctly in my view- that Trump is a threat to democracy and I don't think people will stand idly by. 

It would be one thing if everyone in Trump's orbit genuinely believed the lies they spewed. The problem is that a lot of them are bad faith actors, who will make up elaborate conspiracies even if they know they're total BS. And given that so many Republicans believe Trump won, there are enough people who will buy whatever these conspiracy theorists are selling even if it is baseless.

My take:

We can surely agree that consumerism is rampant. If we all bought fewer things our collective emissions would go down. Emissions per capita are massive in North America in particular on a global scale, despite a small manufacturing and industrial base relative to the size of the economy (as much of the production of stuff is now outsourced to other countries).

Reducing emissions is everyone's problem. Handwaving it away as ""well Exxon just needs to pollute less"" is inane -- how exactly should Exxon pollute less? Should they:

1.	⁠Produce less? Then you will need to consume less and likely pay more per unit
2.	⁠Produce the same amount with fewer emissions? Aside from being somewhat of a scientific fantasy, then you will need to pay more for the same amount to cover the costs
3.	⁠Do some other thing which you think is both financially beneficial to Exxon and you? Well then, why haven't they done it already? More to the point, why hasn't some other company done it?

Any way you slice it, reduced emissions primarily come down to us as individuals consuming less, with R&D to improve efficiency helping us along.

1,2024-03-21,CMV: Israel and the West aren't doing enough to suppress Islam,u/HumanNutrStudent,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bkj7k5/cmv_israel_and_the_west_arent_doing_enough_to/,changemyview,"I am a white guy from Canada, but my wife is a Christian Lebanese woman who has spent most of her life in Lebanon before coming to the West. She's very well educated on the history of both Christianity and Islam, and she thinks Islam is an awful and dangerous religion, more so than other religions (she believes all religions are inherently awful), so I have come to share her beliefs. 

From the perspective of the West, there should be very little incentive to support Palestinians or any other group where the main practiced religion is Islam. Some of Islam's religious texts advocate for the killing of non-believers. 

In my opinion (which I'm willing to change), the West isn't doing enough to crack down on Islam. We should be taking an approach more similar to that of Mainland China. I know that the CCP is persecuting and abusing people, which is wrong, but at the very least, there is very little religious influence in their society. I know my children to grow up in a religion-free society, especially one that is free of this dangerous religion Islam, but with the way Western governments currently are, I doubt that will happen in my lifetime."
1,2024-03-21,CMV: I worry the US might be safer under Trump.,u/damndirtyape,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bkkvh4/cmv_i_worry_the_us_might_be_safer_under_trump/,changemyview,"I know this is an unpopular opinion on reddit, but I'm a bit of a swing voter. I have some inclinations that are more liberal and some that are more conservative. I'm leaning towards voting for Biden. But, there's part of me that thinks the US might be safer under Trump. 

The world's a scary place right now. We have a major war in Europe. Things are tense with China. There are big conflicts in the Middle East. Parts of South America are experiencing significant violence and instability. North Korea is behaving in a bellicose way. The Haitian government is collapsing. 

It just seems like we're entering dangerous times. I think there are big reasons to be concerned about national security. I worry that we might be approaching World War III. 

With this in mind, I don't have a ton of confidence in the Biden administration. I worry that we might be safer under Trump. 

That said, I'm not married to this opinion. I'm open to other points of view. Socially, this is an inconvenient view. So, you'd be doing me a favor if you could convince me I'm wrong. 

With that said, here are my reasons. 

**Under Trump, there was peace. Under Biden, there has been war.**

Here is a list of Trump's foreign policy accomplishments:
* Presided over an era of peace and bragged about not starting any wars. 
* Maintained tough, but peaceful relations with Russia and China. 
* Oversaw the dissolution of major Middle East terrorist groups. 
* Organized a historic peace summit with North Korea. 
* Organized peace treaties between several Middle East nations. 
* Renegotiated several trade deals so that they were more favorable to the US. 

In contrast, what are Biden's foreign policy accomplishments? Does he have any? Or, have things only gotten worse during his presidency? 

Here are the major events that have happened under Biden:
* A major war in Europe began. 
* Oversaw the chaotic disintegration of Afghanistan's government. 
* A major Middle East conflict began
* Relations have gotten worse with nations such as Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. 
* The world seems to be on the precipice of World War III. 

I realize that some things are out of the President's control. But, is it really all luck? Is it just the whims of fate that the world became more peaceful under Trump, and began falling apart under Biden? Or, did Trump have some skill at handling foreign relations? 

**Trump might be better at negotiating.**

One might speculate that Trump was better at negotiating with hostile foreign powers. He maintained a firm stance, but was adept at working behind the scenes to maintain peaceful relations. He categorically destroyed dangerous groups that could not be negotiated with, like ISIS. But, overall, he moved the world in the direction of peace. 

I mean, my god, the man actually got North Korea, the most bellicose nation in the world, to begin pursuing more peaceful relations. That's damn near miraculous. 

In contrast, has Biden made any attempts at all to negotiate with Russia? I agree that they are tyrannical and a danger to world peace. But, they are a major military power that must be negotiated with. We historically signed treaties with the Soviet Union, an even more murderous regime. 

From what I understand, Biden is simply saying that Russia should negotiate with Ukraine. Ideally, that is how things should go. But, the reality of the situation is that the US is indirectly at war with Russia. Considering that we are both major nuclear powers, I think there should be some efforts at direct negotiation. Why in the world is this not happening? This seems like a major failing of the Biden administration. 

**The immigration crisis**

I think that both the Democrats and Republicans would agree that there is an immigration crisis. Though, they have very different perspectives on it. Republicans express alarm at the large numbers of people trying to enter the country. Democrats express dismay at the poor conditions these people are facing, and they condemn our ill equipped immigration system. Both points of view have some validity. But, regardless of how you look at things, there is indeed a crisis that we are failing to deal with. 

To make matters worse, we are seeing some disturbing developments in the Americas. Some countries have struggled against surges of gang violence. The government of Haiti has basically collapsed, leaving the country in the total control of the gangs. 

Understandably, this is spurring large numbers of people to seek refuge in the US. I feel compassion for these people. But, for the sake our security and stability, we can't just open the floodgates to the entire world. We don't have the capacity for that. 

I worry that the Biden administration is incapable of handling this situation because it’s too politically incorrect to put restrictions on immigration. When he first got elected, Biden seemed like he was just trying to be the opposite of Trump, and undid most of Trump's reforms. 

Well, it seems like word has gotten out that the Biden administration is permissive towards immigrants, and now people are clamoring to take advantage of the situation. And, its not just people in Latin America. People from all over the world are coming to the southern border. 

I think Trump would be able to handle the situation. When he was president, we saw decreases in immigration. During covid, he took the necessary step of tightly closing down the border. Would Biden have had the stomach to do that? 

**I think Trump can be considered a proponent of realpolitik.**

We are in dangerous times. It is entirely possible that we are facing World War III. In times like this, I think we need an administration that will doggedly protect our safety and do what is necessary towards that end. 

Trump's catchphrase was America First. I know its not politically correct to find that appealing. But, it has some appeal to me. I want a president whose top priority is my safety and well being. 

If we are facing a major world conflict, I want a fighter in the White House. I want someone who will try to keep our military as strong as possible. I want someone who is able to make hard decisions, and take necessary actions that might not always be popular. I think this describes Trump. 

I don't have this type of confidence in Biden. My feeling is that every decision he makes is discussed ad nauseam by a committee, and they take whatever action they think is most likely to get them praised by PBS. In peaceful, maybe this is the best approach. But in dangerous times, I just want the person most likely to keep me safe. 

**Conclusion**

So there you go, those are my thoughts when I go full conservative. I think there are legitimate arguments against almost everything I've said. But, on a gut level, I worry that my security is most assured if Trump gets reelected. 

Please, convince me that I'm wrong. Why is the US safer under a Biden presidency?"
1,2024-03-21,CMV: There is no valid reason for tipping in any situation,u/Human-Revolution3594,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bkl5e4/cmv_there_is_no_valid_reason_for_tipping_in_any/,changemyview,"Tipping is a common custom in the United States, and I believe it is fraught with problems. For all of the justification for tipping, I have yet to hear a valid argument to support the practice. I will highlight some common arguments about why someone should tip, and why I disagree.

* “Tipped employees make below minimum wage: No, they don’t” While there is such thing as a “tipped wage”, the employer is still responsible for paying them at least minimum wage for the hours worked in a pay period. If that doesn’t occur, then that is illegal and not a problem for the customer to solve

* “Tipped employees won’t be paid as much if tips aren’t given”: This may be true, but that is not the customer’s problem either. While I do recognize that moving to a straight wage as opposed to tips will result in effective pay cuts for many tipped employees, I believe that jobs that customarily get tipped aren’t that difficult, or valuable. It isn’t hard to be a server, etc, and thus doesn’t command much more than minimum wage. It is not a customer’s job to artificially inflate the wage beyond what it should be. I have seen some extreme examples where servers claim to make $80k, which is as much as many skilled professionals like engineers, nurses, skilled tradesmen make. Being a server, bartender, etc is not nearly on the same level.

* “You are screwing over the worker by not tipping”: It is not the customer’s job to pay the employee, that is the employer’s job. Tipping, in my view, is a terrible system for all involved. Ultimately, an employer who puts the onus on the customer to subsidize an employees wage through tips is the one screwing the employee."

They often draw parallels to John Brown or whatever, but the KKK os a better analogy imo.

 The Confederacy was just looking for self-determination and independence, but the North, full of violent psychopaths, burned the South to the ground; killing some 500-600k people (yeah, I know most of it was bad medicine or disease, but it is still 5 to 6 times more dead than the whole Arab-Israeli conflict). The South may have started it (debated), but the Arabs clearly started the '48 war.

 After the war, the South's political liberties were virtually non-existent as their leaders were purged, they lost their Supreme Court representation, the North installed Carpertbaggers, wrote the election laws, forced Amendments, etc. And there are certainly examples of Black people violently attacking whites, as some Jews attack Arabs.

After all that suffering and oppression, can we really be surprised that some young men, as immoral or unproductive as it may be, decided to lash out becuase they had no other options? Killing the KKK will just inspire more people to join the KKK, so let's just let it go.

Saying ""the South wanted slavery"" is true, but
Hamas wants a Islamaist fascist state, so if you think the goals of the Confederacy matter in looking at their justification, the goals of a Palestinian State should matter as well, and both are essentially working towards oppression. Fyi, the Middle East abolished slavery around the 50s and 60s, so around the time Israel came or occupied certain places.

In terms of tactics, The Original KKK mostly targeted politicians (almost everything in Birth of a Nation is BS, they didnt wear white hoods). So, arguably it is more moral, and the lynchings were of ""suspected criminals"" in retaliation. (I know it isnt PC to say that, but the Israelis killed in attacks arent even accused or suspected of committing any wrong other than existing on that land. At least you could say they thought Emmitt Till did *something* wrong)."

If the drinking age and legal age to purchase cannabis and nicotine products is 21, we might as well consider 18-year-olds to be minors. It makes no sense to be allowed to post porn the second you turn 18 as well as being allowed to fuck someone old enough to be your grandparent, being able to do hormone therapy to change gender, give my life to the military, sign binding documents and being tried as an adult legally. You might as well make the age for these things 21 if 18 isn't old enough to even have a beer. So, it's not an issue if I make porn with someone's grandpa and impulsively join the military but I get in trouble just for having a smoke? Making the drinking age 21 isn't going to prevent drunk driving accidents either. 


There are plenty of people well over the age of 25 (when your brain is supposedly fully mature) who irresponsibly drink and are more immature than literal children. If we restrict alcohol so much (or any vices really), it will only encourage teens to be sneakier and dishonest. It's not fair at all to give an 18-year-old adult responsibilities and expectations while not even letting them unwind after a long day with a drink or smoke. I'm old enough to work overtime, shouldn't I be able to relax with a drink or cig?  


What the law is doing is also infantizing young adults and basically treating them like second-class citizens. Either make everything legal at 21 or 18, you can't have it somewhere in the middle.  It makes zero sense"
257,2024-03-21,"CMV: ""Virginity is a social construct"" isn't a great talking point",u/Tall_Promotion_7160,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bkpm4v/cmv_virginity_is_a_social_construct_isnt_a_great/,changemyview,"I really only see this used as a way to combat two types of thinking, the first is to push back on the idea of desiring your partner to be a virgin or to be celibate until marriage, the other being used to comfort people (but particularly older men) who are virgins at older ages and struggle to date/have sex.

The first I think is a bad argument because the foundation of those issues isn't really going to exist whether or not virginity is a social construct does not change how people value sex. Some people attach sex to emotions in such a way that sex is the ultimate emotional act and that changes what virginity means to you. Just saying ""it's a social construct"" doesn't work in the same way it won't work to just tell a t-phobe that gender is a social construct.

In the second, I think that it's stupid to use as a talking point as it's just not really effective in combating the issues the people who use it try to combat. The reason why people who are upset about their virginities are upset isn't because of the concept of virginity. The founding discomfort isn't the word virgin and the societal idea around being a virgin. The issue is being unable to lose your virginity. They feel discomfort because they cannot attract anyone romantically or sexually, feel as if they are missing out because they are not having sex, and feel bad being so far behind socially."

By ""private property"" I mean land or capital which is owned not for personal use, but for generating passive income in the form of rent.

Arguments I've seen include:

* Right of first occupancy, the notion that whoever occupies the land first ought to own it. 
   * Any parcel of land has been taken by force from its previous occupant at some point in time. If the person you bought it from stole it, how can it be legitimately yours?
   * Why should the first person have the permanent right to the land when there are limits on the amount of land in the world?
* Improving land gives one the right to own it (sometimes called homesteading).
   * If a tenant farmer improves the land he works, does the ownership pass to him? No. It stays with the landlord.
   * What if many different people improve the land? Do they all own it?
   * Do I have the right to decide that someone else isn't using their land to its fullest potential and take it from them?
* Private property is the only possible way of organizing the economy.
   * Many societies in history, including those with intensive agriculture have held some or all of their land in common.
   * It was once the case that most societies in history had slavery as an integral part of their economy. Was that a valid argument for slavery?"

Ronald Reagan era of dealing with drug users is harmful and only adds to the problem.  But the US is so far behind other countries in dealing with this issue 

Look at Sweden and Portugal. Opened free heroin clinics. Safe place to shoot up, clean needles, medically pure herojn, nurses on site. Since they implemented that, crime went down a massive amount. Things like street prostitution went to almost zero 

Who woulda thunk it? That women aren’t willingly their bodies to random psychotic strangers for fun, or because  they “like their job”

Problem is the US is raking in the dough with no end in sight. From both ends. We let the shit get in too easily and def have shady practices on border security. And certain industries are making a killing. Higher OD rates and higher addiction rates = higher federal subsidies. 

Prison industrial complex makes bank. Local, country, state, and fed. Fines, jails, etc. treatment facilities and detoxes are swimming in money

And if we use this calculator we can see that $6,000 in 1930 had the same purchasing power as $103,533.83 does in 2023. $3,900= $67,000.  
  
And based on the IRS report for calendar year 1930, the average net yearly income of Americans during 1930 was $4,887.

Do you know what $4,887 income translates to in 2023? $84,328.31  
  
As of 2023 the current average yearly income in the U.S. is $56,940.  
  
If houses cost $103k like they did in 1930 it would take about 3 years of income to pay for. Nearly 3x as long as it would've taken someone during the Great depression to pay for the same house.  
  
But housing prices didn't stay stable either. Those went up, too  
  
Today the average price of a home is $416,000. That would have been $24k in 1930. That's nearly 8x the cost, time, and savings required to purchase a home.

✨ It means if you are not making at least $85,000/year right now then you are factually and measurably doing worse than someone during the Great Depression ✨  
The debt isn't our fault. The recession/depression. Your personal debt. It wasn't. Profit driven industries have been bleeding us dry and still expect us to pay our bills? For college? We were supposed to have more.  
It means every single household in the USA has been robbed of about $30k of generational wealth since 1930.  
It means we are currently in a depression even worse than the Great Depression. This isn't just some seasonal recession.  
It means your budgeting skills aren't the reason you're poor.   
In fact, your grandparents who lived thru the depression probably have no idea what it's like to struggle financially as much as you have.  
It means corporations are trying to normalize us living on the absolute bare minimum. But asking for living wages isn't ""greedy,"" I promise. (See bullet point #1)

WW2 is credited for having ended the depression in 1939. I call that bullshit military propaganda. Why?  
  
Because in 1938 FDR enacted the Federal Minimum Wage, saying this quote in his address about it (below) and I'm just wondering what's supposed to get us out if this one. 

""The idea is simply for employers to hire more men to do the existing work by reducing the work-hours of each man's week and at the same time paying a living wage for the shorter week.  
  
\[...\] I am fully aware that wage increases will eventually raise costs, but I ask that managements give first consideration to the improvement of operating figures by greatly increased sales to be expected from the rising purchasing power of the public. That is good economics and good business. The aim of this whole effort is to restore our rich domestic market by raising its vast consuming capacity. If we now inflate prices as fast and as far as we increase wages, the whole project will be set at naught. We cannot hope for the full effect of this plan unless, in these first critical months, and, even at the expense of full initial profits, we defer price increases as long as possible. If we can thus start a strong, sound, upward spiral of business activity, our industries will have little doubt of black-ink operations in the last quarter of this year. The pent-up demand of this people is very great and if we can release it on so broad a front, we need not fear a lagging recovery. There is greater danger of too much feverish speed.""

But when guys ask this it’s not coming from that point of view, we want a definite non chemistry point of view.

Dead bedrooms are more often than not a symptom of deeper problems. If all parties involved are willing to resolve the issue then they can likely find the root cause.

But with that out of the way, the arguments I've heard are: AI art is stealing because it is taking someone's else's work in order to train the machine but it's not giving that person any compensation for it. They worked hard! They deserved to be paid! And if you can't pay them, then you shouldn't have it! End of story! Because this is their work, their livelihood! They put blood, sweat, and tears into this and YOU are just taking it and giving them NOTHING in return. You're just stealing it from them!

Meanwhile those exact same people: Pirating movies/music/games/sports pay-per-views is NOT stealing because 1. it's just copying. It's not stealing some physical thing (neither is the AI when it learns from your work....) 2. People who pirate weren't going to buy it anyway (oh and the people using AI art were going to buy that art?)

Heck, the AI is at least transforming it into something new, with pirating you were always just straight up stealing it...

but I don't want to digress too much. So what were those arguments again? You're not giving the artist compensation for their work? What compensation did you give to those who made the movies/music/games/sporting events that you pirated?

or how about, ""if you can't pay them, you shouldn't have it"" ? Well gee why doesn't that go for the movies/music/games/sporting events?

or ""copying isn't stealing"" okay cool because the AI is literally just copying... heck it's doing LESS than copying in most cases....

""It's their blood, sweat and tears"" What? The people who made the game didn't work hard on it? The people who made the music didn't work hard on it? Isn't that THEIR blood, sweat, and tears?

""I wouldn't have bought it anyway"" says the piracy defenders ""Then you shouldn't get to enjoy it"" says the AI art defenders.

Do you see how these two positions simply cannot coexist?

But I suspect whether anyone is willing to admit it or not, a LOT of people who held one have held the other as well.

29,2024-03-22,CMV: Wins are not a QB stat,u/Heidelburg_TUN,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bkvby6/cmv_wins_are_not_a_qb_stat/,changemyview,"This is one of the most pervasive oldhead takes in the NFL and it's easily the one that does my head in the most. 

For some reason, a large amount of people have convinced themselves that you can evaluate the contributions of an individual player by looking purely at team success. This quarterback may have better individual numbers, but this other guy is just a winner. He knows what it takes to *win*, even if it isn't pretty. Blah blah blah yadda yadda yadda.

Obviously quarterbacks contribute heavily to their team's success, but they are far from the only factor in it. There are 52 other guys on an NFL roster (and even more on the practice squad), and if those guys all suck, it doesn't matter how good your QB is, your team is going to suck. Conversely, if those 52 guys are all among the best at their positions in the league, you'll probably be great, even if your quarterback sucks.

Football is a team sport. Quarterbacks get passing yards, touchdowns, and interceptions, and teams get wins. We have so, so many better ways to evaluate quarterbacks than Wins, yet this idea still persists, despite obvious inherent problems with it.

If you evaluate players' careers based on QBWins, then the following has to be true:

-Ben Roethlisberger is a top 5 QB all time

-Eli Manning is as good as Joe Montana

-Otto Graham is the greatest QB of all time because he has the highest win%

-Alex Smith is better than hall of fame QBs Troy Aikman, Dan Fouts, Bobby Layne, Kurt Warner, and Joe Namath.

It feels like it should just be obvious that this view doesn't make internal sense. People will pick and choose situations where they feel that QBWins matter, and ignore the facts that are inconvenient for them. Wins are not a QB stat."

Saying this anywhere near a coin collector will be met with shock and disgust. However, I always feel like coins would be -better- if properly cleaned. 

I personally don't find it nice to look at/hold hundreds of years of grunge and decay- You can't see the original details, the shine, or how the coin was supposed to look. Some older coins I've seen are covered with dirt/grime that you can tell details are under it, but it's all blocked and filled in with dirt.

If the coins were cleaned, CAREFULLY, you could see more of how the coin was intended to look and be seen. In its original colors, without dirt blocking details, etc.

Of course, this does not apply to coins where cleaning them would break them (very fragile, etc), and proper cleaning should be done to ensure the details and original finish are preserved as much as possible. Quality/value could be judged based on how carefully and well-cleaned the coins were, treating them like artifacts not pocket change. 

If the coins were nice and shiny, it feels more reminiscent of the time, how it was supposed to be, looks nicer, feels cleaner, and all around just seems like a win to me."

And although this applies broadly, to things such as restaurants, public transports, work conditions, rule of law, etc, in this case it is generally brought-up in regards to work conditions and quality of life.

In short, my belief is that your personal experience with something repeated (say going to a certain restaurant 4-5 times, working 3-4 jobs in a certain area, interacting with a certain branch of a local government (or equivalent)) will most likely represent your future experiences.

For my view if, say, you went to a certain Italian restaurant 5 times, disliked it every time, chances are you will dislike it a 6th time as well. Or if you worked 5 jobs in Merida, chances are whatever experience you had there, your sixth will be similar.

Their position, however, was that average (median or modal) experience will most likely represent your experience. So for example if most people like a certain Korean restaurant, chances are you will to. However if you did not before, it does not mean you will not like it in the future, just that you were either unlucky, ordered the wrong dish, talked wrongly to the waiter, etc. Or if you had 5 really shitty job in the Attic where employers always tried to scam you, you should just have been smarter about it, so the next one won't try to scam you. And so on.

Basically their position was that whatever experience you may have had at one point that is outside the norm is down to you, or to approaching whatever subject in the wrong manner, or bad luck.

And that is about it. I honestly could not for the life of me understand how they arrived at this conclusion, nor they seemed to understand mine. Could you try to push back against my view, and hopefully make me understand theirs? Or even better, change my PoV.

204,2024-03-22,CMV: you can't use anonymously self-reported rapes for any meaningful conclusions about criminal behavior,u/Irhien,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bl4t12/cmv_you_cant_use_anonymously_selfreported_rapes/,changemyview,"Some of the debate on rape seems to be based on studies where the anonymous participants were asked whether they have committed rape (with or without explicitly using the term). I don't see what these data can be good for, when talking about prevalence or patterns of actual rapists. It should be mostly useless.

0) **Keeping mum.** Obviously, rapists can still feel unsafe and never admit anything even on anonymous surveys, or lie for other reasons. You can probably try to estimate the fraction of the honest ones by asking the known rapists whether they would have answered honestly but it doesn't seem very reliable and it's a different population (to begin with, they've probably found much more reasons to regret what they did). Even with a reasonably good estimate, it makes the data less reliable. Having the data from a part of rapists would still be somewhat useful, but these are going to be mixed with false answers from non-rapists.

1) **Mistakes.** (*mostly unimportant*) People make honest errors. Misunderstanding the questions, checking the wrong boxes. It's probably on the order of 1% or less, but when you're studying a small minority, 1% is a lot of noise. Counterpoint: honest errors can be mostly eliminated by asking multiple questions and discarding the data from the participants whose answers aren't consistent. Yes, but now your survey is likely a lot bigger. Which segues into my next point:

2) **Trolling.** People can lie for shits and giggles. Sure, anonymity is good for letting the people who want to admit criminal/antisocial behavior do so, but it likewise protects those interested in messing with others. Bonus points if they feel like they'd rather spend the time doing something else, or if they're lying to the perceived authority figures (like undergrad students participating in a scientific study on campus).

3) **Fantasizing.** People can lie because they fantasize about rape, and answer based on these fantasies as a way of engaging in them. (Also this can contribute to the difference between admitted rape called by its name and admitted actions constituting rape by legal definition: rape fantasies are not for everyone if you call them what they are and realize how rape victims are actually likely to react and feel, but without this part it must be less uncommon. As evdinced by the apparent popularity of ""stepsis got stuck under my bed"" and ""shoplifter is forced to blow mall security to avoid prison"" plots in porn.)

4) **Bragging.** Lots of men brag about their sexual achievements, often lying and exaggerating. Sharing fantasies is covered by 3), here I'm talking about trying to raise one's status. While in most cultures unambiguous rape is nothing to be proud of, showing dominance raises one's status in the eyes of many people and so does crossing some lines (""grab them by the pussy""), some cases of rape are acceptable or justifiable or not taken seriously in the eyes of some groups, and some people outright enjoy women being hurt and humiliated. So rape (again, more often without the label) should still be a kind of sex many would consider worthy of bragging about before the appropriate audience. Doing it anonymously with no feedback is poor ersatz, sure, but I still think some will plausibly be tempted, or might repeat whatever they said to others at some point.

5) **Distorting the facts.** (*less important*) Come to think of it, real rapists could be braggarts and rape fetishists, too. Why admit to just *n* rapes when it could've been 3*n*? On the other hand, some might be particularly ashamed of some of their actions and omit them, diminishing the number of victims or changing details.

I'm not including disorders that make people lie/make stuff up compulsively, fail to distinguish their dreams from reality and other weird cases: these are probably too rare to affect the results too much.

Even a small fraction of non-rapists lying for whatever reason can be comparable to the number of actual rapists willing to admit anything. I don't see how one can meaningfully estimate the ratio of true:false confessions in a given survey, let alone filter the false ones out, except for obvious cases.

I guess the best approach to CMV would be to show me the methods used by the researchers that would convincingly eliminate most of the false positives, or independently verify the results. A partial CMV could be convincing me almost all rapists actually want to confess honestly rather than to brag: if it's not bragging that drives them, this at least contradicts 5) and makes 4) more tenuous.

Edit: I'm a slow reader, so you probably shouldn't add new replies if you want a delta: it seems like there's already enough convincing comments, plus if I'm not convinced I'll indeed look at what the researchers themselves do to address these issues. Should've done it in the first place, yep."

It’s often the case that such a product might take a lot of effort to develop (beyond that of a few founders), yet investors might not be willing to invest in it. 

Requiring startups to pay minimum wage constrains innovation from startups which don’t have the capital to pay workers.

Virtue is the mean between two extremes, according to Aristotle's virtue ethics (just citing my influences).  
**P2**. For some virtues, the mean is sex-specific, leading to different virtuous behaviors in men and women.  
**P3**. Masculinity is the attainment of the male-specific virtuous mean.  
**P4**. Individuals embodying their sex-specific virtues contribute more to society than those who do not.  
**P5**. Flamboyant behavior in men is posited as deviating from the male-specific virtuous mean.  
**C.** Therefore, men embodying masculinity, as the sex-specific virtuous mean, contribute more positively to society than flamboyant men.

This is the core of why I have this view and why I think more masculine men (defined P3) should openly challenge the academic ideas of gender as a spectrum and other associated cultural movements even at risk of being ""cancelled"". I think people that are not masculine men may be starting from a different moral reference point and that's why *not* taking a stand against this is understandable for them. They think this new education *is* the midpoint of virtue. I would only expect someone who has actually attained the real midpoint to know something's wrong. That's why I'm putting corrective action on masculine men.

I'm open to this idea being incorrect and would be glad to understand why. I think this argument is valid but I understand it might not be sound.

**Edit**: Let me show my work a little on these premises. So here is a hypothical breakdown of 3 random virtues by sex:

**Virtues**

Courage, Compassion, Emotional Expressiveness

**Objective means** (1 being deficiant of the trait, 10 being excessive of the trait, 5 being the true virtue and balanced)

Courage 5, Compassion 5, Emotional expressiveness 5

And here is an example of how all virtues have an excess and a deficit:

1. **Deficiency of Compassion:** This would be a lack of empathy or indifference to the suffering of others. Individuals with this deficiency may ignore the needs and pain of others, showing coldness or detachment. This state could be described as heartlessness or insensitivity.
2. **Excess of Compassion:** This would be an overwhelming or inappropriate level of empathy towards the suffering of others, leading to an inability to maintain personal boundaries, make objective decisions, or possibly even to a detriment to one's own well-being. This state could manifest as over-sensitivity or emotional over-involvement.

**Male ideal mean**

Courage 6, Compassion 4, Emotional expressiveness 4.5

**Female ideal means**

Courage 4, Compassion 6, Emotional expressiveness 5.5

*Expand that to all virtues.*

These numbers are aribtrary right? Well here is what I am proposing. If we take 100 of the greatest men from history (most loved, most positive impact, accomplished, best role models, ect) and 100 of the greatest women from history and find a systematic way to rate their amount of a trait 1-10, we will find that the ""ideal male"" has a different objective virtue balance point than the ""ideal female"". I can only think of Steve Irwin and Mother Teresa as examples. If we throughly read up on them we may find one of them ended up with more compassion than the other. And thus a boy or girl growing up ought to aim for a differnt amount of a virtue if we had data on 100 examples like them. Over-involvement.

Im not arguing for any specific result, other than that the means being *different* due to biology and diferences in the male and female brains and bodies.

And I am also arguing that wherever the average flamboyant man's mean is at now it is very far from the 100 best men. I think if every man was flamboyant oour whole military would fail for example. Its not something to push onto kids as normal and okay."

He straight up said Bill lied to him about the monicagate and condemned it, greatly damaging his chances. why would you try to get away from bill whose approval is actually growing rapidly compared to speaker newt who tried to impeach him.

If this wasnt enough he moved his campaign headquarters away from DC and picked a random ass clinton critique from a safe small blue state as his running mate. Joe just turned ppl away from the ticket , Gore somehow hoped ppl would see him as different from clinton thanks to all this which backfired like hell

his surrogates attacked bush for being a nepo baby which gore was himself making him look like a liar which he claimed clinton was not him.

made no efforts to become appear more charismatic and had a bad campaign strategy 

honestly he would lose the PV as well if bush's arrest from 76 didnt damage the later's chances "

No other tournament provides the excitement we see every March at the end of the college basketball season. 

What could possibly make this tournament so much fun to watch? Let me tell you:

1. Possibly the biggest difference from any other tournament is the shear quantity of teams involved. 68 teams get a chance to cut down the nets. This brings me to my next point...

2. The tournament is specifically designed to ensure that we don't just see replays of conference play or conference tournaments. Teams are arranged in their respective regions in such a way that no two teams that have already met twice this season will meet again until the sweet 16. 

3. The single elimination format makes every single game the most important of your season. Sure, this isn't unique to the ncaa tournament, however...

4. The nature of basketball allows for upsets at a higher clip than other sports. The fast flow of the game, the impact of personal fouls, the potential for any single player to go off and make an impact they hadn't made all season adds a level of uncertainty unmatched in any other major sports tournament. 

5. Last, but certainly not least, the Cinderella story. Your Saint Peter's, your Loyola Chicago's, your NC State Wolfpacks! Teams that have no business upsetting the status quo of the basketball season upending the seasons of perennial powerhouses. A rag tag team of under recruited talent taking on some of the best athletes in the country, future NBA stars, finding a way to win. With nothing to lose and pride on the line these long shot teams win over our hears and find the fans of every team around the country cheering them on (until its your team getting struck down).

March Madness is a beautiful event. The pinnacle of sports, but im always open to being proven wrong! 

What have I missed? Where have I erred? What other prestigious sporting event deserves the love that I have for college basketball in March?"

Now that the stock market has more than recovered from 2022 & early 23 lows, inflation is under control, the fed and other central banks have completed the cycle of monetary tightening, and we’re in the early stages of revolution in AI, change my view that we aren’t heading into a period of decadence to rival roaring 20s and/or rapid technological growth like the 1990s.

1,2024-03-22,"CMV: Soccer, or 'football', is the greatest sport in the world, and it is simply 'the worlds sport.'",u/Jolly_Green_4255,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bldhg4/cmv_soccer_or_football_is_the_greatest_sport_in/,changemyview,"1. **Anyone can play soccer, not everyone can play basketball, rugby, American football, etc.**  
You see, to be a somewhat good basketball player you need to have the luxury of being born tall, or at least make the requirement to functionally play basketball and have the same advantages as everyone else.  
To play American football, you need to be in incredible shape, pretty much almost military standards shape, this logic can also be used for rugby.  
With soccer, you can be 5ft 1 and skinny, or you can be 6ft 11 and built, no matter how small, tall, big, short, skinny, big you are, you can be a good soccer player.  
The greatest soccer players of all time, are some of the shortest players and not the biggest. The biggest soccer player ever, players like Hulk or Akinfenwa, still get recognition to this day because their build didn't stop them. Players like Peter Crouch, who everyone said couldn't play because of how tall he was, became a legend for teams in England.  
What's my point here? You see, it is one of the very few sports in the world that doesn't judge you on how tall you are or how short etc etc, and in fact, **anyone** can play the sport! And still have a fair chance of being as good as the next person.
2. **The view counts speak for themselves.**  
The 2024 super bowl had 123 million viewers. The 2023 world series had 9.1 million viewers. The NBA finals in 2023 had 11.64 million viewers. **The 2022 world cup had 1.5 billion viewers.**   
Why is this important? The rise in viewers in comparison to the other ""finals"" shows that, in the eyes of the world, soccer is the more entertaining sport to watch out of them all, this practically boosting the point on why it is the ""world sport.""   
You'll never find a sports tournament have as many people watching it as the world cup, even the euros had 5.23 billion people watching it, and it only involves one continent!
3. **The moments shared with fans is truly something you'll have to experience, to understand.**  
I'm not going to say that NFL, NBA, and whatever else, hasn't got a fanbase as strong as soccer does, but until you experience what its like to be in a stadium, or to be part of a soccer fanbase for a club - you'll never understand how unique it is.  
There is a reason stadiums are called home grounds, because when you are inside of them, you simply feel like you are at your home. You cry together, scream together, shout together, sing together, and celebrate together - and even when you aren't at the stadium, the bond shared between fans from all over the world simply because you follow the same club is so unique.  
The world cup final is a perfect example of this. Only 2 countries are in that final, and yet, billions tune in to watch it - it is the only thing in the world that can unite everyone together, no matter who you support club wise, who your favourite player is, or if your nation is in the final, you are all unified to watch the greatest 90 minutes of the last 4 years.

&#x200B;

So, to sum it up - soccer is the greatest sport in the world, and is the 'worlds sport' because of its viewer count, the ability to play the sport no matter your birth-given circumstances, and the unification it brings out in the world."

1,2024-03-22,cmv: Adam Something is a hateful clown that should not be listened to,u/Yuuba_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1blfxch/cmv_adam_something_is_a_hateful_clown_that_should/,changemyview,"So I will admit that I am biased because I dislike a lot of the online urbanism community, I feel like they are all self-righteous and cringe. However, I still occasionally watched some urbanism content on YouTube despite disagreeing with their points sometimes and finding their community cringe. However, Adam Something I believe is just a shitty youtuber and believe he has nothing of value to share.   
I always found him to be the worst urbanist YouTuber, however, I still sometimes watched his videos (YouTube always spam recommends them to me), specifically many of the ones about stupid tech bro stuff I found to be decent. However, I now think he is a shitty person who makes shitty videos and I feel like he should be called out more  
I started feeling like this due to his new video on the Cyber Truck, which I thought I would agree with fully. The cyber truck is an objectively terrible product, and most Teslas have been for a while and he points this out in the video, and that is all completely true.   
However, He says a lot of stuff that just shows not only that he is a bad YouTuber, but also a massive hypocrite. He says multiple times that Elon Musk pushes neo-nazi conspiracies citing him saying the great replacement stuff. Elon actually did say the great replacement stuff, however, Adam Something is a hypocrite to criticize him for this. He literally has the nickname ""Azov Something"" for supporting the Neo-Nazi group in Ukraine Azov Battalion. (by the way, I am in no way a supporter of Russia or Tankies, but Azov literally has nazi imagery in their logo, Adam Something supporting them is objectively supporting a Nazi group). Therefore, he is hypocritical on that front.   
Another incredibly mean-spirited thing he did was diss the YouTube channel Throttle House. To prove the Cybertruck was Bad he found a review of it from a YouTube channel called Throttle House. These guys literally proved his point for him, he uses their clips multiple times in the video to prove his points. They agreed that it was a shit vehicle, but Adam decides to diss them by calling them a youtube channel for divorced dads. For no reason, he disses the people who are like the basis for most of the video.I was not even a fan of this channel or really knew about them, but it is incredibly mean-spirited to diss them I assume for no other reason than being a car YouTuber, but I am a fan of many car YouTubers and none of them are as self-righteous or pretentious as most urbanist content (especially Adam Something).  
He also in many of his videos makes fun of tech bros idolizing movie characters and stuff. That's fine, but he is a massive hypocrite, In most of his videos he compares real life to video games and movies (one time he said nuclear war wouldn't be that bad and cited fallout).   
In my opinion, the worst, and most hypocritical part of the video was when he talked about the Cyber Truck in relation to other cars. Saying that people who own a Cadillac escalade hate minorities, a big thing with the urbanist community is hating on people who may have agreed with them, but like to shit on things they like/ their hobby. This is again, very mean-spirited, and in just my experience I knew a lot of white people who owned large SUVs who did not hate minorities. For most of my life I lived in a Middle Eastern Gulf country, most people there are obviously not white and a large portion of them own Large SUVs. Speaking of the Gulf, I think its funny how Adam accuses other people of hating minorities while they have a (in my opinion) irrational hatred of the Gulf, where it borderlines on being racist. I understand the countries in the gulf spend money on bullshit vanity projects made by monarchs, but these people like to dick ride the nice European architecture in European cities, large amounts of which were bullshit vanity projects made by monarchs, but just older and in Europe. It almost feels racist the way the urbanist community talks about people from the gulf.   
Then he says people who own big trucks like the Ford F150 fantasize about having sex with their daughter's underage friends, IE a pedophile. First of all, the ford F150 is if I am not mistaken the most sold vehicle in the US, and vehicles like that are very popular all around the world. Yes, many people don't need them but a large chunk of it objectively goes to people who use it for work. Most farmers own trucks so I think these people exaggerate how many people buy them that don't need them. Secondly, Is there anything wrong with liking big trucks? even if somebody does not need one I see no reason to hate them so much you call them a literal pedophile, unless he has evidence that people who own trucks are more likely to become pedophiles, which I do not believe he has. I do not own a truck or even a car, and honestly, I think there is a valid discussion to have about cars becoming so large that they are unsafe. However, if somebody likes trucks they should be allowed to own one just because they think it's cool. I think a big reason why the urbanist community is not going to get as many people on board who otherwise would have is because they attack people simply for having interests.   
Furthermore, Adam is a massive hypocrite by calling others pedophiles, He literally defended Vaush when he was found having literal Loli(child) And beastiality Hentai on his hard drive. In my opinion, you lose the right to make fun of other people for things like that, even as a joke when you defend literal Pedophiles.   
Besides that there are a lot of things specific to other videos to criticize, but in my opinion Adam Something should stop getting support because he is a hateful individual who is a massive hypocrite who makes shitty videos. But maybe you will disagree."

Companies like Apple are constantly moving, changing, and taking away features in updates. Even when they can be ignored there can be coercive tactics that force updates to retain proper functionality.

My point is this: When money changes hands the product you are purchasing should be the product you get to keep; that should apply to the software and any parts in the product.

Furthermore any changes must be mutually agreed upon, and while deals can be made, the seller can’t just change the terms of usage, or take back the product because you don’t want to adopt those changes. If the seller wants to push the product change, it should be required to treat it as you would a new sale, and provide a refund or compensation of some kind.

10 years ago, if you brought your car to a dealership to get something fixed, and the dealer decides it wants to change out your steering wheel for a yoke, and wouldn’t give you back the car until you agreed to accept the yoke, you would rightfully be furious. However this is the kind of behavior that seems so common in the the tech industry. We should not be allowing this kind of practice and we should be not allowing sellers to do this.

To be clear, I understand when changes are in reference to a live service. I don’t for instance think that Apple should be forced to keep iTunes running if it’s not working for them, but I am saying that the ability to play MP3s on my iPhone regardless of source, should be retained unless I give them consent to take it away.

I also get security updates, and it would be one thing if there was a significant safety risk; but that should be provable and justified and much like recalls, should have some concession if the product is no longer useable with the original functionality.

That’s it; to the extent that we have things like “lemon laws” and right to return things for refunds, no non-consensual updates should also be a thing we expect.

\[Update\] I handed out one delta for a person who brought up the idea of having a mandatory disclosure of EULA to home pages so that there is consumer transparency, as an alternative idea to reign in the predatory practices hidden within the EULA culture. 

That being said, people keep bringing up the concept of security updates, I'm just going to go ahead and declare this point dead. I'm sorry but I've been pretty clear that I don't really consider security and maintenance updates a part of this scope because in general they don't involve significant overhaul of the product, nor do they typically require the purchaser to agree a new EULA or other terms and conditions. It's not compelling to me. "

1,2024-03-23,CMV: Jerusalem belongs 100% to the Jews,u/Not_Ill_Logical,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bloz3h/cmv_jerusalem_belongs_100_to_the_jews/,changemyview,"Though Jerusalem was replaced by the city of Samaria as the capitol of Israel (after the tribe of Judah was cast out because of Solomon’s son), Jerusalem continued as the capitol of the new and smaller nation of Judea. It was always the Judean’s (Jews) capitol city.

From here, the two separate nations of Israel and Judea lived side by side for over 500 years, even warring with other on occasion. But neither ever conquered the other.

Then, 500 years after that, the nation of Israel was conquered by the Assyrians and the nation of Israel ceased to exist. (Those people are now sometimes referred to as the 10 lost tribes of Israel.) But Judea, and its capitol city Jerusalem, were not conquered by the Assyrians and continued on after Israel was gone. And later, when the nation of Judea was itself conquered (by the Babylonians) and deported off their land, this tribe did return and the nation of Judah/Judea rose again. And Jerusalem was their capitol city again.

Muslims argue that Jerusalem is a holy city to them, but they already claim that about Mecca and Medina, both of which they say are holier than Jerusalem. How is it Muslims think they are entitled to multiple holy cities while the Jews should have none? Jerusalem belongs to the Jews.

Having said this, it’s important to note that 0% of the remainder of ancient Israel, that area where the 10 lost tribes once lived (aka: Samaria or the Northern Kingdom) belongs to the Jews. It was false for the returning Jews to claim ancient Israel as their own. Since the reign of Solomon ended, Judea was a separate nation from Israel and never ruled over any of it. In fact, when the Jews renewed their country in the 1940’s, they should have named it Judea, like it was 2000 years ago when Rome ruled over their land, and like it was 2500 years ago when the real nation of Israel vanished into history permanently, and like it was even further back, when the Jews left Israel to form their own nation of Judea."
1,2024-03-23,cmv: Celebrities should be held to higher moral standards ,u/whoyoumei,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1blp6ow/cmv_celebrities_should_be_held_to_higher_moral/,changemyview,"
Especially regarding their behaviours towards eachother

I'm not saying I agree with cancel culture, but if artists are openly bullying and antagonising eachother it should definitely be called out more.

If you really think about it, celebrities are the cool kids of the world, and being famous just means you're all in the same school. If some kid is caught being racist in school, they practically get shunned, but for some reason some celebrities get a ""get out of jail free card"". 

Of course this type of mentality invites a lot of unwanted hatred towards people.
I'm not talking about celebrities being terrible once, but those showing a pattern of repetitive behaviours. There are celebrities who had a history of being abusive, violent and racist. They get a ""second""(more than that) chance because they've apparently redeemed themselves. I just don't get it. If you're hurting multiple people over the course of many years, it's just unforgivable. Do we still not understand the impact of these agressions on people's lives?

Then there are the celebrities that have been caught serial cheating or breaking up their relationships in a disrespectful way. For us, it's a headline, for everyone else involved, it's their life. When we experience similar heartbreaks it rewires us, and I don't think people consider the feelings of famous people at all. I think it might be due to the fact that they have to show their happiness 24/7.

The celebrities that create cliques and make big deals out of kicking people out, and inviting them in, and then give no reasoning. It starts unnecessary hate trains. Clique behaviour is the worst. I'm sure we've all seen it first hand in school. It's terrible to experience, and it's even worse when you're being unnecessarily antagonised. Now factor in people having hundreds of thousands of fans, and some of these people going after you without any rhyme or reason. There's a certain amount of accountability that's required. Is it really ""savage"" when you consider how many hounds are released for your own personal vendettas and revenge? And don't get me started on the ""don't bully, this isn't what I wanted"". Be so forreal. You know exactly the amount of impact you have.

I'm not saying follow the idol culture in K-pop, I believe it's too severe, but they do a good job of ensuring that they don't allow idols with tendencies of bullying/racism to debut. Maybe it's business strategy to avoid getting cancelled, I can't be too sure 

Obviously it's impossible to get rid of the celebrity worship culture, but if we expect more decency from them, it can set better examples for our future generations. As much as we would hate it, kids end up idolising celebrities because they want to be like them. 

I know they face backlash for their wrong doings and deserve a second chance, but even if what they did wasn't physically, racially or bad in any other type of way, someone is getting hurt and we'd never see it.

P.s I have posted this opinion in another sub but I wanted to engage in a discussion about it here as well."

5,2024-03-23,"CMV: as a US leftist, I don't think universities should be (totally) state funded due to fear of government control",u/pebspi,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1blq7sv/cmv_as_a_us_leftist_i_dont_think_universities/,changemyview,"I am aware this is a traditionally conservative stance, but hear me out. I was thinking about this just overnight and am very open to having my view changed. I was pro state-funded college until a day ago, and I admittedly don't know how all of this works. To be clear, I am also aware that colleges are already state funded to an extent. Said funding (according to a quick google) is not the bulk of where colleges get their money, but it's not insignificant. 

College is not just a job training center. It's where experts in their respective fields conduct research to make advancements, and that research costs money. The people conducting the research need to be paid, and their research methods need to be funded. If you read a study or statistic on global warming, mental health, issues that affect minorities, or a thinkpiece on a piece of literature, odds are that information/perspective was gathered by a university. If the government gives money to the school to conduct that research, the college is inevitably going to have to answer to the government to some extent, as if the government decides it doesn't like what the college is doing, it can take away the research money.

Now imagine a republican government led by Donald Trump, if Project 2025 works. Mike Pence ran Indiana so you couldn't get liquor on Sundays. Ron DeSantis banned schools from teaching Critical Race Theory. This is all with laws. Now imagine if they controlled the funding of these schools.

Even if the politicians don't write a law that ""you can't teach these certain things,"" they can exert pressure by threatening to add or take away funding behind the scenes. Push my agenda, here's money. Push their agenda, no money. Sure, educators can stick to their principles in spite of the offers/threats and often will, but who's to say for how long, and how often? I find educators are pretty principled people who are serious about what they do, but still.  And if the values and customs of the younger generations get eroded over time by a Republican led state, they aren't going to be as compassionate towards those minorities affected by the conservative propaganda. When they're old enough to be professors and teachers, they'll happily comply with it for money without knowing it's propaganda. 

While these reasons lead me to believe largely state funded education is too risky,  I think college is very important because degrees make living affordable while also providing a chance for students to become more cultured. University serves as sort of a socialization center, where you meet other people from very different walks of life. This is why there are so many stories about people who entered college from a small town and changed a lot when they went to school. These people were exposed to other people and ideas that their hometowns didn't expose them to, and didn't allow them to consider. This happened to me, personally.  In addition, it is very difficult to survive financially without a degree right now, but I think the solution to that should be ""make living without a degree easier,"" not ""make degrees easier to get."" To be clear, I'm OK with them being easier to get in the sense of making them cheaper, but not making them so easy to get that you don't have to try or push yourself in class.

Here are some ideas to allow for this culturalization to remain intact while reducing the risk of government control:

* Somehow make it so that schools have a separate ""education"" fund and ""research"" fund. Government can contribute to the education fund but not the research fund. If colleges try to criss-cross them, there will be heavy fines. That way, government has less influence over research (although admittedly influence over education is arguably more dangerous). 
* Make the gap year an institution so that students can become more cultured and worldly without needing to go to college. Give 18-22 year-olds money to travel and see the world. Maybe sprinkle in some light education here and there. 
* Make living without a degree more affordable so that you don't have to go to college to survive. This will make using colleges for propaganda/banning information less appealing to the government since the population will be smaller. This could solve the financial issue but not the socialization issue. 
* Find another way to make college affordable which I don't know about

I would also like to acknowledge the potential counterargument that public K-12 is already funded by the state and taxes, so this government control is already possible and (in most people's opinions) already happening, as seen in the sanitization of how harshly the colonists treated the Native Americans. Without going into how effective it is or isn't and the tons of problems that American public schools have, it is true that the government can affect what is taught, but then universities can act as a fail safe where the truth is king.

Another counterargument is that not funding universities through the state basically turns them into businesses, and businesses can be shady and have their own agendas as well, and are often (read: usually) tied up with government anyways. And honestly? You got me there, but at least a business is going to be pragmatic and make itself money, and you can “overthrow” it by not attending and making them lose money. The government doesn’t always work like that. 

&#x200B;

Overall/Tl;dr: while I think college and/or living should be made more affordable, and the culturalization effect of college is important, I don't think state funded higher education is the way to go because it means a biased state rife with racism and homophobia could stamp out honest, subversive, and progressive education.

It is a certain kind of nurturing, a certain kind of society, a certain upbringing that reduces him into a criminal.",u/Sangay__Tenzin,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1blqp8m/cmv_no_man_is_born_as_a_criminal_every_man_is/,changemyview,"Man has never tried to remove the causes of injustice. On the contrary, in the name of justice, he has been taking revenge on the individuals who were not obedient to the social order, to the establishment, to the vested interests. They were condemned as criminals, punished - and it was thought that justice had been restored.

In fact, the people who had been punished were really the victims. Justice was not restored. In fact, the people who were the root causes of injustice in the world had taken their revenge. Their revenge was fulfilled, and people were made afraid to go against the social order in any way.

It is very strange that during such a long history nobody has tried to look at why injustice exists at all. We have been trying to look only at individuals, and they are not the causes, only symptoms. For example, a poor man is forced to steal in certain circumstances. If you really want justice to be restored, his poverty should be removed. But no, you throw the poor man into jail for a few years, and you create more injustice in the society because then his children are bound to become beggars or pickpockets, his wife is bound to become a prostitute.

You have taken away the humanity, the pride, the self-respect of that man you have jailed; you have humiliated him so much that back in the society he will find himself a stranger who nobody trusts, who cannot get a job, who everybody avoids. Nobody wants to be friends with him. He is again forced to steal.

It is a known fact that once a man is forced into jail as a punishment, he automatically goes back again and again to jail. In the long run, the jail becomes his home, he becomes a jailbird. The outside world is just a holiday resort. Once in a while, he is out in the world - but the world does not accept him, does not treat him on equal terms with other human beings. Insulted, he also becomes revengeful. Revenge cannot create anything else except revenge. Hate creates more hate, revenge creates more revenge.

In jail he becomes more and more of an expert. He is no longer an amateur. The first time he was an amateur. In jail - which should almost be named a university for crime, a teaching school, a productive field for criminals - he learns that it is not the crime that is punished, but being caught that is punished. Don't be caught, and you have not committed a crime. There are senior experts in the jail; they teach the novice, they initiate him into the secrets of the criminal world. Each time he comes out of the jail, he is more mature as far as crime is concerned.

But perhaps the old humanity was not interested in removing crime completely. It was only interested in punishing the disobedient, the misfits those who wanted to go their own way, those who did not want to become a cog in the wheel, those who had a certain individuality. There was no other avenue open for them except crime. Crime was their

sort of rebellion.

The rebellious man and his world will look into the causes. No man is born as a criminal; every man is born as a sage, innocent. It is a certain kind of nurturing, a certain kind of society, a certain upbringing that reduces him into a criminal.

The society of the rebels will remove the causes. For example, poverty will not be allowed on the earth. And once poverty is removed, almost fifty percent of crimes will be removed, and fifty percent of judges, fifty percent of courts, fifty percent of law enforcement authorities, and fifty percent of laws just by removing poverty.

The US will use military force to ensure the any resolution to the conflict is bilateral, mutual and peaceful.

This has been the US's position since the 80s, but the geopolitics today is significantly different to the point where this position will need to shift. For a few decades now, PRC has explicitly disallowed ROC to declare independence and ROC has zero appetite for unification. There is no future where the resolution is bilateral, mutual and peaceful. Taiwan is de facto sovereign and independent and there is no path forward that changes that barring a PRC's invasion of Taiwan.

With the current US official position, it is incredibly risky for Taiwan to declare independence because it may lose the military protection of the US. This means that it's incredibly hard for them to establish proper diplomatic relations with other countries if they wish to do so. I think that the US should give Taiwan the OPTION to declare independence if they so wish. It doesn't mean that the US will recognise or support Taiwan as an independent state immediately, so this move will not violate the US's One China Policy either. To me, this move is simply a recognition that the geopolitics of China-Taiwan has shifted significantly and the future where there are two fully independent and sovereign states is very realistic path.

For other countries, once Taiwan declares independence, they no longer have to answer the thornier question of: does mainland China belong to ROC? Instead they just have to ask: does PRC have sovereignty over Taiwan? Which is a much easier question to answer for diplomatic purposes."
1,2024-03-23,CMV: Musical theatre is underrated and isn't 'cringey',u/Geo_5678,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1blshgl/cmv_musical_theatre_is_underrated_and_isnt_cringey/,changemyview,"I'm a huge fan of all theatre, but I especially love musicals. Musical theatre has a lot of stereotypes around it and I think too many people find it cringey. Here are my arguments against that.

1. People have very emotional reactions to music, so it's a great way to communicate messages across and make them impactful. People have no problem listening to songs so why should there be a difference when those songs are performed on a stage? Writers of musical theatre are just using a creative way to get a message across.
2. Loads of musical theatre songs are used on TikTok and nobody finds them cringey or weird, but for some reason those same songs are cringey or weird as soon as they are done with dancing on stage. 
3. People often think that the over dramatic acting associated with musical theatre is cringey, but there are so many examples of really raw, powerful acting in musicals that's not overdramatic at all. For example, check Samantha Pauly singing all you wanna do from Six, Elle McLemore singing lifeboat from Heathers or Philippa Soo singing burn from Hamilton. I used three examples here that people are more likely to know, and they show perfectly how powerful musical theatre can be (refer to point 1) and they also show that musical theatre doesn't have to be overdramatic at all.
4. Musical theatre can just be fun and that doesn't need to be cringey. What about people dancing and singing and enjoying themselves on stage annoys some people?

1,2024-03-23,cmv: N word should either be censored for everyone or shouldn't be censored at all.,u/Griems,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1blshya/cmv_n_word_should_either_be_censored_for_everyone/,changemyview,"Hi! This is something i feel strongly about, yet dont see being talked about. I am very excited to hear arguments i haven't heard before and am asking this in nothing but good faith! Being convinced would mean i dont have to be frustrated about not being able to change something that i think should be changed, which i look forward to.

 I am aware this could be controversial, but have trust that if we can all assume good faith here, that wont be a problem.

The idea that the n-word has quickly become SUCH a strongly guarded word for a group of people with a certain skin color, while it is a celebrated word for people with another specific skin color, seems deeply wrong to me. This seems like exactly the kind of todays segregation and dare i say, racism we try to fight against.

I use racism in this context to mean the division between people based on nothing but skin color however explicit or implicit.

I posit that either NOBODY can say that word, or EVERYONE can. If everyone can use the word, then it should follow the same 'rules' that any other word or insult follows: depending on the context, wording, relationship etc words can range from being humorous, innocent, jarring to offensive and even outright racist. However, this is dependent on context etc. and NEVER on the single word uttered by a person that happens to have an arbitrary skin color.

I would prefer anyone be able to say the word without it carrying any extra weight from the skin color of the speaker. However, if we decide NOBODY can say this, thats also fine by me. Theres 3 reasons:

1) I am not a fan of censoring words as I think banning words gives them power. I would much prefer we as humans come together and become bigger than our history by recognizing the historical significance of the word, yet deciding to let that word live on in a positive way (shared language/vocabulary between people) instead of in that segregating way.

2) All people should live together as one. Cultures are supposed to be celebrated, shared and open to anyone appreciative of them. People living together will naturally start adopting eachothers mannerisms/language/habits/... This is to be embraced and celebrated! This is exactly what unites us despite physical differences.

If i am white and brought up in a black neighbourhood, we share an important history and identity. Yet I will always be somewhat alienated because i cannot fully participate in the dominant culure. This does nothing but interfere with integration, which is such an important thing to unite people despite differences.

This point 2 is probably the most important one for me.

3) a last point as to why i prefer to keep the word for everyone instead of nobody is because i recognize the cultural significance of the word for black people. Its part of a very deep core vocabulary for them and I appreciate that. It would be a shame to get rid of that for them if we can instead just all share in it and get the same result (uniting).

Would love to hear how people disagree."

Sure, what the AI will produce will be incredible but what defines, to start off with, art is pure representation. When people draw art, it opens up this “world” in their head of storytelling, by that I don’t solely mean using several pieces of art to create an animation, but every aspect (facial expressions, gesture, posture, colour scheme) of a single drawing is completely customisable to an artist to embed emotions into a viewer, whether this can be interest in this character, intimidation, admiration and so on. This effect is always immediately consumed by the viewer, creating a much deeper connection to this than AI art would.  


However, I know a lot may argue that in the coming years, AI may evolve to be able to mirror these features, but humans are who tell the AI to create this, and the exact precise information and detail to produce what you “envision” is ultimately impossible and the whole aspect of storytelling and representation in what’s created is completely empty. You will never create what you want with AI art, drawing art absolutely can, and with the severe dying of AI art over the past few years it is pretty clear that nobody on the Internet appeals to this whatsoever. And those worried that we will see a revival, don’t worry, my view and the severe disgust across everyone in the world via the Internet of AI art will always create backlash and ridicule anybody who uses this.  


As for AI coding, the same thing pretty much applies except for one pretty obvious thing. Coding and telling an AI to code are actually extremely similar. The purpose of coding is to have a computer do exactly what you want, the compact language forms allowing you to achieve exactly pin point what you want. Using the English language to “create coding”, not only requiring several thousands of paragraphs to achieve everything you want (which is the literal purpose of why regular coding exists, so you don’t have to make these long paragraphs) but you’ll never ever understand the outcome of what you have created, which is in most definite going to be severely imperfect. In summary, AI Coding is virtually impossible because it has already been tried before several decades ago, when computers started to rise, everyone instantly realised you couldn’t use the English language to create what you want on screen, which is why the language of coding is the way it is."

I believe in social services and think they’re necessary & if I make enough money (which I don’t right now but I have in the past) I definitely don’t disagree with paying for them. The problem is, you must be at such a low paying job to qualify and they help so much… there’s no reason you would start trying to improve your position in life unless there’s a reasonable path to improve your position significantly.

What I mean by this is that as someone who grew up extremely poor, with a mother that actually was unable to work due to disability I started going to community college after high school. My mom encouraged me to start working so I could pay her bills (not the best mom if I’m being honest she just wanted my money). Now that I’m working, her benefits get decreased & her housing costs increase as well. I’m already paying her rent (even though the government pays for everything… education is partly the issue here my mom didn’t understand her benefits or how much she’s screwing over her son) now that benefits are decreasing I have to pay her more rent. 

Okay now I decide to work more and make more because my mom is bleeding me dry, I can’t afford gas. Another rent increase with my pay increase, okay I pick up another job. Now our benefits are at risk of being taken away but I don’t have money I’m giving it all to my mom why would I quit? I keep trying to improve my status and as a result I have to move out. Now I’m living alone and the 3 bedroom house my mom easily affords she continues to pay for without my assistance. Meanwhile I struggle to pay for my own apartment. 

Eventually I get injured but I had a high paying job so disability is paying me 5k a month tax free. This isn’t really the best because the reality is, starting off it was really hard to qualify. Initially I survived on credit cards and savings before I moved in with my girlfriend, she was financially providing for a few weeks. Eventually I got my disability and yeah I was living large. 

I was making 8k a month before but so much was coming out of my 8k and I was working 70 hours a week to get this (yeah I guess the job wasn’t so high paying huh?). Now I’m getting 5k untaxed and not working? Yeah I need it, I deserve it but now my job fires me as a result of my leave. I have to find a new job… hopefully someone will pay me a reasonable wage right? In California it’s impossible to get an apartment to rent for less than 2300 a month. The worst area in Stockton/Modesto/Vallejo/Richmond/Compton (you get the point) an apartment is renting for 1900 it’s worth it to pay 400 in order to not get SHOT. 

Here’s the reality, finding a job is hard. Yeah anybody can work at McDonald’s for 16 an hour with no benefits. These are the only positions hiring. Nobody is hiring and paying a fair wage, nobody is hiring with benefits. The good reliable jobs you work might require you to work a full year before a small raise & it might be a decade before you make a livable wage. I had time to put in for my last job because I started young. I worked my way up. Now at 30 who’s going to put themselves through this? It’s easier to get free healthcare food stamps rental assistance etc. 

I’m not saying benefits shouldn’t exist, I’m not saying they should be lowered. Realistically what benefits represent are the bare minimum of what a human needs to survive. My mom needed her house because she had a large family and a disability. 4 kids and a mom. We all shared a bedroom until the sibling of the same gender turned 18 (this isn’t something we got until the oldest sibling was 16 they put you on a long waitlist for this and my family had a lot of other circumstances that justify qualifying for this kind of thing).

What I’m saying is that jobs need to START at a higher point than benefits do. You need to be able to quickly earn benefits and raises. If that’s not achievable which it likely isn’t, then benefits need a higher cut off in order to encourage people to work until they DONT NEED THESE BENEFITS. What’s happening now is “oh you’re starting your journey to better your life? You’re on your own, good luck surviving without me.” Which makes me think… why the fuck am I even doing this. "

1,2024-03-23,"CMV: Atheism, despite its claims of rationality and skepticism, is based on a series of assumptions and limited perspectives",u/Kind-House-5612,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1blvbvw/cmv_atheism_despite_its_claims_of_rationality_and/,changemyview,"Atheists often pride themselves on being rational and evidence-based, but their arguments reveal significant flaws.

**Epistemological Critique of Atheism**

Atheism, grounded in skepticism, claims that knowledge of a deity's existence is impossible. However, this very skepticism undermines atheism itself. If certainty is unattainable, then atheism's certainty in the non-existence of God is equally questionable.

Michael Martin's claim that atheism is a ""justified and rational true belief"" lacks epistemological backing. Atheism's reliance on ""mid-level principles"" ignores deeper metaphysical truths that transcend mere scientific rationalism. The noncognitivist approach, treating ""God exists"" as nonsensical, fails to engage with the rich, philosophical underpinnings of theism, reducing complex metaphysical concepts to mere semantics.

**Ontological Arguments for Theism**

Atheists often subscribe to ontological monism, but this perspective is limited. It dismisses the possibility of a non-material reality without sufficient justification. Theism, in contrast, acknowledges a more expansive reality that includes both the material and the immaterial, offering a more holistic understanding of existence.

The argument that only physical entities exist is inherently self-limiting. Theism posits a more inclusive ontology where both physical and metaphysical realities coexist, providing a richer framework for understanding the universe and our place in it.

**Logical Fallacies in Atheist Arguments**

Atheism's logical arguments against theism, like those addressing the problem of evil and divine hiddenness, are based on a mischaracterization of the nature of God. They assume a human-like deity bound by human-like limitations, ignoring the transcendent nature of the divine in theistic philosophy.

Epicurus' problem of evil, while provocative, oversimplifies the theistic understanding of God. It fails to consider the possibility of a divine purpose behind suffering and evil, an aspect central to many theistic doctrines.

**Reductionist Views on Religion**

The reductionist perspective, seeing religion as a mere psychological or social construct, ignores the depth and transformative power of religious experience. This perspective fails to account for the profound philosophical, moral, and spiritual insights that religion, and by extension theism, has contributed to human civilization.

Atheism fail to fully engage with the depth and complexity of theistic thought. Theism, with its richer, more inclusive ontology and its profound philosophical and spiritual insights, offers a more compelling and holistic understanding of reality."

When I’m getting closer to a new woman, life just feels brighter. And I’m more motivated to become a better man, for her. I eat healthier and I work out more to maintain her attraction and be better in bed for her. I put more effort into my hobbies to make myself more well-rounded and less clingy, and I put more effort in my career so we can keep doing fun stuff together. When I’m single and in a drought, I don’t care about shit to be honest. I still do all of the above, but with much less vigor and consistency. Because seriously, what is the point?

And do I even have to say anything about intimacy and sex with a woman? Pretty much better than any drug, food, tv binge, or video game I can think of. There’s maybe a select few accomplishments in my life that have given me more joy, but it’s debatable.

It seems childish to judge someone on what gives their life meaning, as if your reason is better than mine. Whether it be success with women, your bank account, your family, your physique, or your guitar hobby…who gives a shit? All of it is temporary, and we’re only here for a good 80 years anyway.

4,2024-03-23,"CMV: Rhaenyra is not a well written, believable protagonist in House of the Dragon ",u/Kalvin-TL,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1blwlxj/cmv_rhaenyra_is_not_a_well_written_believable/,changemyview,"**SPOILERS FOR THE SHOW AND EVERYTHING ASOIAF**


I still like the show, quite a bit actually. It has a lot of problems from being a very strange season of TV that speeds through 25 years just to set up the main conflict of the series. However, I think Rhaenyra’s character isn’t handled well and she’s pretty flat and unbelievable as a result. 

I also want to establish from the jump that I am supportive of feminist themes in fiction, however rudimentary, if they’re done well. Alicent is an effective contrast with Rhaenyra here. 

Alicent is wronged by her father, husband, and a social order that sanctions it all. Yet Alicent clearly imbibed her father’s priorities. She directs all her otherwise justified anger out on Rhaenyra unfairly. She helps her shithead son ascend the throne under the mistaken belief that was her husband’s dying wish. All through out she tries to minimize bloodshed. Alicent is both a victim and overall fairly earnest and well intentioned by ASOIAF monarch standards, but still has manifest flaws. Those shortcomings originate in her victimization. It’s very tragic, human, and believable.

The way *the show portrays it*: Rhaenyra is never wrong, only *perpetually wronged* by the world. Furthermore, the show’s morality and plot curve and bend around Rhaenyra’s actions to make it this way. 

Let’s look at this chronologically. It is deeply unjust that she cannot be a free person who can love on her own terms. Yet at the same time what she did to Criston was sketchy at best. The power dynamics are obvious and she was reckless with him. But let’s not fixate on that! The show wants us to feel bad that her father and ex-bestie step mom are on her case for getting laid. And Criston become a toxic ex boyfriend villain straight out of a teen drama anyway - so the writers don’t want us to fret about the lead up to that at all. 

Rhaenyra is the heir and her sons her successors. It is unfair that she wasn’t the heir originally by default because of her gender. Not to sound repetitive but I want to make clear that she is oppressed under a sexist system. That said, she is still a literal princess. On top of that she is allowed to love with greater liberty than most because her father, the king, runs cover for her or is otherwise willfully blind. But let’s not focus on that! The show wants us to understand this as: Isn’t it so ridiculous and evil that a feudal society built on bloodlines is reluctant to metabolize the most obvious bastards ever? 

This is disappointing because they could have made it a more complex and character defining conflict. Rhaenyra cares about her duty to the realm and her duty to save the fucking world. Yet she brazenly has obvious bastards. I am ok with all of this if it was treated as a mistake, or resulting from human frailty. It would be a real GRRM ass story: The human heart in conflict with itself. Instead the show just focused on how everyone is so uptight about illegitimate children or is just cynically trying to gain power by having them established as bastards. That’s true, but in the same way it’s true that Westeros should probabaly elect their leaders with popular suffrage. It isn’t the world the characters live in and Rhaenyra should know better. 

Rhaenyra and Daemon presents something of a missed opportunity. It whitewashes the Laenor shit to a laughable degree. Yeah they had to kill an unnamed rando for Rhaenyra to marry her uncle zaddy. But it was a no name mook, and unlike the source material, Laenor lives happily ever after. I’m sorry but that part felt like team black tumblr fanfiction. There should be more of a cost for Rhaenyra getting the husband she wants and needs for the upcoming war. 

The worst part is that the one time where we’re confronted uncharitable interpretation of Rhaenyra’s character and actions is the dagger scene. Alicent was not entirely wrong that Rhaenyra is privileged and protected. Rhaenyra doesn’t have to play by the same rules as anyone else, including the Queen. I would truly love for Rhaenyra and the audience to at least tackle that perspective…..Yet it comes when Alicent snaps and tries to kill her on the spot. And the ultimate takeaway at the end of that encounter is that Alicent is just a self righteous, vengeful hypocrite and hella jelly. That’s the last word. It isn’t entirely untrue either, but we are already shown Alicent in a negative light. It’s the first we see of her after the time skip. 

I hope my point is somewhat coming across. The show runners want her to be sympathetic and in the right no matter what reckless, morally grey, etc. things she engages in. Ned Stark is one of the most straightforwardly good and honest characters in the HBO shows. Even then he struggled over what the right decision was. The show established that the true heir, Stannis, would not be a good king. He certainly made miscalculations throughout.

Jon Snow, who is a far more boring and straightforward hero unlike the source material, still had to hang a young boy. He had to betray the wildlings trust for what he believed is the greater good. The writers didn’t make it easy for him by having all of his wildling friends turn into mustache twirlers the second he had the opportunity to make it to castle black. 

GOT tries to tackle the decisions they make and their conflicting desires.

With Rhaenyra, again, they make her the sympathetic party and/or victim no matter what. She could get on dragonback and attack a Green city. But then someone would explain how they evacuated literally every single civilian in 20 minutes before it happened so it’s all above board. Then they could cut to a scene of her running over flea bottom peasant children with a hummer. But as she exits the vehicle triumphant music would play and we’d see all the kids had nazi armbands on so it’s fine please dont give it any additional thought. 

I have no issues with Rhaenyra being the protagonist. I have no issues with her being heroic and even having the ultimate goal of protecting the realm for the long night. I am happy for her to be a flawed character who makes mistakes as well. The problem is that it doesn’t feel like her status is *earned* by her so much as the screenwriters really put their thumb on the scale. Anything questionable she does never reflects on her character in any way. The writers twist it until it is just another excuse for bad faith actions against her *and nothing else*. 

The show clearly put a lot of stock into the relationship between Rhaenyra and Alicent and wants to keep building on that. I am excited to see where this goes. I just wish Rhaenyra was as human and 3 dimensional as Alicent.

Rarely anyone pushes women to have *good* personalities. Good is subjective. 

I think a lot of mothers and less conventionally attractive men/fathers teach women to seek personality over looks, and at the same time create negative stereotypes about good looking men, to give men with less attractive features a chance in the world.

This is proven by simply looking outside. Women with conventionally attractive features are more commonly seen with less conventionally attractive men than the reverse. It’s not even close. 

Men also agree more on who is beautiful than women do, and I think this is based on how women are socialized. Looks are not as subjective as we think. Sharp jawlines indicating cardiovascular exercise, muscles, good weight, height and proportional features, will always be seen as attractive. 

Again, women are TAUGHT to look for *good personalities* which honestly is more subjective than attraction. Many *good* people are pompous, rude, self serving, etc. No one is perfect and everyone hurts somebody at some point, sometimes by purely existing at a particular point in time. 

For example, I scares a woman on the street just from being muscular. She admitted that I scared her by doing nothing. My presence caused her to react in fear. She walks a completely different way now even though she knows I was just minding my own business. 

Women’s romantic options are monitored by society and we teach them to seek personality to give more men a chance. No one has issues taking down hood looking men a notch because ppl assume their life is easier. "

The mob wrongly assumes he's mass shooter who killed someone unprovoked. They chase him and try to beat him. Then the 2nd guy tries to beat him with his skateboard.

Then the 3rd man no longer has the right to carry the hand gun. Yet still brought it. He sees Kyle lower the gun. Yet still moved in to shoot. Only then is he shot, non-fatally.

Kyle is an idiot who should've never been there. The 3 men are actual, inarguable criminals though and no better than he is."

For context, I’m a virgin in college and have never had luck with really attracting women. I’m still like this but I’m hoping for change.

“Be attractive, don’t be unattractive.” (Wow, great advice. Thanks for being vague and unhelpful)

80/20 rule (they keep citing an old study from online dating)

Give up, it’s already over (Wow, great advice to give to someone who is struggling)

It’s always a variation of these three things that keep being brought up. People on Reddit make it seem like average people literally are unable to date, when that’s not true. So many male posters on here are incredibly pathetic and demotivating. If anyone posts a comment being contrary to these points it’s downvotes for them.

Another sub full of victims is r/antiwork. Everyone on that sub believes that life is literally unwinnable, when in reality it’s challenging in America, but not as bad as they make it seem. You’d think America is a third world country based on the posts in there. 

So, yeah. Reddit is good for a number of things and can good advice but I learned that there are so many victims in here it will severely skew your view on reality. Dating is not only for the top 20 percent of men and America’s economy is not some labyrinthine challenge that only the few can solve. People here just want to be pathetic."

As long as you’re slightly extroverted, and you have the right look, you’re in, it doesn’t take a lot of education or talent. You don’t really need to go to acting school. Sometimes when I look at a lot of these actors, and I try to figure out where they came from, they were just discovered at some store, or something like that. It’s nothing ever profound. Or they’re related to someone in the business. We worship these actors so much, because they do provide a lot of entertainment, but I don’t think that they are inherently Better than anyone else. I think you could probably pick people right off the street, and put them in the movie, and they would be no worse or better than the current actors that are out there.

- The government often blocks mergers (Activision+Blizzard)
- This post is not as much about politics as it is about you and your families retirements

Okay so let’s talk about SPACs before we the truth social merger. A SPAC is, simply put, a newly utilized vehicle to IPO. Some businesses prefer SPACs because they lessen the risk of litigation which often arises during a traditional IPO. In short, SPACs tend to be cheaper, but they come with more risk to the investor. 

SPACs are somewhat controversial in the M&A space because they are rarely profitable to the investor and often just function as a vehicle for fraud/selling a shitty company to investors that don’t know better. 

Truth social’s SPAC is insanely risky for so many reasons, the main of which being:

1) truth social isn’t profitable
2) the space is already saturated with many other media conglomerates and spin-offs
3) one person owns 59% of the shares (Trump), meaning that person is highly motivated to pump the stock by any means possible, including fraudulent misrepresentation
4) investors may not have any way to actually recover their investments as it’s unclear whether the PSLRA (private securities litigation reform act, which lets investors sue alongside the government) covers SPACs.

1-4 is honestly enough to block the SPAC imho. 60% of investor money will be pocketed by a private party (trump, who owns about 60% of the shares). That money is virtually unrecoverable in the presence of fraud. So if Truth Social fails, investors are basically barred from recovery short of fraud/touting actions against trump. And the money is totally unrecoverable if the trump wins the election.

5) other media companies stock prices naturally fall.
6) 90% everyone’s retirement funds, ETFs and the like, include shares of companies like Fox and Warner Bros. Those companies prices fall in conjunction with the merger. Meaning truth social’s merger loses even non-investors money.
7) that means this one merger is guaranteed to lose EVERYONE some money.

Now, it is true that Trump is a “private citizen”. But that’s not an entirely accurate description. He’s a presidential candidate (and many claim he is still the president). He’s afforded many special privileges as a just former president, and he enjoys immunity from suit if he were to win in 2024.

From a litigation and economic standpoint, there is a major problem with a presidential candidate facilitating public offerings of his closely held company. Do we really want a president who holds a majority share of a media company? 

So, in my honest opinion, the government should block the merger (IPO basically) until at least 2025. It’s way too risky to let the possible president hold a controlling stake in a media company whose success is directly tied to beating its competition in the market of public opinion. We need to snuff out the governments hold over the media we see, not allow the two to become one. "

Before the over-the-counter birth control revolution in America in the 60’s and 70’s men took for granted that their wives would have kids until they couldn’t anymore. Especially catholic families. Sex was a right of the husband and, whether they planned it or not, pregnancy was a common side effect of that right. Hence the families with like, 14 kids. That meant at minimum the husband and wife had sex 14 times. Maybe the only sessions in their marriage and each session produced a child. But it was a given that the risk was always there.

With contraception women for the first time had an easy, relative to what was available in the past, option to not only gain some semblance of control over their sexual lives and bodies and unsurprisingly when they did they decided they wanted a far less children to take care of"

1,2024-03-23,"CMV: There is currently no actual definition for ""man"" or ""woman""",u/anfal857,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bm58cc/cmv_there_is_currently_no_actual_definition_for/,changemyview,"I see a lot of videos of people getting humiliated for not knowing how to define what a man or woman is when asked. The implication here is that there's an actual solid definition for these words that exists, but in reality, the cocky person asking the question doesn't really know what a man or woman is either. This becomes very apparent when their own definitions are questioned. 

Before I continue, I should state that I am genuinely wanting to be convinced that sex is binary and the words ""man"" and ""woman"" can be defined. However, there are some stipulations I have:

1. The definition must only include the analytic qualities that actually *define* what a man or woman is and have no synthetic qualities. So for instance, if you define a woman as ""having two X chromosomes,"" then that quality should be present in all instances. There should not be any woman without two X chromosomes or non-women with two X chromosomes. The definition should include all men/women and exclude all non-men/non-women. Similarly, a bachelor is unmarried by definition. I should not be able to find even 1 instance of a married bachelor. If you can only give synthetic qualities (i.e. qualities that aren't universal) then you have not defined what a man or woman actually is. You have merely given a list of various random characteristics that are not inherent to being a man or woman.
2. Give me a reason why intersex people do not disprove the concept of a sex binary. While it may be tempting, do not resort to using cliches like ""exceptions prove the rule."" If exceptions cannot disprove rules, then there is no way any rule could ever be disproven. Most people have black, brown, or blonde hair, yet we do not say hair color exists in a trinary, with red hair just being an anomaly that exists within the black/brown/blonde trinary. Qualifying intersex as an anomaly, disorder, rarity, or whatever will not get you off the hook. Because then you're essentially just saying ""sex is a binary except when it isn't."" Also, keep in mind, there are more intersex people than there are people with red hair.

Addressing possible a possible counterargument:

""You can still say sex is binary the same way you can say humans have 10 fingers."" 

If you are just speaking casually and informally to someone who doesn't particularly care about nuance or accuracy, then sure, saying that sex is binary or that humans have 10 fingers can be forgivable. But when you are speaking with scientific precision, you need to account for exceptions. If you define a human as ""having 10 fingers,"" then when confronted with a person with more or less than 10 fingers, you will either have to say that the person is not human or modify your definition. Otherwise, there is no reason a person couldn't also include ""having brown hair"" or ""having blue eyes"" in the definition of human."

1,2024-03-23,CMV: Movies are better than TV shows,u/Pow32,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bm7sfl/cmv_movies_are_better_than_tv_shows/,changemyview,"**(1) Quality over quantity**

The most obvious factor is the allocation of budget. Movies are able to invest much more resources per minute of screen time than a TV show, resulting in consistently higher quality production, VFX, costumes, etc. However, this also applies on an artistic level. Even low budget indie movies and arthouse films are able to achieve a higher quality audiovisual experience per minute of screen time than a high budget TV show can. 

To illustrate, I will use the musical score as an example. While there certainly have been great individual songs composed for TV shows, it's not realistic to have a 50 hour TV show that has truly great music composed throughout the entire run time. Compare that to movies, where a good score results in top tier music for nearly every single scene. Even the best composer in the world is going to be spread thin if they have to compose music for an entire 10 hour season of TV. This same exact principle applies to all aspects of filmmaking. Cinematography, editing, writing, etc. 


**(2) Storytelling**

A lot of people will point out that TV shows have much more time to develop characters and flesh out complex plots, but I don't think this is particularly beneficial for most stories. The advantage of the short run time of a movie is that they are able to drive home the drama and themes of the story much more effectively, because they cut out all the filler and focus on the true essence of the story. 

For example, Darth Vader is one of the most iconic fictional characters of all time, even though he only has a total of 34 minutes of screen time in the entire OG trilogy. In just 34 minutes between 3 movies, the audience completely understands what Vader represents, and succinctly experiences his entire character arc. Nearly every moment he is on screen is legendary, there is no filler. This is part of what makes him so memorable and iconic. Less is more. 

Regarding themes, I will illustrate using 2 recent examples. In Dune Part 2, we experience a story about religious exploitation on a biblical scale in just 2h 45m. While the movie had to make cuts and changes from the book, it was focused on the essence of the story, and it powerfully drives home the point in a succinct manner. Compare this to GOT's Daenerys Targaryen, who is also a messianic figure turned tyrant, similar to Paul Atreides in Dune, yet this story is stretched out over the course of 8 seasons. Both stories deal with the dangers of a messianic figure who is exploiting a culture, but Dune is way more effective at expressing this, largely because it is only focused on the essence of the story, and not bogged down by empty filler content. 

I will also briefly talk about general story structure. TV shows have a tendency to have very short act 1 and act 3, with hours and hours of act 2, which ultimately results in pretty imbalanced stories. While act 2 is usually the most interesting part of a story, act 3 is where the actual point of the story comes together. TV shows often times just keep act 2 going on forever to keep the audience coming back for more. I think this backfires very often, which is why so many TV shows end up shitting the bed at the end. Movies generally don't have this problem. 


**(3) Conclusion**

Movies are much higher quality on a minute to minute basis than TV shows. They are greater audiovisual / artistic experiences, and they are a more effective storytelling medium. "

I’ll start with my main reasoning.

(1) It’s getting harder and harder to own anything of significant value. Car? 500-800 a month payment plus have to have full coverage insurance. Obviously we all know how the housing market is. Wages haven’t increased anywhere close to the value of homes. Corporations are buying up residential housing and turning it into rentals. Upper class Americans are doing the same plus air bnb. 

(2) Lobbying, Gerrymandering, citizens united, representatives trading stocks, and even just the cost of a political campaign mean regular citizens just are not going to be represented in the government. Worse it’s legal/illegal corruption that gears the governments interests towards corporations and the wealthy. These are issues of their own but they tie to the consumer not being valued mainly by the lack of protections we have in the market/economy. 

(3) I’ll end with this because it’s what set me off but look at advertisements. I go to a website to read an article and I get a short paragraph, ad, short paragraph, ad, page lags out and sends me to the top, scroll to find my paragraph, repeat. It’s extremely unprofessional, they completely disregard the user experience for the sake of more money and it’s common. Ads at the gas pump.

However i feel that there is nothing holding boys back and there isn't any sexism against them at all in school. This is more of a laziness issue on the boys rather any discrimination against them.

 Studies show that teachers spent more time helping boys than girls. Girls have an incredibly misogynistic dress code put against them that can hinder their education greatly. Girls have to deal with harassment from boys and predatory behaviour from grown men. Historically girls were not allowed to be in schools or receive education.

Yet despite all these obstacles they face, the girls far outperform the boys, that shows dedication and hardwork from the girls and also how much more capable they are than the boys. And the final evidence i found is that girls only schools do far far better than boys only schools, but boys in mixed schools does better than girls in mixed schools. 

All this shows that there are more obstacles for girls than there is for the boys and that this completely the fault of the boys for not being as good as the girls despite all the privileges and attention given to them. 

I want to be helpful and i do understand that men face issues but how is this an issue of sexism against boys instead of laziness and incompetence of the boys.

The reason I believe this is because with the prevalence of the way gender is slowly being broken down more and more as a social construct men, women, and nonbinary people (etc. cant list some as its against rules but I don't want discourse on this. this is just an explanation on why I hold the view) that gender is less apparent on the physical sense and even sometimes mental. I believe there's a significant overlap between men and women eg 0.1% of men would look and act like most women (and some indistinguishable), vice versa etc. basically I think there's always an exception to your straightness and you could find someone of the same gender that you find attractive and would date. I think the reason we don't is because there's so few people that meet our standards outside of our sexuality and also to preserve your own sexuality due to societal pressures. EG if a you were a straight man and saw someone perfect in everyway (looks, mental, etc. maybe even was the exact same as your current GF) but they were a man would you really turn them down if societal pressures didn't have a role in it?

To me even genitals aren't applied here anymore either due to that not defining gender either. I think a lot of it could be preference like hey I want to have kids some day so I'm straight however that 1 guy I would totally date if they could have kids which is more a preference rather than sexuality. what does everyone think?

I want to be clear I don't think sexuality is a choice but instead think its always a heavy skew on your preferred gender and the preference/choice aspect is of those that are what they want out of the relationship rather than the person themselves EG kids, genitals, aesthetic etc. 

I know this is a very unpopular opinion so wanted to see what others views are outside of my own and why you think personally you are not bisexual. I would like to also add that I'm asexual and biromantic so keep that in reference to your replies that I don't feel sexual attraction the same as most which could be why I hold this view. Because of this I also want to add I believe asexual people with no desire to date are truly asexual and not bisexual/biromantic. this post is more in reference to those with sexual attraction"

Of course, we learned all about positive things the US has done (defeat the British, stop the Nazis, yay!), but there is little to no discussion of the negative. Things like the Trail of Tears and Japanese Internment (most of which were at least second-generation American citizens) are touched on, but only a with a glance. There is no true discussion of these horrors and what they mean for the US on a broader scale. These are the things they discuss.

They don't discuss the really bad stuff. They don't discuss government funded experimentation on and sterilization of African Americans at university campuses. They don't discuss the fact that Navy weapons tested and infected thousands of citizens in San Francisco despite not fully understanding the possible medical effects. They don't discuss the way the government introduced and installed private property in Hawaii and then bought it all up for profit. They don't discuss the way we've toppled governments (either directly or through support) and installed evil tyrants for the sake of American gain. If these are the things we know about and choose not to teach, what do we not know about? I'm not a conspiracy theorist guy, but this is just what's out there and that's pretty scary.

Finally, the fact that most citizens seem to be entirely unaware of or in active denial of the propaganda apparatus is precisely the indicator of its success. So many Americans point at countries like Russia and China, but don't realize ours is on that same playing field.

I would like to be proud of my country, the only home I've ever known, but I'm ashamed of these things. I'm curious what others' thoughts are."

Common examples include: a preference if they dressed more modestly, or if they didn’t go out to clubs / bars.

My view is that as individuals are not forced to stay in a relationship so no one should be shamed into not expressing their views or be labeled as controlling.

Communicate is vital in relationship and society suppressing men’s concerns by labeling preferences as controlling or insecure will only leave one partner uncomfortable."

1,2024-03-24,CMV: The statement ''Antizionism isn't antisemitism'' is just false.,u/Admirable-Cherry6614,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bmd92h/cmv_the_statement_antizionism_isnt_antisemitism/,changemyview,"I have a few ideas surrounding this:  


1. It makes no actual sense. Like, these people think that Israel engaging in a defensive war against Gaza where the vast majority of the world Palestinian population aren't getting got is genocidal. But Hamas' mission to wipe out every single Jew in Israel (50% of the world Jewish population) isn't. Hmm.  


2. People think Hamas are ''freedom fighters''. They aren't. They do not care about Palestinian displacement or poetic justice. They are just terrorists and former members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Thus, their main objective is to destroy a non-Islamic, westernised state in the region and build a fundamentalist Muslim state atop.  
When Palestinians do support them, they do so because they view it as ''this might lead to justice''. But even they are by large aware that that's not what Hamas really cares about, the death of non-believers is.  
Extremely popular statements in the pro-Palestine movement pertaining to freedom fighting and freeing land have like zero connection to Hamas ideology, or Palestinian terrorists that came before. They are merely just distractions away from this ''kill nonbelievers'' ideology, brainwashing tactics to assist in the normalisation and facilitation of it, an indoctrination tactic in journalism, a PR shield for something far darker.  


3. Third. If zionists went around saying that their political beliefs were entirely separate from Israeli politics, people would absolutely lose their shit at them. Using mitigating language to detach yourself from what you clearly ideologically support - cute trick, I think. I'm not buying it.  


4. I think that people who support Palestine need to stop bullshitting people with ''Palestine has literally no connection to antisemitism''. It is beyond insane that Arabs can just slaughter hundreds of thousands of their fellow Arabs all over the Middle East, and western leftists will give zero fucks. And then turn around and purport to give a shit about the sanctity of Arab life. Half a million have died in Syrian Civil War, I do not remember these people giving a fuck literally ever. They still don't give a fuck now."

",u/enter_the_bumgeon,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bmelwa/cmv_men_have_a_mental_load_just_as_woman_have/,changemyview,"First a note. Please dont turn this in a man vs woman discussion. Or who is better. Or who has is worse. Please only focus on the mental load. Thank you. 

So for those who are not faminilar with the mental load. Its about how, even when men and woman do the same amount of household work, the woman has to carry the mental load. Meaning thinking about tasks, planning etc. Basically being the manager of the household. Now I do believe the mental load is real, even though its a bit of a generalisation and isnt true for every household.
If I made a mistake about the mental load, please correct me in the comments and I'll edit. 

So even though the mental load is real in my opinion. I dont think the discussion is fair, since nobody ever talks about the mental load for men. So i'm going to talk about what I think falls under the mental load for men. Please note that, just like the mental load for woman, this is based on some generalisations. 

So for me the mental load for men is. 
Finances. Not income per se, but handeling of finances. Stuff like bills, taxes, insurances. This is something men worry /think about more than woman.

Safety. When (potential) danger arrises, the man will protected the family. 

Repairs and maintenance. Generally speaking, the men takes care of stuff around the house. 

There are probably more examples here. But I think this is enough the get the point across? Again, its not about who's mental load is bigger, or more important. Its about showing that, while the woman mental load is real, men also have a very real mental load they carry. Men and woman arent the same, and thats okay, so naturally theyd have different mental load. I think in a relationship this is very complementair. 

So this is my view on the subject. But I never ever hear anyone talking about a male mental load, when mental load gets discussed. So I might be wrong. Im totally open to the concept of me being wrong, but at this moment I dont think I am. So change my view? 

*So a man vs woman kinda discussion on the internet is always tricky. So please note that, while I dont believe men and woman are the same, I do believe they are absolutely equal.

23,2024-03-24,"cmv: Party line Republican candidates, including presidential candidate Donald Trump, have no uniquely beneficial policy proposals. ",u/UnawareYetThere,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bmfg6h/cmv_party_line_republican_candidates_including/,changemyview,"First, I’d like to specify what I mean: My current view is that when the policy platforms most likely to be implemented by each party in the 2024 federal elections are compared to each other, those being the Republican and Democratic parties, Republican policy plans are either equivalent or worse in performance on reasonably expected outcomes than Democratic policy plans. 

My current preferred dimensions of reasonably expected outcomes include: 

1: Upward progression in the human development index for more municipalities than not.

2: Decreasing wealth inequality between the Upper, Middle, and Lower classes.

3: Decreasing racial and gender/sex based gaps in economic indicators

3: Faster, cheaper, and more successful on average administration of routine services(Snap, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, etc)

4. Mutually beneficial and lasting relationships with foreign nations. 

5. Improving/maintaining environmental quality(air, water, soil, climate)

6. Improving/maintaining consumer product quality and affordability. 

7. Encouraging convincing national unity.

Note: I would like to add the qualifier of “sustainably” to each of these. That meaning: likely to persist into the extended future to the best of our predictive capabilities. I say this to address short term benefits that fail to last, such as the (as I’m under the impression) temporary and small economic boosts uniquely created by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 

This cmv essentially has two points of contention then: first the points about policy quality and also what variables are best to measure such.

I made this cmv as extensive as possible because I would like to find any examples that counter this argument along any of the proposed, or suggested, dimensions. I do not expect anyone to comment on each aspect of this post, but rather discuss any points that you may have specialized knowledge on. I would consider my view changed if I am convinced that the evidence we could reasonably expect to have demonstrates any one or more uniquely beneficial policy proposals made by and likely to pass the federal Republican Party line.

It is destructive to find the source of decision making. If decision making has no source, or a source that is not ourselves, if this became a popular dogma by the populous that could lead to a large rise in nihilism. I do believe this belief could be a freeing concept for a small portion of the populous. Overall it’s not a question worth pondering for society as a whole.

The popular rebuttal is for practical matters such as the criminal justice system. I would argue this has nothing to do with free will, but the lack of empathy. Regardless if you fully believe in free will or not you can still empathize with a human being’s circumstances. A Somalian pirate has conducted terrible acts of violence, but where those individuals were born, the poverty, and the access to quality of role models undoubtedly had large impact on how they ended up committing those acts of violence. 

The better question is not thinking if free will exists or not, but understanding the amount an environment can impact of human beings decisions. That fact should be unarguable, but it doesn’t do us any better to take it a step farther and ponder the fact that free will is a falsehood.

I state this argument to hopefully find a rebuttal, because pure truths are pretty rare, so I’m sure I missed something and I want to know what it is. "

It's because for me personally, I feel more satisfied in my accomplishments of knowledge and exploration when it's done by me alone and not ordered or demanded by anybody else

I also don't enjoy doing artwork based on anyone else's standards other than my own. Because it it's quite limiting and restricts myself to their expectations 

But I know it's supposed to be limiting and therefore help challenge myself because without challenge, there's no progress.

 But at the same time, it just feels more gratifying when I set difficult challenges of my own

And it's not like I wouldn't wanna create anything for others. I'd still wouldn't mind doing commission jobs, art requests, and creating projects for customers if I had the opportunity to make money and business off of it 

My mom and I argued about this. And she said that if I really want to not spend a long time in college, that I should only do the classes that mostly pertain to my major and interests at the moment (Graphic Design 1, 2, etc.) And once I'm done within a year, I'll be able to take those classes into an intern job for Graphic Design, and make enough money to self invest in other projects in the field of art if that's what I wanna do

* We have the NATO for protection, we don't need the EU for that. In fact European countries have completely neglected their military responsibilities and forced the US to squeeze their own population to compensate for our own failures. It's disgraceful. I think nobody can argue on this point.
* The EU is a trade block. Trade wars cost mankind trillions of dollars in lost productivity. The evidence for this is overwhelming and the consensus amongst economists is virtually unanimous.

I invite anyone to provide me with good reasons for the EU to continue to exist.
*  Even as far as the environment is concerned things are very disputable. They've been subsidizing megafarms with billions for decades, which economists universally agree is tremendously wasteful as well as unfair to developing countries, whereas the environmental damage is again well documented. So it's extremely hypocritical for the EU to take control there now.
* I would go even further and say that the EU undermines democracy by having an overpaid and corrupt elite impose their personal values on other countries. When I look at people like Frans Timmermans or Ursula von der Leyen I frankly just want to vomit. They do not represent me or my people in any way.

An emergency department with bad reviews means nothing to me. They’re usually doing a good job and actually triaging properly. That means some people wait hours. That’s the system. That’s not the doctors, nurses, physios faults.

There are so many of these entitled people that they will always complain about public hospital care. They don’t understand that healthcare may be a right, but a perfect system was never the right.

For somebody who thinks ""I wouldn't stay with the other person forever if I got bored or I got unsatisfied after a while"", I have a simple suggestion: don't get married - it's literally not for you if you admit to yourself from the start that you aren't prepared to pledge undying commitment to this one other person, and effectively you are *lying* if you say ""yes"" at the alter, provably; just because you aren't dissatisfied now doesn't mean anything. By changing our understanding of marriage to bend to this new concept of it absolutely ruins marriage and only leads to a huge deal of divorce in society - I'm not necessarily saying we should change the laws but we absolutely should make divorce a taboo in the vast majority of cases - I'm obviously going to make the exception for things that are illegal such as spousal violence"

This is evident in examples like brexit where over 60% of 65+ year olds voted to leave, brexit overall having a damaging impact on the people of the UK, economists predicting that damage will continue for years. So why is it that people who won't even live long enough to see the negative impacts of their voting decisions are able to skew the votes so heavily.

Older people do vote more than their younger counterparts so they do skew votes, they more often vote out of national pride e.g. brexit. When voting your voting for a countries future, young people are the future of a country.

I don't want to be a cynical person at all. 

---------------------------------------------------

I'm worried that this feeling seems to be getting worse the more I try to find evidence to prove myself wrong. I'm also having trouble relating to people as I get older, because I keep seeing dishonesty and selfishness in others more and more and I just can't respect or identify with it.

To be clear, I don't believe people are motivated *purely* by self-interest as some definitions of 'cynicism' would say. What I feel is that everyone seems to be more dishonest than honest, and that when push comes to shove almost everyone else seems to be ultimately more selfish than not. Not 100% selfish, but generally over 50%, whereas I was taught to believe that people fall on a spectrum and average out at 50% (does that make sense?)

To say someone is ""purely"" selfish sounds like absolutist hyperbole, and I believe humans are much more complex than to say someone is all good or all bad. There are also countless examples of selfless acts all around us. I just keep seeing selfishness outweigh that selflessness more and more, and in more people. Same for dishonesty, which is ultimately a form of selfishness.

I pride myself in my ability to read people - those who know me have said the same thing over the years - and I read dishonesty and hypocrisy in people constantly. I pick up on inconsistencies and fallacies and recognize the behavior patterns in people who are lying. Many times I've told my wife or someone, ""I think this guy's full of shit,"" and my wife would roll her eyes but then later on it would be discovered somehow that he *actually was* a liar. We used to laugh about how often I would have this ""6th sense"" and it later turned out to be true.

But it's not just a ""sense"" that I get this feeling from, it's concrete observations. I see people feigning ignorance to manipulate a conversation, I hear people list altruistic reasons to care about an issue but then suddenly stop caring when it no longer benefits them, I watch the way people use argumentative fallacies or language tricks in debates. And I see how much this stuff is *accepted* by the wider population as normal. On reddit at times people encourage feigning ignorance lol. And it's not just dishonesty to others, because I also see how much people are willfully dishonest or in denial with themselves.

I get very lonely sometimes because I feel like I'm the only one in the world who *truly* cares about these things or understands what I see.

**TL;DR**: Can anyone out there convince me that people aren't mostly full of shit? Where are all the genuinely good people who really aren't fundamental liars or self-centered hypocrites? How do I find them?"
1,2024-03-24,CMV: It's okay to invalidate the identities of hyphenated-Americans and tell them that they're not one of whatever group they claim to be apart of.,u/SwamperOgre,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bmjbkw/cmv_its_okay_to_invalidate_the_identities_of/,changemyview,"To start this, a hyphenated American is an American citizen who can trace their ancestry to another part of the world, such as an African-American, Irish-American, Italian-American, Mexican-American, Asian-American. They're called this as a hyphen is usually put between the two words. 

I'm Irish (Like legit Irish, not the faux Irish from Boston), but my dad is German (this will be relevant in my argument.)

Now on the surface, there is nothing wrong with this. Americans like any other nationality are allowed to take interest in their heritage. 

However... In recent years, a good chunk of hyphenated-Americans have been going on a power trip with this. Particularly with the bullshit.

Because of this I totally think it's valid for people from the OG countries/continents (i.e. Ireland) to tell hyphenated-Americans (i.e. Irish-Americans.) that they're not one of them and that their identities are invalid.

Here's why I think so:

**Cultural Appropriation:**

Once a term used to describe a foreign culture taking aspects and turning them into something else. (Such as the Italians taking house music and making it big.) Pretty harmless 

Now thanks to the ""expertise"" of American university chicks with a saviour complex, a term that once meant cultural exchange and innovation has now been merged with the term cultural misappropriation to give hyphenated Americans a power trip over a culture that they themselves are not apart of.

African-Americans are dictating who can and can't wear cornrows, dreads or afros despite not being from Africa.

Mexican-Americans are dictating who can and can't celebrate Cinco de Mayo or el Día de los Muertos, who can or can't sell tacos or who can rock a sombrero despite not being Mexican themselves.

Asian-Americans are dictating who can and can't where Chinese or Japanese traditional atire, own Maneki-nekos, get dragon tattoos (or anything with dragon designs on it for that matter) despite not actually being from Asia.

Indian-Americans (not natives) are dictating who can and can't celebrate Holi or wear anything Indian Inspired despite not being from Indian.

And you get the point...

But why do people who are not from said country get to speak on the behalf of the people from the OG country, It's a bit entitled, isn't it? 

Like in terms of African Americans why do they, who's population size is 0.34% the size of the entire population of Sub-Saharan Africa, get to be the spokespeople for the various cultures and sub-cultures of almost an entire continent minus 5 countries. 

Why do Asian Americans, who's population size is 0.8% the size of the entire population of what would be considered Oriental Asia, get to be the spokespeople for the various cultures and sub-cultures of the eastern half of a continent?

The list goes on really...

Why do hyphenated-Americans get to decide who is and who isn't allowed participate in the cultures of the OG cultures?

The average African (like actual Africans from countries such as Nigeria and Botswana, not the 'Africans' from the hoods of Detroit) couldn't actually give a fuck if some fair skinned chick from somewhere in the middle of Germany wears cornrows. 

The average Mexican from Tijuana couldn't give a shit if some fair skinned chick from Australia celebrates Cinco De Mayo. 

The average Indian couldn't give a shit if a bunch of fair skinned Americans wanted to host a Holi run.

Once they're not being a dick about it all is good.

And I know I'm gonna get these arguments of, *""Oh well, African-American women are discriminated in jobs for their braids and Asian culture is made fun of and bla... bla... bla...""*

Okay, your country is fucked and has a bigoted system... Why is that any other nation's problem that you can't sort your shit out. You live in a democracy, utilise said democracy to fix your problems.

So I must ask, once again. Why do a group of American individuals who:

- Aren't from or have grown up in a certain country.
- Have a fabricated national identity that is based on a parasocial relationship to their great great great great grandparents who at this stage are either ash particles or maggot food in the ground.
- and Base their culture around glorified aspects and a romanticised view of the culture to which they claim to be a part of.

Get to decide who can and cannot participate in said culture when they themselves are not even apart of said culture and ironically enough committing cultural appropriation themselves?

That's like me deciding who can and can't participate in German culture by the proxy of my dad being German.

Who are they to decide who can and can't partake in a culture?

**Getting offended on the behalf of the OG country/culture.**

Now as an Irishman, I can laugh at myself. I can laugh at caricatures of the Irish. I like a good piss take now and then. They need some new material that isn't potatoes or leprechauns because that shit is more stale then Riley Reid's vagina. But I can take a good bit of banter about my home country and so can most people…

However it seems like a lot of hyphenated-Americans genuinely seem to not be able to take the joke and get offended on the behalf of others.

**Speedy Gonzales:** A relatively harmless cartoon mouse, actually quite popular amongst kids in Latin America and Spain. The “Latinx-Mexican-American-but-not-actually-from-nor-ever-have-lived-in-Mexico crowd” then decides to have a bitch fit because Speedy is offensive in their fragile little minds and decide to throw a bitch on twitter which eventually leads the Warner Bros to pull an iconic character from a kids show. 

**Apu:** There’s been a million fucking videos and posts on this topic actually explaining how Apu was actually quite an amazing and well developed character compared to the other characters of varying nationalities, so I’m not gonna go into that. But essentially, Hari Kondabolu, a rich upper class **American** of **Indian descent** decided because like most fucking people, he was bullied in school for an aspect that made him different from others and Apu was used as an insult towards him. Unfortunately, because the entitled rich brat decided not to go to therapy to deal with his issues, he decides to project his issues onto a relatively harmless character who was a staple character of a beloved franchise and because of the rich hyphenated-American’s bitch fit, Apu get’s pulled from the Simpsons. Go figure. *Despite the fact, out of a country of over 1 billion people, very few, if any actually gave a fuck about Apu or actually found him funny.

**The University of Notre Dame:** Now this one I can definitely comment on because unlike the people of Boston or Chicago, I’m actually Irish. So there’s some University called the “University of Notre Dame and they have an American football team called “The Fighting Irish” with a Leprechaun mascot and some Irish-Americans including some fucktarded ESPN host by the name of Max Keller got offended on behalf of the Irish. Now, I can say with 100% conviction that not a single fucking person in my country has or is offended by the name of that team or it’s mascot. So why are a bunch of Faux-Irish twats from Boston or Chicago getting offended on behalf of our small little country on the other side of the Atlantic. Like who gives an actual fuck?

And there’s more… Ugandan Knuckles? Most Ugandan people didn’t give a shit about him but some African-Americans decided to get a massive stick up their ass about it despite probably not having any heritage links to Uganda. 

But this all kind of reaffirms my point on why it’s valid to reject/invalidate the identities of hyphenated Americans, because who are they to decide what is offensive to people from the OG culture?

**Cultural Superiority Complexes**

*Sigh…* Now this one personally annoys me to no actual end because people use it as an excuse to wank themselves off and put down others. It also shows me that the average American (especially hyphenated Americans) is ignorant to history to suit their own personal agenda.

Here are some ignorant beliefs held by hyphenated-Americans: 

*African-Americans: Europeans are responsible for all or most slavery or are the creators of slavery.*

Nope, slavery has existed since the first civilization, Mesopotamia who weren't even “White.” Hell the last country to abolish slavery was (by the American construct of race), Black. (Mauritania)

*Every non-”white” hyphenated-American: Europeans only ever committed Genocide.*

Oh boy… Do I have a bridge to sell you! 2 of the 3 current ongoing Genocides are being committed, are not being committed by Europeans.

1 is being committed in the middle east. (Palestine.) 

1 is being committed in Asia. (Uighurs) Hell, they're literally being put in concentration camps. 

Plus, there was Hatilla the Hun and the more recent Rwandan genocide back in 94.

So yeah… Genocide wasn't specific to Europeans.

*Irish-Americans: Ireland is innocent and never did anything bad.*

Ireland was literally a theocratic shithole up until 1975. Our country at one point literally imprisoned women for the “crime” of having a baby outside of marriage. They were forced to do hard labour whilst their babies were sold off by the Catholic church to rich Americans.

Ireland was like Francoist Spain without the dictatorship. We're even actively working to undo all the damage that the church has done.

And once again this drives home my point that it's alright for people from the OG countries/culture to tell hyphenated-Americans that they're not one of them and they're not apart of the culture. 

There's a load of other things I could mention, that hyphenated-Americans seem to do. 

Like assuming European food lacks flavour. (If you need to put tobasco sauce on everything to taste flavour, then you have the taste buds of a coal miner.), Ireland is all rural, Cleopatra was black, etc.

If hyphenated-Americans are gonna start dictating who can and can't participate in different cultures that they themselves are not apart of, speak on behalf of other cultures despite not being apart of them and just generally acting entitled. Then there is nothing wrong with people from the OG cultures telling them to fuck off.

Know your place or get lost. Simple as.

So… change my view I guess."

They hate LGBTQ rights, they hate women's rights, they're uncomfortable with the idea of non-white people voting, so they hate the basic principles of freedom that America is built on. The second they started feeling the least bit threatened they threw out democracy and tried to elect a fascist dictator, so they don't even like the most basic fundamental element of this country.

I've even seen conservatives on the internet say they would rather fight in a civil war than fight in Ukraine, which lines up with the data from the military that says white male recruitment is at an all time low.

I believe the root cause is within the absence of ""quality enforcement"" through confrontation, the bar keeps getting lower and putting one's foot down becomes a form of ""privileged entitlement"" which leads to resentment.
I believe complaint is the only way a certain ""bar"" can be enforced, and I see it as a duty for neglecting it is an insult to the effort that was invested for the bar to exist at first. I observe it in so many occurences : companies forcing people to work on international workers day, to restaurants raising places and lowering quality, to administrative bureaucracy and so forth...
As long as it's deemed a right, and not a duty, it's somehow inherently fine not to deal with it... While the duty justifies spending time with custommer service for a complaint, or risking an employer's resentment not to work on a day people literally died to ensure, or simply turning full ""karen"" not to have to bribe one's way into a construction permit.
I don't think my observed sample is in any way ""an isolated case"" and I believe educating children on the matter can be a good start to ensure the effort spent on building the standards for a functional society doesn't go to waste for individual conveniences.

I believe this because I have partaken in it and grown up in a culture where it is very normal and even somewhat encouraged. 

Most of the women I have met that are/have been quite promiscuous often have underlying mental issues e.g bpd, bipolar, daddy/abandonment issues etc and they have had a somewhat unstable life. They also seem to be more depressed and anxious individuals. I have not seen the same for men to the same degree.

Us men also tend to, most of the time, get something out of it (us straight men cum a lot more often than straight women with ONS, this is just a fact) whereas majority of the time women do not.

I have noticed throughout my short life that my male friends are not as near as deeply affected by this culture as my female friends are, a big one being that a lot of the women tend to form some sort of attachment afterwards until it is broken so many times that they don’t care anymore and form an emotional defence mechanism.

Me personally I won’t treat a women any different because they have a high body count. I would still gladly be friends with them if I got along with their personality just like anyone else (and I have). Heck I would even sleep with them…but… I would not take them seriously as a dating prospect because of what I have seen.

Women seem to bear the brunt of this culture, and I sincerely believe(contrary to popular belief) that hookup culture is a sugar coated ANTI-feminist component of our culture. The primary  benefactors of this culture are us MEN.

They used to tell women to keep their bodies and save themselves for a husband, someone that genuinely wants to care for them and they had to prove it. Us men had to work for sex. 

The amount of women I’ve met, heck even my first gf had had sex with multiple people before she’d even been taken on a proper first date! I find this aspect of our culture so sad and such a fall from grace. Sex and hookup culture is now at the drop of a hat and being told to a generation of girls under the guise of “empowerment”.

Onlyfans is “empowerment” hookups are “empowerment”

It is the opposite, you are being brainwashed in a different way but it all leads back to the same benefactors.. us. And I argue the previous was way more empowering than this bullshit lol

I honestly believe the perverted elites of our society socially engineered our society to slowly veer this way so that they could benefit and us men could benefit. 

The greatest lie told to women and our society.

It's only a speculation so take it with a grain of salt, but i truly believe it is the case.

I've known people who have cheated on their partner. almost everyone i know in our neighborhood has cheated, men and women alike. Even those who are married for decades, and even the people who are closest to me. It doesn't help that stories about this are all over the internet and media. I don't think it's a case of confirmation bias. I truly think there's more people who cheats than those who doesn't. People just think it's confirmation bias because these cases only came from those who admitted it or got caught. But those who are able to hide their adultery until they die twilights those who are exposed.

Monogamy or, even polygamy, are a social construct or, at most, a romantic thinking. We are just driven to sex and intimacy, simple as that. We just created rules for it because those who experience or witness it clearly didn't want such thing to happen to them because we have possessive and jealous tendencies.

But like rules some people are just inclined to break them. But the fact that it's easy to hide adultery, and the fact that all humans likes sex and intimacy, makes this such a useless law that people don't even feel like they would be in trouble or face consequences if they proceed to do such thing. They would only realize it once the feeling of lust and intimacy wore off. It's not like murder or other heinous crimes because people who condemns it overwhelms those who enjoy it. People like to complain about it, like i'm doing now, but it doesn't change the fact thay people are still vulnerable to intimacy. But there's still some outlier because we have unconventional people who just does everything differently from the rest of their peers.

we underestimate how much the need for intimacy drives us."

There were instances where these mutants were not able to control their powers and end up hurting the people around them.  For example rogue who can unalive you just by touching you. Plus many of them if not supervised would commit crimes or do whatever they want at the expense of others. If left unchecked they literally can cause the extinction of humans.

There are cases where the mutants powers cause more harm to themselves ( so much for calling those powers gifts) .With all this the humans have very good reason to fear the mutants. 

Oppressed people in the real world don't powers like the mutants do to fight against their oppressors so how is this an allegory?

First of all, we have never seen this being possible with any political system, not even with those models that want to end social classes like communism (ironically communism only intensifies these social classes to the extremes rather than eliminates them).

Second, for something like this we would have to destroy our entire civilization and build something totally new that we don't even know if it can really work, not to mention what to do to eliminate the ""leader figure"" that seems so necessary for the majority of humanity.

Third, the corrupt nature of humans. In our current system, to end social classes you will first need a leader who is committed to doing so, and to do so society must ""grant"" him great power, power which is so tempting for humans that it is more likely that you will end up with a dictatorship rather than your long-awaited utopia. I think we overestimate humans and humanity itself, in general terms, we are still too animalistic.

And finally, I unfortunately and genuinely believe that there is no good or ""fair"" political model, much less one led by humans, the best we can do is support the fairest of all and the one that makes all social classes live as well as possible, also one that supports both intellectual and social advancement. In the end, if we analyze it carefully, this world is quite harsh and horrible, nature is cruel and although we are no longer really part of it, we still come from it.

Do not come at me with ""One is elected so it's okay"" thats a different argument and isn't relevant to this conversation.

Many people point to the extreme costs associated with maintaining the monarchy of the United Kingdom. Unlike other European constitutional monarchies, the British have not adopted a more modern practice of monarchism. This obviously costs more more than the operation of the Dutch or Norwegian monarchies.

1. Presidential Inaugurations are just as unnecessary as Coronations and cost more
- The average American presidential Inauguration costs the taxpayer $100 million dollars. Some of that is covered by campaign fundraising from the President Elect, so I'll take $20 million off the average. Also, the inaugurations of the last 10 have cost much more than the 10 previous to them so I'll take $50 million off the average to account for that. In rough total, the average cost of an American presidential Inauguration in the 20th-21st century has been around $30 million.
- Adjusted for inflation, the modern cost of Queen Elizabeth's 1953 Coronation was around $20 million.
- During the reign of Queen Elizabeth, there were 14 American presidential Inaugurations while she only had the one. $420,000,000 > $20,000,000

2. The American presidential motorcade consists of 50+ vehicles in the normal configuration. The British monarch travels with 6, and only when conducting official state business while the secret service provide escort for any occasion. In terms of total security cost the Metropolitan Police estimates the cost of the Royalty and Specialist Protection Branch comes to several million UP TO a maximum of £100 million pounds. Contrasty the US Secret Service gets a budget of around $2 billion dollars.

3. Estimates vary from several hundred million to 2 billion, but it's undeniable that the British monarchy creates around £1 billion pounds of revenue for the United Kingdom each year. In 2022 the British Royal Family cost the nation around £100 million pounds. Even if you take the lowest estimates of the revenue from the Royal Family they still make a net positive for the country's economy.

Regardless of what you think about spending money on the Presidency or the Monarchy, it is inarguably more expensive to maintain the United States Presidency than the British Monarchy.

In fact it's pretty self aware and logical.

Insecurity is not a bad thing and it's something that all people have. Sex is an incredibly intimate and vulnerable act and men have the added factor of sexual performance is something that men are mocked for pretty regularly. This included getting mocked in a vacuum or getting compared to men your partner has been with before and coming up short (no pun intended) so it's not really a suprise that lots of guys would choose to be in a relationship where this isn't as much of an issue. 

Another aspect is that the types of guys that are able to have casual sex with women are typically incredibly conventionally attractive guys. Lots of average guys don't want to feel like they're being settled for when it comes to how sexually attractive they are to their partner, so if a woman doesn't have a sexually history that implies that, there's less of a reason to feel insecure.

If you as a man are deciding to not date a woman for one of these reasons you're not doing anything bad. You're not viewing a woman as less than for her sexual history, you're not taking out your feelings on your partner, the only thing you are doing is looking for a relationship you are comfortable in. I guess worst case scenario, you could be hypocritical if you have a high body count, but the guys that have 10+ body counts are the super conventionally attractive guys who I doubt are insecure and using more misogynistic reasons to justify not wanting to date a promiscuous woman"

With their widespread presence and standardized menus, chain restaurants offer a level of consistency and reliability that you can expect almost every time. Whether in your hometown or traveling across the country or world, you know what to expect when you walk through the doors.   
Plus, let's restaurants are everywhere, from big cities to places you wouldn't expect, so you're always close to a decent meal. I love to travel and try to eat locally whenever possible. But sometimes, what I try doesn't agree with me. That's when seeing a Hard Rock Cafe is like a lifeline. It might feel a bit lame and ethnocentric to go for something I already know instead of something local, but when you're starving and want something you're sure you'll like, it's perfect.   
It's hard to ignore how chain restaurants are big players in the job market. They hire many people worldwide, from teens looking for their first job to people needing something steady. Regarding economies, chain restaurants do more than serve meals; they play a significant role in balance, especially in tourist-heavy areas, by circulating money. Supporting local businesses is equally important, of course, but these chains add to the mix, helping sustain jobs and contribute to local governments through taxation.   
In the dating scene, it's acknowledged that taking your potential partner to a chain restaurant might not initially seem like the most charming choice. Sure, I agree with that sentiment from time to time. But if you're in a pinch with no other options, is it a terrible idea? Does choosing Chick-fil-A over a local mom-and-pop steakhouse where your bill will be over $100 change the substance of your first date? Personally,  I tend to skip meals on a first date. I find coffee and ice cream to be good enough. But, of course, that's just me. "
63,2024-03-24,CMV: Raising minimum wage would exponentially grow the economy in the medium term. ,u/Fando1234,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bmv7xu/cmv_raising_minimum_wage_would_exponentially_grow/,changemyview,"I’m not an economist, this is completely a view I’m open to changing. Though I’ve always operated under the principle that current levels of inequality are abysmal. And that those we rely on most deserve to be paid much better.

My logic is as follows; much like in the Keynesian model more money in the hands of the majority means more people buying more goods. Ultimately creating a positive cycle of increased productivity, as people buy more products.

This in turn means more products need to be created, which means higher profitability for companies making the products and more money to pay their workers/hire. As well as increased competition from other businesses set up to satisfy this demand increase. 

The counter arguments I’m familiar with are as follows:

1. Raising minimum wage would increase inflation.
2. It would harm small businesses.
3. It would incentivise big businesses to invest in AI faster, and make human workers redundant.

Based on my argument above. Here is my counter counter to these points:

1. Inflation: In the short term perhaps, but inflation is not in itself bad if wage growth is higher. It should also be noted that a minimum wage increase is only using money that is already circulating in the system. Finally, once suppliers respond to increased demand this should even out. 

2. Small businesses: This is a valid point. But can be mitigated by applying the minimum wage first to larger companies, and giving smaller companies a moratorium for a few years in order for them to ride the wave of increased demand. It would also incentivise schemes like co operatives or share ownership for staff, to stop workers jumping to higher pay at larger corporates.

3. AI forced redundancies: this is a larger question about what we want to do with AI. It is the same issue we will face eventually either way, as the technology becomes cheaper over time. Either we regulate against AI, or we create some kind of UBI system, and allow more jobs to become automated. Either way it’s an issue we have to solve irrespective of minimum wage increases.

If women are in a committed relationship, going to a club that matches your sexual preferences (I.e straight person going to a straight club vs gay club) is disrespectful to your partner and your relationship 

Rationale: 

People are very well aware of the intentions of the participants of the club so there is no excuse of ignorance.

Women who go to clubs to “dance with their friends” also knowingly are aware that:

1. Clubbing typically involves alcohol that they may have free access to through men so there is a high likelihood they will be intoxicated and have their decision making be impaired

2. Men in the club are approaching them with the purpose of trying to sleep with them and this will occur throughout the time they are in the club 

3. Accidents can happen, it is easy to get severally intoxicated or overdose on drugs such that a blackout can happen and have things happen to you

4. You may or may not have single friends who are also there that encourage negative behavior like excessive drinking and interactions with men who want to get in your pants

5. You often dress (not always) in a manner that intentionally attracts from the other sex

Knowingly going to a club despite knowledge of these factors means you want to go to an environment where you will be intoxicated and have men pursue you. This is inherently disrespectful to your relationship to your partner.

The excuse that you just want to dance or have a night out with your girlfriends does not apply because you can dance or have a night out without going to a club"
1,2024-03-24,CMV: I shouldn’t feel bad for misogynistic/pick-me women who end up in toxic relationships.,u/doodlecadoodle,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bmy7jq/cmv_i_shouldnt_feel_bad_for_misogynisticpickme/,changemyview,"(**Disclaimer**: *I wanna clarify first that I'm talking about able-bodied and mentally stable women in the West in this post since you people love whataboutism and acting obtuse*)

I've seen on social media that whenever a former pick-me girl comes forward with her story regarding a toxic relationship she just ended, the comment section rallies up behind her calling her ex names and consoling her after the fact. People share their sympathy for her case and coddle her the entire time. I have a problem with this for two reasons. The first one is that it feels infantilizing whenever women are absolved of any blame regarding the relationships they enter. I've seen time and time again how it’s pretty common in the media to paint women as beings who have no agency or will of their own. It just rubs me the wrong way because we have not fought as long as we have to continue to be portrayed as weak damsels who didn't have any resources or other options before falling into that toxic relationship. No, she had agency and had an active choice in picking that raging misogynist she’s now complaining about. She just lived in Wonderland and thought that she was the exception from that man's misogyny and toxicity because she shared the same archaic views. We live in the day and age of information. There’s vast content on the internet whose sole purpose is teaching women how to identify misogyny and avoid it. ""She was raised like that!"" Isn’t really an excuse, given that multiple people, both men and women, grew in traditional households and wound up having radically different perspectives than their families. 

The second is that that woman probably *mocked* other women for sharing their stories of abuse and toxic relationships. She probably participated in the mockery and degradation that misogynistic men love spreading and relished in it.  After all, being a pick me revolves around validating all the bullshit toxic men spout. I don’t know about you guys, but I'm no Jesus and don’t believe in turning the other cheek. It’s hard for me to sympathize with people who first laughed and demeaned others, even if now they finally understand the situation and know better. I would never laugh at the pain they're now in but I also refuse to lend a shoulder to cry on. I'm glad they made it out and are now safe, but I won’t be engaging in their soothing and comforting. "

I see people being dragged on Reddit all of the time in the comment section of r/texts and relationship posts for being insecure in their relationships and life circumstances. I have never understood it because everyone on this earth has at least one insecurity or has experienced insecurity at least once in their life.

This behavior is typically accompanied by a bunch of comments implying that one is superior to the insecure party simply because they are not bothered by what that person is bothered about.

A very common example that I see - ***“LOL IKR? Me and my husband don’t even care about stuff like that! HAHAHA!”***

So? Different people are bothered by different things because everyone has had different life experiences and no one has to exist the way that you exist. You’re not better than another couple because your relationship is different than theirs. Nor does anyone have to model their relationship after your relationship.

If it doesn’t bother you or your husband that you get flirted with at work then good for y’all. Lul. 

(You don’t have to be insecure in your relationship to be bothered by that either. That’s just disrespectful.)

It is completely possible to have insecurities and not be an insecure person. 

Just like it is possible to have things that make you angry, but not be an angry person.

I have always found it ironic how the word “insecure” gets hurled around like some kind of social pariah considering the fact that most human beings who choose to believe in something like a higher power for example tend to choose this path because they are afraid of death (insecure in the finality of mortal existence) and want to perceive there to be a purpose in enduring all that they have experienced in this life. 

Insecurity is a logical response to a perceived or experienced negative event. 

Random hypothetical - Suppose you get taken into the back room of an abandoned warehouse by a complete stranger with a bunch of bloody dead bodies, blindfolded, and ordered by someone holding a loaded gun to sit in a chair and are simply told “You won’t get shot”, you sit in the chair, the dude leaves the room, and you hear a bunch of shots being fired and people screaming around you. Who would be secure in their odds of not being shot?

Where is the line drawn in the proverbial sand between insecurity and delusion?

Like that one religious person that went into the lion exhibit and got attacked by the lions trying to prove that “God would protect him”, lmao.

Could I call anyone that refuses to follow in his footsteps insecure in their faith? 

Why is it considered “weak”, “pathetic” and “sad” to lack trust in someone or something when trust is always a gamble, especially if you have been hurt, victimized or lied to before, let alone multiple times in the past?

Stigmatizing insecurity discourages people from admitting that they are insecure about something or pretending something doesn’t bother them that does in fact bother them. 
 
I am willing to change my view if someone can convince me that berating, dogpiling and ridiculing someone for being insecure about something is a good thing and necessary.

Another phenomenon becoming more prevalent or atleast known about are therians, otherkin, or trans-species.

Proportional representatives would eliminate the undemocratic process of gerrymandering. 

SCOTUS term limits would prevent some administrations from having way more impact on the judicial branch than others, making it less likely to arbitrarily swing too far to either left or right. Furthermore, lifelong terms are bad because unexpectedly sick or deceased justices lead to more 4-4 decisions or stalled cases and slows down the court. 

All these changes together would make voters feel better represented and also I believe reduce partisanship, which makes these measures some of the most valuable and important measures we could take."

European football leagues must disclose salaries I don't understand why many football fans are against revealing players' contract salaries. I think player salaries are either too low or overrated. I think Haaland's annual salary is over $50 million. Honestly, there is no way the EPL salary would be that low. Does anyone know anything about Mbappe's contract? Why didn't you make it public in the first place? I don't know if it's after tax or before tax. The media always says different things. The same goes for the salaries of Griezmann and Suarez during their time in Barcelona. To begin with, La Liga is not sure whether some players' salaries are before or after tax. Always changing. First of all, the salaries of Messi and Ronaldo from 2011 to 2018 are estimated to be after-tax salaries.) And this is not accurate regarding Messi's contract. Laporta said Messi's salary must be paid until 2025. How much did he get paid? And many believe Mane's wages at Liverpool were £100,000 a week. First of all, Mane's agent said his salary is higher than reported in the media.American leagues disclose salaries. Messi's annual salary for 2023, as revealed by the MLS Players' Association, is $20 million. The base annual salary is $12 million. The media reports that it is over $50 million, but in reality it is much less than this. Conversely, if you look at the wage bill, EPL clubs spend more money than the media reports, with Manchester City spending more than 300 million pounds, and Liverpool and Chelsea spending more than 250 million pounds. (Please disclose player salaries, contracts, and salaries.

And why are some people asking (there will be comments asking why I don't disclose my salary, but I'm an ordinary person. Are ordinary people and sports players the same?

I'm not gonna use the ""ticking time bomb scenario"", because it's indeed flawed and has many things that people are overlooking. But I believe that torture is justified against a certain type of criminals and under a certain circumstances (like, martial law or emergency state, when human rights is temporarily restricted or suspected for the sake of law, order and safety).

Also, I don't think that torture is not that ineffective. If it's applied properly, it can be effective and extract the information and separate it from lie and false attempts to buy the time. Like, if criminal is lying and tries to confuse the interrogator, but his lie is discovered, the intensity of the torture can be increased and criminal can be intimidated that ""it's the only a start, tough guy, we broke apart guys much tougher than you, so you better to tell the truth or you're gonna spend the rest of your life permanently disabled in the intensive care unit"". 

In fact, the using of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" is quite common among the government agencies and among military across the world, and some ex-military and ex-government agent has told that all of that anti-torture rhetorics is a pure demagogy and empty babbling, because if torture is used properly and under a certain circumstances – it becomes quite effective, especially if resources allows the interrogatir to separate the information from true and false. That's how a coordinated work done.

1,2024-03-25,CMV: nukes should not be ignored in second 2nd amendment debates about overthrowing the government,u/Orang-Himbleton,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bn8vlk/cmv_nukes_should_not_be_ignored_in_second_2nd/,changemyview,"So, in my opinion, the correct interpretation of the 2nd amendment is not that individuals necessarily have the right to defend themselves against criminals/the government/whatever with guns, it’s that states have the right to overthrow the federal government if it ever goes rogue, and the best means to do that is by having individuals take up arms against the federal government. This is an important distinction on a policy level because the latter interpretation would likely allows individual states to prohibit, say, open-carry and concealed-carry in public. But I don’t want to talk too much about what the 2nd amendment doesn’t allow the federal government to do, I’m wanting to address the spirit of the text of the 2nd amendment as a whole. 

>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

To me, the key phrase in the 2nd amendment is “being necessary to the security of a free State.” I think this will be the point most people take issue with. I think “free State” is either supposed to mean a free individual state, like Kansas or New York, or the free country as a whole. It doesn’t matter which one, but I support the idea that that it means one of those two things.

With that in mind, there is no language about what a tyrannical government would look like in this amendment, and I think that was intentional. I suspect that the reason the founders wanted the citizens of the US to be capable of outgunning any form of federal government they found themselves being terrorized by, whether that be one that wants to silence the dissenter’s speech, or whether it be one that wants to eradicate all human life. 

Now, the US definitely has enough nuclear bombs to destroy humanity, no doubt, and they’re all under the control of the federal government. So with all of this in mind, the conclusion is that the 2nd amendment does not apply to a federal government that has nukes.

I’ll put my argument is syllogism form
1. The 2nd amendment is only relevant when the federal government does not have enough fire power to wipe out every other state in the US
2. The federal government does have the fire power to wipe out every other state in the US
3. The 2nd amendment is not relevant in the modern era.

There are two potential pieces of evidence that could convince me that the second amendment should be considered relevant. The first one is that the federal government does not have enough firepower to actually destroy the US. The second one is that the founding fathers may have addressed the issue of a completely insane and powerful federal government being able to overpower every single state militia combined, and they say the 2nd amendment would still apply.

Some weak objections I’ve heard are “the federal government wouldn’t destroy a shit ton of property, that would be insane!” My response is to say what if they are insane? The founding fathers had an answer for that in their time, but they didn’t have an answer for our time. Another bad one would be “most of the people in the government/military wouldn’t support the government going rogue.” You can’t know that will always be the case. Maybe they went crazy or lied to everyone until they gained enough power to kill everyone. You should also just be charitable and grant that argument since, if the government won’t let itself go rogue, the government would be so weak that we wouldn’t need a second amendment. And the last bad objection I can think of right now would be “what if the people took over all the government’s equipment?” If we’re assuming they can do that, then, again, we wouldn’t even need a 2nd amendment, we could just steal all the government’s equipment and then overthrow the government.

If they want to rejoin the community, they have to use another account, and if they do that, it's ""ban evasion"".  
I don't see what permabanning achieves that a 2 year or even a six month ban doesn't. Except aggressively punish people for minor infractions.

Today's cars, on the other hand, have become overly complicated with an overly complicated electronic systems, touchscreens, and driver aids, to the point where they seem to have lost the essence of what driving should be. 

Also to add, manual transmissions are increasingly rare, and even traditional automatics are being usurped by CVTs and dual-clutch systems. While they may be more efficient, they remove the involvement of shifting gears manually, which many driving purists – myself included – enjoy. Not to mention modern cars are a pain to fix independently. They are equipped with advanced electronic systems and computerized control units that require specialized diagnostic tools and software for troubleshooting. This can make it difficult for the average car owner to perform DIY repairs.

I also think all modern cars often look and feel quite similar, regardless of the manufacturer. There's a certain homogeneity in design and performance that leaves few cars standing out as truly unique.   
  
I understand the benefits that come with modern technology in cars, from increased safety to better fuel efficiency. However, I can't help but feel that something integral to the spirit of driving is being lost in the process. Change my view."

1,2024-03-25,CMV: Fear of commitment does not exist,u/Upset-Ad3151,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bnfnfh/cmv_fear_of_commitment_does_not_exist/,changemyview,"I am talking specifically about committing to someone in a romantic relationship. And I am defining commitment as a decision to stay in a romantic relationship with someone in the long-term (not necessarily exclusivity). 

What we call “fear of commitment” is just an attempt to rationalise the fact that we don’t really want to commit to someone. There is no real abnormal fear stopping the commitment, just discomfort with the conditions of the relationship we would be engaging in. Namely, not wanting to progress the relationship in the ways that have been culturally imposed as “romantic expectations” e.g. spending most of our time with that person, meeting their friends and family, getting married, sharing finances, living together, having kids. 

We wrongly use the term “fear of commitment” in the following (and other) situations:

1. When the potential partner is “good on paper”, so we cannot come up with real reasons to not commit to them. Rather than accepting that we just don’t want to proceed with the relationship in that way, we blame it on “fear”, blaming ourselves and wanting to fix it. There is also social pressure from friends and family who also don’t understand what’s stopping us from following societal norms, so they blame it on some secret fear we have. 

2. When the person has decided they don’t want to have a romantic partner, a family and kids. Rather than simply accepting that some people have different preferences for their relationships and lives, we assume they are just afraid of commitment. Even though the person may be very committed in other areas of their lives, such as their friendships or career. 

3. When there is doubt about wanting to engage in a committed relationship with someone because the potential partner or the relationship dynamic is not good enough. Rather than accepting that it is not the right person or relationship or our feelings just aren’t there, we blame it on fear and try to fix something instead of just letting go of something that isn’t working. 

The times in which there is real fear to engage in committed romantic relationships. It’s not a fear of commitment, but a fear of betrayal (eg people who have been cheated on in previous relationships), or rejection (eg people who have been repeatedly broken up in the past). But even in these cases, the person is just not ready to get romantically involved and they are indeed better off staying away for the time being, so there is nothing to fix. It’s a reasonable decision to abstain from commitment while they work through their emotions. 

Therefore, rather than trying to reduce the “fear” of commitment, we should focus on finding the type of person and type of relationship that we would actually want in the long-term. "

I don't think anyone needs a high school diploma to know that being a short guy in the Western World basically makes most areas of life a living nightmare. I myself can attest to this, as even my younger cousin who's 15 years my junior loves to make fun of my height and brag about how he'll be bigger than me in the future.

But enough rambling. The main point I wanted to make here is the idea that the short guys who DO somehow succeed in finding partners (long or short-term) often do so because they have money. 

Here's some of the obvious examples: Tom Cruise, Daniel Radcliffe, Kevin Hart, Lionel Messi, Kendrick Lamar. What do these short men all have in common? $$$. 

And that's not even going into the fact that I have a concrete example of how one time in undergrad I heard one of my colleagues mention how her sister who was getting married was getting married to what she described as a ""rich boy"". Given that he was short however, it was pretty evident that if he didn't have the bling, that he wouldn't have been getting married, and I wouldn't be surprised if this applied to honestly MOST short men out there who weren't fortunate to have a ""childhood sweetheart"".

So yeah, sufficed to say, this is exactly why I have to go above and beyond what I was originally planning to do in my life and go into biotech because it seems no matter where I go in the ""desirable"" world, I'm always gonna be seen as an undesirable wretch in pretty much every way imaginable to the point that only having a lot of cash would make anyone consider giving me a chance.

The whole thing is based on my personal experience and what little I've seen in others as well.*

So, a while back turned 23. The problem: People who don't know me, still think I am 15. 

While this on itself is not a problem in the long-term, in the short-term, it is. And here's why:

**1) Getting carded nearly everywhere:**

Wanna drink beer with friends? ID. For me in particular too. None of my other friends are getting carded, despite me being the oldest one in the group.

When I got a gym subscription the receptionist asked me if I my parents were OK with it. Told her I am 22.

While this is funny and I can laugh at my self a bit, it still bruises my pride a bit.

**2) Difficulty with dating women:**

The big fucking elephant in the room. While I do not have exactly evidence to back it up, I have to admit that I've seen women treating men who appear younger, differently at least to an extend.  

It is very hard to put in words. But it is very characteristic especially in a more casual context. It is in an \*ever-so-slightly\* and subtle mother-ish behavior. Like, I am not viewed as an adult but as a child. This isn't even a dating thing now that I think about it.

While I am trying my best to not put a label on every woman ever, very few people of the opposite sex do not do that. 

However, women who have a similar ""problem"" as me are a different story. They usually behave in a much more normal way. 

**3) Respect and overal different treatment.**

This is related with the second point. But it applies to pretty much everyone really. I feel like I have to put much more effort than others to prove that I am mature. 

And by that I mean that people do not assume you are mature, until they get to know you for a while. Basically it is harder to make good first impressions.

Professors and classmates talk to me way differently than most, despite not exhibiting much differece of behavior compared to most people. (At least as far as I know)

Best way I can describe it is that people are both more lenient and do not consider you competent by default unless you put more effort to demonstrate that you are good enough at the thing you do.

&#x200B;

All I want in order to award a delta, is to show me that such people (especially men) do not have it that bad in general. That in general, it is not such an inconvenience and I am exaggerating. 

I do not know how much of an impact this actually has. I've asked in a lot of places in the past but did not get a useful answer. This sub is kinda a last ditch effort, lol.

This is something that I think should be determined by a medical professional as to whether an abortion should be allowed, with doctors being charged for breaking these guidelines.

The reason why I think that abortion should be illegal (except as stated prevously) is that I think that it is morally wrong to deprive a living being of the support it needs to survive. For example, if you have a child, then you have a moral obligation to feed and support the child, and if you were to intentionally starve the child and they died then you have broken your moral obligations and I would regard it as murder. There is no ""right"" for you not to feed and support the child, they are your child and it is a duty to care for them.

So why do we not extend this to the unborn and when are they denied this moral obligation? and furthermore who are we to decide whether or not it is deserving of are obligation? I would personally view conception as when they are regarded as a person, as a human being, even if not fully developed.

I am going to argue against some of the common arguments against abortion.

**""A fetus isn't a living being because it relies on someone else to survive""**

Personhood isn't determined by whether or not someone relies on someone else to survive. By that logic that would mean that people on benefits, disabled people, sick people, children, homeless people, etc. were not people but of course that would be a crazy and incredibly wrong claim to make.

**""I don't care what your holy book says""**

I am not religious, I don't know why every argument about abortion has to do with religion. I couldn't care less about what the Bible says about abortion, I am basing this off my own moral judgements.

**""It's a woman's right to choose. Stop telling women what they can and can't do with their bodies""**

First of all, it is not ""your body"", you have another body inside of you, and don't they have a right as to whether they want their life prematurely ended or not. Also this argument doesn't say anything about the personhood of a fetus nor does it say anything about the morality of abortion, it just appeals to feminism and the idea that women being held responsible for anything is misogynistic.

By that very logic, I could go and kill someone because it is my body, my choice and they are just a ""clump of cells"". I think a better example would be, that if I wanted to charge my phone but my grandfather's life support was plugged into the socket instead. That I could unplug his life support in order to charge my phone because my needs are clearly more important than my grandfather's needs to survive and he is just a ""clump of cells"".

There is also a good reason why someone cannot just go into a public place and start masturbating even though it is ""their body"", they have rules that they have to follow and things that they can do with their body that are immoral and should be outlawed. Though they have the free will to masturbate in public and they can choose to do so, doing so will rightly cause them to be punished for it.

**""But what if they can't support the child who is being born?""/""What if they don't want the child?""**

First of all, adoption is a thing, if they don't want to take care of the child, they can give them up for adoption and no this does not contradict what I said earlier. Giving a child up for adoption fulfills a parents obligation to their children as by giving them to adoption they are being cared for even if it is by someone else.

Excluding rape victims, if they didn't want to have a child then they shouldn't have gotten pregnant in the first place and them making that mistake doesn't mean that the child has to be punished for it. As for rape victims who get pregnant, I still think that abortion should be illegal in that case because of the arguments I have made previously.

I think another thing to consider is that if they get pregnant by accident or if the father doesn't take care of the child, then how is that not also the ""man's"" responsibility in this situation. I think that if you get someone pregnant then you are responsible for the child that they have, whether it was an accident or not. I want to bring this up because some people will use this whataboutism against me but I agree that the man is also responsible for the child but so is the pregnant woman.

But if it really is just a ""clump of cells"" then why would the man in that situation have to pay child support? why would he have to be obligated to pay child support for a ""clump of cells""?

**""Conservatives...""**

I would consider myself centre-left personally. I support benefits and I support nationalisation, free healthcare, increased taxes for the rich, increased wages, anti-imperialism etc. If that sounds right-wing to you then you are probably the kind of person that thinks that Fidel Castro is too right-wing and I don't know why I would consider your opinion."

Homophonia is hate towards others based on their lifestyle choices and their personal way of living. Hate towards someone of any religion is literally hating someone based on those same exact principles.

And don't give me the excuse of how some ""Christians"" and the church can be homophobic. Those people aren't following the basic principle of Christianity, which is to love everyone regardless of their ways or lifestyle. With that said, people seem to believe it's okay to hate ALL Christians due to the actions of others. I've seen a ton of homosexuals and atheists be hateful. Why should I hate ALL of them, just because some are rude?

487,2024-03-25,CMV: Russia cannot win the war in Ukraine at this point.,u/TheMikeyMac13,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bnolej/cmv_russia_cannot_win_the_war_in_ukraine_at_this/,changemyview,"So by victory I mean achieving objectives, which we should consider at the start of the invasion, when the intention was to take Kyiv and install a puppet government, and to take much of Ukraine. 

But to expand on that, long term what could Russia's reduced goals be considered? A smaller area of Ukraine? Slowing the spread of NATO? ""de-nazification?""

I contend that in the long run none of these will happen in a way that Russia desires. To change my view on this you will need to convince me that Russia can achieve their military goals in Ukraine.

Don't come at me with Russia adjusting their goals and claiming victory, like ""well we didn't want Ukraine anyway, and our goal was to cause NATO to expand"", I am not buying that.

Here goes:

Russia on offense:

* Russian military doctrine is terrible at projecting power. Russia uses old soviet military doctrine, which is to defend the homeland on the cheap. More lower end tanks, more lower end artillery, more lower end aircraft, etc. Fewer support trucks per battalion, instead moving men, machine and supplies by rail inside Russia, And not going for air dominance but airspace denial. Using robust SAMs to deny airspace once the ground has taken.
* Russian logistics are worse than Russian military doctrine. This is the ability to provide reinforcements, ammunition, food, and other supplies to those fighting the war. Omar Bradley once said amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics, and he was correct. Keeping the war machine moving takes good logistics, and Russia is garbage at it.
* Russian maintenance practices are marred by corruption and inefficiency. Corruption has caused needed maintenance not to happen, or to be underfunded after theft of funding. And this has caused Russia to have more failures than expected in ordinance (at one point 60% of Russia's guided missiles failed to launch, target or detonate) or in equipment. (Russia has had a staggering failure rate on vehicles and aircraft. You have to do the wrench work, and Russia doesn't do it well.
* Russia's losses have been severe. Not just in human losses, having lost more soldiers to being killed or wounded, having lost perhaps 400,000 soldiers to being wounded or killed. (now more than the USA has lost in all wars going back to WW2, and now they are going into WW2 in terms of US losses) and Russia has endured. In terms of vehicles the losses are perhaps more damaging, as replacement is not as easy as another round of conscription, where we now see Russia sending T54/55 tanks into Ukraine, tanks built in 1948. Russian losses so far, per Oryx, who verifies losses via images or video:

2856 tanks  
  
1273 armored fighting vehicles  
  
3677 infantry fighting vehicles  
  
418 armored personnel carriers  
  
3175 trucks  
  
353 towed artillery   
  
706 self propelled artillery  
  
361 multiple rocket launchers  
  
106 aircraft  
  
135 helicopters  
  
21 naval ships and submarines

That is a large amount off loss for Russia, a country not able to replace their losses.

https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties\_of\_the\_Russo-Ukrainian\_War

So militarily, Russia cannot project power well, and has gone about as far as they are going to go in terms of offensive actions. Russia will struggle to go any farther, and the harder they push the worse the losses will be. Will they run out of soldiers? No, but they will run out of equipment for those soldiers. As much as it was a shock to see two US sourced Bradley's kill a modern Russian T-90, a Russian T62 or T54/55 has no place on a modern battlefield, they will not last long in combat.

So that is the ability for Russia to go on offense, now let's talk Russia on defense:

* Russian defensive ability is better than their offensive ability, and it isn't close. Now their artillery and their mines have much more value, and the S400 and S500 systems are quite good, and they can deny the airspace near the front to non-stealthy Ukrainian aircraft.

If Ukraine attacks these defenses, Ukraine will take much larger losses than when defending against Russian offenses. They can and should keep fighting, but carefully, as to prevent as many losses as possible.

But in the long run, the Russian defensive ability wont save them. First, Russia hasn't achieved their goals, right now if it all ended Russia didn't achieve their goals and lost a staggering amount, right now it would be a loss if Russia didn't go back on offense...and if they did it would be a terrible idea for them.

Why wont Russian defensive capability save them? Let's talk some reality. First, if Ukraine can destroy the Kerch Strait bridge, they probably take Crimea through siege. Russia feeds and arms their forces in Crimea using that bridge, and without it their ability to continue that (bearing in mind poor Russian logistics) are compromised. Sending those supplies across the water cannot possible support their forces there and can also be targeted, and sending them through contested Ukraine is quite a lot farther and more costly, and is also in danger in the parts of Ukraine it would have to drive through.

That is Crimea eventually falling. It is a matter of when, not if.

Now the parts of Ukraine with a direct land connection to Russia? That is much more problematic. For Ukraine to take that would take military capability Ukraine, but in the end if those areas are returned to Ukraine (and again, keeping those areas is not a victory for Russia, I am speculating in what a full victory for Ukraine would look like) it will not be because they were lost militarily.

Why? Let's talk sanctions:

The sanctions are doing more than you might think. Russia is hurting. Russia is buying artillery shells from North Korea and drones from Iran, nations Russia used to supply, now they are a customer. That speaks to Russia's military industry. Russia cannot build Armada tanks to send into war, they are sending T54/55s built in 1948. And Russia cannot build more SU-57's, an aircraft not seen over Ukraine. 

Russia is mainly selling gas and oil to China and India, and they are selling it for currency that only buys goods and services from China and India. That will not help them to win the war. 

So as long as the sanctions continue, Russia's clock is ticking. They can put off the inevitable, but in the end Russia will have to abandon this war that they started. Economics demand it.

Will the sanctions end? No, not until the war ends, and not for a while after that. So the west will keep the sanctions up for as long as it takes, as that serves the interests of the west. 

Will the military aid end? No. It will slow, but we are still talking about spares, older weapons systems and ammunition which is not front of the line for NATO. This is an investment for the west into Russian defeat, and the harder Russia loses, the more secure the west is when this war is over. 

&#x200B;

Lastly, lets talk about the reality of the situation for Russia:

Russia is sending T54/55s into war, Ukraine is now sending Abrams, Leopards and Challengers. Russia cannot take steps forward, their ability to project power is a joke. Russia is getting hit at home by Ukraine, and now by terrorists. And now NATO has expanded, now closer to Russia than ever, now covering both sides of the exit from St. Petersburg, making getting submarines out in a stealthy way more difficult for Russia. And in the end Ukraine has kept fighting, and the west has kept supporting them.

Russia has succeeded to the greatest extent that they are able to militarily and economically, and can go no further, and cannot be said to have won this war.   


And the future is more bleak for Russia than the present.

&#x200B;

So please, change my view on this if you can. Convince me that it is possible for Russia to achieve their military objectives in Ukraine."
118,2024-03-25,"CMV: Social media is undoing the fabric of society and, in its current form, poses an existential risk to the future prosperity of the human species. ",u/Fluffy-Dog5264,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bnos7w/cmv_social_media_is_undoing_the_fabric_of_society/,changemyview,"This isn’t to say that social media is inherently bad. Conversely, I believe that the technology is incredibly powerful. Which is exactly why its mismanagement under its current stewardship has, and continues to pose a catastrophic risk to the stability of our global civilization.

In light of recent events, it’s becoming ever more apparent to me how important consensus will become in the coming years. Technology is becoming far too powerful for us to let ideological fault-lines turn into rifts. You may or may not agree that when words fail, and communication breaks down, all that is left is violence. If we can’t reasonably convince others of our viewpoints through rational discourse without evolving into spear throwing, then there is no reasonable hope to think that we can survive the coming century of technological evolution un-fractured.

Think about what social media is at its core — a platform conceived from the ground up to facilitate discussion and consensus. But instead its current stewards have dialed this optimizing function in the complete polar opposite direction: to sow division. 

Why would they do this? Because there isn’t a single human emotion that is more motivating than anger, and hate. 

The business model requires engagement more than anything for these companies to survive. Despite the mounting evidence that the status quo does more harm than good to its users, let  alone society at large, this status quo persists. As mental health issues proliferate, and aspirant despots bid for power, it’s difficult to ignore the indelible imprint of wasted potential that stains the internet’s modern history. 

What if we had all the spoils of enlightenment thinking and 21st century medicine but, as the cherry on top, we could actually agree on a few things? Like, very basic things that can consolidate the future prosperity of our offspring. 

Informedness, tolerance, liberty and sustainability. 

It would have been understandable to call me a starry eyed idealist a few decades ago. But turn of the century advances in digital communication infrastructure has turned this prospect from a pipe dream to a completely workable reality. Think about it, two birds with one stone: optimize for broad base consensus instead of engagement, and problems to do with polarization and problematic use go away! Taiwan’s government has even experimented with this in their digital platforms during election years in an attempt to combat political strife. 

Modern society is a deeply complex system, the failure of which accrues greater stakes on a yearly basis. Not just for us, but also every other species on the planet. I believe that establishing a healthy status quo for all digital connective tech, including AI, VR and neurotech, will be the biggest existential challenge for us over the next 50 or more years, alongside climate change of course. And the continued prosperity of future people will depend largely on getting it right. Could you CMV?"

The majority of the people I’ve talked to say it is wrong and they wouldn’t be friends with someone that would do that. However, pretty much all of the people I’ve talked to that feel this way are men talking about a male friend with a sister. When asked the same question, but about a brother and female friend they usually have an entirely different answer. 

I think this belief is rooted in sexism. I think these men subconsciously believe that each time a woman has sex it further devalues her, especially with casual sex. I think that, conversely, they see a man with a higher body count in a positive light. 

Personally, I find it very strange to care about who your sister has sex with. Also, I don’t see casual sex as an immoral act. I think that it can be an enjoyable experience between two consenting adults, where you get some physical pleasure as well as the comfort from closeness to another person. People I’ve spoken to about this claim the reason they care is just because they are a “protective brother”. I normally respond with, “what are you protecting your sister from, an orgasm?” Because, if the person sleeping with your sister is a friend you should know their character and that they are respectful. So, I would go as far to say, wouldn’t someone rather their sister be sleeping with their friend than someone they don’t know. Also, why wouldn’t they want their sister to have sex. As I stated before, sex is enjoyable. Why wouldn’t you want a loved one to partake in enjoyable experience, especially with someone you know and trust.

Any policy proposal I have seen which aims to support reaching net zero, on closer inspections appears to simply impoverish the people of the country it is enacted in. Similarly such policies will make a nation less competitive at best, and under go a voluntary process of economic self flagellation at worse. 

The prospect of net zero sees people's freedom's inevitably being cuetailled. An example of this is that you already you have plans in place in several nations for dynamic pricing based on demand facilitated by real time data transmissions, which will ultimately see poorer people working 9-5 jobs paying more for their electricity and heating, when prices are already extremely high in most countries. 

The only way to achieve net zero is by punishing ordinary people and diminishing their quality of life. In pursuit of what is effectively an ideologically driven goal.

When net zero is avhieved in day Spain, the United Kingdom or Germany, what impact does this have on the environment ? Not very much. If everyone achieved net zero what is a really the benefit here? The planet warms slightly slower ?

 Is that really worth impoverishing people, restricting their freedoms and ushering in reduced economic output and activity purely to slow down global warming ? Personally I don't think so.

Perhaps I am missing something here, some key piece of information which will perhaps change my view. But ultimately I don't think that the ""climate crisis"" is really something the average person needs to be overly concerned about. Certainly something that governments and corporations should have a responsibility to fix, but that should be done by transitioning to clean energy sources and finding innovative solutions, not mindless pursuits of ideological goals which hurt ordinary people for something which ultimately the human race has very little control over.

1,2024-03-25,"CMV: Zionism is widely misunderstood and demonized, and has been the most successful land-back movement for an indigenous people this century",u/ok_memelord,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bnx9jo/cmv_zionism_is_widely_misunderstood_and_demonized/,changemyview,"There's been a lot of historically inaccurate talking points being thrown around since October 7th, mainly that Jews are no different to white Europeans, and that Zionism is an extension of white supremacy and settler colonialism. This couldn't be further from the truth.

**1.) Jews are indigenous to Israel**

\-In the second century BCE after the Maccbean revolt, a Jewish state was established in Judah - roughly within the borders of modern day Israel.

\-Judah eventually became a client state of the Roman emporer. The Jews revolted against the Romans and were expelled; the Romans renamed the area Syria Palaestina - Palestine -  by Emporer Hadrian in order to sever the Jewish connection with the land.

\-The expelled Jews settled in Europe (Ashkenazi), the Middle East (Mizrachi) and the Iberian Peninsular (Sephardic)

**2.) Zionism is a land-back movement, the aim of which was to liberate Jews from antisemitsm through the creation of a Jewish state in their ancestral homeland**

The Jews in the diapora experienced 2 millenia of persecution, exlusion and genocide. Antisemitism was ubiqiutous, potent, and popped up generation after generation. 

Theodore Herzl, a Vienese Jewish reporter reporting on the Dreyfus Affair and the ""father"" of political zionism, observed the nature of the monster that is antisemitism and had the following observation:

""If France – bastion of emancipation, progress and universal socialism – can get caught up in a maelstrom of antisemitism and let the Parisian crowd chant 'Kill the Jews!' Where can they be safe once again – if not in their own country? Assimilation does not solve the problem because the Gentile world will not allow it as the Dreyfus affair has so clearly demonstrated""

To sum up, Jews are an ethnic group who are distinct from white Europeans in genetics, culture, and language. Ashkenazi (European)  Jews are the descendents of the Jews kicked out of Judah, and are indigenous to modern day Israel. Zionism was a reaction to antisemitism, stating that Jews could only escape antisemitism through the creation of their own national homeland.

This post is not arguing whether the creation of Israel was right or not - it's setting the record straight about Jews as an ethnic group and the historical validity to their claim of being indigenous to Israel.

I also feel that men have to bring a lot more to the table to be attractive to a woman, especially if he’s not physically attractive.

1,2024-03-25,CMV: The Sexual Revolution did jack squat for American women,u/nowlan101,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bny1de/cmv_the_sexual_revolution_did_jack_squat_for/,changemyview,"Maybe in a “long arc of history” argument you could say it overall made it easier for women to have open, casual sex without being slut shamed and that the American public today is vastly more accepting of it then they were even 20 years ago, but in the short term, in the 60’s and 70’s, feminists were kinda right. 

At least the 50’s, 30’s and 40’s you had the veneer of propriety. You wouldn’t see a “romance” film between 15 year old and middle aged erotica author. Though there was rampant abuse behind the scenes that would make your hair turn white to hear about. Those weird twisted desires, like the aforementioned plot which belongs to a real Charles Bronson movie, were kept away. Shamed by the taboos of any sex talk in movies. 

But the 60’s, 70’s and 80’s, in the aftermath of the revolution, you have all this grotesque, carnal hunger on the screens. A wet dream fantasy factory for American men, but that can now wrap itself in the flag of liberation or artistry instead of being called out for what it really was. Women as a whole can’t benefit in an environment like that, where the fruits of revolution are sweet for one gender and sour for the other. 

Free Love was just a way for men to openly cheat on their partners while pressuring them to be okay with it in the guise of “openness”. I mean literally, guys from that generation openly admit it. The book Please Kill Me Now, which is an oral history of punk, has some passages with one of the members of the stooges and he basically said “my version of free love was I get to fuck around while you still play loyal housewife to me.”

It was a thing. There’s no female equivalent to Annie Hall or Caddyshack. It was all for the male gaze. So I think there’s some truth to the idea that the sexual revolution for women was added pressure to be more sexual but at the same time not *too* sexual because of continued double standards"
28,2024-03-25,CMV: the 32-hour proposed bill won't help the lower working class who are struggling the most,u/CareNo9290,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bny3tw/cmv_the_32hour_proposed_bill_wont_help_the_lower/,changemyview,"*Sorry if I come off as maybe ignorant or have some wrong facts. I don't have a perfect understanding on politics so this is just my take.*  


The lower working class probably won’t benefit much. The middle class or upper class? It will probably benefit them, but those at the lower working class will not benefit. My argument is that the lower working class people need to work several part time jobs in order to be able to afford their bills/expenses or even just to survive. This bill only affects full-time jobs. A single full-time job could pay less than 3 part time jobs or even 2, which is what some people are doing in order to survive. But toning it down, let’s assume the lower working class individual works 2 part time jobs simultaneously. They are still working more than 32 hours.   


Furthermore, while the bill does produce more open job positions, it doesn’t change the fact that they don’t pay enough and that the federal minimum wage is impossible to survive off of. You can work a full-time job and still not make enough money to live, so a part time job wouldn’t be any better. The compensation of work hours doesn’t make up for the payment to expenses ratio deficit, it only reduces stress. As previously stated, lower class workers will not work only 32 hours a week, but possibly more. Additionally, employees might be willing to work more overtime, which would mean corporations have to pay more just for the employee working 40 hours. Therefore, this will actually cause businesses to create more job openings with lower pay. While the businesses can’t lower the pay of current employees, nothing is stopping them from lowering the pay for future  job positions. This will only make it harder for people to afford to live.   


I say that a good way to support the bill would be to create a separate one raising the federal minimum wage/mandating certain states to increase their minimum wage according to the median expenses to payment ratio in each county of that state. The bill also negatively impacts smaller businesses that find difficulty in finding and paying employees, so the bill should target businesses/corporations who make a minimum amount of revenue or have a minimum of employees. That way it exempts struggling businesses. Additionally, the bill should try to create more mandatory benefits for mental health or stress management, so that corporations are further limited from taking advantage of their employees, especially when the employees' work hours are lowered.  


In conclusion, I believe that while the bill will significantly reduce the amount of stress on the middle/upper middle class, it doesn’t do much for the lower working class who financially struggle and cannot manage their stress because they’re always working. I think the bill is a great idea, but it should target the financial aspect of working rather than the stress, because more pay for the same job would mean less external stress factors such as debts, bills, personal expenses, etc.

Might seem weird to explain here, but I frequently hear people using the word without proper context. Anyway, there's a variety of different forms this tendency can take. Some being worse than others. Now, to get onto the meat of this post:

I'm not exactly proud to admit this, but I'm a Sadist. I have frequent sexual thoughts about various women that involve torture. Usually mental torture aimed at making them feel helpless. This has occurred since I was thirteen (I'm nineteen now, turning twenty this September) and I've tried to stop thinking like this many times. Without success. To make things weirder, such thoughts aren't even triggered by anger towards the women. If I dislike any woman to a significant degree, I typically don't think about her in a sexual way period. My feelings toward most women I fantasize about are either positive or neutral. I'm just enticed by the thought of having power over them. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to hurt anyone like that for real, but I still think their overall presence makes some unsavory implications about my mental state. Especially since I don't know where they come from. Despite that I've been told by folks online that I shouldn't worry since I'm not tempted to cause actual harm and I'm just kinky. But I...hesitate to trust that because they didn't give any logical reason behind that belief. I was hoping someone here might give a clearer answer. Am I just kinky or sick?"

I say this because pro-lifers ignore things like income and the well being of the parent when it comes to making abortion illegal. They would rather a child be born into a situation where the mother may be mentally unwell or working minimum wage. I saw a pro-lifer argue that crack-addicts should still have their children even though that child will be born addicted to crack. This, to me, doesn't make any sense and looks like you're fine with children being born into lives where they are destined to be abused or neglected. If it is vey obvious that the mother is not suited to raise that child, why would you ever consider letting that child be born into that mother's custody. This is borderline being pro child abuse.

Pro-lifers argue you should take responsibility of the consequences of your actions. Let's look at the people who are having abortions. Most are poor women in their 20s. Poor women who live off minimum wage jobs. Is the single woman making $6 an hour supposed to take care of herself and her baby? How many of those women are going to put themselves first when things get desperate, and leave that child without food? What about homeless women. Is the homeless woman supposed to support herself and her baby with no income? What happens when that homeless women desperately needs money; what's gonna happen to that child? What about teens who get pregnant, which is the second highest demographic of people who get pregnant behind women in their 20s. You really think the irresponsible teen girl who forgot to use a condom is going to happily raise this child, or will it end up on the side of the road somewhere.

 These women are not going to take care of these children like pro-lifers magically think they are. They're not going to give a shit about them just because they were forced to have them. No one wants to look after something they never wanted in the first place. Child abuse rates are going to skyrocket with all these unwanted children running around, that's just a fact. Millions of children will end up dead and/or abused. Prolifers know this and are choosing to ignore it or justify it. That is pro child abuse, unintentionally. They may not want the abuse to happen, but they're doing nothing to stop it either. They're encouraging these women to have the babies in their poor state.

""The child should have a fighting chance no matter the situation they're born into.""
That's all fine. Doesn't change the fact that you're allowing that child to be born into that situation in the first place just because you believe it should be alive regardless. You're against the people who don't want that child to end up in a ditch or trashcan, to end up in a situation where they will be starving without food. And you call yourselves the moral people? Fully knowing these kids are going to be starving and subjected to other abuse? You're okay with that? You would rather this child be alive in hell than never had existed at all. I don't understand.

I'm ranting. Just my thoughts. I don't see in any way how abortion can be moral or said to ""care about the children"" when the children in question are 100% going to end up living shitty lives until they turn 18, or even beyond that. It's not about the children anymore, and frankly I don't think it ever was. "

And there is no better example of this than the divide between minimum wage laws vs unions as a method of achieving higher wages for the working class.

Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Austria, Germany, Switzerland all have high wages despire no minimum wage laws, this is a result of unionization and collective bargaining between the employer and the employees. Collective bargaining is much stronger than individuals. The problem is that unions have declined in countries like the United States, as a result of state actions taken against them, and propaganda put out by the capitalists.

1,2024-03-26,CMV: A US-China war over Taiwan would be a good thing,u/FuckHopeSignedMe,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bo3xf2/cmv_a_uschina_war_over_taiwan_would_be_a_good/,changemyview,"Here's some reasons why. 

**One: Climate Change** 

Climate change is the number one threat to society today. China and the United States consistently rank as two of the world's biggest polluters, if not *the* two biggest polluters. A sufficiently major war can decrease the amount of carbon dioxide emissions. World War II had this overall effect, for example. 

This would likely repeat if China invaded Taiwan; especially if the United States were to become directly involved. Just shutting down access to the Taiwan Strait would destroy US$2.6 trillion worth of global trade, [according to some estimates.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/25/if-china-invaded-taiwan-it-would-destroy-world-trade-says-james-cleverly) According to the World Trade Organisation, the amount of global trade in 2022 [was worth US$31 trillion in total](https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/wtsr_2023_e.pdf), so this would amount to close to 10% of global trade destroyed. 

The flow on effect would be a lot of current carbon emissions would go away. A sizable amount of the current emissions are entirely reliant on that trade happening, so stopping or slowing it would force the emissions to be cut back. 

This would force a faster adoption of renewables. One of the reasons why China has traditionally been a large polluter is because it's been able to import coal from other countries. In recent years, China has made substantial strides towards becoming predominantly powered by renewable energy, however a lack of carbon emitting fuels from elsewhere would likely force it to adopt renewable energy at an even faster pace. 

This could also have a similar effect on the United States. While American dependence on oil from the Persian Gulf states is declining, it's still a factor and likely will be for many years at this point. Any war that would potentially disrupt that supply line, even if it's in a very roundabout way, would speed up the United States' transition to renewables.

**Two: The overpopulation factor** 

The unfortunate reality of today's world is that it is overpopulated. While enough food is being produced to feed everyone currently alive, that's unlikely to happen with current monied interests. 

I think the fact that there is enough food for everyone tends to ignore the main reason the world's overpopulated isn't the capacity for modern food production, though I think that is something worthy of discussion. The main reason the world is overpopulated is because of the current climate crisis. Especially in countries with high carbon footprints, every additional person tends to cause a disproportionate amount of harm to society. 

So, the best thing that could happen is if a major war broke out and had a high casualty rate. Compared to the casualty rates in American wars since World War II, and especially this century, the deaths from a war with China would be high. Even optimistic estimates of what American losses in such a war are high: [at least two aircraft carriers and seven other surface vessels](https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/230109_Cancian_FirstBattle_NextWar.pdf?VersionId=WdEUwJYWIySMPIr3ivhFolxC_gZQuSOQ), according to a report from the Center of Strategic and International Studies, along with hundreds of aircraft. 

This would be a hard pill for a lot of people to swallow, but it would ultimately be a good thing. It'd still be a fairly small number in terms of the overall population of the United States. Fatalities on the Chinese side would likely be even higher, but still small. 

The big benefit of this would be that it'd start a demographic decline. This is already a factor at play due to the fact that birth rates tend to slow in well educated, industrialised countries. In China specifically, it's already started: its population is in the early stages of a decline. A US-China war would speed this up as a large chunk of the dead would be younger people who either hadn't yet had children or would have had more if they hadn't died in combat. 

While a counterpoint to this would be to suggest that there'd be a postwar baby boom, that's not a given. The reason why there was one in Allied countries after World War II was because they were coming home to booming economies where they could afford to have several kids. That isn't a given in a US-China war. The estimates I've seen suggest that the global economy would contract during such a war and would likely remain contracted afterwards, regardless of who won. 

The flow on effect of that is that people wouldn't be having more kids for some of the same reasons they aren't having kids today. In fact, it'd possibly even worsen these conditions. Therefore, a relatively small decrease in the population due to the war would become a much larger decline in the decades after. This would be a good thing for the climate as people can't pollute if they're not around to do any polluting. 

**Three: the societal change factor**

One of the things that major wars tend to be very good for is causing widespread societal change. In the United States, for example, World War II has been credited with invigorating the black civil rights movement and the second wave of feminism that became the backbone of social change in the 1950s and '60s. For a more modern example, Ukraine is currently attempting to crack down on its widespread corruption issues, and this is largely due to its current war effort. 

This would likely repeat if a US-China war broke out. While the international economy might be in shambles for decades, it would still be feasible to make concessions to appease disgruntled, battle-hardened vets and the people who'd likely side with them in any civil unrest. For the most part, governments are generally more willing to make some concessions to the people after a major war if the choice is either throwing the dog a bone or face major civil unrest after a major war. 

**Four: Taiwan would be more likely to retain independence** 

Of course, the main reason why this hypothetical war would be good is because Taiwan would be able to retain its independence. 

This is good for intrinsic reasons. If a country wants to be independent, then it should be independent. It's also good because Taiwan tends to rank highly in terms of civil liberties, so the life of the average Taiwanese citizen in an independent Taiwan is much better today than it would be under Chinese occupation. 

It'd also be good for the West and its economies. Taiwan is a major manufacturer of microprocessors and is one of the West's main suppliers of them. If these factories came under Chinese occupation, that'd most likely cause supply chain issues as the Chinese would be disinclined to sell them to the West after such a major war. 

This sets such a war apart from recent American-led wars. Unlike with the Afghanistan War and the 2003 Iraq War, there would be a set objective (keep Taiwan independent), after which everyone could pack up and go home. It'd also be much more agreeable to most people in a moral sense as I doubt there's many people in the West today who think Taiwan should become a Chinese province. 

**Five: It'd lessen the influence of the major powers** 

The other end result of a major war between the US and China is that it'd lessen their power on the world stage. The reason this would happen is because global influence is at least partially based on international perception--that is, powerful countries are powerful because people perceive them to be such. 

It is possible for a country to lose this perception. A recent example of this is Russia. Before the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the Russian army was perceived to be the second or third most powerful army in the world. Its reputed might was so strong that when Hillary Clinton floated the idea of a no-fly zone over Syria, a lot of people were nervous about it due to the risk that it could provoke a war with Russia. 

This kind of perception no longer exists. Russia's military is no longer seen as the major threat it once was. While there are concerns that Russia may be trying to prepare for a wider war against NATO later this decade, nobody thinks they'd do as well in a conventional war against NATO today as they did five years ago. This is especially true given how many losses of experienced soldiers and good equipment the Russian army has taken in Ukraine. Gone are the days when Putin could come out and say that his army could take large chunks of eastern Europe in just a few days, [as he reportedly once did in 2014.](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/putin-russian-troops-could-be-in-vilnius-or-warsaw-in-two-days/) 

This is a consideration that would carry over to a US-China war. The United States would lose a lot of its influence due to it being largely based on its military might, and it will be seen to have lost a lot of its military might fighting China. China, on the other hand, will lose a lot of its influence because its economy, the cornerstone of its international influence, will be in complete disarray. 

While both countries would probably still be major players on the world stage, their influence will be lessened. I don't think either country would be completely replaced as a global superpower but I do think that regional powers will become much more prominent in their influence, at least in the short term."

Of course, the parity of European soccer is worse than that of the United States. But it's not that much of a difference. Rather, Kansas won the NFL three times out of five in the 2020s. It is a hard cap. There is no cap in baseball (the players' association does not agree), and due to the nature of the sport, pitchers only appear on the mound once every five days and pitch only about six innings on average. The batter must wait until his or her turn to bat. The weak team has an advantage over other sports. To begin with, PSG, with Messi and Neymar Mbappe, has won the Champions League 0 times. (PSG Messi couldn't even make it to the quarterfinals) Manchester United and City have won the Champions League once in the 21st century. It is not that different from American sports where there is a salary cap. Over the past five years, the winning teams have been Liverpool, Bayern, Chelsea, Real, and City"

Mutants are used to symbolize civil rights struggles and the unfortunate racism against minorities in the United States, but it’s stupid, because it’s perfectly logical to be racist against mutants.  Unlike different human races that that largely have the same physical capabilities, the average mutant is what? 10 times stronger than the average human?  If a specific race could brutally murder me in under 10 seconds without a weapon then do the same to any witnesses or law enforcement I would structure my entire life around avoiding that race, and I firmly believe it would not make me a bad person.  It doesn’t even have to be on purpose, superpowered people kill normal people on accident all the time; which famously happened in the pilot of “The Boys”

A super-power “cure” that would take away super-powered people’s special abilities without their consent is treated like an extermination, this is also stupid.  Why on God’s green earth is punching holes in people’s brains considered a human right, to me it actually sounds like a fairly reasonable and non violent way to handle dangerous super-powered people.

Most famously in the Brotherhood of Mutants(X-Men) super-powered people believe that they are better than normal people.  This is obviously meant to represent groups that believe in racial superiority.  This is a stupid comparison because well; the brotherhood is right lol.  Most media portrays super-powered people as exactly the same as normal people(even looking the same most of the time), but they have a special ability with no downside.  This makes super-powered people even more superior to normal people as  Homo sapiens sapiens(sorry if I botched the name) are to Neanderthals, because at least Neanderthals are physically stronger than us which gives them some kind of advantage over us.

Those are the most prominent examples I’ve seen of comparisons of super-powered groups to real world groups, and they all suck.  I’d love to hear what others have to say about it, hence the post.  Thank you for reading and have a splendid day."

However, it is **terribly incompatible** with the most fundamental subdivision of years into **days**. Simply put, a year has 365 days (forget leap years for now), and 12 definitely **does not** divide 365. This faced humanity with two options, the reasonable one and the stupid one.

The reasonable option is, of course, to come to terms with the fact that, since days are unequivocally the most important unit of time (at least in the non-immediate scale), and lunar months have fractional days, **we should not use them to keep track of days**.

The stupid option is to force the division of a year into 12 months, making up an unnecessarily system where we restart counting the days in cycles of uneven lengths we call ""months"" that are now not actually the same as the original lunar months, and to top it off, have huge ego fights about how the months should be named and whose important enough to have a longer month after their name, leading us to a sorry situation where even though 365 divided by 12 has a remainder of 5, the length of months varies between 28 and 31 days (instead of having, say, seven 30 day months and five 31 day months. And then we can say ""oh wait, that's not stupid enough"" and shuffle months around such that **the tenth/eleventh/twelfth months** are named after **the numbers eight nine and ten** because someone pushed them two places because he thought is religious inclinations take more precedence over **having a clear and easy method for tracking f\*\*king time**.

So, obviously, humanity went with the stupid option. And now when someone tells you ""Lets set an appointment for August 6th"" you have to do multi-modular arithmetic just to figure out what day of the week this date falls on.

Imagine a world where we just numbered the days of the year from 1 to 365, adding a 0th day once every four years. Wouldn't that be incredible? Just imagine talking about dates. ""When is your birthday?"", ""135"". ""Let's meet three weeks from now"", ""OK that's today+21"". (After some more adjustments) ""the vernal equina are in days 1 and 182-183, the solstices are on days 91 and 273-274"".

It might get some getting used to, but I think any benefit of the current system over my proposed one are cultural habits that can be adapted to any system. I don't know how humanity would have been affected by taking this route, but I like to believe that had it done so, today it would have looked something like [this](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/026/738/future.jpg).

1,2024-03-26,CMV: Option of extended driver's license to permit going over speed limit,u/macnfly23,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bo9nen/cmv_option_of_extended_drivers_license_to_permit/,changemyview,"As most people know, the highways (Autobhans) in Germany often don't have any posted speed limit. Not all but a lot. Many people over the years have made arguments that extending this to other countries wouldn't work, and one reason that often comes up is the fact that it's harder to get a driver's license in Germany and that drivers are more experienced. 

I'd propose the following (doesn't matter for which country, let's say the US). The current speed limits remain for regular drivers, but an option is provided where someone can apply for an ""enhanced driver's license"" which would include additional defensive driving training similar to what police officers do and general education about speed and all of that. 

Once someone gets this enhanced license (which would not be easy to get and you would need at least say 5 years on a regular license) they would be allowed, on certain highways (and not in cities), to either have an increased speed limit applied (say +20%-30% from the regular one) or unlimited speed as in Germany. They would of course be required to adapt their speed to the conditions and they could still be fined for not driving in a reasonable and prudent manner if the speed is clearly inappropriate in the conditions. But if there's no one else on the road and they're going 100mph/160kmh, there wouldn't be a problem. Also, if an enhanced driver gets speed tickets for dangerous driving, they would lose their enhanced license and revert to a regular one.

Conversely, regular drivers exceeding speed limits would have harsher penalties.

Let me anticipate some of the arguments against this:

(1) It's too much bureaucracy to be worth it

The enhanced license isn't mandatory so it only affects people who want to be able to drive faster

(2) It costs the taxpayer too much money to implement this system for a select few people

There would be a tax on enhanced licenses to fund any associated costs.

(3) The training won't be good enough and speed is still dangerous

It works in Germany even without there being specialized training, so why wouldn't it? And why do we trust police and ambulances to drive fast then? Yes, speed is dangerous but in reality a ""regular driver"" driving the speed limit might still be more dangerous than an enhanced driver driving over. The enhanced license doesn't give a free license to speed whenever, only when the conditions are safe

(4) It's useless because increasing speed doesn't change journey time enough

People are often in a hurry and even 5-10 minutes might matter. In any case, there is clearly a human perception that if they go faster they'll arrive faster so people are going to speed no matter what. Do we rather want someone to have more training or keep the current system where people without training are going to speed anyway? And on long journey's if one goes an average of 80mph compared to 100mph it can make a large difference in the end

(5) Arguments about road conditions (i.e. roads not maintained well)

Maybe I'm wrong but I don't really buy that road conditions make a huge difference if someone is going a bit faster, but this would also be included in training and people would be made aware. Highways where the conditions are particularly bad would not be included in the ""enhanced"" system and would still have speed limits

The majority of Palestinians were born under these conditions, if any of us in the west were to experience the same things they did by some foreign government wed be demanding they were destroyed entirely.

Look what we did after 9/11 , razed 2 nations that weren't even directly involved. How can anyone say its unjustifiable that the Palestinians engage in violence for their freedom. 

In international law, the right to violently resist is closely related to the principle of self-determination. It is widely recognized that a right to self-determination arises in situations of colonial domination, foreign occupation, and racist regimes that deny a segment of the population political participation.

If there are no other means of attaining your rights taking them by force violently from those denying them to you is entirely justifiable CMV."

Ethics and morals are enforced because the majority agree to it and as the majority they are naturally stronger than minority. Leaders have no power if the entirety of the rest of the country revolts. To stay in power a ruler must either keep the country from uniting or to have a stronger group helping them, like the military.

The only way to change things is to convince the stronger party or overthrow them. If you convince them they are still in controll, but if they wanted they could change back and if you can't convince them there's nothing left to do besides revolt.

When some people say 'Humanizing Hitler', they are talking about cherry-picking things that he said to make him seem like a semi not horrible person. I am not saying that he was anything more than a pathetic hateful man. However, I believe that so many people make a mistake in acting as if Hitler was some one-in-a-billion kind of guy, a man with beliefs so extreme and so incomprehensible that there was never really anyone like him before he came about, and that there will probably never be someone like him again. When you accept this belief, you inhibit a presupposition that falling down the rabbit hole Hitler did could never happen to you, that you could never become a hateful evil person like he was. If you don't accept yourself as at risk of succumbing to evil temptation, then you are more likely to live in an echo chamber, and not allow yourself to consider the possibility that you may hold to an immoral ideology. More people should read Mein Kampf and books of the like, to see how people become radicalized, and how they can avoid it themselves, Humanizing Hitler is an important step in this. 

I think that the most likely way my view could be changed on this is if you could convince me that determinism is incorrect. The main reason I hold this belief is because I think essentially any Human that had the same influences as Hitler had, would have become a hateful person just like him, albeit they probably would not become powerful as he did because he was unique in his speaking ability. If it is convincingly shown that determinism is deeply flawed, and that most people in Hitlers situation would not have gone down the same/a similar path. "

For Arab countries, they can be excused since they at least have some level of kinship with Palestine. For them, they have zero. Apart from religion, they have no other redeeming quality to sustain their beef with Israel. Singapore left the mess that is Malaysia and has since established a healthy relationship with Israel all along maintaining it's international obligation when it comes to the conflict.

Human rights? Malaysia has legal apartheid and segregation while Indonesia is committing a genocide against the Black population of West Papua. Brunei wanted to start killing gay people but had to place a moratorium due to a massive pushback arising from their proposed law.

I can understand Iran but SE Asians beefing with Israel just shows subservience to Arab interests and not in their own interests. Like they derive nothing concrete from their actions and the conflict would largely be solved without their input by Arab and Western countries.

The Christian Apologists who claim to have sound reasoning in their approximation of an ""Argument"" all make large assumptions and fail to see the 'barrier to entry' -- that ""faith"" -- in the enterprise of theism which is necessary to have before any form of belief could be rationalized or reliably established.

For instance, anybody claiming that God exists who do not include faith in (at the very least) ""the unprovable, absolute existence of Good & Evil"" as part of that equation is selling the whole thing short by playing outside their lane, claiming that something which requires faith in order to exist can be seen without it."

1,2024-03-26,CMV: Climate Denialism is equivalent to Genocide Denialism and should be treated as such in the mainstream.,u/Soma2a_a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1boenj9/cmv_climate_denialism_is_equivalent_to_genocide/,changemyview,"Let's get some definitions out of the way

Climate Denialism: Rhetoric and actions meant to deny or downplay the severity of climate change and need for climate action (phasing out of fossil fuels, future effects of climate change, etc)

Genocide Denialism: Rhetoric and actions meant to deny or downplay the severity of a past or present genocide (arguing about the exact figures, about intent, apologism, etc)

When I say ""treated as such in the mainstream"" I mean just as a Holocaust denier wouldn't be given any airtime on any mainstream network, climate deniers should be treated just as genocide deniers are treated in their ""opinions"" on those matters. Treated as unserious, insane, and overall harmful to any discourse regarding that subject. I'm not advocating for any legal action against them (unless they make defamatory or libel statements in relation to their rhetoric).

Nor am I saying discussion regarding the academic specifics of climate shouldn't happen, just as academic specifics of genocide should still happen. But Denialism is very clear in its intent if someone actively goes against accepted figures with no evidence for those claims, other than conspiracies. The key here is *evidence* and *intent.* If a scientist has evidence a consensus view in climate science isn't true, and provides that evidence in accordance to peer-review, and still acknowledges the other accepted figures in climate science, then fine. 

But, if a pundit with no climate background frequently pushes back against scientific consensus regarding climate with only fallacies and anti-climate rhetoric, then they shouldn't be allowed to be a pundit and the network that employs them should be shamed in every way possible. 

Why I believe Climate Denialism is equivalent to Genocide Denialism is simple. Climate Change is in fact capable of killing and displacing tens if not hundreds of millions of people in the near-future (2050-2100) and intensify global conflicts if action, mitigation, and adaptation is not adequately taken. As well as subjecting future generations to this reality. By denying the realities of Climate change, those deniers practically endorse this future, and so, endorse all the death and destruction that entails. The reason the mainstream doesn't view this to be the case is because climate denialism, by way of fossil fuel misinformation and propaganda, has been normalized. This shouldn't be the case, just as genocide denialism shouldn't be normalized. I make the equivalence to showcase the danger climate denialism entails and causes.

Most of my views on climate change's consequences can be seen in the IPCCs latest synthesis report."

There's evidence that several of the vaccines could lead to an increased risk of blood clots and other blood related issues (low platelets, unusual bruising, etc.) 

 When bringing these issues up in conversation, people who aren't against vaccines tend to get very defensive, as if discussing the negative effects is the same as denouncing all benefits. It seems impossible to discuss the legitimate risks without it becoming political. 

  Because of this reaction, people who have had complications or are concerned about them have largely been shunned and not allowed to express their concerns without being lumped in with the antivaxxers. This shunning helps to push them into the hands of antivaxxers and become radicalized. 

 People who are in support of vaccines were so afraid of giving the antivaxxers talking points that they refused to acknowledge the side effects at all. They continue to downplay them, actively destroying people's trust in modern medicine by ignoring legitimate concerns out of fear of illegitimate ones. "

Men who like women are sexual beasts at their cores, and mere impulses and thoughts cannot be wrong.  

I’ll go a step further and say that there’s nothing wrong with *expressing* that objectification in an appropriate context.  Nothing wrong with simply saying that a woman is “hot,” that you’d like to fuck her, *how* you’d like to fuck her — these are mere cousins to the thoughts themselves, after all.

It only becomes wrong when it crosses into *action* that harms, or could harm, another person.  So talking with your buds about the girl at work is harmless.  Go nuts.  But catcalling or harassing her is not.  Talking sexually about her in front of children, or in front of women who might take offence, is not.  Etc.  

And just because the objectification isn’t itself wrong doesn’t mean it can be indulged without caution.  Seeing women solely as mere sexual objects can lead to unfair and degrading acts, and one must ensure that this doesn’t happen even unknowingly because its unfairness doesn’t depend on intent.  But viewing them sexually as just one part of a balanced picture is perfectly normal and not at all wrong."
6,2024-03-26,CMV: University education isn't worth it like 50% of the time nowadays. Unless you're interested in one of the most in demand fields or domains then you're wasting your time and money.,u/Core2score,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bofqll/cmv_university_education_isnt_worth_it_like_50_of/,changemyview,"So much hype surrounds university degrees nowadays. The reality of it is like the difference between how cool it seems to be in the UFC vs getting punched in the face by Jon Jones.

I still see young people pressured to secure a spot in a uni cause it gets you a better start in life, earns you respect and ensures that you get paid better. Almost none of which is true.

Respect is earned, not simply granted, and it's not a bonus that you get with a uni degree or whatever. As for a better start in life, well that depends on where you are. In North America, where a program in law, healthcare, or computer science could see you rack up to hundreds of thousands of dollars in student debt, it could  actually make your start in life so much more difficult.

Payment isn't necessarily better neither! Now admittedly people like doctors, pharmacists, dentists, lawyers, and some IT engineers get paid way better than average, but that's not everyone. Life is too short to spend doing something you don't like just cause you wanna make a decent living, especially when (as I will explain later) that's not the only way. If you're interested in say history, marine biology, public relations, or the like, then you might be in for a nasty surprise as your annual salary post graduation might not equal 20% of what you had to spend on your higher education.

Moreover, even if you are one of the more sought after pros, how much more do you think you'll be making? I'm a pharmacist, graduated a few years ago, one of my closest friends since childhood chose to become a hairdresser. Now he has his own business and when you factor in how much I have to pay in taxes every year, he makes close to twice as much lol (businesses have a much easier time with tax write offs). It's easy to imagine why when you realize he didn't have to spend over half a decade in school, or stack up tens of thousands of dollars in student debt, or pass a separate licensure exam for every province he wants to work in.

Another relative of mine started a bakery with his wife a few years ago with a bit of help from their parents, and now they supply multiple supermarkets and are on the verge of expanding to another province.

Of course I'm not saying that the secret to success is to become a baker or a hairdresser, and this could be a much longer OP but I'll leave it at this. If you have kids, my view is don't pressure them into going to uni. A simple 2 year college program could be so much more cost efficient, and earn them the same income as many uni students. Better yet, investing the cost of a uni program in a small business might pay off so much better and impose less mental pressure on them later in life. If you're thinking about going to uni, don't do it cause it's the norm, or cause people want you to do it, do it cause it's your passion and cause you want to. A uni program is no guarantee for more success than starting your adult life without one."

1,2024-03-26,cmv: the fine-tuning argument cannot be used as valid evidence for a god claim,u/bananataffi,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bog7gs/cmv_the_finetuning_argument_cannot_be_used_as/,changemyview,"My most foundational argument is that until the fine-tuning argument can be proven as true, it is inherently fallacious to use it as an argument or evidence for a god claim. An inability to be demonstrably proven implies a lack of cohesion with measurable reality. To be considered valid, a claim must be able to have supporting evidence that is demonstrable, repeatable, and verifiable. The fine-tuning argument falls short of this simple test of truth and therefore is invalid to use as evidence for a god claim until such time that is proven to be true. My next few arguments will be to further chip away the idea that the fine-tuning argument can support a god claim.   
Although we can’t definitely test whether reality is fine-tuned, we can see overwhelming complexity. This is represented through the way that universal laws play out. However, it is a jump in logic to look around at the complexity of this cosmos and assume it was finely-tuned. This is because there is a lack of supporting evidence for a cosmos that is fine-tuned and the argument essentially turns into: “I don’t know how complexity arises so it must be fine-tuned”. This is an argument from ignorance and therefore cannot be used as valid evidence for a god claim. This also creates a selection bias where other reasons for complexity are not properly explored.   
I believe a significant reason the universe may appear fine tuned is that our bodies and consciousness have been slowly adapting to reality through a process of biological evolution. The fine tuning argument assumes reality is particularly set up for the way our consciousness exists, and not that our consciousness has adapted to the way reality just happens to be.   
This leads me to my next point: the existence of universal laws does not imply a finely-tuned cosmos. Consider the following thought experiment: Imagine two identical universes, mirroring our own reality at this very moment. The only distinction between these universes is that one is finely-tuned by some ""fine-tuner,"" while the other universe evolves through mere complexity. How could we discern which universe is the finely-tuned one and which one is not?  
Ultimately, there is no definite test to confirm which universe is which. We may be able to hint towards one or the other but until one is verified it should not be stated as true. You can’t verify a god claim by making logical jumps where it’s convenient and that is exactly what the fine tuning argument does.   


I'm more than willing to admit where I may be fallacious and where I may not be speaking within the bounds of logic, please lemme know :)"
1,2024-03-26,CMV: None of the current US Supreme Court justices lied in their confirmation hearings about how they would vote on abortion,u/falsehood,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bogx8y/cmv_none_of_the_current_us_supreme_court_justices/,changemyview,"I see a lot of people from the left side of the political spectrum say this pretty freely, such as https://twitter.com/JohnCleese/status/1772614830765097113 today or https://twitter.com/tedlieu/status/1522967086577856513 two years ago.

I think this particular argument is really unhelpful because it moves the argument about honesty to shaky grounds compared to much more concerning topics like Clarence Thomas's pattern of undisclosed gifts from wealthy conservative friends and the filibuster against Merrick Garland.

Quoting [factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2022/05/what-gorsuch-kavanaugh-and-barrett-said-about-roe-at-confirmation-hearings/):

> A close examination of the carefully worded answers by the three Trump appointees, however, shows that while each acknowledged at their hearings that Roe was precedent, and should be afforded the weight that that carries, none specifically committed to refusing to consider overturning it.

In reviewing [the actual statements made by the then-nominees](https://www.npr.org/2022/05/03/1096108319/roe-v-wade-alito-conservative-justices-confirmation-hearings), none say in my reading that they would uphold or protect Roe. Instead, they called it a precedent. 

Alito: 
> ""Roe v. Wade is an important precedent of the Supreme Court. It was decided in 1973, so it has been on the books for a long time,"" he said. ""It is a precedent that has now been on the books for several decades. It has been challenged. It has been reaffirmed. But it is an issue that is involved in litigation now at all levels.""

Thomas:
> During his confirmation hearing in 1991, Thomas refused to state an opinion on abortion or whether Roe had been properly decided. Doing so could compromise his future ability to rule on cases related to Roe, he said. (""I can say on that issue and on those cases I have no agenda. I have an open mind, and I can function strongly as a judge."")

Gorsuch:
> ""I would tell you that Roe v. Wade, decided in 1973, is a precedent of the United States Supreme Court. It has been reaffirmed,"" he said. ""A good judge will consider it as precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court worthy as treatment of precedent like any other.""

> ""If I were to start telling you which are my favorite precedents or which are my least favorite precedents or if I view precedent in that fashion, I would be tipping my hand and suggesting to litigants that I have already made up my mind about their cases. That is not a fair judge. I did not want that kind of judge when I was a lawyer, and I do not want to be that kind of judge now.

Kavanaugh:
> ""It is settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court, entitled the respect under principles of stare decisis,"" he said. ""The Supreme Court has recognized the right to abortion since the 1973 Roe v. Wade case. It has reaffirmed it many times.""

Coney Barrett:
> Perhaps the most revealing moment for Barrett came as she was being questioned by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who asked if Barrett considered Roe to be a ""super-precedent.""

> Barrett answered by defining super-precedent as ""cases that are so well settled that no political actors and no people seriously push for their overruling.""

> ""And I'm answering a lot of questions about Roe, which I think indicates that Roe doesn't fall in that category,"" she said.

Roberts:
> During his confirmation hearing, Roberts repeatedly declined to comment on Roe beyond saying he believed it was ""settled as a precedent of the court.""

> For the court to overturn a prior decision, Roberts said he thought it was not sufficient to believe the case had been wrongly decided. The justices would have to consider other factors too, he said, ""like settled expectations, like the legitimacy of the court, like whether a particular precedent is workable or not, whether a precedent has been eroded by subsequent developments.""

> ""I do think that it is a jolt to the legal system when you overrule a precedent. Precedent plays an important role in promoting stability and evenhandedness,"" he said then.

And regarding calling something ""settled law"" see [this quote from Chuck Schumer](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/21/640626120/collins-says-supreme-court-nominee-kavanaugh-called-roe-v-wade-settled-law):
> ""Let's be clear: This is not as simple as Judge Kavanaugh saying that Roe is settled law,"" said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. ""Everything the Supreme Court decides is settled law until it unsettles it. Saying a case is settled law is not the same thing as saying a case was correctly decided.""

Newtons laws of motion suggest complete determinism in the universe. All forces and initial conditions of the universe at one point determine its future state entirely. This means that within the confines of newtons laws, everything is determined, and therefore nothing exists with the free will to change its course of behavior.

Not everything in the universe is governed strictly by Newtons Laws, however in the cases where different laws are at place (for example quantum mechanics) levels of randomness are introduced (through superposition) which still does not equate to free will. "
259,2024-03-26,"CMV: While colonialism is terrible, the concept of “Indigeneity” is commonly misconstrued, misused, and actually makes social justice more difficult",u/Phobophile81,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1boi6ba/cmv_while_colonialism_is_terrible_the_concept_of/,changemyview,"
Many times I come across debates about what specific group of people a part of the earth belongs to. The most obvious example is with the Middle East conflict right now, but wherever there’s a debate that involves race or identity, it seems to inevitably become an anthropological/historical arms race to determine what ethnicity of people actually “deserve” a piece of land.

My central point is that being indigenous is not an immutable, biological characteristic that many people think it is. It’s a social and political status, just like being a colonizer is. Seeing people in such a black and white way is ultimately not a logical or good way of looking at the world, the earth, or human beings.

We need to stop these regressive debates about what land belongs to who. Its pedantic, unhelpful, and unrealistic. We are not animals that are endemic to very specific ecoregions. We are humans and its in our nature to spread and explore as much as we can. We need to respect and take seriously the beliefs of the people who have lived in a specific place the longest, of course, because they have a wealth of generational knowledge. But there isn’t any immutable characteristic in those peoples DNA that makes them special, it’s simply the culture they belong to. 

The fact is we all walked out of africa at some point, and there's plenty of resources for us to share and thrive anywhere- especially with modern technology. We’re smart enough to figure out a way for everyone to ideally live where they think they ought to be without harming anyone else

I'm glad that we are more conscious of colonialism but sometimes people get too hung up on the nebulous concept of indigeneity. When we start getting caught up in all these ethnic and racial ideas to try to justify who a specific piece of land belongs to we start to become no better than the colonizers that claimed it for their own. Everyone should ultimately be allowed to live wherever they please if they do it with respect.

I’m not advocating for wiping away indigenous customs and traditions with free trade and gentrification. But treating indigenous people like their entire identity revolves around and is dogmatically linked to a specific piece of land, while non indigenous people are innately more cosmopolitan, is an exoticising and racist worldview in its own way"

However, if that happens, I believe Israel should just level Palestine. Militarily, I think that's the right decision. If you cannot keep up the Iron Dome for long enough and your citizens might be injured or your economy permanently damage, you must protect them at all costs. Give them a day to surrender or evacuate, and then just level anything that could even be close to a rocket launching site.

It probably wouldn't even be a war crime, as of they limit it to anywhere that has militaristic value, that is not a violation. But even if they just flatten everything, even residential, I believe that is a rulers duty to protect their citizens, even if they are jailed for it.

There are, of course, exceptions to this rule.

No, you cannot bring literal garbage or stuff that violates health code (i.e. used wigs, food products, etc)

The item needs to be proven functional or at least reparable.

There should be a law that pawnbrokers cannot refuse an item. It doesn't matter if it's not a name brand, fake, too old, whatever, as long as it's functional. Every item that comes into a pawn shop, the pawnbroker must offer a price on. If he feels like it's worthless, he must offer as low as 1¢. The customer, however, just as always, DOES NOT HAVE TO ACCEPT THE PRICE.

Reason I say this is because I frequent this pawn shop close to me often. Great business, but the pawnbrokers annoyed the hell out of me. I've seen them deny things for frivolous reasons, such as:

A guitar simply because it's not a name brand (as long as it functions I don't see the problem)

A set of golf clubs because they're Spalding (someone please elaborate to me what's wrong with a set of Spalding Golf Clubs)

A set of stainless steel earrings because ""currently we're not buying stainless steel.""

A printer because it wasn't brand new in the box

NWT underwear just because the pawnbroker straight-up said no.

Bowling balls because the lady almost broke his counter with them (not on purpose).

A set of speakers because there was a dent in them the size of a nickel (they didn't even attempt to test it out). If they proved it worked, there was no reason to deny him his money.

A vacuum that they initially did accept, but then forced the customer to give the money back because they found out afterwards that it was actually heavily used and repackaged to look new (that's your fault dude not the customer's)

A stereo because the customer was getting upset over the long line

And then customers get angry because they're denied money they were supposed to get and that they need, so they say ""I ain't going nowhere until I get my money,"" which these idiots interpret as ""please have your security drag me out forcibly.""

Exactly what gives them the right to put your hands on anyone? You're simply asking for a lawsuit, and then you're gonna wish you just offered something as little as a penny instead of being so tied up in litigation.

I don't want to hear how ""it's a private business they have the right to refuse items if they want to."" These reasons are frivolous.

It also makes me laugh, when these customers bring in ostensibly worthless stuff, the pawnbrokers would often say ""you're not gonna come in my store demanding money."" Bro, you are a pawn shop. People coming in your store demanding money is the SOLE PURPOSE of your existence."

I see a lot of people overcomplicate this situation in an attempt to make it harder to define what the founding Zionists did as colonization.  
  
I think this is wrong, I think that when you cut through all of the fog, Israel's creation was almost textbook colonization. Political Zionism started out with the goal of colonization, and it executed that goal 50 years later.  
  
To change my view you'll have to point out historical falsehoods in my following argument which fundamentally alter my timeline or overall analysis.  
  
Zionists began planning to take the region of Palestine as early as the 1880s, the very founder of Zionism, Herzl, referred to this goal as 'colonial.'  
  
To make it clear that Herzl meant colonial as in, British colonization, forceful oppression and settlement of a foreign land, etc... We have to examine some quotes from him and a time-relevant definition.  
  
In a letter to Cecil Rhoades, the infamous British imperialist, he Theodore Herzl writes to ask for his assistance with Zionism. He explains that he is specifically righting to Rhoades of all people because:  
  
""How, then, do I happen to turn to you, since this is an out-of-the-way matter for you? How indeed? Because it is something colonial""  
  
A few sentences later he makes it even more clear that he is talking about Palestine:  
  
""What is the plan? To settle Palestine with the homecoming Jewish people""  
  
At another point in his journal, we find him clarifying that Zionism's goal from the start has been the complete control of Palestine.  
  
""Then I went into my plan more deeply, saying that it was not a matter of colonization on a small but on a large scale. We wanted the territory as an autonomous one.""  
  
Herzl makes it clear that he wants the colonization to be established with military force:  
  
""I said I wanted only the kind of colonization that we could protect with our own Jewish army. I had to oppose infiltration.""  
  
Herzl expressing his deep shock that any fellow Jew would fight back against his colonization efforts:  
  
""Having just returned from a trip, 1 hasten to answer your kind letter of September 7. I had already been informed that Mr. Scheid is working against me. From your letter I see that this is true. I am asking myself what might motivate this gentleman to proceed in this way. The movement that I started may not have the approbation of all Jews; but for the present it is incomprehensible to me that  
  
people who have to do with colonization should be fighting it.""  
  
Herzl's response to a journalist asking him what he should write about:  
  
""Oh yes, write about the solution of the Jewish Question through the colonization of Palestine""  
  
(All from the Complete Diaries of Theodore Herzl)  
  
As for the proof that he was using colonial in the way I am alleging:  
  
The Century Dictionary Volume II (1885) gives an example use of the proper usage of  
  
'colonization': ""The increase of our trade and manufacturer, … our growth by colonization and by conquest, have concurred to accumulate immense wealth in the hands of some individuals. Burk, on Present Discontents""  
  
It defines 'colonize' as: To plant or establish a colony in; occupy with a colony or colonies: as, England colonized Australia”  
  
“Given to emigration and the founding of colonies in new countries: as, the British are a colonizing people”  
  
Colonizing Example: “Rhodes too was in early times a colonizing, and so a famous power -one”  
  
Yes, the guy who Herzl wrote a letter to requesting help with his settlement of Palestine, the guy who Herzl described his movement as 'colonial' to, Cecil Rhoades, is literally in the definition of the word colonizing from a reliable dictionary published in almost the exact same year that Herzl wrote his letter.  
  
There's more.  
  
Herzl very clearly stated that he wished to do exactly as Rhodes had done in his infamous imperialistic conquests:  
  
""Such an arrangement I have permitted myself to submit to His Royal Highness. It is this: First we create a corporate body in England which will take the preparatory steps and, moyennant finances \[for a financial consideration\], acquire lands and settlers’ rights from the Turkish government. On the basis of such concessions the actual Chartered Company• will then be formed —and, circumstances permitting, with its legal headquarters at Karlsruhe and under the protection of His Royal Highness Grand Duke Friedrich. There will automatically result from this a political relationship of protection by the Empire, one to which there can be no objection from third parties. No express declaration on the part of the Imperial government is required for this; in fact, we could be disavowed without further ado, as operating on our own, just as the English government was able to do with Cecil Rhodes at any time.""  
  
Herzl was borderline in love with Rhodes:  
  
"" Naturally there are big differences between Sir Cecil Rhodes and my humble self, the personal ones very much in my disfavor""  
  
One could try to argue that Herzl technically didn't found Israel, however he was the founding member of the First Zionist Congress, he literally created the blueprint that Zionists followed for decades and decades. His name is the first mentioned in Israel's '48 Declaration of Independence, at the very beginning. To try to deny that the organization he created and that worshipped him did not follow his ideology would be dishonest. Now back to history.  
  
(No more quotes from Herzl are necessary to prove my point, but just know that there are 100+ instances in his diaries where he describes Zionism as colonialism. )  
  
Around 1919\~ Britain gained governance (not ownership) over the region of Palestine during WW1. And in 1920, as a result of Zionist influence and political pressures, they issued the Balfour Declaration, where they agreed that they would oversee the coexistence of the local Palestinian Arabs and migrant European Zionists.  
  
The Brits did not want the Zionists forming their own state, but the Zionists went there with the intention to do just that.  
  
As a result, between '20 and fall '47, the relationship between them and the Brits became strained, with the tea drinkers going so far as to impose strict immigration bans against further European Jews.  
  
During this same time, Palestinian Arabs were also relatively upset, as Zionist leaders predicted they would be (Ben-Gurion and Jabotinsky, or see the Plan Dalet). There were tensions, a few riots, etc... But no outright war up to this point.  
  
In response to the aforementioned immigration bans, Zionist groups began to run illegal immigration operations, and even went so far as to conduct terror attacks against British officials.  
  
Having had enough, the Brits referred the issue to the UN in the fall of '47. Various proposals were considered, including the Arab High Committee Proposal which was a one state, Palestinian ruled solution in which no more Zionists would be allowed to immigrate, (I have a little prediction, you haven't read this far in, you'll reply with some claim that I've already addressed here) but those already there would be granted the same rights and protections as Palestinians.  
  
Some will try to claim that Zionism's touted public acceptance of the Partition is proof that they wanted peace, however according to the founder of Israel himself, they did not plan to stick to the partition plan, and just saw it as a stepping stone.""Does the establishment of a Jewish state \[in only part of Palestine\] advance or \[slow\] the conversion of this country into a Jewish country? My assumption (which is why I am a fervent proponent of a state, even though it is now linked to partition) is that a Jewish state on only part of the land is not the end but the beginning.... This is because this increase in possession is of consequence not only in itself, but because through it we increase our strength, and every increase in strength helps in the possession of the land as a whole. The establishment of a state, even if only on a portion of the land, is the maximal reinforcement of our strength at the present time and a powerful boost to our historical endeavors to liberate the entire country""  
  
(Letter from Ben-Gurion to his son Amos in 1937).  
  
However the UN decided on resolution 181, in which they suggested that the UN security counsel oversee the splitting of the region in to a Jewish territory (55% of the land) and a Palestinian territory (45% of the land).  
  
As Zionists knew they would, Palestinians were unhappy with the idea of foreign colonizers being granted control over 55% of their home, and a civil war broke out between the two groups in the region.  
  
As a result, the UN never actually split up the land.  
  
They fought until May 14th, 1948, when the British Mandate (rule) officially came to an end, and the area became technically ungoverned.  
  
The Zionists moved fast and aggressively, declaring themselves an independent state and seizing a great deal of Palestine by force. The Palestinians, in league with volunteers from various Arab nations, fought back against the invaders but lost. Resulting in the Zionists ultimately ending up with control of 77% of the region of Palestine. (Note that of Israel's current land mass, 6% was bought, with 6% being all they had in '47). Zionists had taken 94% of Palestine by colonial force and violence.  
  
Thus, Zionists colonized Palestine.  
  
Two random points I'd like to preaddress:  
  
""Israel was a refugee country."" No, Israel created a refugee crisis. It was founded by European Jews who actively chose to go to Palestine with the intent goal of colonizing it. After it was colonized, many middle-eastern countries expelled their Jewish residents thus making them refugees.  
  
""It cannot be colonization because Jews are indigenous to the land."" Before you argue this, please find me a time and context relevant semantic source with a definition which includes the nuance that it's not colonization as long as your great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandparent/uncle/etc... lived there once."

We always tell children “If you don’t like a gift, don’t say you don’t like it.

People that do that need to grow up and handle it. **Criticism is part of life. You’ll never escape it.**

My parents always told me to do this, constantly. When I was a kid, I just had to go with it because I always had to assume they were right since they were in authority. But now that I’m an adult, I realize that I was simply being taught to lie and to assume people couldn’t handle criticism.

It’s also EXTREMELY hypocritical for parents to do this when they literally tell their kids to never lie to them. How about if you don’t want them lying to you, **don’t teach them to lie in the first place!!!** All it does is make them look like abusive assholes that only want things done *their* way just because they’re in authority.

2,2024-03-26,"cmv: Capitalist free market, supply and demand are always going to be somewhat divorced from need for as long as labor itself is subject to supply and demand...",u/AliceInCookies,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bol1ro/cmv_capitalist_free_market_supply_and_demand_are/,changemyview,"  
This seems inevitable to me but a lot of advocates for capitalism act like it isn't true for reasons I can't understand.  
  
Like, I don't make much money, because I do unskilled work. Unskilled work is work where you can train the vast majority of people to be competent at the job within a few days (As opposed to, say, a neurosurgeon, who needs more than 18 hours of training shifts). This means that the supply of labor is high even relative to large demand, which means that in turn the price at which I can sell my labor is low.  
  
What sort of makes me itch is that if I phrase things like that without any political agenda, most evangelists for capitalism will say, ""Yeah, broadly you're exactly right.""  
  
Okay, but that means that if money is a signal of ""need"", then I have less ability to signal need than a skilled worker.  
  
Suppose me and Jeff Bezos both get the same kind of cancer, and we both have the same odds of survivability from the same treatment. The treatment costs one million dollars.  
  
Are we to say that the fact that I don't have one million dollars indicates that I need cancer treatment less than Jeff Bezos, who would pay without thinking?  
  
That's a completely perverse definition of what it means to need things!   
  
The only way to get out of that would be to advocate for a radical blank slate theory, in which every single person is equally capable of doing a high skilled job, and has consciously chosen not to do so.  
  
This is just, like, obviously not the case. Like, at the very least you have to deal with unmedicated schizophrenics, people with learning disabilities, people getting chemotherapy or other medical treatments that make them too weak to work, and furthermore a lot of people who are the most ""rah rah"" for capitalism are also somehow the least inclined towards blank slate theory, and are often advocates of fairly rigid views of human potential who are happy to argue that some people are just incapable of doing skilled work.  
  
But like... Because of how labor works Capitalism is going to be not very good at fulfilling the needs of unskilled workers, even if the market is otherwise working in a very idealized and efficient fashion, let alone the world we actually have with things like inherited wealth.  
  
Now, I would argue that capitalism can be bad at fulfilling the needs of low-skill workers even when society is producing enough surplus that it is possible to fulfill their needs.  
  
This doesn't mean that supply and demand are entirely unmoored from human desire either, that's not what I'm arguing."

I also think there is value in maintaining a diplomatic and economic bridge between nations for and against apostasy laws. 

Suppose heavy economic sanctions was the right answer for apostasy laws. What happens all the other human rights issues? Do we use the same tool, with the same severity? 

Consider the relationship between US and Saudi Arabia as an example. The US doesn't seem to use any pressure at all on Saudi Arabia (I don't know, somebody please correct me if I'm wrong). While Saudi Arabia seems to be slowly improving on human rights issues. 

My stance on this is based on how I think things work for individuals. It's not good to lie to people in order to cover up their evils. It gives people a false view and cause stagnation instead of progress. It's better to be transparent. I think the same applies to large groups, like nations.

Hi

I'm not talking about teenagers who put the 💍 in their social media bio's when in a relationship but I'm speaking about people in the age range of 29 and over.

What exactly do they do it for?

I know 2 guys who currently do this. Both of them have never had a gf and they also are the type of guys to kind of brag.. the type who are obsessed with social media and have their profiles on public. 


One of the guys even put pictures of his partner when they first got together but put an emoji on her face so no one could see what she looks like..

Idk, I just find it a little cringe and weird.

Thanks for reading.

The principle 'your body, your choice' should apply universally, recognizing individual autonomy over personal decisions that primarily affect oneself. While the use of such substances comes with inherent risks, including the possibility of overdose, the responsibility lies with the individual (fuck around and find out).

 It's paradoxical how society accepts the legality of cigarettes, despite their well-documented health risks, yet criminalizes other drugs. Legalization could also mitigate the harms of unregulated, illicit markets, potentially reducing instances of drug-related violence and ensuring safer, controlled access to substances. This approach would demand a comprehensive public health strategy, including education and support systems for addiction, rather than punitive measures."

At most, there is a reflexive process by which our minds can introspect and act through itself, also making it at the most not totally connected to the world. What my stance is against, though, is the mind-body dualist split that currently dominates the scientific method (eg positivism). We would be much better off adopting a more materialist reality, understanding conditions and history as parts of our minds. 

This also means that we can never fully understand things as true, the dualist dream is that because the mind is separate from the world it has the ability to build the world from an objective perspective. They might also claim that materialist view of the world (critical realist, dialectical) is asinine because we would never be able to see the analyse the world for what it is, being so wrapped up in it. It’s true, in my opinion, that we are wrapped in it. 

However, we still have options such as totalising the world through a synthetic lens as we see it to create provisional semiotics and logics of understanding (Sartre on dialectical reasoning), or even analysing the network of all interconnected things and our place within it, denouncing all semiotics or qualitative leaps and only allowing things to basically explain themselves in their inter-connections. In any case, all knowledge is provisional, we are a part of it all, and our minds move with history."

We can make a shit ton more of goods and services, efficiency becomes mad. And with this technological advancement, society should advance as well right, with more resources at our disposal due to automation we should be better off as a society. But no, Capitalism screws us. As industries get automated, there'll be massive job crises, people will be unemployed and unable to afford some basic needs. And as more companies use automation, the need for labor decreases and decreases, as it's way more profitable to just use automation. Everyone's just going to end up unemployed with just capital owners getting richer and richer, as they employ automation more and more. Something like automation is supposed to be good for society, it makes work easier, but it just ends up increasing the wealth gap.

Now solutions to this, a UBI? Eh, that just weakens the problem a little bit with workers having a better ability to afford basic needs, but the rich would still continually get richer, as a UBI is in no way going to give the average person enough money to be able to raise capital to start a competitive business that employs Al. Unless that UBI is like a massive amount of money but that just seems super ineffective and would probably just end up causing inflation as well.

Welfare, probably would work to the same level of UBI, would provide basic needs to the unemployed, probably a bit more efficiently in terms of the people more in need get what they need, but still the same problem, no one has the ability to raise capital still other than preexisting capital owners.

Therefore, I think we really, really need to make a shift towards socialism, or at least somewhere in which automation can benefit the many, rather than the rich few. Now you can say, socialism has never worked, but let's be real, socialism has failed because of geopolitical reasons, and authoritarianism, not because socialism is fundamentally flawed. And with automation, most low-skill and some high skill labor will become redundant, so it's not even like you can use the argument that people will become lazy and it won't work, because it won't matter if they're lazy.
Now are these statements very broad, and general, and am I making a billion assumptions about the optics, yes. But I don't think there's any denying that a trend like this is going to occur, maybe not linearly as I portray it, but it will happen. Very open to disagreement, lmk what yall think.

I use the word ‘great,’ as something subjective, which is where I may understand my lose some of you. I do believe that we can vote our way to a *better* future. This includes possibilities such as expanded healthcare, higher wages, more liberties for underrepresented groups such as migrants/disabled, local or federal infrastructural improvements, expanded education systems, expanded social welfare systems, and more. These are all wonderful, all in the cards if voter bases are able to elect certain candidates, maintain an educated activity in the electorate, and hold representatives accountable. 

Now, this is where *great* comes into play. I believe that great changes are theoretically possible today, but they aren’t fathomed in the overton window let alone in practice. These are changes such as massive tax reforms which hold corporations accountable to an effective tax rate at or higher than the median worker rate, complete shifts in the division of labor which provide greater levels of ownership (or at least a substantial increase in wage comparable to the increase in overall productivity) and versatility of meaningful duties to workers instead of pigeonholing workers into a single mind-numbing task, increased expectations of human fulfilment (eg substantial time off, reduced hours, conceptualising reproductive labor, making foods healthier, making said healthier foods more affordable, designing infrastructure changes around said fulfilment such as walkable cities; the list goes on). 

I firmly believe that what I listed is possible, but there is no way currently to vote away the baked in profit motive structure which continues to see capital gains reinvested in assets which almost entirely promote growth in the top% of industrialists/execs, and corporations act like the tiny reminder (if there is any at all) is all that existed. Moreover, the technocratic oligarchy has a chokehold on media and politics, we will never see the kinds of radical changes, changes meant to equalise class dynamics to a considerable effort, ever mentioned. The government was supposed to represent law while the people represented power (Arendt), this is no longer the case. The industrialists have created corporations that exist as “people,” monopolise the power, but team up with the law against the true public. what was supposed to be a limited government has increasingly become absolutist."

Doesn’t every human on Earth want the same basic things? Food, shelter, safety, a sense of purpose, and love? Doesn’t consumerism and greed muddy this simple reality? Isn’t the “goal” for everyone to live in peace and harmony? Why does it feel the progress we’ve been making (global/race relations) is some contrived form of progress? Hasn’t every human with basic capacity entertained the same questions since we’ve had the ability to map word to thought: why am I alive? What happens when I die? What is purpose? Aren’t we all, in some sense, inherently shaped by how we entertain the questions we can’t help but ask (moral paradigms, belief structures, religion), and how we choose to “answer” them? Is the ongoing global circus just a way to distract from the hard and un-answerable? Is the hive mind of humanity scared of the reality of catch-22 questions (knowing we will always ask questions we will never have the answer to, while being compelled biologically to continue asking them)? What has to happen for us all to get on the same page, one I know, in some sense, exists? Does it all boil down to Darwinistic tendencies? Is it the limit of our biology? 

Ex: When I think of individuals coveting “brands”, I see a clear connection with the want for “social status”. I then think, one wants to project a certain social status because it mirrors/projects their strength/dominance. The seeming need for this projection is for what? To show, in a world of the fittest surviving, one is the most fit to do so? Isn’t said symbolism a deep facade (as in, aside from having immense resource, with its value being in how it’s repurposed, one with access to said resources is very likely not to be the fittest, either physically or psychologically, and that the resources mean next to nothing if there are not others with different capabilities to deploy them “appropriately”)?

One cannot be on top without others being below. We are all not the same, but will we ever be equal (in terms of value) in the eyes of each other? Don’t we get the most joy, objectively, from helping others? Shouldn’t the “fittest” be excited to help the “other”? If we all flourished in our unique ways, contributing in a manner the next could not, however minuscule the contribution, wouldn’t we all benefit? Who is anyone to judge the value of a potential contribution?

As I re-read this back, I can see why one would feel this a gross over-simplification of the human condition. I would just say: isn’t our over-complication the real issue? I feel there is so much I can say, but for some reason I have been particularly dejected lately, and I am genuinely unsure what the point of all the noise is. Being human is hard. Why do we make it so much harder on ourselves? Shouldn’t we be “in this together”?"

And yes, it matters.",u/Brave-StomachAche,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bouyn9/cmv_not_putting_the_l_first_in_lgbt_is_misogyny/,changemyview,"(This is inclusive to the extended community labels as well)

Exactly what is stated.  GLBT was the acronym for a long time, but this was mostly when lesbians were left out of the equation in terms of rights (and even nowadays, lesbians are underrepresented, objectified, and there are significantly fewer spaces for them compared to queer men).    
During the AIDS crisis, it was lesbians who fed gay men dying from AIDS because no straight doctor wanted to go near them. 

Additionally, there is no secret that the queer community is filled with sexism--between \*constant\* discourse over lesbian sexual spectrum (terms like pillow princess, stone top, butch, fem, etc) and copious amounts of benevolent and ambivalent sexism, it's exhausting.  Not to mention that there is no small portion of queer men who are disgusted by lesbians, AFAB bodies, and are openly misogynistic.

The L comes first in the acronym to help remind people not only what lesbians have done for the community (cough cough, Stonewall riot), but also how they've been treated.  

And at the end of the day, if it's ""not a big deal"" like so many people claim, then why do they care that I care? I'm not tearing anyone down or correcting people.  I just use my own terminology even when others use different terminology.  If you are that uncomfortable with putting women first, after it was women who spearheaded the movement to give you basic human rights, you have a lot bigger issues to deal with, probably with a therapist or other professional.  Putting the L first is basic decency and respect.  "

""shoot in the legs/arms"" approach isn't actually that ridiculous and it has a point",u/AlexFerrana,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bovrsd/cmv_shoot_to_incapacitate_aka_shoot_in_the/,changemyview,"Plenty of people, especially related to law enforcement and gun ownership in USA, strictly dislike the ""shoot to incapacitate"" approach, which means ""if the situation requires a use of deadly force, it doesn't mean that you should mag dump the assailant/perpetrator, but it's better to shoot him in the leg or arm and injure him rather than shooting into the center mass which would likely lead to the death"". And in my opinion, that approach is over-criticized and low-balled too much.

First on, while legs and arms is smaller than the torso, it doesn't mean that it's impossible to hit it with a pistol at close range. Especially if the perpetrator isn't really moving or moves slowly. Police and gun owners should focus on better training rather than ""aim the gun and spray n' pray"" mag-dumping, which also would reduce the possibility to miss and hit the bystander or someone's property.

Second, being shot in the leg or arm is certainly less dangerous than being shot into the body, especially torso and chest area. Yes, it could cause the disability of a limb, but it's still better than death.

Third, leg shots usually drops the person regardless if he's under the drugs/alcohol/mental crisis influence which mitigates or straight up cancels the pain. It doesn't matter how much pain you can endure, a bullet going through your bone or knee in the leg would make you drop like a bag of potatoes.

Fourth, that approach is widely used outside of US, particularly in Europe, Russia and some other countries like China, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Australia. Just because USA doesn't use it doesn't mean that nobody uses it.

Fifth, shooting to incapacitate can be used in a situation where deadly force is technically legal and justified, but ain't really necessary. Like, a standoff with a knife-wielding perpetrator, or when a mentally disturbed person has a crisis moment, or when a drunk or drugged up person wreaks havoc, or if the attacker is unarmed but has a strength/size advantage.

Sixth, ""shoot to incapacitate"" approach can be used when police isn't having an access to less lethal stuff like beanbags, OC sprays, tazers or batons or when all of this stuff failed.

That's my opinion, folks."

As a symbol of our barbaric and animalistic past.

This is of course assuming that technology and our global economy develops to a point where eating meat is no longer necessary for survival for almost all humans. Because I do recognize that many poorer parts of the world still rely on meat and animal products in order to get their required amount of protein, calcium, etc. 

But in most of the developed world I cannot see any justifiable excuse to eating meat. Most people in these parts of the world can sustain a healthy life using plant products and supplements. Many do. 

No culture or personal enjoyment justifies the killing and torture of other living beings. And to say that eating meat is natural and part of our evolution is obviously an appeal to nature fallacy. There are many ways we can and do work to prevent pain and suffering caused by nature. 

Also it has yet to be truly proven that insects and fish don't feel pain and suffering. I guess if it can be definitively proven, one could make a case for eating them. "

Like, if you are an average-looking guy who wants to date a beautiful woman, people will tell him he needs to lower his standards and settle for a woman who's not attractive, basically telling him he needs to date someone he's not attracted to. 

I even heard one person on YouTube saying, ""If you think your partner isn't attractive, then that's fine."" People say this to average-looking women who want a super handsome man, and I think this is fucked up. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so a 10/10 for you might not be a 10/10 for someone else. And I think advising someone to date someone you aren't attracted to is fucked up to your partner. 

Imagine your boyfriend or girlfriend asks you, ""Am I attractive?"" and you say, ""Well, I don't think you're attractive. I wanted to be with an attractive man/woman, but I settled for you even though I'm not physically into you."" Like, that's super fucked up and toxic. 

What makes it worse is knowing there are people out there who would date a man or woman they aren't attracted to just to have a boyfriend/girlfriend. Like, if you are not attracted to someone, then I don't think a relationship can work. 

And like I said, dating someone you aren't attracted to because you are struggling to date someone who you are physically attracted to is not only toxic to you but it's toxic to your partner. 

So, that's why I have a problem with relationship gurus on YouTube telling people to ""settle"" and ""lower your standards"" because I think that's a start to a toxic relationship that would lead to heartbreak. 

Imagine you ask out a guy or girl, and that guy or girl struggles with insecurity but they like you, and they are attracted to you, and they think you like them, but they find out you aren't attracted to them at all. But they stay with you because they feel like it's too hard to find a relationship or something. That's so toxic to that person, and it's toxic to yourself too, because you feel like you aren't attractive or good enough to date the type of person you want to date, so you put that insecurity on another person.

Because the gender pay gap has shrunk in the western world, and women tend to not rely on men anymore for income, women's standards have gone up accordingly. They still want men richer and more successful than them, but now resort to dating men older than them, who are further along in their careers and have more money.

Women refusing to date at or below their level leads to young men having no options. Thus, **60%** of young men are single, and increasing over time. The only other cohort facing a similar glut of singles is elderly women (65 and older).

Having such a huge glut of adolescent young men who are unable to find a girlfriend is going to lead to an aggravation of the mental health crisis in western society. I believe the rise of radical online influencers like Andrew Tate is a symptom of this broader problem.

My CMV is as follows- western governments have done basically nothing to address the mental health crisis that the inceldom of young men specifically is causing. Figures like Andrew Tate will continue to emerge and grow in prominence in the west as a result, undoing much of the progressive policies made on social issues over the last several decades.

Everytime someone disagrees with us, every time we’re called fat, every time someone doesn’t acknowledge our gender identity, every time someone makes assumptions based on our ethnicity. These things almost always offends us. And our solution is always to demand them to apologize and respect us. 

We can’t control how others perceive and/or speak to us- but we absolutely have control over whether we care about enough to allow ourselves to be affected by it. The person who is the most responsible for being offended is us. It is our fault for caring so much about how they view/talk to us. If the other person doesn’t respect us then that’s their choice. You can’t force them to respect us. If we are prone to feeling offended by it, we are the main one who needs fixing.

132,2024-03-27,CMV: Chinese men treat women better than Indian men,u/Extreme-Reporter-295,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bp0lfo/cmv_chinese_men_treat_women_better_than_indian_men/,changemyview,"I’m an Indian girl. In the quest of learning new languages and different cultures, I’ve met a lot of people around world. There’s no comparing the west to the east in terms of how women are treated and the level of patriarchy in the society. Both India and China have a deep rooted patriarchal culture, so I wanted to compare the two. I’ve been learning Chinese for the past few years and I’ve talked to a lot of men from mainland China who wanted to improve their English, every single one of them have been very polite and respectful, they compliment on how beautiful you are rather than saying you’re hot or cold. Not once have I come across any sexual innuendos or unsolicited pics. I’ve also learned a lot about their culture and family dynamics. It was refreshing yet disturbing, knowing how women are treated in my country. Maybe the sample size is too small and I was lucky that I came across the good ones, I don’t know but the ratio is definitely not as bad as Indian men. 9 out of 10 Indian men I’ve talked to have been creepy, it’s rare to find decent guys who just want to have a good conversation.

I’m not just talking about online interactions, although there are some that I can’t leave out for example:
How they say “I love you” during the first conversation and then call you a b*tch when you don’t reciprocate their ‘love at first text’

Sexual innuendos…this is the most annoying! They bring it up every chance they get. The so-called progressive well educated Indian men do that too, just goes to show a college degree does not equal education. 

In all seriousness, a few highlights from what I’ve observed living in India all these years: 
They don’t treat women as their equals, they are hell bent on enforcing gender roles, they have this idea that women belong in the kitchen (happens till this date in majority of households, even if the woman is working a full time job)

Women are considered to be a liability, such a resource draining burden that the father of the bride has to pay someone to marry her (dowry). I’ve learned that it’s the opposite in China, and the guy has to give a bride price during marriage. Both are very transactional and I don’t condone either, but the latter is suggestive of how Chinese culture views women as a valuable resource rather than a liability. 

On a very serious note, sexual violence against women is rampant. Victim blaming is a national sport at this point, they’re very quick to teach how women should dress, not go out after sundown, not have male friends, etc rather than teaching men not to abuse. To put it bluntly, the streets are not safe for women in India and there’s a stark contrast to that in China. Crimes happen everywhere but the difference is Indian men gaslight you that the victim is the reason for the crime. 

Marital rape and domestic violence, these topics aren’t even brought to daylight. In both India and China, marital rape is legal which is very concerning. Divorce is still a taboo in India and women have learned to live with all the abuse. I have to agree that both societies have a deep running patriarchal culture, but it’s very contrasting to see how China especially the younger generations have changed for the better. 

Of course there are always exceptions in every situation, there are good Indian guys but I’m talking about the vast majority. All that I’ve said may not apply to a small portion of urban population but that’s that, India is large and the majority is not urban nor progressive.

I could go on and on… but I’ve come to this viewpoint because there are many countries that have a patriarchal structured families but that’s not the only problem with Indian men, there’s more to it. Maybe cause how they’re not taught how to treat women? Or the way they ARE taught how to treat women? Both countries have a lot of cultural similarities coming from the east but how did we end up like this? 

China is way ahead in gender equality compared to India and Chinese men treat women better. I’d love for my opinion to be challenged!"

For misogyny, a good example is authority. People will say women aren't lesser, they are just different and get different roles. And then completely ignore that those roles blatantly favour the man, give him all the power and authority and then pretend this isn't sexist.

1,2024-03-27,CMV: You can only perceive what you subconsciously value. You cannot perceive what you do not subconsciously value.,u/ActuallyMan,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bp4cd8/cmv_you_can_only_perceive_what_you_subconsciously/,changemyview,"Cognitive Neuroscience gives a biological basis for selective perception. The brain’s attentional systems (particularly the reticular activating system (RAS)) act as a filter for sensory information, prioritizing stimuli that align with an individual’s subconscious values (Kandel et al., 2000). This biological selectivity ensures that only information deemed relevant by the brain’s value system reaches conscious awareness. Further, the limbic system's role in processing emotions and values biases perception towards emotionally resonant or valuable stimuli, reinforcing the brain’s tendency to selectively engage with the world based on value (LeDoux, 2002).  
  
Psychological Theories give insight into how this biological predisposition is manifested in cognitive behaviors. Selective attention theories, for instance, highlight how individuals focus on information that is relevant to their interests or values, ignoring irrelevant data (Kahneman, 1973). This is echoed in the concept of confirmation bias, where people tend to notice, remember, and interpret information in a way that confirms their preexisting beliefs and values (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), further illustrating how subconscious values guide what we perceive.  
  
Philosophical Concepts provide a broader existential and phenomenological context to the discussion. Existential philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre have posited that humans endow their world with meaning through their values and choices (Sartre, 1943). From a phenomenological perspective, Merleau-Ponty argued that perception is an active engagement with the world, shaped by our bodily experiences and the meanings we ascribe to them, which are inherently value-laden (Merleau-Ponty, 1945).  
  
Integrating these perspectives, it becomes clear that perception is not a passive, objective recording of the external world but a selective, value-driven process. Neurobiologically, our brains are wired to filter and prioritize stimuli that resonate with our subconscious values. Psychologically, this biological basis is manifested in behaviors and cognitive biases that further narrow our perceptual field to what we value. Philosophically, the very act of perception is imbued with existential significance, as we navigate the world guided by our values and the meanings we assign to our experiences.  
  
Conclusion: We can only perceive what we subconsciously value and cannot perceive what we do not. This demonstrates that our perceptions are fundamentally shaped by the interplay between our brain's selective attention mechanisms, our cognitive biases, and our existential engagements with the world. It also raises questions of our own influence over our values, and by extension, the way we perceive the world.   


A question I have (side topic): How do we precisely influence what we value?

Jean-Paul Sartre’s exploration of ""nothingness"" underscores this, suggesting that consciousness arises from distinguishing presence (existence) from absence (non-existence) (Sartre, 1943). This differentiation is fundamental; without it, the concept of existence becomes indistinguishable and thus unprovable.  
  
Epistemological Basis: Knowledge demands the capacity for falsification. The proof of one's existence, therefore, relies on the conceptual framework within which existence and non-existence are clearly delineated. Without the ability to conceive of non-existence, the claim to existence is unfalsifiable and, by extension, epistemologically weak.  
  
Cognitive Science Perspective: Cognition operates on the binary of categorization, distinguishing what is from what is not. This cognitive mechanism is essential for conceptual clarity, including the understanding of existence itself. Without the cognitive ability to identify non-existence, the mind cannot adequately conceptualize, and thus prove, existence.  
  
Conclusion: The ability to identify non-existence is indispensable for proving existence. This requirement is rooted in the falsifiability principle, which asserts that for a claim to hold, its negation must be conceivable. Philosophically, the understanding of one's existence is contingent upon the notion of ""nothingness."" Epistemologically, the claim of existence demands the possibility of its opposite to be meaningful and verifiable. Cognitively, the perception of existence necessitates the ability to recognize non-existence. Together, these insights forge a compelling argument: without the contrast provided by non-existence, the proof of existence is not just unattainable but conceptually incoherent."

1,2024-03-27,cmv: Dating is not “easier for men than women once they’ve actually gotten a date”,u/Anon_cat86,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bp6wz1/cmv_dating_is_not_easier_for_men_than_women_once/,changemyview,"I always see people posting this. “Getting a date is easier for women, but dating is just as hard for them because they have to worry about more stuff after that” and “just because we can get guys horny over us doesn’t mean dating is easier because it’s still hard to find a guy we actually like”

It’s not like we have zero expectations for men on dates. The man does, in fact, have to look good and put effort into his appearance too. “Women have to spend HOURS doing our makeup” I guarantee if you did it in 15 minutes most guys wouldn’t notice a difference, and guys have to shave and often have to style our hair, and both sexes have to pick a nice outfit, that’s not just a woman thing.

the bar for men’s behavior also isn’t lower. Yes, some men are misogynistic, racist, emotionally immature, entitled, etc, but those men aren’t getting a second date. It’s not like that’s something women actually put up with, those are still disqualifying factors, and like, do you think some women aren’t also misandrist, emotionally immature, entitled, or discriminatory, sometimes?

Lastly, there’s the fear of violence, which, first of all, is an irrational fear. It’s on the same level as fear of like car accidents; it’s something you should watch out for but being constantly on edge and unable to get comfortable isn’t necessarily reasonable. Also, while the rates of domestic violence against men are on paper much lower, men are far less likely to report intimate partner violence or abuse, and far less likely to be taken seriously if they do, so those statistics are most likely not accurate. 

The availability of dates also plays a big role here: women have to make sure a guy won’t assault her, but guys often don’t have the luxury of considering that possibility. going over to someone’s house you met at a bar or on tinder is still sketchy if you’re a guy; guys just don’t worry about it because it’s that or nothing, at least women know they can find someone else interested in them if they turn a guy down.

And then of course that’s not even to mention how much more understanding men are of female anger than women of male anger. I know the meme is that guys can get angry girls can’t, but in reality male anger scares women, and unless she really trusts you she might see that as a sign you could be dangerous to her, which isn’t the case when women get angry around men."
1,2024-03-27,"CMV: How are western societies individualistic if family reputation is real in the western society, and one’s actions have consequences for people in their life",u/AppropriateGround623,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bp6y01/cmv_how_are_western_societies_individualistic_if/,changemyview,"In an individualistic society, one’s actions shouldn’t reflect bad on their family. If anyone is to be held accountable, it should be the individual.


Then why is that when a woman starts an OFs for instance, she loses her friends, and people in her family get bullied and shamed? Why people question the upbringing of a woman if she does OFs or sleeps around, and use phrases like “her dad will be proud.” Why her actions are reflecting bad on her family, and in particularly her father? 

The concept of honour is present in the western world as well. If a woman is found to be doing anything that is considered deviant, especially in terms of sexuality, it’s regarded as embarrassing for men in her family. 

“Oh well, at least they don’t murder, they disown”

Disowning is actually on a spectrum, with murder on the other end. Disowning is also a form of social violence, and if it wasn’t for western society to support individuals to survive on their own, it’s just your family condemning you to death. Imagine getting disowned in a society where you can’t easily afford to live or with little support from the state, and it would make sense. Disowning reveals the fact that your family has found you to be an embarrassment. Shame that needs to be washed away. They won’t disown you unless they fear how others would treat them because of your actions. 

Traditional honour based cultures usually lack a strong state, or the state itself being supportive of oppression, as in the case of Afghanistan or Iran. I suspect what’s actually deterring a lot of men in the west from murdering their daughters for “moral transgressions” are strict sentences. If the laws were amended to grant lower sentences to men for committing such acts, as Italian penal code did till early 1980s, we would see a large number of such incidents. Westerners don’t have some inherent hatred towards murder committed to protect family’s reputation as that’s something plenty of individuals would be willing to do provided they don’t have to face prison for the rest of their lives afterwards.

355,2024-03-27,CMV: Online dating is dead.,u/Bifocals_of_Argus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bp73vl/cmv_online_dating_is_dead/,changemyview,"I feel like I tried all sorts of apps for about two years - Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, OKCupid, CoffeeMeetsBagel, and even FaceBook Dating. But the results were consistent regardless of the platform, where likes/matches were so rare, I never even got to plan a date. Furthermore, I've grown more and more doubtful that it's just me. I've been hearing many anecdotes, for what those are worth, that suggest that online dating in general has been downhill.

Plus, most apps have been bought out by MatchGroup, a publicly-traded company that's lost over 75% in stock price value since the vaccines rolled out in 2021. Indeed, when a company is ostensibly offering a service that's suppose to help people connect even in a basic way, but then rolls out a fourth paid subscription tier for Tinder that costs $500 per month, then I'm not sorry for thinking that they may not have my social/romantic interests in mind.

So, I've personally written off the whole concept, even though I do have at least three relatives that've met their partner via an app, albeit years ago. But this year, I'm ready to try other ways of meeting people, like volunteering, checking out events held at art galleries, film festivals, and more.

Now, if you can convince me that online dating is still alive in some way - or at least somehow hasn't gotten worse over the last three years - then I'd be genuinely impressed. I also don't want to hear any gaslighting that claims that I'm overrating my attractiveness; even if I was in denial, is attractiveness not subjective, at least to some degree? Now, I'm not gonna claim I'm as attractive as a Hollywood actor, but I feel a solid bit above average, too, and I've got a close female friend that's called me charming, respectful, and brilliant. Meanwhile, in online dating, I find it very hard to convey those attributes, at least in the very initial stages - but I digress.

I'm also not incapable of blaming myself and taking on personal responsibility. But I think we need to admit that sometimes, when you don't get the results you're hoping for, it's not always your fault."

Like I was watching Jeepers Creepers 2 over as an adult and just laughing from start to finish at how implausible the Creeper is. 

Even Candyman (1992) doesn't give me the chills anymore. It has to be movies that are based very closely to the human condition that brings out a bit of uncomfortable fear. Movies like Smile (2023) that touch on concepts like trauma. And movies like It Follows that remind me of inescapable realities like death do it for me. 

So true crime really is my go to now. The reality that someone could and have murdered other people is just plain scary. There's no plot to poke holes in when it happened in real life. And that's a type of horror that can really keep me up at night. Maybe it's just me, but shows and documentaries on real serial killers are much more interesting. 

Personally I can't even get past the first episode of the Jeffrey Damher series on Netflix. To think that someone could kill in cold blood like that just makes you think. "

A counterargument might be that we could find an object in nature that we then use as a seat. Or generally, the counterargument is to present things that fail to meet essential criteria, but that would still be included in the category.

My thoughts on the matter align more with structuralists, I think. I would say that categorization/grouping is something we, as humans, use as a tool and that tool is meant to facilitate discussion and understanding. Like all tools, I think it has its uses, misuses, and abuses. When a category is hindering our understanding of the world rather than enabling it, I think we should discard that category.

I'm guessing some people will respond that certain things are better to start your day with. But that doesn't seem to be the rule for breakfast.

1,2024-03-27,CMV: It doesn't make sense to let women vote,u/BridgeOk4421,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bp9zvk/cmv_it_doesnt_make_sense_to_let_women_vote/,changemyview,"I know this is a very unsettling and controversial opinion to have given the way we see the world today, but taking into account the complex history of democracy it does not make sense to let women vote in elections. We are so blinded today by our safety and security that it has completely altered the way we see reality. The reason democracies exist in the first place is because military aged men got tired of not being represented by the people in power. In these situations it was most often some sort of monarchy (most often ran by men) where nobody got to vote at all. The reason that these monarchies were able to hold their power was because of a threatening military made up by men. So the only reason anybody can even vote in the first place is because of these men overthrowing their tyrannical rulers and fighting other men. Given this historical reality and applying it to the USA we see the same pattern of men dying to create free society. Free and liberal society does not exist unless good men die to create it. 

Lets now look at society post revolution (by men). In order to maintain a democratic society there has to be good men creating infrastructure, protecting community, building economy, and maintaining order. None of this cane even exist without masculine men protecting women, having children, and maintaining order. Not to mention the military required to defend against bad men. None of our society could exist without good men protecting women and children from bad men. Not to mention every single thing used in a society is built by men, that is just the reality. 

Now we can examine the inevitable outcome which is the downfall of western liberal democracies. We are so blinded today that we forget that this western empire will eventually fall because every empire does. This fall will be at the hands of an enemy which will, from our perspective, be a bad man. It will not be a military of women that threatens the order in western society, it will be a military of men. When this happens men (not women) will have to rise up and clean up the mess because that is the reality of life. And whatever empire is set up after the fall of this empire will be built by men, maintained by men, and inevitably destroyed by men.

Taking all of this into account, I do not think that the men who create, maintain, and defend society should let women decide who leads the society. It makes sense that people can not comprehend this reality and this is because we are blinded by safety and security, as I mentioned before. 

Thank you to anybody who read my entire argument. Note: This does not come from a position of hate or male superiority, I simply believe that this is the reality of life. I am more than opened to have my mind changed. For people that disagree with me, once this empire falls and men have to die to create a new empire do you think they should let women decide who leads it? If so, how long after the establishment of the empire?"

1) By ""sixth sense"" I mean that feeling that something will happen - usually bad things - that come from nowhere. I believe we do have the faculty to make such previsions, that are not originated from concious reasoning or concious empirical input, and are correct. For example, I can have just ""a bad feeling"" about being in a place and go home, and by that specific decision, save myself from harm.

The origin of this sixth sense might be material - unconcious reasoning and perception. Or it might be paranormal. Regardless, its not part of my stance here.

2) The sixth sense is useless. Yes, it does happen and provides true information about the world. However, no person can garner it efficiently because it feel *exactly* like feelings coming from irrational dread, superstition or even random emotions. In the long term, if you trust more and more in your sixth sense you'll make good and bad choices based on it; you can't learn to use it more efficiently.

We have the faculty to gather true information from unconcious means; however we don't have the faculty to differentiate between false and true information from those means.

3) Some people might be more sensitive or have a greater sixth sense. But depending on it is bad for you. It will make you more fearful. I see that a lot of people that I consider to be actually sensitive - for example, that I witnessed having ""bad feelings"" before a death in the family - are also more fearful and lacking of confidence.

There are many things that can cause deeper relationships and a greater appreciation for life and cancer is a really stupid gamble. And those things didn’t directly stem from cancer, CANCER is just a sickness. People may gain something from the experience of having cancer but that is because of themselves and their own strength, not because of cancer, cancer still sucks."

Sometimes I wish it were all untrue because I'm so attached to my sexual immorality but I don't want to go to Hell. 

But I think there is sufficient evidence to make belief in Christianity reasonable (besides the historical arguments, I know numerous non-crazy people who have had supernatural experiences commensurate with Christianity, and I don't think they're all lying), and moreover I see no worldview that is more compelling. (At Peter says in John 6, ""where else would we go?""). 

Now, even before I became a Christian, it was abundantly clear to me that all other modern moral systems about ""equality"" and ""egalitarianism"" and ""non-aggression"" and ""bodily autonomy"" ""freedom of xyz"" were completely, entirely, 100% fake and made-up by 17th-century freemasons and have really morphed into something abominable in the post-1945 world order, and have no credibility whatsoever. If I were not a Christian, it seems I would be a Neitzscheite who believes that ""morality"" is nothing but the will of the strongman, which is to say that it does not exist. In fact I more or less find this self-evident now too, except I believe - hope? - that the ""strongman"" is God. There is certainly no ""moral truth"" to be found in Utilitarianian calculus or in your fake made-believe ""rights"" or in Kant's godless deontology.

___________

Now, whenever I'm feeling upset about God and religion I sometimes have the bad habit of looking up a bunch of athiests trying to disprove Christianity or talking about why they left. And I sometimes wish they did a better job, because when I look around, it seems like most former Christians have reasons for leaving (or converting to some heretical liberal Episcopalian sect which seems to be little more than Christian-flavored secular humanism) that sound like this:

- ""The Bible supports slavery. I got brainwashed in public school to believe that like, slavery was the worst thing ever. It literally did a racism! Therefore Christianity can't be true""

My question is always ""how on earth do you know that slavery is bad? Especially when it's obviously not?"" It wouldn't be bad regardless of if Christianity is true or not. In fact if Christianity were not true, it's even **more** evidently *not bad*. What does that even mean to call it bad then? At least in Christianity there are limits of charity and prudence put on it - if there's no God, I see no reason there should be any limits on it at all, beyond the strong man's limitations!

They can't answer my challenge of how they know it's supposed to be ""bad"" without appealing to a bunch of absolute nonsense about ""rights"" and ""equality"" and ""fairness."" Look around the world. What on earth is ""fairness?"" What part of any of this is screaming at you that somehow things are supposed to be ""fair?"" The strong lions get all the meat and rest starve. So too, if we are just apes, the strong men will enslaved and destroy the weak and take everything from them. I don't know where the ""should"" comes into this - that is simply what will be.

> ""I used to be a Christian but then I had a gay friend / became gay so I left""

I have sexual morality problems too. How does that disprove Christianity? The fact that it will make me unhappy if God punishes my sins doesn't mean He doesn't exist. Again, I ask, how do you know you're supposed to be allowed to have sex with whomever or whatever you please? (Made even worse is the fact that this isn't even what they believe, which I would at least have sympathy for - no, they've developed some insane parallel moral system around sex involving ""consent"" as their god, which to me is completely insane).

Again they seem unable to answer, without referring to groundless ideas like ""bodily autonomy"" and ""gender equality"". I tell them that you don't own your body and the genders are *obviously* not equal - this is true in Christianity, and it would be *tripply* true if Christianity were false. There's no conceivable coherent worldview whatsoever where gender equality is a real thing.

___________

So despite my struggles with sin, the fact that so many of the apostate's reasoning boils down to the fallacy ""I want to do X, God doesn't want me to, therefore God isn't real,"" makes me more convinced that I ought not to make the same folly.

Am I missing anything here? The Christian apostate seeks to free himself from the shackles of God's moral ""tyranny,"" only to invent a brand new moral tyranny which is absolutely groundless and incoherent and invented by mere men in the past few hundred years, it seems. Therefore their moral arguments fail.

(2) Because school choice is bad, politicians can be hypocritical. Two wrongs don't make a right. 

None of the above will move me. 

School choice allows students to more easily choose against their public school options for private school options. I'm not debating the merits of that policy--perhaps private schools are generally worse. Regardless, private school is expensive, and it's anti-democratic to tell the public that privileged children should have multiple choices and that's fine because it wasn't state-subsidized. So what? Poor kids couldn't go to school if it wasn't state-subsidized. Doesn't mean public schooling should be abolished. 

So, CMV. Politicians who enroll their kids in private K-12 shouldn't argue against school choice for poor kids.

I specify poor kids because many states income-test their school choice programs. I think it's reasonable for politicians to say that, while they send their kids to private school, rich parents should still pay taxes to support public school regardless of which school their kid enrolls in.  "

Native American reservations are sovereign territories. They function just like any other country for the most part. (Don't argue- that's not what I'm here to discuss.)

They can choose who is part of their tribe or territory. Every single tribe I looked up requires a certain percentage of your blood to be from that tribe. 

So how are they racist?

There are almost no other countries in the world that require a certain blood percentage to be a race or ethnicity to gain membership into that country. They only want you part of their group if you meet there DNA standards...

Now OP, you might say, a tribe is about an ethnicity not a territory. Interesting. In the past if you had one drop of African-American blood you were considered black. That most people would agree that's racist. The government enacted that law because they only wanted the ""right"" type of people to be in their race.

That's exactly what Native Americans are doing.

But OP, Native Americans have a terrible history in the United states. Why would they want to open tribe membership to descendants of those who harmed them??

Great question. Doesn't change the fact that the policy itself is racist. ""Sorry you can't move to the United States as an immigrant because your great grandfather was a Nazi."" Sounds silly. 

Now you say. hey OP, I don't think you're being sincere with this question and you're just trolling.

There are a few reasons for this. The first being that you can only now swipe on a small handful of people that are shown to you without having to pay an atrocious fee to continue swiping right on what are, 90% of the time, fake or inactive profiles, 9% narcissists or other abusers, and maybe that little tiny sliver is a genuine person, but even then the odds of them actually meeting up with you is vanishingly small. You may as well just go and blow all your money on lottery tickets or play the slot machines in Vegas. In short, it’s a rigged game. 

The whole purpose behind these apps are for the schemers to keep you on the site for as long as humanly possible. They “trick” you into thinking you have a potential match, only to find out later it’s a robot or some other fake, maybe a crypto scammer trying to take your money and steal your ID. 

I don’t know why people have become so heavily reliant on these things. I quit them a month or so ago for the most part. I admit I was overusing them too. I don’t want to subject myself to such torture. 

The scammers, harassers, schemers and cheaters are running amok like bulls in china shops on those sites, and I would rather not subject myself to such lunacy and torture. There are too many lunatics, and the sites do nothing about them.

I am open to someone changing my view on this if anyone has any success stories. I feel they are minimal, but maybe I am wrong. "

I think that most incels start out as very normal men with ""normal"" views on women, the issue being that by virtue of living in a patriarchial society, a lot of people, including women have some baseline of misogyny. Usually not overt or extreme, but still present. 

I think that if you have these views, the incel pipeline is open to you, and unfortunately, most men have these views. I mean, lets take a look at something much lighter, Andrew Tate. He received a large amount of attention and ushered in a Renaissance of the Red Pill which is still ensnaring people in very large amounts, it's even ensnaring people that don't know they're doing misogyny.

So I don't think that misogyny is unique enough in men that that it's only misogyny that makes incels incels. Afterall, if it was, there would be no misogynists in relationships. ""Suprisingly"" I think the leading cause of incels is rejection. Most feel entitlement to a relationship or sex, not in a malicious ""women owe me sex"" way, but in a ""this is a normal part of human life and it's something I'm going to get as I am a normal human"" and those people aren't even necessarily wrong. It also doesn't help that the idea of relationships and sex is a chemical one provided by the brain.

When you fail to get these things in the way incels do, it really does break you. I was maybe like 5 steps from becoming an incel before snapping out of it and at some point you feel so low that it's phyiscally distressing to get rejected. 

So if you're one of these men, you are objectively abnormal, so you seek advice and all advice is fitted towards normal people. Except the advice that's targeting incels, that advice unfortunately is usually toxic and bad, but it's the only advice that applies to you and works for you, so you get sucked in, the only people who understand what you're going through are incels and a lot are 20 steps deeper into it. 

It's just like picking up a bad habit that makes you feel good, it's easy to fall into when the circumstances are right and they typically are for most men, save constant or near constant rejection."

Let’s not forget the trauma caused to pets, dogs, cats, horses, cows, etc. 

Fireworks are illegal in certain areas of California, because each year serious injuries and millions of dollars in property damage occur from wildfires sparked by fireworks. Large grass crops and dry vegetation increase the threat for devastating fires throughout all of California.

Additionally, to produce the oxygen needed for an explosion, many fireworks contain oxidisers known as perchlorates. These can dissolve in water, contaminating rivers, lakes and drinking water. Finally, fireworks release a fine cloud of smoke and particulate matter, affecting local air quality.

The first issue is who should be entitled to demand housing from the government. If housing is truly to be considered to be a right then the answer should of course be anyone. If someone for example decides at 35 that working a job has become sufficiently boring should they be entitled to demand that the rest of the working populous provide them with accommodation. I think most would agree no as it would simply be unsustainable. This, of course differs from not just negative rights like freedom of speech/ expression but also from positive rights like healthcare. If the position is that housing should be made available to anyone who is unable to procure it on their own then I would argue that means that makes it not a right since there are extensive conditions being placed on one's right to demand it. 

The second issue is what the specifics of the housing standard should be. The UN says the following on this 

>Adequate shelter means ... adequate privacy, adequate space, adequate security, adequate lighting and ventilation, adequate basic infrastructure and adequate location with regard to work and basic facilities   all at a reasonable cost

The UN's description does not do much to define adequate and to be clear they believe that the above should apply to everyone. The definition is completely ridiculous as they use the word adequate 6 times to define adequate as well as using 'reasonable cost' which is also rather vague. If this is the best definition that the UN and their experts can come up with then it is pretty apparent that this is far too subjective to possibly be considered a right. What should be the standard for a reasonable cost in a place like Vancouver or Toronto. Should the cost for the government to actually build the accommodations and purchase land be considered in the calculation or should it simply be set as a percentage of the renters income. What is the reasonable cost for the guy I discussed above. Would it be say 40% of his income had he not quit working or should it be free as he currently has no income. Also under the location standards only adequate location with regards to work is guaranteed. If someone is living in Toronto and working as a grocery clerk does the government have the ability to say that a unit is available in rural Ontario, and by offering this unit the government has fulfilled their obligation. Does renting a room with a locking door qualify as having sufficient privacy and space for a single person?  

In conclusion I think that the government should insure that people who are unable to provide for themselves should have roofs over their heads, however I don't think that there is enough of a consensus on standards to extend the right to housing to everyone and it is also likely impossible for the government to pay for it.

For one, it's loaded with antioxidants (i.e. red wine). Secondly, it strengthens your immune system to superhuman levels. Forget flu and covid and drink up! Thirdly, any toxic results will take decades upon decades to manifest and by then its more likely that old age causes the problems than alcohol does. Also, it feels relaxing! And let's be honest, it's fun to have some drinks with your buds, right?

Alcohol increases positive thinking, makes you happier. Hence why it's referred to as a ""guilty pleasure"" and only deemed ""bad for you"" by ancient generations that claimed that alcohol promoted ""immorality ""

Alcohol toughens you against disease as I mentioned earlier. I've read that the more you drink, the less likely you are to come down with serious illness or have trouble fighting off infection. 

I feel that alcohol has just gotten a bad rap by older generations. It is true that alcohol relaxes inhibitions. However I believe these older generations have held that this relaxation of inhibitions brought on by alcohol causes immorality and so therefore a sort of stigma has been generated against drinking.

Bottom line, I believe alcohol helps mood and increases immunity. So I don't think it should be looked down as harshly by the medical community"

 One smokes before work and twice after work, the other smokes 2-3 times after work. The weekends are terrible. They both smoke until they are braindead. The house is under various levels of construction at any given time because one guy always wants to implement some random ""great idea"" that essentially blocks entire rooms unfinished for weeks at a time. We aren't talking major updates. Trash and random junk is everywhere. These are small, outlandish additions to the house that would make any novice interior designer have a stroke (new lights, signs, mirrors etc.). 

 Both of them used to be outdoors types. We used to hike, hunt, mountain bike and fish. We used to go out to the bars. Now, they can't be bothered to get off xbox or anime. I know weed has some great pain/anxiety relieving benefits and may contain a cure of certain cancers/tumors. But goddamn it seems to make them insufferably stupid or tragically couch potatoes. I find it extremely difficult to give 2 shits about their problems when I'm seeing this go down. Mental health is important.

-The soundtrack
-Awesome & not annoying companion/device (FLUDD) & the inventive/revolutionary mechanics around it that seamlessly blended into the story/setting & without losing or replacing all of the ""OG""/64 mechanics
-Variety of play strategy/approach in different environments, with and without FLUDD
-Broad (& addicting) levels of challenge, plus the ability to leave & come back to ""frustrating"" levels/do other things in the meantime = high replay value
-The beautiful, cheerful, and downright fun scenery/""worlds"" & their inhabitants
-Incorporation of Yoshi...
-Voice acting = top-tier (esp the English adaptation)

Reasons/critique (against other ""Mario's""):

-Galaxy's worlds (not to mention perspective/camera controls) felt restrictive despite it being set in space & the characters were annoying or ""flat,"" as in, they didn't really pique interest/engagement
-Odyssey was too much at once, the voice acting was cheesy as were the bosses, the worlds and characters weren't immersive despite being more vast/expansive/diverse, & none of it/them was/were engaging enough, even based on challenge vs reward alone, same (all of the aforementioned) goes for the mechanics 
-64 is great and probably my second favorite, I don't have much to criticize only that it was just the best *until* Sunshine came out
-the other games (super mario bros, mario tennis, super mario 3d world, mario party, etc) all just feel like anime filler-episodes

1,2024-03-28,"CMV: Society has failed to teach and provide emphasis on the fact that sometimes, in order to love someone, you must set them free to allow space for their individual choices, even if it doesn't involve you at all",u/Equivalent_Ad_9066,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bpskis/cmv_society_has_failed_to_teach_and_provide/,changemyview,"In my opinion, within our amatonormative society (or a society that assumes long term romantic and sexual monogamous relationships are the end-all-be-all type of love), another factor we don't seem to acknowledge enough is that setting boundaries, limitations, and  personal morals for the sake of oneself and other's well being is just another way of showing love and care for that person 

Just because unrequited love can exist, doesn't mean you have to force your desires of reciprocated love upon someone. Cause at that point, it isn't love anymore. 

And we need to understand that If we really loved, cared, and respected someone, then we'd learn to let  them go and live out our own lives. And value self-love as a result 

Society has failed in this regard because it bases the concept of love SOLELY on actions and what we can do for someone in order to covey love (sex, words of affection, gifts, confessions, etc.)

 And because of this, it makes people who have romantic, platonic, or sexual feelings think that engaging in these actions all the time is how we can get someone to love us, even if it's against someone's boundaries and well-being 

Actions and restraint both showcase love, respect, and care equally. It's just that actions usually speak louder and are more fulfilling to us than no actions at all

 I feel like once we're taught these important qualities to consider when interacting with others in society, we'll be better at understanding more about ourselves and others in a deeper meaningful way

There’s a thought experiment I like doing for this sort of argument and it is as follows: Imagine there are two universes, each identical to each other. The only difference between these two universes is that one is godly in origin and function, the other is completely secular and naturalistic in origin and function. How do we determine which universe is which? How do we know which one we’re in right now?   
The whole point of this thought experiment is to bring you to the point of realizing “I simply don’t know which universe I am in”.   
Until there is sufficient evidence towards a claim or the properties behind it (especially of the god variety), that claim cannot be used as a valid argument towards anything that is cohesive with measurable reality. As of right now, there are no tests to determine whether a god exists or not. Until such time that a god claim is proven, the existence of this universe does not mean there must be a higher power.   
No god claim has ever had any factually demonstrable properties to lead towards the idea that a god actually exists or created this universe. There are however many naturalistic explanations as to how the universe may have began and how it may continue to exist. This includes the big bang theory, evolution, and cosmic inflation. All of these are theories that have properties behind them that are demonstrable, verifiable, repeatable, and absolutely none of these necessitate a higher power until that higher can be demonstrated in the same way. While I can't claim this universe is absolutely secular and naturalistic in origin and function, I can claim that I have no reason to believe there is a higher power behind it. "

35,2024-03-28,CMV: Pro-Death Penalty Advocates are Usually Inconsistent in their View of the State,u/SeriousRhetoric,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bpvd9c/cmv_prodeath_penalty_advocates_are_usually/,changemyview,"I think it is reasonable to start with the assertion that, broadly speaking, in the US and most Western countries, being pro-Death Penalty is generally associated with the right of politics and being anti-Death Penalty is generally associated with the left.

This has always confused me a little as regards the Right's usual perspective of the state, which leads me to the opinion that there is severe dissonance in how small-government right-leaners perceive the role and reliability of the state versus the trust in the justice system necessary to be pro-death penalty. 

Being pro-Death Penalty, to me, essentially requires one to completely trust a justice system to be 1) something the State has constructed to be fallible or near-infallible, 2) something the State is going to be consistent with and 3) something the State will efficiently deploy without bias or agenda.

1), 2) and 3) seem to be to all be things that the political right are broadly cynical of when it comes to matters such as healthcare, education, welfare, pensions. 

Which begs the question of why, when it comes to the Death Penalty, would you give the State the right of life and death over someone?

This, to me, is at the heart of the Death penalty conversation rather than the underlying morality of it: most notably I've never seen any contradiction between believing that there are some crimes for which a person doesn't deserve to live/having no sympathy for a criminal whatever happens to them and still being anti-Death Penalty.

Indeed, I would say I was severely anti-Death penalty despite being happy to say there are many criminals I have no sympathy for being subject to capital punishment. I do wonder if it's the case that the debate has sometimes been poorly presented by left leaning folks to centre the ethics more and ignore the State based/power dynamics. 

I'd be happy to hear from pro-Death penalty folks - especially those who perceive themselves as small-government or cynical of the power of the state as to how they reconcile this belief; and to CMV not necessarily over the death penalty, but certainly CMV that the death penalty is consistent with cynicism of big-state and beaurocratic systems.

The only argument I would ask to avoid would be that that implies the existence of a three-tier guilt system (ie: Guilty, Not Guilty, and Very Definitely Guilty) which is well trodden and I perceive as being self-evidently fallacious."

1,2024-03-28,CMV: Plant-based diets should be the default,u/James_Fortis,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bpw99s/cmv_plantbased_diets_should_be_the_default/,changemyview,"1. **Environment**  
\- Studies have shown the best way for us to reduce deforestation, land use, fresh water use, water pollution, and biodiversity loss is to change from omnivore diets to plant-based diets.  This is because animal agriculture is the leading driver of all of these factors, and switching to a plant-based diet can reduce them by as much as 75% (example source [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-023-00795-w), [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00343-4), [3](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaq0216)).  Per the FAO, animal agriculture also emits more greenhouse gases than the entire transportation sector.    
\- World Wildlife Fund (WWF) states we've lost an estimated [69%](https://livingplanet.panda.org/en-US/) of wild animals in the past 50 years, with losses as high as 94% in places like Latin America.  We've already changed the world so much that [96%](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1711842115) of mammalian biomass is now humans and our livestock.  
  
2. **Health**  
\- A plant-based diet can be a major improvement over what many in the west are currently eating.  Countries like mine (USA) get 150-200% of the protein we require and only [5%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6124841/) hit the recommended minimum daily fiber intake, and have high (42%) obesity rates.  The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics is the largest nutritional body in the world with over 112,000 experts, and [its position](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27886704/) is a plant-based diet is healthy for all stages of life and can reduce the chances of getting the top chronic diseases, such as obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers.  People in developed western nations are very rarely dying of dietary deficiencies like scurvy, kwashiorkor, or beriberi, but rather dying of diseases of excess.  
  
3. **Ethics**   
\- Over [80 billion](https://ourworldindata.org/how-many-animals-get-slaughtered-every-day) land animals and over a trillion sea animals are farmed for food each year.  An estimated [90%](https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/global-animal-farming-estimates) are factory farmed in hugely inhumane conditions.  If we haven't physically seen where our animal food is produced, it almost definitely came from a factory farm.  Even small family farms have inherent cruelty, like what happens to most [male calves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcN7SGGoCNI) on dairy farms or male chicks in hatcheries.    
\- Animal farming is devastating for many communities.  For example, hog farming in North Carolina (USA) has [hog feces sprayed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bHSFS4Zyg8) on neighbors and in local water supplies.  Local workforces are exploited to work in the industry, since they can't move out when no one wants to buy their house that's now next to a hog farm.  Slaughterhouses lead to massive [mental and behavioral issues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10009492/) for the workers over time.  


  
A ""plant-based"" diet has a few definitions, so for the sake of discussion let's take it to mean 90-100% of our calories are from plants.  By ""default"" I mean it should be the selection that's offered first and foremost, and that most people are eating; this would mean things like offering a bean and vegetable burrito with a fruit cup to patients in the hospital instead of things like meatloaf and ice cream after a heart attack, or offering plant milks as the default instead of cow's milk in schools.

  
The dominant diets in developed nations are based on societal and behavioral norms, but are far from optimal.  Corporations and governments won't lead the charge alone against the status quo, so it's important that we as consumers take responsibility at the same time.  This post includes everyone who is capable of doing so, not exceptional cases like those who only eat invasive/overpopulated species or must eat animals to survive."

1. Hamas did the Oct 7 attack unprovoked and specifically because there was a real possibility of peace in the region if MBS had his meeting with Israel. This was cancelled due to the attack. This is two points which I will address separately.

First point, when a nation attacks you unprovoked then it means it needs no reason to attack you. Then you need to give them a reason to not attack you. In this scenario you need to give an unproportinal response. 

If Ukraine ever wants Russia to not attack them then it needs to kill at the least 4 Russians to every Ukrainian. Doesn't matter civilian or otherwise... The numbers should be high so that the public remember this before they think of the next attack. 

2. The second point from above... Hamas doesn't want peace in the region. Maybe because Qatar will stop funding them otherwise. Iran will do the same. Whatever the reason is it's a bad actor. Now i am not commenting on whether Israel is the same. Coz the fact is all actors in the region are bad faith actors. 

3. Israelis have no other place to go back to. In such a scenario nothing should stop you. This also means we should tackle global warming in the strictest manner but all of us are hypocrites. 

4. Palestinians were given too many chances to count to form their own state by Israelis (1952, 1980, 2006), western powers (US) , other Arabs states (Kuwait, Jordan)

All times Palestinians refused it and instead made demands which would mean genocide of the Jews. 

5. The motives of Hamas. Hamas is a genociding terrorist organization. The only reason it doesn't is because it's incompetent as fuck. 

Imagine all the things it did on Oct 7 and all it got was 300 hostages of which they have already lost a 100. They are not freedom fighters like the western liberal would like to believe. They are not equivalent to the IRA. They are equivalent to Al Qaeda. Otherwise they wouldn't have killed Yasser Arafat. 

6. The last point. This will be cintriversial but we have to look back in history. 

One fact we can say without hesitation is Gazans are not modern ppl. Their value systems are still pre-modern. So we wo) have to apply feudal values to them. 

Now there was a thing tha feudal Lords did to their vassals when they rebelled. The starved and harmed their subjects. 

The feudal Lords were safe in their castles just like the Hamas top brass is hiding out in qatar. But if the people are harmed the ruler loses credibility. 

Gazans starve. Hamas loses credibility and perhaps, maybe when Israel leaves - the population will not put someone similar in power. (I told you it's controversial, was not lying)

This includes constitutions  and religious texts. The rules were written by a small group of people during a time in history when a lot of social rules would be deemed immoral now (like slavery or misogyny), so why do people think adhering to them will benefit our current society? If we want to progress, keeping close to traditional, old fashioned rules and interpreting them “as they were written” is dangerous because it ignores how far we have come and where most of us want to go. It’s baffling how many people who pride themselves on being modern, inclusive people who believe in equality don’t realize they are defending laws and messages that were written by people who probably had the opposite values - people who thought inequality and misogyny was normal.

It unfairly rewards those who occupy property without permission, while penalizing diligent owners who may lose their property due to extenuating circumstances, such as being unaware of the squatter's presence.

3,2024-03-28,CMV: The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict Will Continue Until One Side Exterminates the Other,u/AMGEmperorMundatus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bq02g4/cmv_the_israelipalestinian_conflict_will_continue/,changemyview,"Sometimes, fiction can teach us much about the real world. The popular manga/anime series *Attack on Titan* is centered around the cycle of violence, the idea that humans will kill each other endlessly and that peace is simply a brief pause in violence rather than a true end to violence. The protagonist, Eren Yeager, ultimately resorts to mass genocide due to his somewhat grounded belief that the people of his native Paradis will always be hated and that violence against his people will never end otherwise. In my view, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the real-life equivalent of this.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has gone on since before the modern State of Israel was founded in 1948. As soon as Jews began emigrating to the Land of Israel/Holy Land/Palestine, the local Arab populations began attacking them. The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem collaborated with the Nazis and raised Muslim *Waffen-SS* divisions. In 1947, the UN drew up a partition plan that would grant both the Jews and the Arabs a state; the Jews accepted it, but the Arabs rejected it. The Arabs then attacked just as the Jews were about to proclaim the independent State of Israel. The nascent Jewish state won the war against all odds, and Egypt and Jordan took control of Gaza and the West Bank, respectively. The Arabs attacked again in 1967 and lost. They attacked again in 1973 and lost. The future seemed brighter in subsequent decades, and Israeli and Palestinian leaders began to make negotiations. Of course, it turned out that Yasser Arafat wasn't actually interested in peace and was in fact only going to use a two-state solution as a means to destroy Israel in the long run. The negotiations didn't matter anyway, as Israeli PM Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated and Arafat started the Second Intifada. Despite all this, Israel still pulled out of Gaza in 2005, only for the Gazans to elect Hamas in 2006, who immediately began endless rocket attacks on Israel. Then, on October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a full-scale invasion of the Jewish state in which they deliberately murdered, raped, and kidnapped civilians in the name of their Almighty God Hitler. Yes, the Palestinians are so mindlessly antisemitic that they arguably worship Hitler more than Allah.

This reminds me of how the Eldians, specifically the Paradisian Eldians, are depicted in AoT. While the Eldians are said to not be entirely innocent, they still face unwarranted persecution from nearly everyone else on Earth. Eventually, Eren decides that he and his friends will never be safe unless they fully eradicate their enemies. To this end, Eren commences ""the Rumbling"" and kills 80 percent of the world's population. He is defeated in the end, and the cycle of violence continues, culminating in the complete destruction of Paradis sometime in the distant future. Only then does the cycle of violence seemingly end.

Thus, it is my view that the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians will continue until one side exterminates the other. If I were to be more pessimistic, I would say that the conflict will not end until both sides are no more, but I don't know if that is true. Violence is in our nature, and as I say, if the only language one understands is violence, then one must respond to them with violence. I would like to know your takes on this situation. If you want to call me a genocide apologist, then be my guest."

My big problem is that Canada has a system of regulations and market controls that can't support it. If the big issue is housing, I know for a fact that Canada has shitty laws for housing developers. 

Problems like fuel taxes or strict employment liscencing is making it worse. I love the idea of strict testing to make sure everyone is totally qualified for the jobs, but a badly functioning understaffed but still nessacery licencing system is worse then not at all. It just turns into a massive bottleneck.

Realistically, Canada does need to get some economists on working to determine just how many people the county can absorb annualy. But it really can sustain high immigration if Canada's legal framework becomes a better fit for a rapidly developing country. "

1,2024-03-28,"CMV: There is no right, wrong or rather binary reality. Reality is probabilistic.",u/Underconstruction222,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bq28e8/cmv_there_is_no_right_wrong_or_rather_binary/,changemyview,"Morality and ethics, the guiding principles of human behavior, are often perceived as binary concepts – right or wrong, good or bad. However, upon closer examination, it becomes evident that they exist along a continuum, making them inherently probabilistic rather than absolute.

Firstly, cultural and societal norms vary widely across different contexts and time periods. What may be considered morally acceptable in one culture could be condemned in another. For instance, practices such as polygamy or animal sacrifice may be deemed moral in certain societies but unethical in others. This variability underscores the probabilistic nature of morality, as it is contingent upon social and cultural factors that evolve over time.

Secondly, ethical dilemmas frequently arise in complex situations where there is no clear-cut answer. For instance, consider the classic ethical dilemma of the ""trolley problem,"" where one must decide whether to divert a runaway trolley onto a track where it will kill fewer people but still cause harm. In such cases, individuals must weigh competing values and potential consequences, leading to probabilistic decision-making rather than a binary choice between right and wrong.

Furthermore, human psychology and cognitive biases influence moral judgments, adding another layer of complexity to ethical decision-making. People often rely on heuristics and biases, such as the availability heuristic or confirmation bias, which can cloud their judgment and lead to subjective evaluations of moral situations. This subjectivity highlights the probabilistic nature of moral reasoning, as individuals may arrive at different conclusions based on their unique perspectives and cognitive biases.

Moreover, moral dilemmas frequently involve trade-offs between competing values, such as autonomy versus beneficence or justice versus mercy. These value conflicts make it challenging to determine a definitive moral course of action, as individuals must navigate the uncertainty inherent in weighing the relative importance of different moral principles.

In conclusion, morality and ethics are inherently probabilistic rather than binary constructs. They are shaped by cultural norms, influenced by cognitive biases, and characterized by complex value conflicts. Recognizing the probabilistic nature of morality invites humility and open-mindedness in ethical deliberations, acknowledging that there may not always be a clear-cut answer and that moral judgments are subject to uncertainty and interpretation. By embracing this probabilistic perspective, individuals can engage in more nuanced and thoughtful ethical decision-making, informed by an appreciation of the complexity inherent in moral dilemmas."

This is going solely off of what I’ve witnessed with my own eyes from people who were previously left leaning and are now right leaning. The one thing I’ve seen constantly with these specific people are two things: 1) increasing in age and 2) increasing in wealth.

My understanding of this is that generally people on the left side of the political spectrum prefer to see large economic and social changes sooner while people on the right prefer to see less of these. With less social and economic change, the greater chance these people are able to maintain their current wealth.

I think this is important because it probably suggests people aren’t really as caring to society as they like to suggest they are and the reality is that many people will turn their back to helping the majority once they become that rich minority.

**How to change my view:**

Honestly won’t be too hard as I’m not set on this, it’s just an observation. To change it would be to 1) provide statistic proof that another factor is a leading reason, or 2) provide proof that my reasoning isn’t a leading reason

What I don't get is why we uphold old rules where the context no longer applies (thus making it arbitrary to uphold currently) or rules that come down to arbitrary decisions. Mind you, I don't mind so much if it's seemingly arbitrary, but actually does have a fundamentally good reason e.g. when a rule is about left/right positionality - most people are right handed and it therefore ""costs"" less to acquiesce to right handed preferences.

I've only heard one argument in favour of more arbitrary rules so far; having arbitrary rules means it's an easy filter for people who are unwilling to be prosocial when there's nothing at stake so if you can't be trusted to be prosocial when there's nothing at stake, why would you be trusted when there's something more tangible at stake. However, I find this unconvincing; people in general do not behave the same way in no/low stakes and high stakes situations. Someone who might fuck around when there's nothing to be gained or lost might lock in when everything is on the line and someone who is prosocial in banal situations might show their true colours otherwise. 

The current heuristic might be ok at discerning sociality, but I think removing arbitrariness would improve it."

I don't think there were more than 40 people there total.  A subset of our group split off and blocked traffic for about 15-20 minutes on a major road in NYC as part of the protest.  My partner was amongst the people who blocked traffic.  It was very peaceful.  They sat down in the middle of the street after a red light and didn't move until they were arrested.  When they were arrested, they didn't fight back, or do anything aggressive, just peacefully allowed themselves to be taken away.

I want to believe it made a difference in some capacity, but it felt like dropping a handful of sand in a beach to stop erosion.  Symbolic but without actually helping in any way.  I don't think the protest got to any news outlet, and I don't know if the people who were inconvenienced by the traffic stop even knew why there was a stoppage.  We were chanting on the sidewalk the whole time, but it's NYC during rush hour.  20-30 people chanting can be lost in the din.

I do believe civil disobedience can work as a catalyst for change, but small acts like this one I don't think push the needle at all.  I want to believe they can and do, and my time wasn't wasted just trying to make myself feel better, and like I was doing something, but it just kinda felt pointless when it was all over.  

I think only large or sustained acts can move the needle, a huge march, or regularly stopping traffic at the same place for days on end, things like that.  A one off like what I participated in doesn't cut it and is there for protestors to feel good than to make any meaningful change.  

I want to believe it makes a difference, but in the end my small act of protest, as well as my partner's arrest don't do anything at all to help any given situation.

 (Please no responses specifically about Palestine, or Isreal/Palestine, this isn't about that conflict, or about the efficacy of civil disobedience as a whole, as I believe civil disobedience does work.

What im saying is as a tool in conflicts it is almost perfect.

1. As a morale booster

Everyone fighting in a war could benefit from some motivation, some sign to believe that they are right and what they do is justifiable. Religion is perfect for this, how many times in the past and present that wars have been fought with religion used as a motivation, not CAUSE, but a way to justify, to show you are morally superior to the enemy and boost the moral of your troop.  It also helps if your soldier thinks he is fighting gods fight, that he is good and on your side.

2. Religion fosters the collectivism and radicalism that is needed for conflict

Cohesion and solidarity is needed in war. When wartime comes, collectivism is invaluabe. The stronger the collective identity becomes, the greater the danger. For a break with the community can cost a person his or her individual identity. And that is an extremely high psychological barrier. This can lead an individual to forego his or her own desires and needs - or even morals - to that of the collective, rather than to question it and them.
Unquestioning loyalty even in hardship, touting the greater good, i mean isnt that what all leaders do? And religion fosters the mindset perfectly? It provides answers and ease the mind to hardships, all while shunning any outsider and strengthening the in group bond. No space for questioning or personal morals. 

Might be the hottest take but i think this stems from the very nature of religion, believing that one way is right and all others wrong, instead of keeping an open mind. As the world changes the people who submit to religion, especially of the radical kind become radicalised themselves, which makes them come into conflict with others more easily and thus make them more prone to violence.
It speaks to the inherent desire to be the good fighting against the evil. 


Ofc all of this could not happen. After all religion is just a tool like all others, some societies make do with it, some use others. But as a weapon thats readily available it is quite terrifying.

Okay here me out, I like to believe I'm a very empathetic person and a lot of that comes from just having life experiences that bring me to such conclusions, and I think this is one of them.

I think that most incels start out as very normal men with ""normal"" views on women, the issue being that by virtue of living in a patriarchial society, a lot of people, including women have some baseline of misogyny. Usually not overt or extreme, but still present.

I think that if you have these views, the incel pipeline is open to you, and unfortunately, most men have these views. I mean, lets take a look at something much lighter, Andrew Tate. He received a large amount of attention and ushered in a Renaissance of the Red Pill which is still ensnaring people in very large amounts, it's even ensnaring people that don't know they're doing misogyny.

So I don't think that misogyny is unique enough in men that that it's only misogyny that makes incels incels. Afterall, if it was, there would be no misogynists in relationships. ""Suprisingly"" I think the leading cause of incels is rejection. Most feel entitlement to a relationship or sex, not in a malicious ""women owe me sex"" way, but in a ""this is a normal part of human life and it's something I'm going to get as I am a normal human"" and those people aren't even necessarily wrong. It also doesn't help that the idea of relationships and sex is a chemical one provided by the brain.

When you fail to get these things in the way incels do, it really does break you. I was maybe like 5 steps from becoming an incel before snapping out of it and at some point you feel so low that it's phyiscally distressing to get rejected.

So if you're one of these men, you are objectively abnormal, so you seek advice and all advice is fitted towards normal people. Except the advice that's targeting incels, that advice unfortunately is usually toxic and bad, but it's the only advice that applies to you and works for you, so you get sucked in, the only people who understand what you're going through are incels and a lot are 20 steps deeper into it.

Well, otherwise every woman would go far and beyond for any other child in need she has no attachment too. And clearly, she will most likely only care at that level about her own child. Assuming she does...

  
In every single example one may analyse, it all comes down to a self-serving decision.

And maybe that is the way many people see and engage in it, but I don’t think it has to be that way. 

At its best, sex is fun, playful. It requires curiosity, openness, presence. It is pleasant and valueable in itself, like playing a game. You’re getting to know and connecting with another person in a very intimate way. And if not, then you are doing sex wrong. 

An argument for casual sex being superficial is that it doesn’t last long. But I don’t think that only long-term connections are valuable. We wouldn’t say that of a friendship or romantic relationship after it ends. 

The other argument may be that it has to be superficial because if it’s not, then you catch feelings and want more. But we don’t say that of say friendships, although it also may and does happen. But we don’t tell people not to connect too much with their friends lest they catch feelings.

So there isn’t anything inherently superficial about casual sex, although many and perhaps most people do practice it that way. "

Consumer costs increasing means it functions as a sales tax, which i think is uncontroversial to say is regressive. I dont think thats all that likely to happen though - i expect if businesses could raise prices they would have already.  

Otherwise, If it's being taken out of shareholder returns before getting to shareholders, there is no progressive bracketing applied. The poor retired grandma effectively pays the same rate as a billionaire owner of AAPL shares.

If the goal is just increasing tax revenue, why not find a more progressive means?

Using hand loaded ammo for hunting or target shooting is different because making sure every bullet you have goes bang isn’t quite as important as when you’re in a life or death situation.

Even if you follow a published recipe to the tee, it can still be more risky than just using factory ammo.

And when it comes to casting your own bullets, bullet expansion or fragmentation when hitting an animal or human target can be more unpredictable or not quite as good as factory manufactured and cast bullets.

There is enough high quality self defense ammo out there that even taking into account cost concerns, it shouldn’t be necessary. Getting enough reloading equipment and reloading enough ammo to make a noticeable cost savings is significant; you gotta spend a lot of money in order to save it."

This isn't political. It's more of a statement about human beings in general and I'm making the point that human beings are extremely ambitious by nature. No matter the race or nation that began it, I believe it was an inevitability. In fact, all of society and where we are currently was inevitable. And for the most part it's miraculous and unbelievable and we should be truly proud of where we are. 

I spend a lot of time looking and considering other species in comparison to us. We are very very different. But at the core we are all just that, living species. So makes sense to look and see where our similarities and differences lie. So the way I see it, every living organism tends to have the desire to work. Working is critical to the survival of life in one way or another. I mean look at bees. They work super hard. But it's for the most basic instinctual purpose to survive. And to that end I actually believe that's what human beings are also working towards. And I also believe that in the long run we actually have the only chance of doing so. 

It's pretty simple this planet is dead once the sun dies. The only species that survives is the one that figures out how to get to other planets, inhabit them, colonize them, for the purpose of creating cohesive community patterns and maximizing work output to further our understanding of nature in order to utilize it to the advantage of our self perpetuating survival as a species.

Now since we are self aware to a fault we begin the self defeating process and beating ourselves to death with guilt. For what? For utilizing resources on this planet to further our own survival? On a micro scale that's what basically every single living species does though, without concern for the other species' survival. Yes it's a cliche thing to say but really, does a lion ask a gazelle how it feels before it eats it? Nah. It needs to survive. So, in truth, I think human beings are in fact consuming this planet. To survive. And to suggest we could just dismantle society and go back to living in huts never ever bothering to progress beyond that well, you must be thinking of the wrong species. 

The question of whether or not we can travel through space already has an answer because we have. It's just a matter of refining the process to a point we can begin to get far enough to find other habitable planets. To colonize them, claim the land, work the land, create, innovate, rinse, repeat. And tadda we live forever. It's possible. But also we need to stop fighting. That's a real issue that threatens our survival immediately. We all need to work towards the common goal of surviving beyond the eventual death of this planet. And we are the only species on earth with the capacity to do so. 

So let's all stop fighting everyone. The fate of humanity depends on it! "

Courts are just loose cannons throwing random people in jail because the girl cried ""rape"" in some cases-we know 10% of rape allegations at any given point are false, and we only know that because the woman came clean. There's probably a lot, lot more where the accuser never said it was fake.

This is where #BelieveAllWomen got us. Rape cases aren't handled like any other criminal accusation, it's guilty unless proven innocent. Some sexual assault trials didn't even bring in DNA evidence, they just threw the guy in jail based on how well the alleged victim acted. If this were an accusation of \*any other crime\*, the court would rightfully believe the plaintiff was lying until sufficient evidence was brought in, because guess what? People lie about this shit, especially if the charges would ruin the defendant's life.

Of course, people aren't constantly monitored. We have no way to prove whether sex was consensual or not in lots and lots of cases, because people don't normally have sex in public where there can be witnesses. And usually if there's no evidence to support your claim and your case has no legs to stand on, the defendant is allowed to walk away a free man if you accused him of \*any other crime on the planet\*. If this were, for example, a murder charge brought against somebody, the outcome would be very, very different. If the court has no evidence that you killed somebody, you're allowed to go free. If the court has no evidence that you raped a woman, you're going to jail anyway. It doesn't matter, because we assume every woman is telling the truth.

And no, ""I was drunk"" isn't evidence. If I get so hammered that I can barely stand and I'll agree to anything, and I agree to get bukkake'd by 4 men, then it doesn't matter. I got fucked by 4 dudes. I said ""Yes."" It doesn't matter if I regret having sex with those men, it doesn't matter if I'm straight. I consented. Roll credits. And I know that drunk people would consent to anything, that's why it's my job as a responsible, mature adult to not get so drunk I'd fuck anything that walks. It's my job to look out for myself. I can't say, ""Surprise! I take-backsies, you actually raped me, see you in court!"" like a 1st grader. Once you had sex, you had sex. Sorry. You consented, you can't revoke consent after the fact because you regretted it. At least men can't. So why can women do that and actually win a case?

Coercion, in most cases, should also not be considered evidence AT ALL. Unless there is a fucking gun being pointed to your head or you're being blackmailed, ""coercion"" isn't evidence. If someone pulls their pants down and asks you how badly you want the job, you still have a choice. You can, by all means, tell the guy to go fuck himself. If you make the conscious decision to suck his dick so you can get that job, then you consented. Period.

If ""I consented but....uhhh....actually, now that I think about it, I got raped"" is a valid legal defense, what's the point of consent? It used to be you either consented or you didn't, not ""Oh, I said yes but I didn't really mean to."" If you didn't mean to, you should've said no."

Most put in a year or less at that and promptly looked for another job. Overwhelmingly, I was told that from the very top, there is massive incompetence. I researched this further, and I am troubled to see the lack of high credentials for directors, undersecretaries and on up to cabinet secretaries appointed by POTUS.

This is a non-partisan issue so far as I can tell - with at least Bush through Biden exhibiting this, but particularly the Obama and Trump renditions of the executive branch of government were egregious.

As I study this, I see (primarily) that we have PhD's and leading minds from around the world being ego-tripped by 30+ year party loyalists to the GOP or Dem party, or even just people loyal to the current sitting POTUS.

I think this is holding our country back, and that if you are to, say, be a National Security director or the Secretary of Transportation, you should be REQUIRED to hold credentials that match the highest qualified people answering to you (as best as possible). I think this might have the effect of promoting the best minds from within these departments and agencies to the top, rather than purely political appointments that make no sense.

Perhaps I am missing something, but at minimum it seems to hold us back, and it seems to me that at its worst it could represent a massive national security issue looking for a place to happen (and perhaps already has/does happen with some regularity)."

Anti-miscegenation views should be viewed as a threat to national security 

**Explanation:**

As someone who recently travelled to Latin America, I noticed that because the Spanish colonial system never forced segregation and mixing was encouraged, almost all the people in LATAM countries are mixed.

In Colombia & in Panama, it was common to find people of all skin colours ranging from pale white to dark black and sometimes these differences would appear in the SAME family among siblings. 

Because of this mixed appearance of Latinos, they are much much less likely to develop identities based on colour and so there was more national unity. No dark-skinned Colombian, calls themselves African or believed that they did not belong in Colombia. No pale-skinned Panamanian would believe it would make sense to tell a dark-skinned Panamanian he should go ""back"" to Africa, that wouldn't make sense as his own great grandfather was probably dark-skinned. 

Americans are way too obsessed with skin colour & race, which impedes national unity. This is why you have certain Black Americans calling for a ""Black National Anthem"" or calling themselves ""African"" Americans (despite none of their ancestors for the last 500 years ever having set foot in Africa). This is why you have an American who was born in the US, who's parents were also born in the US, but they call themselves ""Chinese"" because their grandparents were Chinese immigrants & don't feel like they ""belong"" in America.

If everyone was mixed, everyone would be forced to identify with everyone & judge less based on ethnic background and more on national identity & shared values.

But I'm willing to hear other view points."

I don't get that. Both my parents are very career centric and 80 % of my childhood they aren't really there for my sister and I. We have issues that we gripe with but also because of that, my sister and I live very comfortable.

 I wouldn't dive into too much details but I have an alternate lifestyle I refused to compromise after even having a kid. In the eyes of the society, said lifestyle might not necessarily be ideal for children development.

Too often I have also seen a lot of other parents who obviously lost love for each other but stay together for their children and this in turns affects their ability to find new partners too.

I am not entirely sure if I share the sentiment. Not sure either if its noble or dumb. I don't intent to be a deadbeat dad by any mean. I wanna be a good father but I also do not want to compromise who I am.

One of the most annoying things on reddit is the hivemind. There's a certain thing about the way people think on here where it's often pessimistic and negative about a service or game. As a product, if you hang around certain subreddits for things like youtube, you see a ton of people asking for a boycott and having a meltdown over advertisements.

Let's be clear. Nobody likes ads. but, if they are the only way to sustain a free service, it's a pretty good deal. It beats paying a flat out fee, and generally, ads aren't that intrusive. There are examples on youtube of ads that are a bit odd for sure, but these are not the MAJORITY of advertisements. Now, you can say I don't know this for sure, but it is obvious that large companies do the larger campaigns on youtube. There's no way to prove / disprove this afaik so there's no point debating over this point.

A lot of people have been getting upset lately because youtube is taking action against adblock on their platform. Youtube is a free service that survives by playing advertisements. So our options are simply, youtube runs ads and continues to exist, or youtube ceases all ads and closes down. Presuming that the people annoyed about ads on youtube actually like using it, it seems that it's pretty cut and dry which is the lesser evil.

To get into the specifics of things, youtube reportedly operates at a loss. Running the largest video sharing platform in the world is definitely not cheap, there are literally no upload limits for anyone who signs up. To me, I've always viewed youtube as a public service of sorts because of what it enables us to share / watch. So, just based on that, yeah. If they're operating at a loss, of course they should increase ads or combat adblock. that just seems like the right thing to do. Obviously, people using adblock violate their terms of service that we agree to by using it, so in the simplest terms, it's a part of our agreement. As the owners of youtube however, they have the right to do whatever they want with their platform - obviously nobody would like it but if they wanted, they could make it a lot more like cable tv, which nobody seems to complain about despite costing exorbitent amounts of money AND showing MANY more ads than youtube does.

I am open to having my mind changed but I don't think it's likely, I'm really making this post just to see if there are any viable arguments against this. In terms of sustaining their platforms, more ads / vetoing adblocker (which cuts into their already limited funds) is obviously the correct move. Ethically it is more than within their right, it would even be within their right to charge for a service like this. And yeah. Ads are annoying. but when paid services like amazon prime and, as previously mentioned, cable are showing more ads than youtube does, I don't think I have a valid reason to complain.

As an aside, youtube does a better job paying creators than other platforms do including twitch. Twitch largely depends on viewers paying creators which they take a cut of. so again, it just seems like youtube is doing better than their competitors. CMV?"

There are a few key things about this system:

1. First past the post within each constituency. This system essentially makes sure that the Prime Minister always belongs to one of two parties. Third-party votes are usually seen as throwaway votes.

2. The party with the 2nd most votes will almost never end up with power, while the 3rd sometimes does. When there's a hung parliament, it's frustrating that it's the 3rd party or some smaller parties that end up with the king-making power. How does a party with some 10% of the total votes have the mandate to determine who the next Prime Minister should be?

3. Prime Minister can be changed by the ruling party without a mandate. In the UK, we have had 2 Prime Ministers in the past 2 years that are not elected by the voters. The last PM to get voted in was Boris Johnson, a relic figure in the context of British politics.

4. The Prime Minister can call an election whenever it pleases them. In recent years, Theresa May and Boris Johnson have called elections when they fancied it (worked out for one but not the other though). And now Rishi Sunak is trying to drag the election as long as he can because he's at a disadvantage. Elections should be scheduled so because the ruling party should not get to choose a date that best suited them.


5. House of Lords. Why the fuck is this still a thing?

To me all of this combined means that whoever wins the General Election, which can be a highly unrepresentative win because of FPTP and gerrymandering, the ruling party or parties is granted by the system an absurd amount of power and control for the next few years.

I'm sure some people will complain about the Electoral College, which I have [here](https://redd.it/1b8tus6), but at least in the US, Americans get to vote for the Senate and the House separately, which are incredibly powerful and often misalign with the President. State autonomy and Supreme Court also further divide the political power up between institutions, so while the EC is horrible, at least the democratic system as a whole is pretty healthy.

I'd like to hear how other systems are worse than the British Parliamentary System and its derivative in other countries."

Acknowledgement: Midway gets some credit because it was the battle the US was more likely to lose. 

Counterpoint: The scale of the win matters. Japan in Mid-44 had a very formidable carrier arm. No one expected such an insanely lopsided victory. 

Acknowledgment: Leyte Gulf sank way more ships. 

Counterpoint: Leyte Gulf was an execution. The Pacific was a carrier war, and once they lost their carrier fleet Japan had no fighting chance.

Why was Philipine Sea so important:

- Hugely lopsided result (10% of the aviator losses!) against a rival who was competitive in nature
- Two years worth of carrier and aviation regeneration lost in a matter of hours
- Massive morale shift, instantly changing the entire tenure of the Pacific War
- Let the US win Saipan, which also let the US start bombing Japan. Massive war impact. 
- Literally caused the fall of general Tojo 

Effectively, Philippine Sea was the battle where Japan lost the war. Any hope of forestalling the US became impossible. Everything afterwards was mop up. I think it gets buried by the history books. "

So yeah, pretty simply, I think I spent way too much time in the menus during gameplay, especially for fuse. Having played RDR2 on console, I think that the weapon and item wheel takes some getting used to, but I don't think it took that much more getting used to than the TotK systems.

I know it might have required a little bit of extra work in terms of categorizing items so that it's not just the same problem as the game as is, but with a radial display. From what I understand about game development though, it wouldn't be that much work since most items already have tags in the back end.

As for why the tag system wouldn't benefit the current bar display- I think that the radial display is better suited for console systems.

Jesus' death only happened and so his resurrection only happened, because Judas betrayed him for 30 pieces of silver. Without Judas Jesus would at best be a minor prophet who performed a couple of fancy tricks.

Instead due to Judas Christians believe Jesus saved us all, and that is something that he should be celebrated for, not judged on.

Could someone else have betrayed him? Sure, but no one else did. Judas took the hit noone else would.

Please note I am not here to argue if Christianity is real or not.

Edit: There are several posts about how just because Jesus' death led to the saving of all mankind, does not make Judas' betrayal acceptable and I have awarded deltas to those. I think it is a fair argument."

Ok, this is something I can't stop thinking about for some reason but I think All Shook Up is a typical white picket American teen trying weed for the first time. Here's my arguments;

It was around this time Elvis started taking more and more drugs now he was out of the army (Elvis did drugs in the army to keep himself awake during long periods of time, as did many soldiers). Marijuana was one of them.

Take a listen to 

""Oh, well, a-bless my soul but"",

They've awarded themselves a blessed soul as they know they've done something wrong

""what's wrong with me?""

They're questioning what's happening as they've never experienced a feeling like this before.

""I'm itching like a man in a fuzzy tree""

They're tweaking out about starting to feel all fuzzy in the head

""My friends say I'm acting wild as a bug"" 

Smoking with friends as teens do, but then they begin to have a bad trip and start freaking out while they're friends try and calm them.

""I'm in love""

Settled down, they begin to enjoy the highs of weed

""I'm all shook up""

The weed is making them reconsider their views, as some would say shaking them up.

""Oh, well, my hands are shaky, and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet""

Oh crap, their friends bought bad weed. It's starting to mess they up.

""Who do you thank when you have such luck?
I'm in love""

Sarcasm.

""I'm all shook up""

Now the strange feeling has gone throughout their whole body

""Well, please, don't ask me what's upon my mind""

Now the weed is making them forgetful.


""I'm a little mixed up, but I feel fine""

Still hazy, but now the bad trip has passed

Would love to chat to someone about this.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1bqxzg6/benches\_clear\_in\_new\_york\_after\_rhys\_hoskins\_over/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1bqxzg6/benches_clear_in_new_york_after_rhys_hoskins_over/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

In baseball, there is a relatively new ""slide rule"" as follows:

>When sliding into a base in an attempt to break up a double play, a runner has to make a ""bona fide slide."" Such is defined as the runner making contact with the ground before reaching the base, being able to reach the base with a hand or foot, being able to remain on the base at the completion of the slide (except at home plate) and not changing his path for the purpose of initiating contact with a fielder. The slide rule prohibits runners from using a ""roll block"" or attempting to initiate contact with the fielder by elevating and kicking his leg above the fielder's knee, throwing his arm or his upper body or grabbing the fielder. When a violation of the slide rule occurs, the offending runner and the batter-runner will be called out.  
Accidental contact can occur in the course of a permissible slide, and a runner will not be called for interference if contact is caused by a fielder being in the runner's legal pathway to the base.

I think the play linked above demonstrates a serious flaw in how this rule is written.  Specifically, the part about ""being able to reach the base with a hand or foot, being able to remain on base at the completion of the slide"".  

The idea here is that if you slide super late, such that you would overshoot the bag and not even have a chance of staying on base, it's a clear indication that you did it to intentionally make contact with the fielder and break-up the double-play.

The problem is that you can slide egregiously late, with the super-obvious intention of colliding with the fielder, but as long as you manage to use your grip on the bag to stop your moment from carrying yourself past the bag the slide rule won't be applied.

Watch the video of Hoskins.  He nearly yanks his arm out of his socket with how hard he is stopping his momentum.  If the bag had no lip to hang onto, he would have easily slid far without of reach of the bag and both runners would have been out.

I would prefer the rule to be rewritten to give umpires simple discretion over whether a late-slide seems intentional or not.  Just let them look at the timing of the slide and exercise their judgment in deciding whether the runner would have reasonably believed that they could reach safely, or if they were just trying to collide with the fielder to break-up the play.

Change my view."

This is like saying: “I believe in fairies because a fairy tales book says they exist.” And when asked “How do you know the fairy tales book is true?”, the person replies “Because it was written by fairy believers.”That argument is inherently flawed and provides absolutely zero evidence that could conclude to fairies. The same logic follows with the Christian Bible.

Any references to miracles that were performed are currently unfalsifiable and therefore unreliable until proven to be of god.

If you and I saw what we both determined to be a miracle, what could we do to determine whether that was of a higher power or not? I personally would start gathering as much empirical evidence as possible, like eyewitness testimonies, photos, videos, and anything physical associated with the event. After that I would start investigating natural and plausible explanations. The default position in terms of any claim is that belief should be withheld until demonstrated to be true, and no god claim has ever been demonstrated to exist in cohesion with measurable reality. This is why we explore natural explanations; they have been demonstrated to exist in cohesion with measurable reality on a repeatable, demonstrable, and verifiable scale. This also creates a likely-hood that whatever alleged miracle we both saw was of natural and non-divine origin until such time that a god is demonstrated to exist.

There is no evidence that the christian bible is more sound than any other holy book.

There are many holy books currently in existence, how do we determine which holy book is more probable to conclude the existence of a god? If a god claim in of itself is currently unfalsifiable, how do we determine that any holy book is of god?You cannot determine any holy book is of a higher power until a higher power is demonstrated to exist. Any test I can think of would only conclude the cohesion, consistency, and historical accuracy of the known holy texts. None would verify the soundness of a god claim.

Faith is a lack of justification in a belief and does not provide sufficient evidence to warrant belief in a claim.

Faith is inherently based on a presupposition of some kind. When attempting to justify belief with faith this presupposition creates an argument from ignorance and circular reasoning. Faith goes where a claim is not supported by measurable reality. According to the people who spend their entire adult schooling and working life measuring reality: when a claim does not align with measurable reality, we can determine it as likely to not be true. Especially if there are more viable and sound counter-claims.

Another point I would like to add is that there is no position someone couldn’t take on faith. A child can have faith that Santa will come every Christmas, but this doesn’t make it true. This is a demonstrable way of showing faith is an unreliable tool to truth and therefore is unreliable to use as justification in the belief of any claim. Just as the child’s faith in Santa’s return does not make it a reality, faith alone does not provide a reliable method of establishing the truth of any claim."

I have no remorse for Israelis because they're living on a stolen land , now some will say that Palestinians are also living on stolen land etc....

I was used to be around my peers and the thing we would do is just play shitty video games wether it’s pc/mobile 

As I grew older I realised something was off, couldn’t quite point my finger at it, but I knew it had something to do with socialising. 

Studies showed me why I was feeling that way, depressingly I faced it as a fuck of my generation and thought well it is what it is. 


Then I joined the army… phones are simply not allowed at this point, we came about 50-100 people from random parts of the country, nothing in mutual, everyone is sorta anxious but doesn’t show it, first instinct? Grab your phone, cuz you don’t wanna socialise and make yourself look like a fool in front of a complete stranger and it’s simpler to  just scroll through random shit on your phone.  We didn’t have that, some would wish they had, but we didn’t, we actually started socialising, had tons of laughs, shared stories, suddenly these embarrassingly foreign strangers became some what of mates, and all you can do with them for weeks is laugh and talk, nothing more, it’s either you’re left out bored out of your mind or you gotta talk to pass the time. 


It made me realise how all of these bullshit talk of elderly people that phones fuck us up was actually true, we just didn’t get it just right when we grew up, and some will maybe never know how fun it is to just connect to people and live with them in the same place and do everything together

The reason I don’t identify as a feminist is because it primary focuses on women’s rights and issues from my perspective. This was of course completely understandable during the first and second wave of feminism as women were disadvantaged compared to men in multiple aspects of society. 

I live in the UK, where as a whole I believe women now have the same rights as men. There are still issues primary affected women, just as there are issues primarily affecting men.  The issue I have with modern day feminism is its continued hyper focus on women’s issues. 

I have hardly seen or heard of feminist marches, discussions, debates etc related to men’s issues. I will admit I do not actively seek out feminist spaces because I do not identify as one, and am disillusioned with the movement because of my perception that it focuses only on women’s issues. That perception was formed, however, because of the lack of coverage of men’s issues in mainstream feminism. 

If feminist spaces do indeed cover men’s issues, they certainly are doing a terrible job at disseminating that aspect of feminism in the mainstream media. 

I understand some people have the view that women are still disadvantaged compared to men and that we should focus on addressing that first, but I find that a flawed argument in regards to being an equality movement as it would be prioritising the issues of one sex over another. 

An equality movement should seek to address issues affecting all groups, and wouldn’t prioritise certain issues because of which demographic the issue affects, rather it should be based on the severity of the issue. 

If modern day feminism is genuinely an equality movement, why is there such a lack of focus on addressing men’s issues?

What men’s issues has the feminist movement addressed?"

Im not a multi-millionaire but I am someone who loves knowing that there are things that are mine, and some things that belong to my partner

Whats so wrong abt that? I get the idea of marriage is that its supposed to last forever. But the truth is, there is a good chance it might not

I could love a partner to the moon and back this year, but then x event/problem happens and by next year we are not together…i don‘t understand how confident people are that a marriage will work out

Idk maybe this belongs in the unpopular sub, but I just don‘t understand whats so problematic about prenups

Like i googled and chatgped this, so what I read is that some may view this as unfair; bc if the richer partner buys more things bc they can, they get too keep that for the divorce

But thats perfectly logical? Why should the partner who either didn‘t contribute as much to costs or couldn‘t, then get to have equal pickings on any assets after a divorce?

 I also read people see this as a lack of trust, and again i am not someone who trusts easy and will probably never trust anyone including 100% but also aside from my clear issues, how is this a sign of lack of trust?

Isn‘t it logical to be ready for any unforseen issues in the future?

I also see that many prenups don‘t support Alimony which people dont like. This also blows my mind…if there is a divorce why is there any expectation for that person to than pay anything to you? I get it if you have kids, but thats a different argument.  If you married someone and decided to be stay at home and not earn your own money or further your education, thats 100% on you. Im not saying stay home is bad, my dad was a happy stay at home dad for all my life. But he was aware of the risks and has a bachelor degree to support him in finding a job in case my mom and dad divorce.

I realize i included my own issues in this and ik im not relationship material.

1,2024-03-30,cmv:Bollywood pictures should have more songs in then.,u/AdTrick7283,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1brf8l8/cmvbollywood_pictures_should_have_more_songs_in/,changemyview,"Bollywood pictures should have more songs in them.

Firstly, Bollywood pictures have only become popular in the 90s and 00s. Prior to that, they were only popular in the communist block due to a lack of alternatives, since showing Hollywood pictures to the citizens of the countries would otherwise rile them up, which would be bad for them. However, they spread over to East-Asia, Africa, and the Middle-East among valid competition. Pictures in those times contained a huge number of songs. An example is Hum Aapke Hain Kaun containing 14 songs, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge containing 7 songs, and Rangeela containing 9 songs. The primary reason these pictures are still popular today is due to their songs, which are still listened to the youth of the contemporary era, such as myself.
Secondly, the songs of the picture are the primary resource that a picture has to convey the tone of the story! In 3 Idiots, how would we see the love blossoming between Chotte and Pia without the song 'Zaabi Doobi'? In Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, how would we have seen the love blossoming between Rahul and Anjali without the song 'Ladki Badi Anjaani Hai'? Masala pictures such as Chennai Express and Happy New Year rely on songs to inform the audience that it is a masala picture, and not a picture of a single-genre, due to their overexaggerated, yet simple nature, that makes it obvious! Moreso, the audience will not be able to focus on a 210 minute picture without it having songs in it.

Finally, the writers do not have to put as much attention to the plot of the picture as they do in the status-quo, since the songs of the picture and the leading star will be the primary variables in the popularity of a picture. In the status-quo, Jawan and Pathaan were a blockbuster and all time blockbuster respectively. However, Dunki did not acquire as much money as the prior pictures of Shahrukh Khan. This was because the songs were not as good in Dunki as they were in Jawan and Pathaan. Otherwise, Shahrukh Khan, due to his international fame, would have ensured that Dunki would have been a blockbuster along the lines of Jawan and Pathaan. Even Fan and Zero flopped due to the lack of songs in them despite containing Shahrukh Khan.

This is why Bollywood pictures should have more songs in them."

I’m autistic and tend to take things very literally and can’t help but notice all of the abrahamic religions, Islamic Hindu and Buddhist belief systems all reference god as light. Enoch describes god as essentially a ball of light in his recounts of heaven. People who have died and been revived talk about seeing the light. People who have had encounters with almost all references to a God describe it as light. Has anyone ever thought that maybe it’s not a metaphor for purity or hope or whatever and that God is essentially just light. I find it very peculiar that that many different religions chose the same metaphor to express the presence of God and much more likely that things got lost in translations along the way. 

Without light we have nothing, no chance for life or consciousness in any way. We owe the entirety of our existence to the light. We know that light carries energy and the speed of light or is essential to bending the fabric of time. We know that plants can use light to create energy, to which we owe our air and sustainable energy in forms of food sources. We know that light can be directly converted to electrical energy, the same electrical energy that powers the human brain. 

We know now that our bodies are energy fields that are manipulated by the ambient powers around us. If God is light, would that make heaven or hell dependent on the energy levels in reserve at the time when the physical body no longer utilized or added any additional energy?

I’ve been looking for months and can’t seem to find anything, in any religion, that would discredit the idea that God is truly light, albeit in a form that we don’t currently understand light/energy/consciousness can hold.

This intrusion might set up bad first impressions with you and that person or group as it can come off as not respecting their space/boundaries. The reason I didn’t include clubs, while they are good ways to meet people. Are really hard to work with when you commute as club hours tend to happen very late in the day.

We are now seeing a surge in people wanting more attention on domestic violence against men, and while i agree, it is not presented in the way it is and is often over exaggerated. 

For instance many of the ""domestic violence against men"" by women are actually self defense. There is a term called reactive abuse which is very common among victims of domestic violence 

[https://breakthesilencedv.org/reactive-abuse-what-it-is-and-why-abusers-rely-on-it/](https://breakthesilencedv.org/reactive-abuse-what-it-is-and-why-abusers-rely-on-it/)

It is simply a reaction to repeated abuse by the hands of the abuser, it triggers the victim to fight back or react badly. A prime example of this is the Gabby Petitio case where her abuser repeatedly abused her and she reacted to him, when the police arrived, it seemed like her abuser was the victim and Gabby was the real ""abuser"" and the crazy one. 

This is further evidenced by how women who kill their husbands serve longer prison sentence than men who kill their wives 

[https://www.domesticshelters.org/articles/in-the-news/women-serve-longer-prison-sentences-after-killing-abusers#google\_vignette](https://www.domesticshelters.org/articles/in-the-news/women-serve-longer-prison-sentences-after-killing-abusers#google_vignette)

This challenges the narrative that women are just as abusive as men are and this is demonstratingly false.

Now onto the real culprit of domestic abuse against men, the perpetrators of the male victims of abuse are not women but other men. 

[https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/challenging-the-mra-claim-of-a-domestic-violence-conspiracy/8632190](https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/challenging-the-mra-claim-of-a-domestic-violence-conspiracy/8632190)

The above article presents everything i argued about to save time let me, just print it out in this post 

>Dr Michael Flood, an Associate Professor of Sociology at Queensland University of Technology, with a focus on gender and masculinities, said that by focusing on the tiny proportion of violent women, the MRAs only shifted the focus away from the real threat: violent men.  
  
The MRAs mis-diagnose the problem and therefore mis-prescribe the cure,"" he said.  
  
According to the ABS, 89 per cent of males and 67 per cent of females who were victims of physical assault reported that the offender was male.  
  
Michael Brandenburg said that, in his 25 years experience, where there was domestic violence against men, it tended to be perpetrated by other male family members.  
  
""One of the challenges we're finding at the moment is men moving back home to live with elderly parents,"" he said.  
  
""There's some violence occurring in those relationships.""

As you can see an expert himself with 25 years of experience has stated that the real perpetrators of domestic violence against men are not women but other men, mostly relatives.

Now for those who say it's because men are less likely to report a woman hitting them, here is a counter arguement 

>Some MRAs argue the one in three figure actually underestimates the number of male victims of domestic violence, because men are either too ashamed, too stoic, or too chivalrous to report being hit by their female partner.  
  
Hack has heard from men who said they were too afraid to report violence by their female partner, or thought the police wouldn't take them seriously.  
  
But apart from these anecdotal reports, there's only mixed evidence to back up this claim, with some studies showing men are more likely to report violence, and others showing they're less likely.  
  
It's also possible many women are afraid to report domestic violence.  
  
Dr Salter pointed out that men often testify to police about being the victims of violence, even though, like with being beaten up by a woman, this violence has been humiliating.  
  
""Men can report degrading violence by men but somehow they're terrified to report violence by their female partner,"" he said.  
  
""I don't think this is a logical argument.""

Now i understand this is all controversial and seems like i'm diminishing male domestic violence victims but it is important to get the facts about the problems we face in this society.Which is why i made this post to see if i am wrong about this because i want to believe that most men are being sincere about how common domestic violence against men is.

People wanna be diverse not equal.

People's worldview are too different to be actually seen as equal

There's so many differences between male and female , young and old , different religions , political views that's it's almost impossible to reach ""Equality"" 


There's so many difference between people that it's impossible to see everyone as equal 

Our Worldview is different , what we think of God or existence of it is different , What we see as morally good is different , Our skills is different , How we wanna be treated is different.

Nobody actually wants to be equal because to be equal is for everyone to be on the same level or be the same.

People wanna feel special and different , it's human nature to be competitive.

Maybe i am wrong but the way i see it everyone is too different and too divided to see everyone as Equal and Equality can only work in a ""perfect"" world  but the world ain't perfect .

Maybe we should just accept everyone is different.

Sure, we've been waiting for a solar eclipse in the US for nearly a century, but when it finally happens, it is going to be, well, a bit underwhelming.

But I see all the time men trying really hard to be masculine and shaming men for being effeminate.

Like why would you have to prove your masculinity to me? If you know yourself that you are masculine or a man, then why shame other men for wearing skirts or makeup? It honestly just seems to me like if anything you're just very insecure about your own masculinity and want to inflict your insecurities on other people. Which makes you a bully. If a man is wearing dresses and skirts clearly he is aware it is feminine but he doesn't care. It makes him happy. Whether or not you like it doesn't matter because he knows about his masculinity. He doesnt have to prove it to anyone. He is already in touch with his own masculinity and doesn't need to remind himself of it.

Maybe I just have a different definition of masculinity but I honestly an effeminate man is usally more secure about their masculinity and aren't afraid to be who they really are. These people who make masculinity their whole personality, tbh I don't see masculinity, I see a very insecure young man who's too afraid to be himself."

i’ve always seen this phrase used in order to defend a misandrist statement. lets flip it around and use it against minorities. 

“not all black people are criminals!” “well not ALL black people but ALWAYS a black person”. 

see how that’s wrong? we can swap it with any minority that has a statistic that goes against them (there are hundreds). racists use it as an excuse to be anti-immigrant. i find it disheartening that most people lack the introspection to realize this statement is bigoted until the roles are switched just goes to show how normalized misandry is compared to misogyny "

I want to introduce something new for them to argue about because these arguments are hilarious and get very heated, and I think I've developed a deceptively simple but robust framework.

I contend that all beverages are either tea or juice. Teas include anything in which a substance is introduced to water: actual tea, coffee, beer, etc. Juices include anything squeezed directly from animal or vegetable: dairy milk, fruit or veg juices, wine, etc.

I have tested this framework and found it to be quite rigorous. Under this definition, fizzy water (and thus sodas) are carbon dioxide teas. Broths, too, are meat / bone / vegetable teas. Brandies, however, are juices, as they are distilled wines. Nut milks are a little tricky but I am satisfied that they can be classified as teas, as water has to be introduced and the solids strained out.

Now Powerlifting is technically a ""sport"". That being said im still leaning towards them not being athletes. The primary(basically only) component is strength. It's either you can lift the weight or you can't. It's too 2-dimensional when you compare it to other sports that employ strategy, coordination, timing, adaptive thinking, ""functional physicality"", conditioning, and other factors.

1,2024-03-30,CMV: Misandry is an acceptable response to misogyny,u/Remarkable-Alarm7428,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1brna9u/cmv_misandry_is_an_acceptable_response_to_misogyny/,changemyview,"TW: mentions of rape and assault

Misandry rises as opposition against misogyny. It is the resentment people develop towards males from years of the patriarchal culture of males misusing their societal influence to oppress women. It's the anger that people feel after years of males raping, torturing, physically assaulting, sexually harassing, murdering, and attacking women.

I am a misandrist. I cannot imagine a male having humanly qualities such as compassion, empathy, kindness, wisdom, love or even basic human decency. And I am not saying this purely because I've seen too many news reports, too many articles, or too many pieces on the various ways males terrorize this society. I have experienced this in real life. I have seen how extremely soulless and degenerate males are. 

Let's start with my father. He is extremely selfish, unkind, rude, arrogant, lazy, disrespectful, dishonest and greedy. He was unable to accept that my mother is much more educationally and professionally qualified than him. He demanded dowry from my mother's parents (who are already broke) and threatened to kill her if they didn't provide him with large sums of money that would essentially leave them bankrupt. He is also incredibly irresponsible and refuses to pay child support for me to the point that police action had to be taken against him in order to force him to pay.

I do not have any brothers thankfully.

My only other male relative was my maternal grandfather, who was a pedophile. Every day, he would groom and rape me for a year when I was 8. He had no qualms about this and threatened to kill me if I ever told my mother. Everyday, I would hide the infections I got, out of shame. My private parts would itch and hurt all the time. This thankfully stopped at 11, when my maternal grandmother saw him forcing himself on me and kicked my mother and I out of the house. Unfortunately, she called me a whore, because she thought my fear of telling anyone about my assault was complacency. She eventually reconciled with us when my grandfather died and made no mention of the incident. But I know that she knew. I saw her look directly in my eye while he raping me.

During this time, while I was 8, the boys I went to school with used to bully me relentless because they thought I was ugly. They would call me dirty for my dark skin color. They physically assaulted me because they believed ugly girls deserved it. If any boy didn't actively participate in the physical assault, they would watch from afar, without interfering or helping me.

Most of my male teachers have either been incredibly sexist in how they teach or have outright molested me in class. Many used to flirt with the underage girls in my class. Many used to make strange remarks about skirts. I have had one teacher press the side of my boob while wrapping his hands around me. Another actively tried brushing his hands against my bra clasp.

While I was in school, every boy in my class would harass me constantly. Since I had better grades than them, they had no other leverage other than to call me ugly. Imagine being called ugly every day and nobody ever does anything about it.

In college, I was sexually assaulted by a guy who pushed my head towards his penis in order to force me to give him a blow job. I managed to get away.

I have no male friends. Mostly because most of males are Andrew Tate worshippers who despise and disrespect women. Many are alt-right, conservative, pro-life, anti-feminists who believe in traditional gender roles that benefit them (they are suddenly feminists when it comes to splitting bills on dates or hitting women). 

In the light of this, I am genuinely happy being single and alone. I do not see a bright future where I am a significant other towards a male, and I have to cook, clean and labor after a disgusting male, considering how males disrespect the unpaid labor their wives have provided for them.

I actively despise males and I have every reason to. I do not see them as human or equivalent to me. I am an average woman. If this is the average woman experience, I see no reason why misandry should be shunned by society. In fact, we need it. Maybe if women are treated superior to males, males will relent and be willing to accept equality as a truce. 

I wish nothing but the worst on males. They deserve the worst. I would never physically harm a male, because misandry is hate, while misogyny involves acting on that hate. But if I see a male suffering, I will look the other way and stomp all over them. I hope males continue to make light of actual male issues. I hope males die in wars like their deserve. I hope they rot in their own disgusting actions and filth. "
1,2024-03-30,CMV: Movie and TV adaptations should NOT be 100% faithful to the book,u/Pow32,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1brnbt3/cmv_movie_and_tv_adaptations_should_not_be_100/,changemyview,"Every time a movie or TV show adapts a popular book, there's always fans of the book who come out of the woodwork to complain about anything that was changed from the original source material. I think this complaint is completely silly. 


(1) Things have to be changed to fit a different medium. I think this is just common sense for most people, but a lot of people don't seem to get this. The language of cinema is completely different than the language of literature. One conveys information primarily through visuals and sound, the other conveys through words. Some things simply don't directly translate from one to the other. Not only that, but the flow of storytelling is different in each medium. Movies for example are generally designed to be viewed in one sitting from start to finish. They need to keep momentum going the entire time, and therefore often need to cut out any filler and distill the story down to its essence.


(2) If an adaptation is a 1 to 1 copy of a book, then the adaptation has no reason to exist other than making money. If you want a movie to be exactly the same thing as the book, then just read the book. There's zero point in having an adaptation if it's not going to be at least somewhat different and offer a new perspective on the same general story. A good adaptation has to make changes to the source material in order to have its own identity.


(3) Different mediums should play to the strengths of their respective medium. The benefit of a book is that ability to go into more detail and explain a character's thoughts. It's more focused on the plot, characters, and worldbuilding. The benefit of a movie is that it brings together other types of artforms to create a different type of experience. Having great music and cinematography, interesting editing, costumes, sets, etc. "

As a result, non-Jewish Germans turn a blind eye, content that their own lives are safe. If the whole German population (including Jews) were as well armed as the American population, it is unlikely that the holocaust can take place.

Most police and military are unhappy to obey evil commands, like put a large number of innocent people into camps and murder them. Especially if they are fellow citizens as opposed to a foreign enemy. They will be more unwilling to do so if those innocent citizens can band together shoot back. I strongly believe that many non-Jewish Germans would have aided Jews if they had the firepower.

The CMV is not to debate what types of guns were available or existed back then vs now. America's current civilian firepower is enough to prevent a holocaust by the government. CMV."

They could have forgiven the entire $40,000 upon graduation and still be in the black on their ledgers. 

Just to push my argument further, [non-fatal work injuries are negatively correlated with educational attainment](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2006/05/art5full.pdf), so the government invests in a college education and they get a worker that is less likely to take from the coffers via social security disability.

I believe that misandry is a reactionary response, I have never once heard someone claim they are a misandrist who has not experienced at least one instance of brutality from a man, oftentimes a man that exudes misogyny and a lack of respect towards the females autonomy. 

While neither are good, I think misogyny is much more dangerous as the power dynamics in this world clearly favors men, whether that be physically or economically. 

If this were synonymous to which came first the chicken or the egg, I think it is most definitely the case that misogyny came first and misandry has followed. Similar premise to racism and ‘reverse’ racism. If misogyny was somehow solved, I think misandry would be as well.

1. Legalizing marijuana reduces the burden on the legal system and allows them to focus on serious offenses.
2. People have the right to make their own informed decisions. I'm in favor of a legal age (same as drinking or smoking), but legal adults have the right to choose what they do to their bodies.

1,2024-03-30,CMV: A percentage of large properties should legally be required to be used as farmland.,u/saintlybead,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1brplwn/cmv_a_percentage_of_large_properties_should/,changemyview,"As we push towards a more sustainable future, I believe it is essential for the land we have in the United States to be used wisely, morally and efficiently.

According to the [World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/arable-land-by-country), the United States has nearly 400 million acres of arable land, that is, land viable for growing crops. This happens to be the largest amount of arable land in any country *in the world*, to misuse this amount of land, especially as other countries struggle to use the land they do have, is grossly wrong. According to the latest US census, there are 333 million people in the country, meaning we have over an acre of arable land per citizen. The research bounces up and down, but sources suggest the amount of land required to sustain an individual tends to be right around an acre.

I suggest that when a property is purchased, and it contains arable land, if the property is large (this is [legally defined](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/larger-property) as anything over 7.56 acres, which I think is a good definition for this concept but, like all the other elements could be shifted over time to meet needs), at least 1 acre on the property should be used for crop growth, and on increasingly larger properties this required amount of acreage would be proportionate (the sliding scale could be discussed but this implementation isn't the focus of my argument). Ideally, these groups would be provided for free to a local stockpile (perhaps on the town, county, or even city level) to be redistributed as necessary. However, I would be willing to at least start this idea with the possibility of the landowners selling their product back to the state, for profit.

Of course, we come across the issue many will have - ""You expect me to work extra hard to maintain a farm on my land!?"". This is a valid concern, and there is a simple solution - simply employing the market to solve this will create jobs across the country as people who don't want to tend their crops can hire someone who will do it for them.

To enforce this, I propose either property sale is fully forbidden without a legally binding document that states the owner will dedicate part of their property to crop growth, or a tax such that the land owner is required to pay, by vehicle of state or federal taxes, into other government-funded social systems. This tax would be set up such that it is proportional to the amount of land you are misusing. This would be *especially* important in the case of property owners who destroy the arable land (by building a mall on a large plot, etc.), and a higher tax would have to be imposed if the land is in any way permanently made unusable for crop growth. 

Conversely, I think tax breaks or some other form of benefit could be provided to property owners who ""go above and beyond"" in their land use. Landowners who produce a broader variety of highly nutritious crops and/or meat (i.e. through systems like aquaponics with fish should be rewarded for the extra effort they're putting in and in turn the extra benefit they're providing.

It's also important to consider the ecological impact of something like this, and it would be important to focus on crops that require low amounts of water, minimal amounts of intervention and yield high levels of nutrition (beans, quinoa, certain leafy greens, etc. fall into this category).

I would love to further flesh out this idea and am interested in holes I can look at. Please keep the conversation respectful and stick to commenters' points, including mine. Far too many people speak with emotion in these conversations and I'd like to keep it strictly logical and moral. Let's have fun! "

With that said, I see no scenario in which the US’s democracy is toppled or the presidential election is not validated with Joe Biden becoming the 46th President of United States based on actions of the Jan 6th rioters. Those that continue to argue that our democracy was at threatened, or that there was ever a chance for the simpleton rioters to somehow take over our government sound ridiculous. Overhyping this makes people spouting this nonsense look weak as if they are grasping at straws. It’s lowly fear-mongering and nothing more. 

Yes, people broke the law. I have no issues with them being punished. That is not my issue. 

If I am just crazy, please explain to me how the Jan 6th rioters threatened our democracy.


For reference, here is a article that highlights survey data based on Jan 6th. There are a significant number of Americans that claim our democracy was threatened. I’m not making it up.

This failure of a creation looks like a straight, horizontal line tried to transform into the letter “C”, but did not have the required amount of strength to rotate the correct way because it realized that it was a failure. It looks like “W” separated into two and had a genetic mutation that caused “U” to come into existence. It looks like an uncompleted circle. It looks like a failure of a half-circle. It looks like a lazy oval. It looks like an artist was going to draw a smiley face, but the sight of this monstrosity made them stop. “U” looks like agony, pain, and failure.

Only when this symbol of the alphabet is out of view can one exceed life’s expectations and experience true happiness.  
Point 2:  
The letter “W” is vocalized as “Double-U”, but it should not be dragged into “U”’s dark void of misery.  
Point 3:  
Yes, the design of “U” has remained static since ancient times, but times have changed. This excuse of a letter represents the negative emotions and feelings that one cannot form with words, for what misery and torture that they are being forced to experience may only be visible to the eye in physical form through this godforsaken excuse of a letter. The only way to save it is to help it transfigure into something less vile.

My view is simple, the toothpick serves the purpose of keeping the sandwich aligned from the time it's created to being in front of you. When it goes to your table, the toothpick should be removed. Why do you need to remove it?

What if you don't notice there is one because the sandwich is very tall? I've had that happen and nearly badly hurt myself.

Why do you have to deal with the trashed toothpick? If you're dining with small kids you don't want sharp stuff like that anywhere near them.

Notice, I didn't say anything about knives. Some places will serve a burger with a knife through the middle. That's great! It keeps the sandwich aligned AND is extremely visible to the customer AND provides utility.

We have people who can't write English properly threatening businesses for extortion money. 

Honestly everything is just absurd and the whole problem is so obvious mathematically, I can only conclude that those responsible for these policies are literal traitors especially with all the China espionage that goes unpunished, this is corruption based on monied and foreign countries interests that's the only explanation for these policies and those responsible need to be held legally accountable and face decades in prison at the least execution at the most depending what they find. 

The deportation need to happen but those people don't need to face any kind of punishment, they just need to leave and never come back, it's the only thing we can do to cool the fire in the meantime and there's no point in keeping people in the country who can't even renew their visa."

This will be my first time casting a vote in a presidential election. In 2022 I voted Democrat across the ballot, and in the 2024 primaries last month I voted for Nikki Haley. I was still undecided as to whether or not I should vote for Trump or Biden but I was leaning towards Biden. However, even though I couldn't stand him last year, I've lately found myself wanting to vote for Robert Kennedy.

I'm a premedical student majoring in Public Health. I abhor Kennedy's stance on vaccines and a lot of other things. I thought of him as nothing more than a fringe candidate who would sap votes from Jill Stein. But as time goes on, even though I disagree with him, I'm beginning to believe that he is the only one who actually cares. He's the only candidate that has discussed the crisis affecting young people. If I can successfully get through these next few years of my career, I know I'll be good to go. But I don't know how other people my age are coping. I've lost multiple peers/friends to suicide and even more to alcoholism and drug abuse because there's simply no hope.

Biden and Trump are too preoccupied with Ukraine/Israel and their own health and legal problems. Neither one of them seems to care about the fact that Generation Z is collapsing in on itself. We were an integral part of the coalition that sent Joe Biden to the White House and he has had four years to help us. His student loan forgiveness plan was a joke. Kennedy is the only one actually talking about reducing the cost of tuition to protect us & future generations from predatory college lending. Biden wants to forgive our debt so we can go into more debt.  Kennedy, meanwhile, is talking about fixing the economy so that blue-collar workers can once again support a family.

Perhaps what gets on my very last nerve is when Biden and his supporters claim that Trump is a threat to Democracy (he probably is but that's a separate debate) while the real threat to Democracy is isolating us from voting for a 3rd party. People have fought and died so that I could vote for whoever I want. That's the true power of a democracy.

So please, tell me why Biden & Harris or Trump & Whoever deserves my vote more than Kennedy & Shanahan."

Any study ever done that attempted to conduct numbers by gender tends to go purely off baseless claims with no substantial way to prove these accusations are accurate.

Also, I feel like it's harder to men to define what they consider *rape* from a woman. I also feel like men don't come out as much about SA because of the stigma our society is built on surrounding ""being a man"" and because of how biased our legal system is in their topic with gender roles.

But I don't think this would solve almost any of the issues that they have with birth control?

Say someone made a pill for men, basically the same as the one for women. 

Let's assume it's no safer, because if they could make it safer than why not just make a safer one for women first? (Ignoring the fact that it's much much much harder to make a male pill than female since preventing an egg from being fertilized is much easier than making every sperm cell in trillions infertile in the testes without also lower testerone)

When would it be useful? Not for any short term relationships. If you met a dude on tinder and he told you ""yeah let's go raw I'm on the pill"" would you believe him? Of course fucking not. So it's useless here.

Long Term Relationships: You're just shifting the symptoms, and for the worse. From a female pill with decades behind in to a new one for men. This solves nothing except now the symptoms changed carriers.

The most common argument is: he's the one that wants raw sex not me, I don't care either way: but in that case, why the fuck are you even together?

You're clearly not sexually compatible, would it not be in your best interests to find someone who enjoys sex the same way you do, namely, with a condom, and avoid all this?

So; the pill for men basically only helps couples in a long term relationship, where they don't want kids but might want it in the future, where the woman doesn't want to take the pill, the man is willing to take it, and they think the symptoms are better than having to have sex with a condom, and the man is not willing to get a vasectomy. 

Surely, this is not a huge market? Like. What concerns does this new pill actually solve?

Smartphones have any function a casual user needs.

Yes, there's a lot of need for advanced features as well, but let's eyeball it and say 10% of people actually use them. No need to show those features to casual users.

Android and other smartphone operating systems are proof you CAN create a computer that isn't overcomplicated as crap.

Windows 10 and 11 being cluttered messes is an obvious fact.

It's not only modern programs. I was watching a YouTube video recently, about a guy programming Mandarin characters for an old MacIntosh computer. Apparently, pixels on screen weren't in order. He had to write a formula into his program to actually modify a cluster of pixels at x and y coordinates. Why.

When I tried to code, I noticed a lot of problems.  To code in Python, for example, you need to install Python. You use an .exe file, and choose a folder where it is installed. It's activated either via command line, or via a coding environment. No big deal yet.

Now, installing libraries. You have pip, which accesses the internet in most backwards way possible. Why the fuck can't you download library  archive from some website, and drag and drop it into some folder, like a Minecraft texture pack?

I know there are libraries that use other libraries, also they get updated regularly. All that's difficult to do manually. Again, make a program with fucking buttons, like an antivirus mixed with Google Play. [Browse libraries], [download], [update] tabs in fucking windows. Command line feature might remain, but not all of us are coding on a Samsung fridge.

GitHub, for example. Developers should buy any third party ***mind mapping*** program (google it), and add visualization of all backups as a flowchart directly into your website. No wonder nobody knows how to use GitHub, you need to literally use command line, and imagine when you have backups and when you don't, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE IT. Window and fucking buttons please.

I saw some Blender tutorials. (Those are made up names, but) you go through [tesselation > shitfuck > random_option_9 > smoothenings > quadratic > halfquadratic] in order to smooth down one of three oddly specific cases for who spheres overlapping. Instead of memorizing all that shit, A FUCKING SEARCH BAR should have been used. Type ""quadratic"" (in this made up case) and select ""half quadratic"" from drop down. You still have to memorize it, but not all options before it lol.

And no, such search function that definitely exists in Blender, but is buried under five menus with buttons so small you need microscope to press them, does not count. Needs to be a big fat search bar on top of the program window, with trillion lines of text all over the screen, that show trillion sub options each when pressed, should be  erased from screen. Nobody who doesn't know a specific option, is gonna find it intuitively anyway. Empty search bar should show all categories, and that's all.

It's like every single program creates as high entry barrier as possible."

1,2024-03-30,CMV: It's wrong to lie to children about holiday characters like the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus,u/franzfulan,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1brurs3/cmv_its_wrong_to_lie_to_children_about_holiday/,changemyview,"Here is a plausible moral principle: *It is wrong to lie for trivial reasons*. This principle would explain a lot. It explains why lying tends to be wrong in ordinary cases, but also why it would not necessarily be wrong to lie to the Nazi at your door who asks you if there are Jews hiding in your attic. However, it has an interesting consequence. If it is wrong to lie for trivial reasons, then it seems like it is wrong to lie to children about the existence of various holiday characters, like Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny. When parents tell such lies to their children, they typically do so for utterly trivial reasons, e.g., because it creates fun for the family, it gives the child a sense of wonder, etc. This seems morally wrong.

The defender of this practice, as far as I can tell, has two ways to respond to this problem, and neither of them are plausible. On the one hand, you can deny that it is wrong to lie for trivial reasons. However, this is a tough bullet to bite. For you will need to come up with an alternative constraint on lying which explains why it would be okay to lie to one’s children about, say, the existence of the Easter Bunny, but not okay for one to just lie all the time whenever it is convenient, which seems obviously wrong. And that is difficult to do.

One option is: *It is wrong to lie when it causes serious harm*. This principle perhaps explains why lying about the Easter Bunny is not wrong. For such lies invariably cause little harm if any at all. However, this will not do, for causing harm is not the only feature that may make an act of lying wrong. If a person lies to their spouse in order to cover up an affair, and the spouse never finds out about either the deception or about the affair, no harm was done, but the lie was still very wrong. 

What is most wrong about lying is that (1) it is a way of using someone as a mere means, and (2) it is a form of betrayal: the liar solicits someone’s trust and then willfully betrays it. Of course, a child may not typically *feel* used or betrayed once they find out that Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny is not real. However, whether someone does or does not *feel* wronged by some action is irrelevant to the question of whether they were actually wronged by it. That is a matter of fact which is no more up to their opinion than anyone else’s. So, for example, a person with low self-esteem may not feel wronged if someone demeans and insults them, but they are simply mistaken. Obviously, lying to one’s children about innocent holiday characters does not wrong them so very much, but it’s still a form of wronging them, however minor.

Alternatively, the defender of these practices may want to deny that lies about holiday characters are lies done for trivial reasons. So maybe you think that there are just some really good reasons to lie to one’s children about the existence of Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny. However, it’s not clear what these reasons could possibly be. Lying seems most obviously right when it is done to save a life or to prevent great harms, as in the case of lying to the Nazi at the door. However, lying cannot be done to avert just *any* great harm or to achieve just *any* great good. The adulterous spouse still acts wrongly when they lie to cover up their affair, even if part of the reason why they lie is to preserve their marriage for the sake of their children. So, even if you think that these holiday lies are somehow really beneficial to children, it’s not clear how that is supposed to justify them.

So, I just can’t see any plausible way out of this problem. But I wouldn't mind having my opinion changed on this. I don’t have any personal investment in this conclusion, and it would be nice if this fun cultural practice was not somehow wrong. Upon reflection it just seems so to me."

Even with the legal statues, the process was extremely difficult, and the amount of time it takes is unbelievable. Ive also been working in construction in the US for 10+ years and have worked with and currently work with many undocumented immigrants (illegal immigrants). 

Speaking to and understanding countless immigrants stories Ive come to realize a solution to Americas “immigration problem”. We should charge for it! (Now before you yell at me here me out) 

Every person I’ve spoken to who has came here “illegally” and “legally” ( 100s over the years) have explained to me the desperation and hardships took to get here especially for the ones who come here illegally. The average amount a person has to spend for the coyotes/guides and travel costs is upwards of $10,000 US dollars and this comes with the risk the the coyotes/guides will just steal your money, rob/assault you and your family, and also includes and extremely dangerous trip that may kill you and this all may be for nothing if you get captured by the border patrol and sent back. IMO this is because of our terrible process of becoming legal that could take upwards of 10 years (if ever) with all the proper paper work and information/work needed while you and your family suffer.  

My solution is for the US to hire a massive amount of immigration officers to help streamline US citizenship but also charge for it for example $5000 (as this is half the cost of a going rate of a “guide”) to get here illegally. If we charged AND streamlined the service America would solve most of our debt and the cartel/illegal drug trade (as cartels make alot of their money charging these people and also forcing many to carry drugs across with them as a bonus). The mass of legal citizens to our workforce would also increase in taxes and business creation. This would also kill the cartels in their tracks as the need for regular people to cross illegally would be obsolete. 

America was born as an immigrate state and america should profit from that ideal that I believe still holds strong. Immigration is what made this country great and it is what will make this country last for the future.

It would be really nice if we could change these narcoterrorists into upstanding citizens that pay their taxes via interpretive dance programs and lots of hugs and compassion that these criminal justice advocates seem to think will work, but that just ain’t the case. The “soft” policies of restorative justice work as a *preventative*, **not** a solution. If you’re dealing with crime like you are in a place like NYC or LA, it’s already too late, let alone in a place like El Salvador where gangs are actively undermining the legitimacy of its sovereign government. You need these animals off the street first. No public safety for the public, no economy for the public to spend in, no economy to spend in means no jobs for people to make money in, no ways to make money leads people to take to a life of crime.

All of those things together can be addressed by softer, more restorative practices. But only after the immediate threat of the gangs are removed. So until then, I understand why El Salvadorans would be fine with that abridgment of criminals rights for the greater good. While we’re on the subject of rights though, why is it these reformers/activists only crop up for the criminals? Why is it **their** rights are the only one that matters? Having a lawyer and getting a fair trial are indeed important, some say fundamental, rights to any self-respecting republic but you know what else is a right? Not being robbed when you go to work. Not getting pressed into service as a gang member or a sex slave. Not being beaten or shot because you pissed off a member of MS-13 who was just feeling petty that day.

Where are the activists for these guys? Where are the activists for the average joe? Why do their rights come second to a criminals? People, regardless of country, creed or class hate freeloaders. People that don’t play by the rules while also actively making your life harder. If the polls are to be believed, and I’m not speaking for El Salvador as a whole, then most of the public seems to approve the measures taken. That’s what the activists are missing in their jeremiads against the abstract violation of rights, people who play by the rules and do their best to live honestly aren’t going to weep for members of the paramilitary organization that shakes down their neighborhood or threatens their lives and the lives of their family members.

You’re still entitled to believe the conduct of Bukele and his hired goons are repugnant and morally abominable but I think more activists should at least consider why, from the perspective someone on the living that reality, why they’d support it and whether there is any solution to a problem as ugly as narcoterrorism that doesn’t involve *some* innocent people getting hurt."

It seems that some superhero fans are always super impressed with how edgy heroes and anti-heroes are, and whether they’re ok with killing, or how good they are at it (Deadpool, Punisher… can’t think of a third one, comment if you feel like sharing one)

The way I see it, it’s way more impressive when a hero says they won’t kill. If you kill someone the fight is over forever, but if you don’t you have to both subdue them and keep them subdued, which seems way harder in my opinion. It also seems unethical to have an unelected vigilante playing judge and executioner, if you want Joker to die, vote as a citizen in a democracy for a policy that can make it happen.

On the other hand, some seem to be really impressed at Deadpool and stuff, and all the slicing and dicing and backflips. Also on the other hand (thinking utilitarianly) maybe it’s unethical to let someone like Joker live, because his life continuing ends the lives of others in the future.

75,2024-03-30,cmv: Suicide Rates Among the Youth are going up due to a Negative Outlook on the Future,u/DeadLantern-,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bs14do/cmv_suicide_rates_among_the_youth_are_going_up/,changemyview,"For this viewpoint, I am speaking for suicide rates in the US, which have grown tremendously among the youth, accompanying a ""mental health crisis"" for Gen-Z and adjacent generations. But, as far as I am aware, suicide among youths is increasing everywhere.

The world is certainly generally better than how it was in the 1960s and before, but it would be difficult to argue that the world in 2014 or 2004 was worse than the world in 2024 (on average, in the developed world). Additionally, it would be even *more* difficult to argue that the outlook of the future from 2004 or 2014 is better than the outlook of the future in 2024.

The future from the eyes of 2024 looks grim. We are 90 seconds to midnight. Global warming presents an existential danger to humanity and Earth that our leaders are doing frustratingly little about. Conflicts are erupting across the world and, due to social media and the news cycle, we are constantly looped in about the suffering that collective humanity is going through.

I think a grim outlook is bipartisan, as well. Young conservatives fear that woke-ism is taking over the United States and that we are losing the moral fabric keeping our nation united, creating problems and weakness for the future--men are being left behind, and endeavors in ""equality"" are destroying the lives of average, everyday Americans. Likewise, liberals are witnessing the democratic structures of this government being torn apart with the dangerous actions of proto-fascists (like with project 2025). Economic inequality is getting worse and we are doing nothing to prevent it, all the while, the people oppressed face the brunt of the storm we are in. There are also things that affect all young people--rising costs of higher education, higher costs of living, increased pollution etc.

The world looks like it's on a downward trend with no signs of stopping. Of course, increased talk about mental health contributes to a higher prevalence of mental illness among youth just because the topic is less stigmatized, but this should not also create higher suicide rates; if anything, it should lower them. Instead, we are seeing suicides among adolescents more and more, despite mental health initiatives.

The only conclusion I can draw from this is that young people are committing suicide because the future they stand to inherit is a difficult, awful one, alongside all the problems people face in life (trauma, poverty, abuse, loneliness, etc). Why continue living in a world that will only continue to go down the drain? There's no hope to be found. Is there another story to this, or can the perceived worsening state of the world be attributed to rising suicide among Gen Z (and those younger or slightly older)? "

The IDF constantly commits attacks against Palestinians , Lebanese and Syrians with the Political aim of Eradicating Iranian-Backed Militias (I.e, there have been an uncountable number of white phosphorus attacks committed by The IDF in Gaza and Southern Lebanon, and they constantly bomb Damascus killing dozens of Civilians).

I hold this view because in my opinion The CIA and IDF fit the definition of Terrorist Organizations perfectly.

My view may change if you can explain how they don’t attack civilians."

 ",u/Opposite-Craft-3498,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bs22pq/cmv_i_believe_paternity_tests_should_be_mandatory/,changemyview,"  So apparently if you are married legally, whatever child your wife has is assumed by the state to be the husband's, and therefore the husband is legally responsible for them. Like, a woman can get pregnant and the husband could be deployed in Iraq for the army at the time, and there is no way he could have physically gotten her pregnant. If they went to court, the woman could just say, according to the law, they're my husband's, and if they were to get divorced, he could still be forced to pay child support even though they are not his. As well, if a woman had an affair and, let's say, the husband found out a year later that he was not the real father, he would still be legally responsible for them. If they got divorced, he would still be forced to pay child support for another man's child. The same if an unmarried man signs a birth certificate and acknowledges because he did not have doubts or was told by the woman that it was his, he is basically now legally responsible for that child regardless if it's his or not. Like if later he finds out that it wasn't his and tries to get out of child support, the state will say, ""Well, you signed it; you're the father; somebody has to take care of that child and it's gonna be you,"" and he would still be forced to pay child support for a child that he did not father. There are pretty much no legal incentives or consequences for the woman to be honest about who the father or potential fathers are. Basically, a woman could just sleep with a bunch of dudes, not know who the real father is, and pick and choose the man she wants, trick him into signing the birth certificate, and she got her child support; if later the man finds out she was dishonest, there are basically no consequences for her.It is also bad because if the father who is not the real father signs the birth certificate he is basically depriving the legal rights the actual father has to that child .There are states where signing the birth certificate also waives your right as a man to get a DNA test. Of course, a man, if he is not married, could insist a woman get a DNA test after she gets pregnant, regardless if they are in a relationship or a one night stand, that he will not sign the birth certificate until he gets a DNA test to prove he is the father. Which women get offended by but should have a right, just like the woman, to know that the child he will be supporting is actually his.Because the law does not really protect the man.Why are the poltical reasons the law is like this I assume that states want to protect themselves from having to to pay for this child so they just pass in on whoever might be the father even regardless if it they are or not.

So the tracks could potentially be 3500miles long or around 2800 miles depending on the stops. 
The new Shinkansen currently under construction in Japan has a operating top speed of 310 mph. 

So in ideal but somewhat realistic conditions it would take between 9.5 and 12 hours from city center to City Center plus some time to where you want to be which shouldn't take too long.

A flight from la to ny takes 6h plus check in and TSA (~2h, might be faster) plus taxi and baggage collection (~45 min) plus getting where you want to be in the city which probably takes a bit longer than the train since the airport are somewhat outside of the city (+30 min for getting to and from the airports). 
That is 9h15min. 

Now that is still faster than the train but the train gives much more comfort and luxury. This can be especially important for people who need to work during these kinds of commuts. 

Additionally for people living not at the coasts the train will be even more attractive.

Although the title sais other, the us should not just spend billions because this crappy analysis is somewhat positive. But the us should definitely consider it. It might have a huge impact on climate and connecting more rural areas to the coasts."

4. What it is for.

Aside from three, which is my original objection, of course the universe has these causes (although we can easily get into some Spinoza territory)!

My argument for the free market is that it is ethical. 
Making alcohol and tobacco expensive will not stop people from using it.
If tobacco and alcohol are expensive, people will simply buy them on the black market, which is harmful and dangerous to health, and which the criminal world can profit from.
Also, if the price of alcohol and tobacco decreases after the abolition of excise taxes, people will spend the saved money on other things like food, clothing, and services.
A huge amount of money is freed up and goes into more useful industries, which stimulates the economy.
So the price of tobacco and alcohol products should not be regulated through excise taxes. 

Another thing is, of course, business subsidies, especially the meat industry. Vegans, of course, talk a lot about the unethical nature of meat consumption. But what they don’t understand and what not to talk about is that instead of banning meat, it is enough to simply cancel subsidies, as a result of which huge corporations will simply not be profitable and the production of meat products will be decentralized, redistributed throughout the country and the quantity of meat products will decrease, while simultaneously increasing its quality.

I can say exactly the same thing about ending subsidies for the auto industry, especially electric vehicles. Environmentalists nowadays talk a lot about caring for the environment, but in fact, by subsidizing electric cars and giving their owners all sorts of discounts on electricity, they are playing a bad game, going against their own interests in preserving the environment. 

Be it consumption of tobacco, meat, electricity, etc. I believe that from an ethical point of view there is nothing better than a free market where prices will be set by producers and will not be regulated by the state."

I'd love to hear some compelling arguments to challenge my viewpoint and maybe help me see things differently.

Let's start with consciousness. It's a mind-bending notion to consider that our perception of consciousness might not be as straightforward as it seems. Think about it: every sensation we experience, every thought we have, is processed by our brains. But what if this intricate processing is all there is to it? What if there's no real ""consciousness"" behind it all, just the firing of neurons and the interplay of chemicals? It's a concept that challenges our very sense of self and raises profound questions about the nature of reality.

Now, onto determinism. This idea suggests that every event, including human actions, is determined by preceding events and the laws of nature. In other words, the future is already set in stone, and we're just going through the motions. This notion can be deeply unsettling, as it seems to strip us of our agency and free will. After all, if everything is predetermined, do our choices really matter?

Some might argue that our sense of free will is just an illusion, a trick of the mind that makes us feel like we're in control when we're really not. Our decisions and actions might seem spontaneous, but they could be nothing more than the result of countless deterministic processes unfolding in our brains.

Of course, these ideas are not without controversy. Many people find comfort in the belief that they are the masters of their own destinies, that their choices truly matter. And while we can't definitively prove or disprove the existence of consciousness or free will, exploring these concepts can lead to some truly thought-provoking discussions about the nature of reality and our place in it.

So, can anyone change my view? I'm open to hearing different perspectives and engaging in a constructive debate on these topics."

Firstly, I have had teachers like her. They were some of the most amazing teachers I have ever been taught by. They were strict, which allows me to follow discipline. They even taught in a theoretical manner, which makes it easier for my hippocampus to store the information taught, since it is taught in a tangible manner, unlike practical experiments, where one has to observe each and every detail lest they accidentally miss a detail. However, she is polite as well, which is a quality that I unfortunately still seek from my teachers, which is what would make them better. Her punishment of extracting blood from Harry's arm was a bit too cruel, and she could have just beat them instead, but she could have been given a warning for that. The same thing applies to the racism.

Secondly, she is an amazing teacher! She takes time to deal with each and every student! An example of this is when she sits with Harry for hours allowing him to enact his punishment! If she goes to such great lengths for this, then surely she will do the same for struggling students, right? Chotte Shamaldas Chanchad once said ""I was teaching you how to teach. I hope that you will learn one day, because unlike you, I never abandon my weak students"". Moreso, she saves teenagers from their hormones and prevents them from ruining their lives via not allowing the opposite sex to be within 6"" of each other! She goes out of her way to enforce this!

Finally, the students had to prepare for their Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations. The results of these examinations can control the rest of the life of the students, akin to the Joint Entrance Examination or the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering. Therefore, making the students stressed was justified. However, there was a safe space in her office for students to talk about their problems, which is what a lot of students studying in coaching students in Kota do not have, which causes a lot of suicides over there. Moreso, she prevents the rest of the students from getting into trouble with Voldemort, since the death eaters did not have a grudge against them. Moreso, she had to follow orders, and therefore, could not protect Harry. 

Therefore, Umbridge should not have been kicked out of Hogwarts."

I know there are other factors to consider like children for example, as children can sometimes be the cause of the divorce, however even M to M marriage who have kids (adopted or IVF) have a lesser rate of divorce.

A 2022 study of Norway, using data up to 2018, found that divorce rates 20 years post-marriage were 5% lower for male-male marriages compared to male-female marriages and were 29% higher for female-female marriages vs female-male marriages

In denmark the divorce rate for opposite sex couples is 46% for male-male marriage it's 14%

Another factor to consider is religion. Some straight marriages are forced, parents for religious reasons want to marry their children young so they arrange a marriage and then as the couple grows older they realize that they are not compatible so it increases the divorce rate."

And/or how kids can can have so much audacity, be so disrespectful/disruptive and have no filter. Usually a lot of the blame for that is attributed to parents. I have observed two opposite extremes of ""It is is because of the gentle parenting and child centre households having no discipline."" And also (this is usually on AITA) ""too much punishment and no talking about *why*""

I am studying sociology, I can't help but think that what can probably now be considered *too much* media socialisation could actually be the culprit for a lot of annoying behaviours. I am not saying this is all bad, or that the way things were before were good but prior to social media, parents, as long as their kids trusted them had a decent amount of control over what their kids were allowed to be exposed to. There was familial socialisation, Educational socialisation, peer group socialisation, maybe religious socialisation and a moderate amount of media socialisation (the TV, comics, the library etc.)

So, if you're family didn't want you to swear and so didn't swear in front of or at you, and nobody swore in your educational setting(s), and you were friends with a group of kids who were from families with similar morals and the same school setting, they are probably not going to swear in front of you either. Swearing uncensored was (is?) not allowed on TV until after most kids would have bene in bed. You could potentially hit double digits without discovering swearing. Ignorance is bliss, see no evil, whatever you want to call it. But now with Tictok and YouTube, you will probably hear it before you hear the word pencil case. 

Same with drugs. If no one in your family or school told you drugs existed, and you were in a good peer group, how were you going to discover drugs? You could not know they existed until you were old enough to have enough reliable sense not to use them. But now you can read all about them online. Not just the bad, but the percieved good as well. 

The peer group would have been the biggest threat to that morality, if you made friends with someone who was from a home were drug use by their parents was the norm, they could introduce you to it, for example. Now, the media is *at least* just as much of a threat, but probably 10 times worse. It might not be the parents fault. They could be trying to instill morality into their kids but there is literally only so much they can control about what their kids are exposed to nowadays. 

They cannot *really* control what their kids view on social media. In theory you could use parental controls, but then you become that tyrant, helicopter parent. You could take your kids phone and look their search history, but then when you give it back, your kids would probably come across something like [this](https://letgrow.org/teen-phone-monitoring/) to throw back at you. (I am personally against searching through kids phones, but that might be because I am still closer to having been a kid than becoming a parent myself.)

Or any time you try to do something which may have even minor controversy surrounding it, like that scene from Megan were the aunt is making Katie eat her vegetables and the Alexa like robot spews parenting advice at her about how you have to give kids a choice or they will develop a bad relationship with healthy food. Neither of those things are ""wrong"". I imagine parenting is very similar to sociology in the sense that are usually many right answers and only a few which are objectively ""wrong"". But kids aren't supposed to know how to parent. It is supposed to be an adult's job. With the parent being an adult and their child being, a child. But with social media, if a parent and their child have a disagreement over something like that, the child could probably find some ""proof"" in no time about why whatever their parent did, [such as taking their phone away](https://childmind.org/article/when-should-you-come-between-a-teenager-and-her-phone/#:~:text=Phones%20have%20become%20how%20teens,when%20you%20aren't%20looking.) was ""wrong"". 

Now of course it is not always the media. There are still plenty of parents who simply are not very very good at parenting and *are* to blame. I really suspect the media is as much to blame, if not a little moreso than parents are in a lot of cases. If people who work in schools, youth setting as well as members of the general public think the behaviour of late Gen Y, Gen Z and Gen Alpha kids is bad, the parents are probably getting it twenty times worse at home with little they can do to permanently resolve it. Taking the internet away for a few days or a week after the fact is a bandaid on a bullet hole, treating a symptom rather than the cause. But as I said above, there is little that can be done about said cause without stepping into authoritarian/helicopter parenting."

I think this is too hopeful of a statement, like saying we will have world peace in ten years. 

Woman are so dangerously hyper sexualised and always have been, and so going into it for “empowerment” doesn't feel sincere to me. Financial freedom is definitely empowering but not the how it's been achieved. Our self worth is tied to many things, one of them being how we spend are time and earn a living. Of course this isn't the case for everyone but it is for many. 

Because with sex work, while the money side may be empowering, the act itself is not. Not if you are happy with people valuing your worth based off your genitals and animal nature. Something we all possess and didn't need to work for. 

  
I am sure there are people reading this ready to write in the comments how judgemental I am, and perhaps thats true. I really don't mean to come across that way. I do respect peoples decision to go into the sex industry and not telling anyone not to do it. I am just wondering if there's anyone who can truly say that having sex with strangers and in front of a camera crew is something respectful, or if its societies pressure to be ""woke"" that makes people feel inclined to hold something that women have always been shamed for by so many men as respectful out of sympathy. 

What I am saying isn’t so much my truth, but the truth of most peoples. Since humanity has existed, sexism towards women has existed on a much greater scale than sexism towards men. There are many ways to claim power without going into something that you wouldn't want your own children to do if you spent 18 years providing them with everything you can for a good life.

1. Immigration. Since the global fertility rate is well above replacement rate, it makes sense to bring in people from the Global South to keep the workforce and tax receipts sustainable for an aging population.

2. Economic incentives. I wish this works but plenty of countries have tried this model but it's not really working, like the Nordic countries, Korea and Japan. Plus, I do not think that this model is sustainable in the long run because it is an incredibly expensive model that will cost taxpayers even more down the road.

3. Cultural shift. Essentially rowing back on our understanding of feminism and family values, kind of like Israel's ultra-orthodox community, which managed to keep Israel's fertility rate at 3.00 births per woman. This is an immoral and impossible solution because there is no way half the voter base will accept turning themselves into baby factories.

4. AI and Robot. The idea that automation and AI will replace human labour to the point where society no longer needs human workers to sustain itself is ludicrous and a pipedream. No revolution in technology has moved us in that direction even one bit, so there's no reason to believe the next one will. Plus, when will it be realised? 50 years? That's well too late to bet our society's sustainability on.

So the way I see it, immigration is the only economical, practical, and ethnical solution out there."

2,2024-03-31,CMV: Injustice Superman was the true victim of Injustice and deserves a redemption arc,u/JoshuaKpatakpa04,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bsequ7/cmv_injustice_superman_was_the_true_victim_of/,changemyview,"Yeah I said it I 100% believe Injustice Superman should get a redemption arc whenever the next Injustice game or comic comes out. When I look at Injustice Superman I find rather to a victim of the whole thing and he got fucked over hard, by everything. Personally I feel bad for the guy despite of all the horrible things he's done and I don't defend his bad actions at all but I'm going to explain why I believe he deserves redemption lets begin.  
  
First lets start of with the tragedy Injustice Superman's wife Lois Lane was kidnapped by Joker and Harley Quinn. The two clowns then performed a surgery where they placed a small timer in her heart linked with a nuclear bomb that was located in Metropolis. If Lois heart stopped beating the nuke would go off, and later Superman finds her but got intoxicated with fear gas by the Joker and Harley and Superman saw Lois as Doomsday. So Superman sends Lois up into space orbit which gets Lois killed. Once the fear gas rules off Superman sees Lois Lane and since she's dead the Nuke in Metropolis goes off. The full causalities of the nuke going off in metropolis was 11 million people, Harley Quinn and Joker killed over ten million people. Imagine being in Superman's shoes you have just been intoxicated by the Joker and Harley Quinn seeing your wife as Doomsday. You take her up to space and then you realise, your wife isn't the monster and you just killed her then two evil murders nuke your city killing pretty much everyone. All of that would make anyone go drastic to ensure something like that never happens again furthermore it's been proven PTSD can fuck up people for the worst.  
  
Secondly lets talk about Injustice Harley Quinn because she is very controversial as she is a perpetrator of kick starting the series. Injustice Harley Quinn aided the Joker kidnapping Lois Lane, placing the timer in her heart and setting the nuke to go off. Yet despite being a catalyst for everything in Injustice happening, Injustice Batman and his insurgency takes her under their wing and she goes through a whole bullshit redemption arc. To make it worse Injustice Harley Quinn never took responsibility or accountability for her actions in one comic run she even says Superman was supposed to stop them and save the day, which just sounds disgusting. People also love to complain how Superman killed Billy Batson a child just remember Injustice Harley killed 11 million people among those people were innocent children yet none brings that up. So if Injustice Harley could get a redemption arc why can't her victim Superman too.  
  
Thirdly there Injustice Wonder Woman another vice that lead to the downfall, Injustice Wonder Woman was the small little devil that kept manipulating Superman. Any time Superman would refrain from killing people or doing harm Injustice Wonder Woman was there to plunge him further down the dark path. Superman was in a weak mental state yet Wonder Woman kept fucking with him further and making things worse. Its even said by Scarecrow that in Injustice 2 when confronting Wonder Woman with her nightmare that she turned Superman that he wasn't supposed to be.  
  
Although it was twisted and mangled he still valued and protected mankind from harm even when he was a tyrant. An example being when Kalibak from Apokolips launched an invasion on earth Superman killed the despotic soldier and killed every Parademon on earth saving the day. He even stops crime and brings world peace pretty making the world a better place.  
  
Then theres Injustice Batman one of my least favourite versions of Batman, Injustice Batman failed Superman. After Superman killed the Joker, he went into the Fortress of Solitude to get himself together. Batman foolishly expected his co worker to immediately get over the death and be the same man which is just dumb considering what Injustice Superman went through is absolutely abhorrent. In addition to this Injustice Batman kept egging on Injustice Superman in the beginning rather than get him help instead.  
  
I repeat I do not support Injustice Supermans actions later down the years but I want to have a redemption arc because he is the true victim of the whole series."
1,2024-03-31,CMV: It was 6 million,u/Most_Pen8235,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bsf403/cmv_it_was_6_million/,changemyview,"The Holocaust stands as one of the darkest chapters in human history, characterized by the systematic genocide of millions of innocent individuals, primarily Jews, by the Nazi regime during World War II. Central to understanding the magnitude of this atrocity is the widely accepted estimate that approximately six million Jews perished during the Holocaust. However, despite the overwhelming consensus among historians and scholars, some individuals continue to question the accuracy of this figure. In this discussion, I aim to explore the evidence supporting the estimate of six million deaths in the Holocaust and address common objections to this number.

Scholarly Consensus

One of the pillars supporting the estimate of six million Jewish deaths in the Holocaust is the broad consensus among historians and scholars specializing in Holocaust studies. This consensus has been reached through decades of meticulous research, analysis of archival documents, survivor testimonies, and demographic studies. Holocaust historians, such as Raul Hilberg, Lucy Dawidowicz, and Christopher Browning, among others, have extensively documented the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime and the scale of the genocide.

Moreover, leading academic institutions and organizations dedicated to Holocaust research, such as the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Yad Vashem, and the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, endorse the estimate of six million Jewish victims. These institutions have conducted comprehensive research, curated extensive archives, and provided educational resources to commemorate the victims and educate future generations about the Holocaust.

Documentary Evidence

Despite the efforts of the Nazi regime to conceal their crimes, a substantial amount of documentary evidence has survived, providing irrefutable proof of the genocide. These documents include records from concentration camps, deportation lists, census data, Nazi correspondence, and eyewitness accounts. For example, the meticulous record-keeping by Nazi bureaucrats, such as the extensive documentation from Auschwitz-Birkenau, provides detailed insights into the logistics of mass murder.

Furthermore, the testimonies of Nazi officials during post-war trials, such as the Nuremberg Trials, corroborate the systematic nature of the Holocaust and the deliberate intent to annihilate European Jewry. The convergence of multiple sources of documentary evidence leaves little room for doubt regarding the scale and scope of the genocide.

Demographic Analysis

Demographic studies conducted by scholars and researchers have played a crucial role in estimating the number of Jewish victims of the Holocaust. By analyzing pre-war population figures, post-war census data, immigration records, and other demographic indicators, researchers have arrived at estimates that align closely with the figure of six million.

For example, the work of demographer Jacob Lestschinsky, who pioneered the study of Jewish population dynamics, provided valuable insights into the demographic impact of the Holocaust. Lestschinsky’s research, along with subsequent studies by scholars such as Sergio DellaPergola and Wolfgang Benz, has contributed to our understanding of the scale of Jewish losses during the Holocaust.

Survivor Testimonies

The testimonies of Holocaust survivors offer invaluable firsthand accounts of the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime. While survivor testimonies alone cannot provide precise numerical data, they provide a human dimension to the historical record, conveying the suffering, resilience, and loss experienced by millions of individuals and families.

Survivor testimonies, documented in oral history projects, memoirs, and interviews, offer harrowing descriptions of life in ghettos, deportation trains, concentration camps, and death marches. These testimonies serve as a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of unimaginable adversity and bear witness to the horrors of the Holocaust.

Objections and Responses

Despite the overwhelming evidence supporting the estimate of six million Jewish deaths in the Holocaust, some individuals continue to question or deny this figure. Common objections include claims of exaggeration, lack of comprehensive records, variability in estimates, and political motivations. While it is essential to address these objections, it is equally important to contextualize them within the broader framework of Holocaust denial and distortion.

	1.	Exaggeration: Some Holocaust deniers allege that the figure of six million Jewish deaths is exaggerated or fabricated for political or ideological reasons. However, such claims disregard the extensive documentary evidence, demographic studies, and survivor testimonies supporting the estimate. Moreover, downplaying the magnitude of the Holocaust diminishes the suffering of its victims and undermines efforts to combat anti-Semitism and genocide denial.
	2.	Lack of Comprehensive Records: It is true that the chaotic conditions of the Holocaust and the deliberate efforts by the Nazi regime to destroy incriminating evidence have resulted in gaps in the historical record. However, historians have utilized a wide range of sources, including survivor testimonies, archival documents, demographic studies, and forensic evidence, to reconstruct the events of the Holocaust and estimate the number of victims.
	3.	Variability in Estimates: While historians and researchers have offered estimates ranging from five to seven million Jewish victims of the Holocaust, the figure of six million has become emblematic due to its widespread acceptance and alignment with the available evidence. The variability in estimates reflects the challenges inherent in quantifying the human toll of mass atrocities and does not diminish the validity of the six million figure.
	4.	Political Motivations: Holocaust denial and distortion often stem from political or ideological motivations, including anti-Semitic beliefs, nationalist agendas, or efforts to rehabilitate the reputation of Nazi collaborators. By questioning or denying the scale of Jewish suffering during the Holocaust, deniers seek to sow doubt, promote hatred, and undermine the historical consensus established by scholars and researchers.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the estimate of six million Jewish deaths in the Holocaust is supported by a wealth of historical evidence, including scholarly research, documentary records, demographic studies, and survivor testimonies. While objections and denials persist, they are rooted in misinformation, prejudice, and ideological agendas. By acknowledging the magnitude of the Holocaust and commemorating its victims, we honor their memory, uphold historical truth, and reaffirm our commitment to preventing genocide and promoting human rights.

The estimate of six million deaths serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of hatred, bigotry, and indifference. As we reflect on the horrors of the Holocaust, let us reaffirm our commitment to combating anti-Semitism, prejudice, and genocide denial wherever they arise. Only through remembrance, education, and solidarity can we ensure that the lessons of the Holocaust are never forgotten and that “never again” becomes a reality for all humanity."

But the obvious reason is that if you want to build a large, tall stone structure, the most stable shape is a pyramid. People just figured that's why almost all really tall structures in ancient times, hundreds of feet tall, are pyramids or pyramidal in shape, like the Sumerian ziggurats or the Egyptian pyramids. The only exception is the Pharos of Alexandria, which is Greek for lighthouse; it was one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Especially since, even though the pyramid has its little chambers, like 95 percent of the total volume is solid rock. It can't collapse on itself because there is nothing for it to collapse; you just pile the rocks on top of each other—it's basically a man-made hill.

Even the Egyptians, after Giza, stopped building such large pyramids and started focusing on large temple complexes, which had columns and beams that were religious. But at least they had usable space to them. Egyptians had to use a lot of interior columns because they had not perfected the arch or dome. I always felt that one of the reasons the Egyptians stopped building them is because they realized it was a huge waste of resources and didn't make much economic sense in the long run.

I would argue that, for example, the Parthenon in Greece, which is a religious building, but the Greeks used post-lintel construction, and it had columns and usable space, is architecturally more advanced than building a pyramid. The pyramid is just bigger, but it was built around 447 BC compared to the Giza pyramids in 2500 BC. I would also argue from a technological standpoint, the aqueducts, which were first built around 312 BC, that the Romans built with their arches, while not as big as the Great Pyramid, from a technical perspective, they were more advanced. Yet, nobody says that we couldn't do it today or that aliens did it. For example, the Egyptians, at the time the pyramids were built, couldn't make a keystone arch.

Another example is the Lighthouse of Alexandria, which was a structure that the Greeks built in Egypt. In my opinion, it was also more advanced. How is a pyramid more advanced than a lighthouse? The lighthouse was one of the Seven Wonders of the World, just like the Great Pyramid. It was a big deal because it was the first structure that was considerably tall, hundreds of feet tall, that was not a pyramid. Unlike the pyramid, the lighthouse had windows, floors, and tiers. And at the top, there was a furnace that lit at night, and in the day, a system of mirrors was used to reflect the sunlight. The light from the lighthouse was said to be visible from 25 miles out to sea or so. It was designed by the Greek architect Sostratus of Cnidus. It was a practical and functional structure. Its name comes from the island where it was built, which was called Pharos. Basically, the Greeks built this giant lighthouse over time, and the name of the island, Pharos, became associated with the structure, and the word ""pharos"" became the basis for the word ""lighthouse"" in different languages around the world. The lighthouse is believed to have been around 100 to 130 meters in height, with the only known taller structure being the Great Pyramid at 146.6 meters.""

But if we completely succeeded I think it would be a nightmare.

There would be no place for parents and families, for one thing, since not everyone in our world is lucky enough to have a loving family, so nobody could in a fair world.

Life’s losers would be totally abandoned and even more scorned than they are now, because everyone would know for sure they had no excuse.

There would be no Michael Jordans for people to aspire to.

There would only be two stories: “person worked hard and succeeded” and “person was lazy and failed”. No great tales of people beating the odds.

I’m thankful that luck exists in our world."

1. Solar is good for the environment and people should do it.

2. Solar is a good hedge against rising energy costs. It’s great peace of mind knowing that you’re locked in. 

3. Solar + house battery is great for blackouts and inconvenient power outages. Do it if you can!!

4. For this argument I’m assuming normal family suburban homes. Not some giant compound that uses extreme amounts of energy. I understand that those may have nearer term break even points. 


My point: When people make the case that solar “saves them money”. They do overly basic math. 

Example: I spent $20k on the system. My bill used to be $100/mo and now it’s $0/mo. So I break even 200 months aka 16 years. 

What I feel like is unfairly left out of the equation is the opportunity cost of the $20k. I think it’s fair to debate where that money would have been otherwise (I.e. not in solar panels), but for debate I think it’s fair to assume that money would be in the S&P500 or VTSAX or equivalent.  When you do this math, you’re very unlikely to ever break even or if you do it’s 40+ years out. And that’s before taking into account repair costs while you’re out of warranty.

at the same time the Republican party is seemingly ripping itself apart. Trump is losing legal cases left and right. and while this doesn't matter to his core voter base, it will matter to independent voters, who will decide the election.

also while there is a lot of rejection of Biden in leftist spaces due to the gaza conflict, at the end of the day Biden's positon is still more popular with the general public.which is more important."

1-Immigrants hurt the working class, there's no secret that corporations wants more immigrants hence so many corporations are virtual singling to young leftists. Immigrants always work at much cheaper profit than locals which encourages corporations to hire more immigrants instead of locals 


2-Immigration cause risk and threats to Women, LGBTQ+ and other minorities. Most immigrants in the west are from extremely conservative and reactionary third world countries that persecuted and discriminate against women and LGBTQ+, especially ones from Arab and Muslim countries. A good example of this is the Arab rape gang in many western European, I lived in Sweden and I know many women and LGBTQ+ there who are sacred walk alone at night because of the fear getting raped/killed by Arabs 


3- import immigrants means that the far-right will earn more votes. A large percentage of people would swift from voting for a progressive party to a far-right ons because of fear of a demographic change, even if the government adopted a strict immigration policies it wouldn't make their concerns about demographic change go away. I know people who voted left-wing in the past but switched to far-right because of fears of demographic change through immigration."
1,2024-03-31,CMV: BLM movement was a bad thing.,u/UnknownNumber1994,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bsm79z/cmv_blm_movement_was_a_bad_thing/,changemyview,"When trying to understand the history of BLM, it apparently strings all the way back to 2013, but I'm mainly going to be speaking on its popularity during 2020-.

When BLM first started surfacing again, it was as a result of *George Floyd* incident. Regardless of what you believe in that case, I think it's clear that the cop was in the wrong and justice was served and this was by the help of BLM protests. 

During this time, I was at the support of BLM and my teenage-self even posted the black square on IG like everyone else, lol. However, I believe this incident laid out a *domino effect* to follow, which, as a result, is why I believe BLM is ultimately bad.

Following the George Floyd incident, there were many protests that continued to spread and they started turning violent. I'm not exactly sure when the protests turned from peaceful to violent, but it seems to be linked to the *Breonna Taylor* incident.

Following violent protests, came the looters. After people started looting is when some people started to turn on BLM. BLM supporters tried to excuse their actions by claiming a ""change"" was needed, but I don't see how blowing up cars and stealing from Walmart is helping a ""change"" be made.

Also, people started to use the tag ""ALM"" as a counter to ""BLM"", saying that all lives matter, in comparison to just highlighting black lives. BLM supporters did not take this lightly, as many of them seem to suffer from racial bias and believe that focusing on their own race was somehow more important than any other race, as this was shown by anytime someone said ""ALM"". 

To say that focusing on black lives is more important because of the fact that they are the race that is the majority of unfair racial treatment in the U.S. is a strange argument, as they are essentially stating they are *majority* matters more than *minority* in this regard which is unintentionally so ironic.

Then, there was the *Jacob Blake* incident, and this also was brought to my attention as an NBA fan, as some of the teams boycotted games because of this.

What's weird to me is the amount of support that that some of these cases received that point the blame towards law enforcement. The *George Floyd* incident makes sense, but the Breonna Taylor, Rayshad Brooks, and Jacob Blake incidents don't make sense to me, as the police were clearly not the main cause of blame in any of these cases.

It was also clear that BLM was stringed from an inherent prejudice towards white people. This is another reason that many white people stopped supporting it over time. 

Regardless, I think BLM was bad and it pretty clearly a form of propaganda as well, to try to and act like a majority of white cops in America are racist towards black people by MSM outlets specifically highlighting the few cases that were questionable in hindsight and using it for their gain. This is part of the reason I recognize BLM as a past event, rather than an ongoing movement.

This is in part a geographical consideration, however I recognise the distinction between Northern, Western and Eastern Europe in that sense is fairly arbitrary. Instead, I would argue that the relation exists on wider levels of culture, economics and politics, such that in general it should be natural to consistently refer to this as a distinct group with the UK included. This BBC article (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-35374822) does a good job at listing a number of these points, but to give a broad overview of my thinking:

Politically:
- They are joined together in multiple political organisations built around this grouping, such as the Northern Futures Forum and the Joint Expeditionary Force
- They tend have a relative history of Euroscepticism, or otherwise being distinct from the rest of the EU/not in it at all
- Almost all of them operate using some variation of a Parliamentary system

Economically:
- Their economic systems are all far more oriented towards knowledge and innovation than the rest of Europe
- Their government services tend to operate in similar ways, such as in single payer models of healthcare and in spending on welfare services
- They all tend to contribute large proportions of their income on foreign aid relative to other nations

Culturally:
- They all tend to be far more socially liberal than the rest of the world in outlook
- A much greater emphasis is placed in their societies on speaking good English
- In general, their culture tends to be very similar to the UK in humour, personality etc

If you want to go further, you could even point out things like the UK flag looking similar to the Nordic ones and many of them having royal families!

As far as I can see, the only major exceptions to this lie in size (economically and in terms of population, the UK is more similar to Germany, France and Italy), and history, with the UK having a far more significant global role. However, given the number of above similarities these factors don’t seem to be playing an enormous role overall.

Hence, I would argue that the UK is a Northern European country, not a Western European country. I am intrigued to here arguments to the contrary however!

And frankly I'm not, and I hate myself for it. I wish that I always had a winning argument up my sleeve so that I can defend my views with confidence, and make others question their views, instead of the other way around.

I make frequent mistakes in life and I hate myself for it. Every iota of effort I spend to improve myself is yet to bear fruit because I keep screwing up. While every mistake is an opportunity to learn, for every mistake I learn from, I find another one to make. So in practice, every mistake is a humiliation and a defeat.

In my everyday life, I am also frequently losing. Because of my high odds of being wrong, my political and religious views are simply not respected, and my brother would challenge me to defend my views in a debate, and I manage to lose not just [once](https://imgur.com/a/jVrxqdd), but [twice](https://www.reddit.com/r/AusPol/comments/xu1pad/question_how_to_deal_with_clashing/).

Growing up, I learnt to ""*not act like you're always right because you're not*"". And I found that a reasonable and understandable lesson, because I really am not always right. But if I were always right, then I could have chosen to disregard that lesson.

Not being always right has been a major drag on my life. [I failed to get a PhD](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b9m15p/cmv_i_find_it_unfair_that_society_values_the/), my reputation is stained by other failures too, and my other achievements in life are all unimpressive - none of which would happen if I were always right.

I wish I could have certainty. I wish I could have self-confidence. I wish that I could be the one telling off others for being wrong instead of the other way around. I wish that I could use my odds of being right as a tool, instead of my odds of being wrong being used as a tool against me."

The only song of hers that I can remember that I still like is Willow. Now I will admit I have a strange taste in music and don’t really listen to modern pop music. But out of all of them I find hers to be one of the most boring ones. 

Also let’s just be honest the fan base is really obnoxious. I don’t mind if you like her music, but can you stop talking about her every single day. Anytime I met a Swifty, as they say, they will not stop bringing her up. That would get obnoxious no matter who they are doing it with. The obsession is just weird.
