1,2022-10-31,CMV: We need to normalize mixed race individuals identifying as mixed in America,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yiu176/cmv_we_need_to_normalize_mixed_race_individuals/,changemyview,[removed]
0,2022-10-31,"CMV: Although every US Citizen has the right to vote, the country would be better off if more people didn't vote - and there should be a basic qualifying test to be able to vote.",u/IrradiatedDog,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yiu1kq/cmv_although_every_us_citizen_has_the_right_to/,changemyview,"Politics in America is all about voting. Don't like a policy? Vote. Want a certain policy? Vote. Want something taught in schools? Vote. Want someone who represents your views? Vote. It's an extremely important right in this country because of the principles America was founded on - representation of the citizens by citizens. The People have a right to be heard, so they send their elected officials to local, state, and federal governments to represent their views. The problem is, a lot of people who vote don't know what they're voting for.

I'm not saying this in a way meaning ""how could you vote for Democrats, they just want to let criminals run rampant and to indoctrinate our children, you don't know what you're doing"" or ""voting for Republicans is just voting for fascists, Republicans are too stupid to know what they're voting for.""

I mean it in the literal way of not knowing about policy. A lot of people only vote a certain way because of how their family or friends vote or because people hear other people talking about how bad another party is. Even voting over one particular issue is stupid. You can't just vote for someone to go vote on one subject - electing politicians brings *all* their policies to the legislature. Candidates run on a plethora of positions. And sure, some policy positions are more important to voters than others, but voting someone into office to enact their policies when you don't even have a basic understanding of their stances and the effects they could cause is grossly irresponsible. ~~When I say a qualification test, I'm not talking about Jim Crow style ""literacy"" tests. I'm talking about a test (multiple choice or true/false) which ensures basic understanding of issues at hand (not policy positions). It would ask a few simple questions to verify a voter has an understanding of the election, like ""Candidates elected to the House of Representatives are elected for terms of how long? A-2 years B-3 years C-4 years"" or ""If you move into a higher tax bracket, how would your taxes change? A-increase B-decrease C-stay the same.""~~

The Founders believed it was not only important for the People to choose who represented them, but also crucial that they are informed and educated in their decisions when choosing their representation. An uninformed vote is infinitely worse than not voting at all. Change my view.

&amp;#x200B;

To clarify, I'm not talking about one particular party or level of government in general, and I'm not blaming one party over the other - I'm talking about anyone who votes for any candidate. Nor am I saying that voters need to be experts on policy - just that they should have a very basic understanding of what candidates' positions are (i.e. pro or against foreign aid, for or against domestic oil production, for or against more market regulation, for or against abortion, for or against voter ID laws) on most - if not all - of their policies, not just a singular one or no idea at all.

Edit for Delta: u/redditor427 changed my view on the test. He made me realize that in order to ensure voters have an understanding of the candidates positions, questions would need to be asked about each candidates' policy positions. Because many candidates are often on the ballot at once, I believe that would place an undue burden on voters to have to complete a lengthy test which then makes voting undesirable and unnecessarily difficult, even for those who are well informed. Thank you for your point!"

### Factual Background

I study undergraduate law (LLB) at a university in England. From March 2020 to August 2021, my law department required all students to study remotely, e.g. by attending classes and lectures on Zoom. Then from September 2021 to June 2022, it allowed students to pick between studying remotely, or in person on campus in England.  But from September 2022, it halted remote study, and requires ALL students to study in person! I already emailed this request and the 2 arguments below to my law faculty's Dean, but she rejected them! 

### Argument 1. [New immune-evasive and vaccine-resistant COVID-19 strains and variants are coming](https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/omicron-subvariants-immune-escape-bivalent-covid-19-vaccines-canada-1.6625212)!

[https://redd.it/ygje08](https://redd.it/ygje08)

&gt; Two new strains of coronavirus have emerged in the UK, health officials have warned.
&gt; 
&gt; More than 700 cases of the mutant BQ.1 variant have been detected across the country with a further 18 cases of the so-called XBB variant.
&gt; 
&gt; Both XBB and BQ.1 are very immune evasive and may even be immune to current vaccines, experts have told The Independent.

[r/COVIDLongHaulers](https://old.reddit.com/r/COVIDLongHaulers). [r/LongCOVIDActivism](https://old.reddit.com/r/LongCOVIDActivism), [r/LongCOVID](https://old.reddit.com/r/LongCOVID) documents the severeity of Long COVID.

### Argument 2. Many essential services and public transport in England have gone, or shall go, on strike!

Some students haven't been able to commute to campus, and some classes have already switched to online, because of strikes throughout England! The university is wasting students' money by forcing them to lease accommodation in England, when they can attend class on Zoom from their own home!
 

### Disclaimers against *deus ex machina*. Rule out black swans. Your reasons shall be level-headed and lifelike. 

Don't just surmise [impacts by astronomical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event#Impacts_and_the_Earth) or natural disasters. It's unrealistic for tsunami, earthquake, [meteorite, asteroid](https://www.mercurynews.com/2013/03/10/comet-meteor-asteroid-heres-how-to-tell-the-difference/) or disease to suddenly impact just my university in England from 2022-4, but not other law faculties in England."

I completely agree with them that they should not be treated the way they are, and that they should have a livable wage at the very least.

However, what confuses me is why they don’t just quit their job and find a new one. I understand that finding a new job can be hard. But a lot of these people work in restaurants, factories, and other service industry positions. These positions often have minimum, if any, requirements. Which makes it easy to find a place that will hire you as long as you show up and do your job. If all the workers refused to work for companies that don’t pay them a livable wage, then those companies would be forced to increase their workers’ salaries.

Instead, many people continue to just complain about the terrible conditions they endure without actually doing anything to change their situation. I agree that politicians should help. But the reality is that progress is slow, especially with politicians that are bought out and care about the billionaires that fund them. These billionaires don’t want legislation that increases the minimum wage. They are likely fighting against it.

That means that instead of hoping someone else will help, workers should just find a new job. I don’t understand why people stay in terrible jobs instead of quitting and finding something else. There is a worker shortage right now, which means it’s even easier than normal to find someone else who will hire you.

If the complaint is that all fast food places will never increase their minimum wages to a livrable amount, then maybe that just means that we should leave those jobs for high schoolers.

I googled it and here are some jobs that don’t have requirements and pay a livable wage:

1: Groundskeeper: you mow lawns, and take care of lawns for a a business. It averages around $50,475 a year in the United States.

2: Garage truck driver: $55,318 a year on average in the United States

3: Massage therapist: $58,944 a year on average in the United States.

4: Customer service representative: $59,498 a year on average in the United States 

5: Truck drivers: $74,224 a year on average in the United States

6: Dispatcher: $111,529 a year on average in the United States

There are many other jobs like these. Why do so many people who have a terrible job with a terrible boss just complain instead of leaving? They deserve better, and they can get better if they work for it."

Yes he could’ve expected this to happen but that doesnt mean he deserves it. it means others crossed the line and went out there way to commit assault. You dont deserve to get assaulted if you haven’t done anything wrong.

And no, its not wrong to dress up like Hitler.
As long as you are not physically hurting someone there is nothing inherently wrong with wearing a Hitler costume for halloween.
Whether you should is a different question, but you do not deserve to get beat up or lose your job because of a joke.

Dressing up as Hitler doesn’t mean you’re a nazi. It means you’re joking around and its actually mocking nazis and Hitler. People who wanna be funny dress up as Hitler, Real nazis don’t dress up as Hitler for halloween, they hurt others.

People dress up as all kinds of different people who committed horrible things, but Hitler is somehow crossing a line. Thats why i believe there is no line, and everyone should be able to wear anything they want. Without serious repercussions."

&amp;#x200B;

In English, neuter pronouns have historically been used for inanimate objects *and* humans. In Old English, the neuter pronoun *hit* was used ""like the masculine and feminine ones \[...\] for both people and objects (inanimate or abstract),"" according to Wikipedia. In the 12th century, *it* began to separate from *hit* and had nearly fully replaced *hit* by the 17th century. The narrative that *it* is only for inanimate objects and should not be used for humans is thus not supported by etymology. 

&amp;#x200B;

Wikipedia presented the following two (past and present) literary usages of *it* in reference to gender-neutral human beings: 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into **its** face to see what was the matter with **it**.  
— [Lewis Carroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll), [Alice in Wonderland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland) (1865)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;*""He* *looks like nobody but* *himself,"" said Mrs. Owens, firmly. ... It was then that ... the child opened* ***its*** *eyes wide in wakefulness.* ***It*** *stared around* ***it*** *...*  
— Neil Gaiman, *The Graveyard Book* (2008), p. 25.

&amp;#x200B;

*They* would also be grammatically correct in both aforementioned examples, but my CMV is not about *they/them* pronouns.  These are not mutually exclusive arguments.  Both *it* and *they* can be grammatically correct to describe singular humans. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what Wikipedia has to say about this discussion: 

&gt;While some [genderqueer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender) people use [*it* as a gender-neutral pronoun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_neutrality_in_languages_with_gendered_third-person_pronouns#It_as_a_gender-neutral_pronoun),[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_(pronoun)#cite_note-gendercensus2021-20) in the postmodern [etiquette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette) of [identity politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics) (increasingly prevalent in educated, urban populations), as a pronoun, ""it"" should not be used unless requested by a specific person.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not know why there is so much modern reluctance to the use of *it* as a singular, neuter pronoun for people, but the etymology and literary history of the word do not seem to support it. Change my view."

But what's the alternative? Mainstream news sources survive on credibility. If they consistently report stories that end up being untrue, then people will stop using them as a news source in numbers to remain mainstream. 

Any media source that isn't mainstream is generally catering to a very specific audience. They're surviving on clicks and views, but they only need enough that can be provided by their target audience. The Root and Brietbart(quick examples) don't need people from the opposing political ideology to listen to them. Those sources don't rely on reputation, they rely on outrage among their base. 

For the purpose of this post, mainstream media is something that's typically on a standard cable plan. ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, PBS. Also nationally known publications or websites, like NY Times, AP, Rueters, etc. 

Also, I'm referring to the news divisions from all of these sources. Rachel Maddow and Tucker Carlson aren't news, they're opinion shows. Anything they say should be seen as opinion and commentary, not a news source."

Being friend zoned is a construct you put yourself into, because the relationship from the beginning was a friendship, so it shouldn't come as a surprise. On the other hand, being fuck zoned can come out of nowhere, because you started the relationship as a friendship only to find out they never wanted to be your friend. 

I will concede the exception to this that sometimes you develop feelings for someone over time when that was not your intent from the start. If they don't share those feelings, you may not feel able to spend that time around them and that is understandable. Both people should be able to discuss and understand this. 

I am specifically talking about people who pretend right from the very beginning to want to be friends, but they only want to find a way to hook up."

He claims this is to help ""pay the bills"" but advertising does that and, frankly, even if all verified users opted in it would amount to a insignificant revenue stream relevant to the platform.    
   
The real goal here is to further anonymize Twitter and to make it harder for consumers to verify the source of their information. Parody accounts already fool people, ""ate the onion"" style, and that problem will only get worse as backlash to the paid checkmark causes people to opt out. Elon is known to be a big fan of 4chan and its trolling and started spreading political misinformation on Twitter almost immediately after taking ownership of it.   
   
It seems clear to me that he is putting a price on the verification as a soft way to further erode trust on the internet. He says it's for ""Paying the bills"", but when author Stephen King called him out he cut the price by 60% (from $20 to $8), so finances are clearly **not** the driving force here.

I am so confused. Many people say on the internet that yoga is not religious. I respectfully disagree.

Yoga means union, and is written about in the Bhagavad Gita, a scripture of Hinduism. Pantajali, who wrote the Yoga Sutras, says that the goal of yoga is to achieve samadhi, where it is claimed that you connect with God/The Divine. Yoga philosophy claims to be a means of connecting with God.

Yoga has a patron god, called Shiva. He is a Hindu god and he is who yogis devote their practice to. Yoga is literally a form of prayer. The asanas, otherwise called yoga postures, were invented so people can sit in meditation for hours, focusing on Shiva. They are not simply exercises. To claim so is to misunderstand yoga. I would go as far as to claim that asana only ""yoga"" is not yoga, it is just pilates. It is not yoga because you are not uniting with anything.

Yoga is a deep philosophy behind it. Guidelines about pacifism, vegetarianism, how to treat others, guidelines on how to pray, avoiding alcohol etc. It shouldn't be viewed as something you just do for a stretch. It shouldn't be done for an hour a week and then just ignored. It should be lived every single day. It should become an individual's purpose.

I think it should definitely be viewed as more like a lifestyle. If people believe in this philosophy, they are Hindu by definition, as yoga is a Hindu philosophy. If people want to put it in any category I think it should be put in the same category of attending church or praying to God, because that is fundamentally what it is - worship.

However, I don't understand why anyone would say it isn't worship of Shiva. He is literally the patron deity of the entire thing. How come many people recognise praying to Jesus as religious but many ignorant people do nor realise yoga is religious?

I want to change my vew because my mother says this is a minority view and if I say this aloud, people will think I'm a bit unusual. Please explain why people might think yoga is exercise.

EDIT: Hello everyone 🙏

  
Thank you so much for making me think about yoga. 

I realised that yoga isn't a spiritual activity for everyone and I sincerely apologise if I upset anyone here.

  
I guess an analogy would be that yoga is like science in the sense that is one big overarching thing. Some scientists focus on a biology and within that maybe a very specific subbranch (like marine biology) whereas other scientists focus on chemistry or a chemistry subbranch.

  
So it's similar with yoga. Some people may focus on the asana (posture) part of yoga to stretch, while others like Modi (PM of India) may focus on bhakti (devotion to God). So it's all yoga, just different subbranches and different goals within. Thanks for being patient and explaining to me.

View changed. Well done. "

Meanwhile, the left (which for me includes liberals, progressives, and socialists) is constantly at war with itself over identity politics. We have no unified and coherent platform of shared positive goals that we can all agree to agree on. We don't have any means of community organizing to compete with churches. We have no long-term strategy. What we mostly have is a burning hatred and rage for anyone who disagrees with us (regardless of what political party they're in), a blindness toward the arbitrariness of our critiques (eviscerating Lin-Manuel Miranda for colorism in IN THE HEIGHTS while championing blatantly racist reality shows made by and featuring white people), and an unwillingness to face the extent to which we're driven by capitalistic greed ourselves.

I'm a 29 yo who is struggling to live and in recent years this thought became stronger and stronger.

Money is bad.

It gives power and worth to people who are smart and good with business, instead of giving it to those who are actually good people and care about other people.

Every system that I know of didn't manage to distribuite money in a way that there is no corruption, no poor people and no billionairs.

I ask you to change my view because I'm struggling to live with this reality and maybe some of you have the right knowledge to change my mind.

If you also have some reads on the subject, I will be thankful for your suggestions.

Thank you very much,

95,2022-11-02,cmv: Individuals from outside of a culture deciding what is or is not offensive for the people of that culture and using that to attack other people are despicable,u/ComradeSokami,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yjwnqi/cmv_individuals_from_outside_of_a_culture/,changemyview,"People with no relation to a culture deciding what is and is not offensive for that culture on the whole, is probably one of the most disgusting and disrespectful things you can do to literally any culture. If you can't respect a whole culture of people to act and decide on their own terms to when outsiders interact or appreciate aspects of their culture, then you don't fundamentally respect them as a people. The people who exhibit this behavior tend to act in a highly self-congragulatory manner, as though they are 'saviors' of a culture they aren't even apart of, even attacking people online who have origins of the very same culture they believe they are ""Defending"". It's extremely pathetic.

&amp;#x200B;

Every culture that exist today is a conglomeration of cultural exchange over thousands of years, precisely because of the process of people choosing to appreciate aspects of another culture. The individuals who get most heated about people who appreciate aspects of other cultures, not only ignore this, but seem almost incapable of recognizing that countries within a certain broad areas of the world, when you remove the differences, have many common cultural similarities due to their close geographical proximity to each other. The Mediterranean Sea cause the rapid spread of eastern Mediterranean cultures to spread all around the entire Mediterranean both through trade and war. The same thing happened in Africa, Asia, Africa and the America's.

&amp;#x200B;

If anything people who obsess over whether people are sticking purely to their 'cultural roots' or not whenever they appreciate other cultures, and ruthlessly attack people who choose to appreciate aspects of other cultures, Sounds eerily similar to the rhetoric you might hear from Nazi Germany, which was obsessed with the strict adherence to Germany's so-called ""Aryan Roots"".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am more than willing to consider any exceptions there may be that could possibly demonstrate it as acceptable or even an ethical necessity in specific instances where a person has no choice but to decide what is or is not offensive for a culture. Arguments that would not work to revise my view in this arena are things that are common sense and apply to every culture with virtually no exception - no culture of people find it acceptable to be hated based solely on their culture or ethnic background, for example. It's the intricate specific aspects of cultures that are usually highly variable between cultures that are relevant to the reasoning of my View. If you can show exceptions regarding specific aspects of specific cultures where an assumption on that cultures opinions to how others should interact with that culture would be ethically necessary on the part of an outsider, and present solid evidence for why, then I would consider it an exception in those instances, but not a sudden replacement to my initial view. I would thus be forced to revise my view to ""most of the time, with some exceptions"". I doubt this will happen, but we shall see what people here can bring to the table.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

Many post have mentioned there are those that attack people because they are defending things from a culture that are indefensible. My original post was focused on people who are craving attention when they attack people using things from a culture, without themselves having any substantial knowledge about a culture - people with an inflated sense of self-righteousness. but it's also wrong to defend highly inhumane practices from cultures, such as FMG, Homophobia, Child Brides, Class Oppression, Slavery, enforcement of a religious lifestyle, and so on. I have awarded Delta's to people who brought this up."

What is he called? AN INCEL or better yet when his negative views lead him to make hurtful comments to women as a whole he is shamed about how he doesn't get laid or how he is short or has a small dick. I have never and will never defend other men who do this and I believe shaming them is correct (although using comments that may apply to other innocent men is wrong but that is another story) I mean cmon where is the same energy for women, rather we make excuses about how she isn't serious or how maybe she has had negative experiences. That is what I want to know? Also I do not in any way support incels or red pill groups whatsoever. Another example is Andrew Tate. I absolutely disagree with a majority of his opinions and I believe that his being banned is a good thing, what about women who do this exact thing but to men. Drewafualo is a great example she constantly attacks men who haven't even done anything wrong and body shames them but not only does she get to keep her platform but she was invited to some celebrity event to be a host like WTF? Billie Eilish who herself admits to having issues about her body image turns around and says ""Don't give ugly men a chance"", and the comments ranged from praising her to defending her saying oh she is just joking or men say this all the time about women, but I'm like NOT ALL MEN DO THAT. We can agree that there are plenty of men who are incredibly insercure about their appearance but because their men they can take it? Please do not get started on how men are mysoginistic and therefore this is warranted. I can tell you a majority of men are good people who would stick up for a woman if she was in danger and don't stand on street corners catcalling women as they walk by. But because of the actions of a few we are all at fault?? How does that work. Many BUT NOT ALL women ( I would even say a minority) do a lot of bad things themselves and have very negative views towards men and I understand that. Hence I also believe that blaming every man for the actions of a few is effed up."

Some of you might say that the death penalty can reduce crime but in EVERY YEAR of recorded history since 1990 the murder rate has been LOWER in states that dont use the death penalty. That’s not enough for you? Well in 2012 latvia abolished the death penalty. That same year crime dropped by 62 PERCENT. The death penalty is a staple of unfairness and evil that MUST be stopped. Only 20 percent of Norwegian prisoners have another scuffle with the law and end up in prison again. In the United States this number skyrockets up to 76%. Can you guess which one of these does not have the death penalty? It’s Norway, having one of the best jailing systems in the world WITHOUT the death penalty.

Human beings on the other hand can survive on a diet without meat, and therefore we are killing other animals for the sole pleasure and hedonism of eating them.

I don’t know much about human anatomy and physiology, and whether or not we are built to be omnivores or not. Either way, if we were omnivores in the past we can be herbivores today.

The reason I made this thought is by looking at what happens in the world.

We humans obviously are often prone to wanting to live in a very conformist, homogenous and close-minded world, we don't want our thoughts to be challenged and questioning the status quo, we love being sheeps and mindless bee workers.

0,2022-11-02,CMV: I do not believe the act of a demon eating a human in the anime Demon Slayer is morally wrong.,u/clavicle524,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yk7g8f/cmv_i_do_not_believe_the_act_of_a_demon_eating_a/,changemyview,"Before I start this post, I would like to clarify some things with you:

* My post will be about why a demon-eating human isn’t morally wrong for a demon. I will not be saying all actions made by demons are good since Rui abused his family and that’s evil.
* I will not be saying it is morally wrong to defend yourself from a demon or even kill it as I believe Self-Defense is perfectly okay. My post is arguing on why it’s perfectly ethical for a demon to eat a human for survival. If a demon was to kill a human for pleasure, that would be evil. I do not believe the demon slayer corps is evil as it is a self-defense response.
* I’m very open to changing my opinion on this.

Without further ado, let’s go.

Through watching [Demon Slayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Slayer:_Kimetsu_no_Yaiba), this question came to my mind. Why are the Demon’s actions of consuming a human so abhorrent? A lion kills a human out of hunger. Is it evil? No, it's just doing its job as nature’s top predator.

Now some may argue that a demon is aware that humans are sophisticated and a lion is not. However, even if demons are aware that humans are complex in their intelligence, I don’t believe it's morally wrong for a demon to kill a human even if it's aware of a human thought process. Why? Because if you were stuck on an alien planet and you had to choose between eating a more intelligent and complex creature or starving to death, I’m sure you would choose the former. I do not believe a species’s sophistication and complex thinking make it unethical to eat it for survival. A demon might be sentient enough to know its victim feels pain and tragedy but I don’t think it makes the demon’s actions less ethical because it’s a matter of you vs them.

Now I know that some people have said that demons do not need to kill humans and that it's just an urge. I don’t believe this is the case and I believe a demon would starve to death if it couldn’t eat a human. I also believe that demons have their own free will and are not controlled by Muzak. If they were controlled by Muzan, then they shouldn’t have been able to retain some of their human characteristics as they would have all been overridden by Muzan’s control.

I would like to hear your thoughts on what I said. If you believe any of my arguments are incorrect, please let me know and explain why.

418,2022-11-02,"CMV: Pascal's wager, if taken at face value, proves that Christianity is the logically wrong choice.",u/Sleepycoon,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yk97br/cmv_pascals_wager_if_taken_at_face_value_proves/,changemyview,"For those that aren't familiar, Pascal's wager is an argument made by the 17th century philosopher Blaise Pascal that essentially states that belief in God is logical and a lack of belief is illogical. The idea is, if you believe you stand to gain infinite benefit if you're right and you just live a moral life with no downsides if you're wrong, but if you don't believe you risk infinite loss if you're wrong and you gain a life of vice if you're right.

His goals were more along the lines of persuading non-believers to live a moral life than trying to logically prove that everyone should believe in God. There have also been many counter arguments made, but despite all that people still either invoke Pascal's wager or unknowingly use its logic in attempt to prove that the Judeo-Christian God of the Bible should be believed in and followed. I'm not really trying to bring up a new argument to disprove Pascal's wager, and I'm not trying to convince anyone who thinks it's a good argument to the contrary.

Really, I just had a shower thought and I want to know if my logic is flawed or if Pascal's wager indeed not only isn't a good argument, but if applied at face value actually proves that the Judeo-Christian god is the logically worst god to believe in, (or rather, that he's tied for worst.) When I say ""take it at face value"" I mean to apply his logic as he does while ignoring anything that makes it a non-starter.

On to my actual argument. Pascal's wager posits a false dichotomy; God exists, or God doesn't. In reality humans have worshipped countless gods throughout history and the wager, if reflective of reality, wouldn't be a 50/50 chance of picking the truth, but more like a 1-in-a-million chance of picking the right god. There are thousands, if not millions of deities that have been worshipped throughout history, and most of those are polytheistic. Hinduism alone has, in some texts, 330 million gods. When a polytheistic religion can have dozens or hundreds of named gods and a monotheistic religion can only have one, the number of monotheistic gods is inevitably going to be insignificantly small.

For simplicity's sake, let's say we have 9,000 polytheistic gods, 999 monotheistic gods, and atheos. Taking Pascal's wager at face value but removing the false dichotomy, we want to use logic to determine what belief will give us the highest chance of reward with the lowest chance of punishment.  Choosing atheism gives us a 1/10,000 chance of being right, but choosing any of the monotheistic gods also gives us only a 1/10,000 chance of being right, but choosing any of the polytheistic gods allows us to chose more than one god and have a greater than 1/10,000 chance of being right, therefore, if you want to use Pascal's logic not only should you not necessarily chose Christianity, but it's considerably worse than choosing any polytheistic religion.

You can essentially ignore hell, heaven, polytheistic religions that still hate you if you worship the wrong gods, religions that have no concept of punishment or reward in the afterlife, and all other minor factors because as long as choosing the Judeo-Christian god means spurning at least one possible deity that does offer eternal paradise and/or eternal punishment, choosing the Judeo-Christian god is as good as choosing no god, and if you chose a god that allows you to worship even one other god that offers infinite punishment and/or reward, then you're twice as likely to have picked the right god than if you'd gone with monotheism.

Edit: To clarify, I am not arguing the validity or efficacy of Pascal's wager, I am not trying for or against Pascal's wager, religion, polytheism, or anything else. My argument is essentially, ""If we apply Pascal's wager to all gods that humans have worshipped instead of just the Judeo-Christian God, my view is that by the risk/reward weighing pragmatic logic of the wager and ignoring any outside parameters that the wager doesn't address, polytheism is the correct choice."" CMV by proving that monotheism and/or atheism have an equal or greater value than polytheism based on the logic of the wager.

Also, I've awarded a few deltas to people pointing out that some deities don't require you to actively acknowledge them to reap their rewards. I don't think these make monotheism a better choice, because polytheism still gives you more options, but I admit that's a big detail to overlook. I'm not going to give deltas for that point anymore."

Maybe I spend my whole life in Uzbekistan, but I'm a russian who raised in russian culture and language. And it's terrible to realise how your native language and culture is now cancelled worldwide because of incompetent president. Maybe I'm too dramatic, but I already encountered with anti-russian sentiment in internet. Like, for example, ukrainian conflict themed subreddits, where everyone wish about turning Russia into North Korea where all russians, regardless of their political views, should suffer. I even remember how people on 4chan called me a ""subhuman"". Even, ironically, opposition-minded russians I had a talk are now hating their own nation, culture and language. It's crazy.

Let's be clear. Even in my country, where I'm born and raised, I'm still an alien for native population. Yeah, most of them know russian well, but I feel like in future I need to learn uzbek. Then, I'm a fan of otaku culture. I love anime. And... look, we are using things which are mostly produced in China. I have TVs in my appartment which are made by korean company. We are living in era of globalization, and english language now is extremely useful skill. Many young people are learning english. Seriously, even in my country english language subject is now mandatory in many schools like russian language.

Yeah, I heard people who are saying: ""You shouldn't leave Russia, go to protest!"", but the problem is that protests are useless, including those with violence for now. Russian government is still strong in making repressions, and it's unlike about the revolution be happen at least until Russia's defeat, which will become one of the most shamed defeats in country's history. That's why many russians who are not happy with Putin are trying to leave their homeland. It will negatively impact on russian economy, giving to ukrainian army a chance for victory. You know, the brain drain thing.

I don't deny that patriotism is a good thing. Like for ukrainian soldiers who are fighting to defend their homeland. But for me it's now uselees nonsense. I wish everyone on planet could talk on english freely. It's not a perfect language, but enough popular and easy to learn."

&amp;#x200B;

With recent news that [Henry Cavill is leaving the Netflix series](https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/30/entertainment/henry-cavill-liam-hemsworth-the-witcher) after Season 3 (sorry if this is how you're finding out), speculation has been rampant on the reason why. One theory people have had is that the last season was so unfaithful to the books that superfan Henry Cavill was too frustrated to continue. This likely led to a toxic work environment for everyone involved, especially with reports that some of the writers [actively disliked](https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-the-witcher-some-writers-actively-disliked-books-games-claims-former-producer) the source material.

While this may all be true, I'd like to make the case that this particular series was not well suited to the screen without some heavy modification and that such modification to suit a new medium and a new audience should honestly be okay.

I've preambled on a bit long intentionally to get spoilers below the fold. Heavy spoilers to follow for the books, games and Netflix series to follow.

&amp;#x200B;

I've read the books, watched the series to date and played The Witcher 3 (I skipped the first two games but have some idea of where they went). Here are some of the major problems that I see with adapting this story to the screen:

**1) It's very heavy on wandering.**   For the most part, the books are very sparsely populated with action and heavily populated with dialogue discussed while the characters wander the woods searching for each other and avoiding Nilfgaard and whoever else wants them dead. Sure, things do happen on occasion, but most of the adventure is spent with Geralt and his team wandering the woods and avoiding Nilfgaard in search of Ciri with very little more than a guess on which direction to go in, Ciri and her team wandering the woods in search of things to steal while avoiding Nilfgaard, and Yennifer and Triss both teleporting around serving as vessels for exposition.

This works on paper because words are words but with the added visual dimension, viewers will often lose interest if the whole premise of the show is ""Geralt complains in the woods again this week"".

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Yennifer is awful.**   The only time I can remember that she actually helps everyone is when she saves Dandelion (Jaskier in the show) from Rience. Aside from that, she mainly exists to give the readers visibility into Vilgefortz' character. When she's not acting as a plot device, she's just a genuinely horrible person.

At the beginning of the saga, she trains Ciri in magic for a while and during that time she mainly just hazed her. Yennifer refused to call Ciri by name, instead calling her ""my ugly one"" for no real reason other than to take Ciri down a peg. Ciri repeatedly expressed her distaste for the nickname, only causing her to lean into it even harder.

In one of the short stories prior to the saga, Yennifer brings Geralt along to Aedd Gynvael to stay for a few months. Why? Because that's where Istredd was and she wanted to cause drama. Every morning she'd leave Geralt to go have sex with Istredd and then every evening she'd leave Istredd to have sex with Geralt, intentionally not covering her tracks in hopes that the two would find out about each other. When they did, the two agreed to a duel to the death. Geralt understood that he likely could not compete with the sorcerer's magic but when the agreed upon time came, Istredd informed Geralt that he had no intention of using any magic to ""make it a fair fight."" Geralt, knowing that Istredd had no chance against him in physical combat, realized that Istredd was really just trying to commit suicide by Geralt's hand due to the pain from Yennifer's betrayal of them both. Instead of dueling, Geralt then walked away from Istredd and Yennifer.

The point being that no one was going to enjoy watching Yennifer. Her whole arc with Geralt is supposed to be that she's horrible but Geralt loves her anyway and you're supposed to question whether he really loves her or if they're just inextricably intertwined due to what you assume he wished for from the djinn. It would be interesting if we were just talking about one book or one season of a show but she's consistently horrible for 7 novels. She needed to have some updates to her character to humanize her or every moment she was on screen was going to be a drag.

&amp;#x200B;

**3) Emhyr Var Emreis' true identity is not handled in a way that translates to the screen.**   In the novels it isn't revealed that Emhyr was really Duny the whole time until nearly the very end of the last book. Up until that point, it's never really even hinted that Emhyr was anyone other than Emhyr. It's easy to assume that Nilfgaard was just building an empire so additional motivation through secret identities was not really required. This ultimately felt like a corny retcon when it was revealed but that's aside from the point.

In prose, you can easily hide that without raising suspicion because you never see faces or hear voices. On the screen, it becomes really obvious when you're trying to hide the identity of a main character. Film from behind, film from the neck down, put the king in full plate armor (LOL, sure), have other characters speak for him... They were doing these things in season two and it was clear they couldn't keep it up. I expected they'd drop the charade at the beginning of season 3 but they did it at the end of season 2. With that cat out of the bag, Nilfgaard's entire motivation will have to change but it can't really line up with the motivation given in the books because...

&amp;#x200B;

**4) There's a really unforgiveable amount of sexualization of a child.**   Like, it's literally the central plot point to the entire saga. It's honestly worse than that time a grown werewolf man fell in love with a literal infant in that weird sparkly vampire book series everyone was obsessed with in the 2010s.

Ithlinne's prophecy is repeated over and over and over again to explain why Ciri is special. Basically the world is going to end in some non-specified disaster and Ciri is the key to stopping it.

Except not Ciri, no that would be too cliché, it's actually supposed to be Ciri's child that will save the world. Why does that distinction matter? Because it means that everyone who is chasing after Ciri (save for Geralt) is doing it because they want to breed her ASAP so that they can be the father of the savior of the world and get all the spoils that come with it.

I know what you're thinking and yes, that includes Emhyr/Duny, Ciri's father. Not only does he want to force his 11 year old (at the beginning of the saga) daughter to have children with him, but he only pursued a relationship with her mother, Pavetta, in the first place because he had been told this prophecy beforehand. He never cared for Pavetta and only engaged with her at all because he wanted to rape their child the moment she was old enough to bear children herself AND he came up with this whole plan BEFORE PAVETTA WAS EVEN BORN. All of his war mongering and murder through all the books was just so he could get his hands on Ciri. W. T. F.

Then there's Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach whose name is only mentioned as ""Cahir"" in the show because the rest of it is hilariously over the top. He was charged with finding Ciri by Emhyr but he gave up on his responsibility to bring her back to Nilfgaard because he fell in love with her when he first laid eyes on her as they razed Cintra. He's not actually motivated by the prophecy, he just saw a terrified, filthy 11 year old girl running away while he and his friends were murdering her whole family and kingdom and fell so madly in love that he immediately decided to abandon his own home and devote his entire being to try to be with her. Later on he meets up with Geralt and team and when Geralt finds out about Cahir's motivation, he gets mad at Cahir but STILL LETS HIM TRAVEL ALONG WITH THEM TO FIND CIRI ANYWAY.

Remember the Wild Hunt? Well they're just elves from another world who want their king to breed with Ciri because they want to save their world too and also because elves are going extinct and she's got super special elf blood.

You know Vilgefortz? Well, he doesn't want to breed with her, actually. He just wants to extract her uterus because he thinks he can use it to give himself Ciri's world jumping powers so he can just vacation in a world that isn't going to end.

If you're not nauseated yet, I don't know how. I can't see how Netflix could allow this to be adapted faithfully unless their intent is to get cancelled. There's no way they could go down this road even a little bit despite the fact that they aged her up in the show by a whole THREE YEARS.

**5) Speaking of Ithlinne's Prophecy, it's never resolved.**   Actually, a lot of things are never resolved. The final book in the series wraps things up like a TV series that found out it was getting cancelled in the middle of filming a season. Geralt manages to kill Vilgefortz and save Ciri from his grasp just in time for Emhyr to roll in who drops that he's really Duny and he's here to take his baby girl off to make a new baby. Unable to fight off a whole army, Geralt reluctantly lets Emhyr take Ciri despite the fact that he just watched all his comrades die to save her from Vilgefortz. But don't worry because like 5 pages later Emhyr decides he doesn't actually want to go through with it and let's Ciri go. Geralt then decides to give up fighting forever and to raise Ciri with Yennifer and live happily ever after.

Except a small fight breaks out in the town where they're supposed to meet back up and Geralt decides to get involved because he just can't give up fighting and gets stabbed with a pitchfork, dying unceremoniously. Yennifer then dies too because their fates are intertwined.

What ever happened with Ithlinne's Prophecy? You know, that central plot theme that drove the motivation for nearly every character in the entire series and was the whole reason for Ciri's existence in the first place? Who cares? The story is over. What about the plague that was spreading and was implied that Ciri brought from another world? What plague? Wild Hunt who? It felt like Sapkowski just got sick of writing and decided to walk away, killing his main characters in the process so he wouldn't ever be tempted to come back to them.

Some people really liked the ending and I might have been one of them if so much hadn't been left hanging. Geralt and Yennifer's sendoff was kind of poetic and really symbolic of Arthurian mythology. You just have to ignore that Yennifer didn't really deserve Geralt or a poetic sendoff to begin with.

But that's where the games come in. Problem is...

&amp;#x200B;

**6) The story in the games is probably off limits.**   The games come in and pick up where the books left off, resurrecting Geralt and Yennifer and most of the major plotlines are tied up in a fairly satisfying way. Geralt frees himself of the wish he made to the djinn by making another wish to a new djinn and the player is given the opportunity to choose Yennifer and all her flaws or Triss who was made into the main love interest for most of the game series. Ciri is retconned into the savior of the world instead of her child (thank goodness), with Geralt's help she avoids the Wild Hunt's grasp and she averts Ithlinne's Prophecy using her powers without the need to be bread by any man. In the good ending, Ciri follows her dream of becoming a witcher and Geralt gifts her her very own pair of swords before they part ways.

But oh boy does Sapkowski hate these games. Or maybe it's more accurate to say he hates video games as a medium on the whole. He's kind of like the personification of Old Man Yells at Cloud. He famously took a flat payment as opposed to a % of earnings from CD PROJEKT RED to license The Witcher property because he was convinced there was no way a game could ever make any money and then when The Witcher 3 became a global phenomenon, [sued CDPR for more money](https://www.polygon.com/2019/12/20/21032021/the-witcher-author-cd-projekt-legal-battle-royalties-new-contract). He also firmly believes/believed that the fact that there are games at all actually costs him [readers by association with the games](https://vulkk.com/2016/08/30/creator-of-the-witcher-books-andrzej-sapkowski-hates-the-witcher-video-games/). He later seems to have softened his view on the games but it still seems unlikely he would approve of their canon being used to finish up his story on the screen. Further, the storyline of the games would actually be the intellectual property of CDPR and would likely require Netflix license it separately.

So unless the Netflix series decides to follow the books and just haphazardly end the series with the central arc of the  whole saga left completely unresolved, they'll probably have to write their own completely original ending to the series.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**7) Why it's all okay.**  So you might be thinking at this point, ""Why would Netflix ever choose to adapt such a train wreck and who would ever like something like this?"" and the answer is, well, in spite of it all, the world is still quite good. Geralt, Ciri, Triss, Yennifer (when she's not being infuriating) and all the side characters that I haven't brought up because this is already a novel, they're all interesting characters. The world is full of mystery and the whole conjunction of spheres thing makes it an easy world to self-insert into. There are vampires, dragons, shape-shifters, dwarves, elves, witches, unicorns, magic, dimension jumping. It's mostly a pretty good time.

I think the main problem is that Sapkowski tried to subvert expectations in two main points by 1) making one half of the pre-destined power couple an absolute horror and 2) by making the chosen one not really the chosen one. You have to give him credit for sticking to his decision in both cases even if it was largely to the detriment of his overall narrative.

But the point is, you could still largely tell this story in a not icky way by making some adjustments. I'm sure a lot of hardcore fans would be upset by that but I'm not sure I care about upsetting people if what they want to see is grown men fighting over who gets to rape a child. If I was one of the writers challenged with adapting this story in a way that satisfies the fans and author while still not completely putting off a whole new audience, I'd probably actively dislike it too.

I'm not really faulting Sapkowski over it either. He wrote these books decades ago for an audience with a completely different culture than the one that is adapting it to the screen. The written word is not set in stone and when things are adapted, we *should* be trying to update them in the same ways that society has grown and matured.

&amp;#x200B;

Things that might change my mind:

* Here's why Yennifer is totally redeemable without changing her character arc at all...
* These other movies/shows were all about wandering too but they were adapted faithfully...
* Emhyr's motivation was about more than that...
* Ithlinne's Prophecy was never all that important because... so the ending is perfectly fine the way it is...
* You're misunderstanding international IP laws or the author's opinion on the games so the story from the games is actually still in play...
* This is not okay. None of this is okay. This series is irredeemable and should be burned. We shouldn't be seeking to adapt to things that are this perverse because...

Things that won't change my mind:

* People actually wouldn't mind it if Geralt's peace was with Yennifer even though she's terrible. (I don't know about you but that would be a major turn off for me)
* LOTR was all about wandering and those movies worked. (They definitely worked, I agree, but they weren't really faithful to the books)
* You're *supposed* to hate Emhyr so it doesn't matter that his motivation makes your skin crawl. (I just can't with this. You can write despicable characters without forced incest being a plot line.)
* The story is great without its central plotline being resolved. (Listen, I appreciate that you can get past that but we're just going to have to agree to disagree on that one.)
* All of that stuff is fine. The plot did not need to change at all. (Eww)
* You were able to overlook these things and enjoy the series as it was despite its flaws. Why would we need to change them just because it's being adapted? (Because we can. It's a fictional world. We're not bound by anything to keep it exactly as it was originally written. There's no reason we can't create a version of this world that can be enjoyed without the need for overlooking these gigantic elephants in the room.)"

Now, some points first.

1. I believe that the grievances presented-insufficient pay increases and administrative difficulties, are valid.
2. I believe Government does have an obligation to ensure financial stability for as many of it's citizens as it can.
3. I am not opposed to Unions being empowered to negotiate with any level of Government.

Regardless,  i consider schools to be an essential service and we know govt partisanship can result in lack of good faith on either side. We don't allow hospitals to close down when Nurse's unions have issues, we don't allow law enforcement, firefighters or the army to do it-because that would negatively impact society as a whole. A bunch of kids going brain-fart after missing months of school over a wage increase seems like a bigger human rights concern to me than a 6% pay increase. 

In general, i disapprove of strikes. Once someone commits to employment, they have a duty to perform and if the work environment or pay is hindering them, they can leave. Ceasing operations-while still drawing strike pay-in order to force the government to comply might have been a morally valid tactic when it was about miners and industrial workers literally dying from unsafe working conditions, or in cases of racial/gender based/etc equality, but when it is over financial disputes and administrative minutiae, it smacks more of dereliction of duty than it does civil disobedience. It wasn't long ago that complaints like that were not tolerated and dealt with harshly by governments. Inconveniencing a whole segment of the population-parents and caregivers-and delaying critically needed post-COVID education is not a right anybody should be entitled to."

If you use spank a child and explain why you did it, how is it wrong? There have been kids who were spanked (within reason) and turned out fine despite what society says. I have some examples. Not every parent who spanks is an angry abuser.

Let’s say your niece or child keeps disrespecting authority. Nothing works; therapy, talking to them, doctors, discipline. What do you do?

Or how about a bully? There’s been a time in which a kid was bullying another and once the school found out, they were paddled in front of everyone. This was in Africa mind you so would this be morally unjustifiable? Abusive?

More importantly, what about younger ones that don’t know danger very well? If you see a younger kid walking towards something dangerous, you can pull them away and (lightly) spank them.

Some of my friends were absolutely terrible kids and their elders beat the shit out of them. They are well-behaved adults now.

Given the circumstance , there’s also nothing wrong whit a parent slapping a child or teen for being disrespectful  or acting out. Some might even ask why I wouldn’t slap an adult for the same behavior. It’s simple, adults know better, they know right from wrong.

Some say hitting is abuse but abuse needs to be continuous. If I hit someone did I physically abuse them?

In order to change my view, show me how: 
1) hitting/spanking a child in these circumstances would harm them even though it is done with no impulsivity or abusive tendencies 
2) demonstrate how all of my examples are flawed
3) what are effective alternatives?"
0,2022-11-02,CMV: White men who date Asian women mostly do it because they have an Asian fetish and Asian women who tend to date white men for more superficial reasons.,u/deadfermata,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ykkqzw/cmv_white_men_who_date_asian_women_mostly_do_it/,changemyview,"I am not opposed to interracial relationships at all. Date whomever you want of any race or gender or class or ideology but it seems to me when it comes to WMAF relationships particularly, it's usually because the white guy has an Asian fetish and often Asian fetishes are rooted in some certain stereotypes of Asian women. 

I am not saying that a white guy + asian women can't love one another. I have friends who are in interracial relationships but it seems to me there are generally reasons under the surface of 'romance' that are seemingly more focused on a racial component and this can sometimes perpetuate certain stereotypes or fetishes while unintentionally (or sometimes intentionally) putting down a certain group.

I have also notice that many (not all) Asian women who prefer white men do it because of one or more of the following reasons: 1) they view having a white partner as a symbol of class and success 2) they want a biracial child because often Hapas are viewed as more ""cute"" or ""attractive"" 3) they dislike Asian men for a host of different reasons which often is rooted in prejudices that would otherwise be considered 'racist' if expressed by other non-asians

And white men who prefer Asians often have 'Yellow Fever.' 

I live in silicon valley and see a lot of these types of relationships and then I also see a lot of white men who travel to SE Asia and marry petite, often younger women, as well. 

I don't deny that a WM + AF can also be in love and I think it's great when two people love each other can be together regardless of their background but it seems to me often there are other factors at play beyond just 'we have a lot in common' or 'they're a great person' or 'we are extremely compatible' All those things may be true but there seems to also be this other less bright reasons that isn't really talked about.

Or am I way off? Feel free to offer other perspectives I might be missing! :)"

A lot of people use this as an example of how racism is alive and well in America.  If anything, I think that these events tend to show the exact opposite.  

Whenever something like this happens, it is met with international outrage.  It is condemned by people across the isle and there are usually pretty severe social consequences.  Last year when Morgan Wallen was filmed using a racial slur(not even directed at a black person) he was banned from radio stations and suspended by his record label. This is just one example but it is seen pretty often whenever a seemingly racist act by a famous white person is recorded or rediscovered.  

Basically I am of the opinion that the outpouring of people condemning the act combined with the social consequences which usually follow such acts are more evidence that racism is on the downward slope.  I’m not saying it’s gone or that nobody is effected by it, just that it’s dying out."

They were all used vehicles. I’ve been stuck in car payments for decades. It is a viscous circle. 

That all stopped in 2020. We had one car payment then. And we decided to sell that vehicle, pay it off and pay cash for a used car. 

The effect has been sublime. Car payments are relentless. Then there is the higher insurance costs. And you have to maintain the car either way. 

So on that month that you finally spring for new tires you end up spending double or triple of what your car payment is. It hurts. 

I’m a backyard mechanic and I do a lot of my own maintenance. So that helps me save even more money. And we are in better financial shape then we used to be in. Still, I’d rather drive a used Camry than have a car payment. 

TLDR: car payments are crushing the middle class. Many would be much better off with an affordable, reliable used vehicle. I know the car market is crushed atm, but there are deals out there."

I've voted Democrat my entire life, but I might vote for a Republican in the midterms and my hope is that Republicans win either the House or the Senate (but not both.)

I generally think my opinions and the opinions of most moderates are reasonable. The only area where I'm extreme is climate change (I think a lot of moderates support drastic action where climate change is concerned because it's an existential threat.) Besides that I want to reform the police, not defund them, I support the LGBTQIA+ movement, I have mixed feelings about CRT, I am against mandated political correctness and censorship, I believe everybody should have healthcare, food, water, and shelter and the government should provide it if necessary, I believe weed should be legal as well and everybody should have equal opportunity. 

Moderates are a very diverse group, so I can't speak for every moderate, but the positions I mentioned seem like fairly common moderate positions. All of them seem pretty reasonable. 

Yet we're anathema to many on the left and some on the right (I personally have experienced far more venom from leftists than I have from the right, although I've definitely experienced it from both.) It seems like some leftists hate moderates *more* than outright conservatives. 

I'll admit, there are some people that call themselves moderate because they can't be bothered to research the issues and take a stance on them. They want some of everything because they don't know much about anything. I understand why that would be frustrating. But most moderates identify as moderates because they've researched the issues and they like some aspects of both parties. Maybe they don't like how extreme the parties have become and they find their views are more middle of the road. I don't see what's wrong with that or why there's so much animosity towards moderates. I don't think it's deserved.

Expanding on what I said because I feel like I didn't make a strong enough case for moderates. I think moderates:

-Help ensure national stability and that things don't get too out of whack in any direction

-Offer an important alternative perspective to mainstream thought

-strengthen third parties so, potentially one day there will be more than two viable options."

If everyone were to purely pursue their own happiness, there would be an abundance of immoral actions. But even more than those that find their happiness in doing harm, as this is likely a small part of the population, most people spend their lives not doing harm but not doing good either, instead they selfishly focus on themselves in everyday choices. Unfortunately, what makes many people happy does not include helping others; instead, it goes to feeding their urges with food, drugs, sex, and entertainment. This lifestyle is a poor orientation of how to live for the following reasons:

When there is such a staggering amount of suffering in the world, doing what makes us happy must be a secondary motivation. We should be telling people to do what does good for the world, good being defined as limiting suffering and increasing well-being. Whether or not that is what makes you the most happy in the world should not matter. It is great if a person finds fulfillment and happiness in doing good, but if they do not, that should not be the reason they pursue a life that purely fulfills their own definition of happiness. I want to give the following example:

John finds that he is at his happiest when in his log cabin out in the woods. When he’s there, he sits in his cabin, reads a book, and is at his maximum happiness. While John is in his cabin in the woods, a nearby city sets on fire. As a physically strong adult, John could help set out the fire by going back home and carrying buckets of water to help put out the fire. Sure, John could not stop the entire city from burning, but he can help where he is needed and do his part in saving a part of the city. Instead, John decides that he is not happy when doing physically tiring work, and remains in his cabin, choosing to fulfill his own happiness.

This is an issue for several reasons. We tend to think that the act of not helping is morally different than the act of doing harm. While the intent is different, the consequence can be similar, and a duty remains that if one is capable of limiting suffering, they have a moral obligation to do so. Additionally, even if John does not find happiness in helping others, his discomfort in doing physical labor is outweighed by the immense suffering and pain of those who might die in fire, or those losing all of their worldly possessions. If someone had the capabilities to be the best scientist in the world, and had the best chance to cure cancer and save millions, I argue that they have a duty to be a scientist. If that individual said that they find happiness in playing chess professionally, then they are choosing their own happiness over the lives of potentially millions. If it is clear that the scientist should pursue research, even if that doesn't make him happy, then we should all be pursuing careers and lives that effectively help others, even if it is not our favorite activity in the world.

When we tell people to do what makes them happy, and that includes watching tv 4 hours every night after getting home from work, they are choosing to sit in their cabin while the world burns. In the world, millions of people every year die from lack of clean water, starvation, disease, natural disaster; on top of those who die, an even larger number are living with large amounts of suffering in their daily lives. Those of us who have the capabilities to do something about that should be actively helping those that were born into different circumstances, and telling people to do whatever makes them happy limits the progress of this goal. While it is impossible to be doing good every second of every day, I am unwilling to say that there is nothing somebody laying on the couch can do to help their fellow human.

Edit 1: I would like to address the point that the fire analogy puts one in harm's way. I understand that and the point is to address a situation where an individual has the ability to help others and chooses not to, without the risk of dying themselves but instead discomfort. I was considering a different analogy, saving a child drowning in a shallow pond, where there is no risk of you dying but just the discomfort of perhaps getting your clothes and phone wet, and would like to insert that instead."

However, I don’t think this should be the case as often as it is. 

I live in an area where the daily commute is atrocious into downtown, especially along the highway spurs. In order to merge onto mine, I start to get over a few miles back even if I can’t go as fast as I want- I’ll avoid having to rush/tailgate/squeeze at the ramp. Instead of most people doing this, they wait until they’re directly next to the exit, come to a full stop, and try to bully their way into a slow moving line of cars trying to merge onto the spur. 

I have seen so many near misses due to unsuspecting drivers further back not anticipating someone being fully stopped. Not going somewhat slow and moving, but just not moving at all. Then everyone going at speed has to slam on brakes because of this one person thinking they’re important enough to stop an entire lane of traffic to get in line with people who actually merged at the correct time. This is so dangerous. If there isn’t a traffic light or traffic jam, you need to be moving with everyone else. Get off at the next exit or merge earlier, both are exponentially safer.

Edit: DFW. The metro area I’m referring to is DFW. Thank you kind Redditor for pointing out the oversight."

1,2022-11-03,CMV: Opening up verification on Twitter is a smart idea,u/optiongeek,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yl63fr/cmv_opening_up_verification_on_twitter_is_a_smart/,changemyview,"There's been lots of commentary about Musk's recent announcement on changes coming to Twitter's verification process. While much of the discussion has focused on the new $8/mo fee, the biggest impact will actually be dropping the requirement on *notability*. After the change, a blue check ✔️ badge will be offered to anyone who can provide the requisite forms of identification and is willing to pay the subscription. Before, the badge was only available if you could establish *notability*. In Twitter's definition, being notable is roughly equivalent to qualifying for a Wikipedia page. That is, you had to demonstrate sufficient mentions in reliable sources in order to convince the reviewer that you are important enough to deserve recognition. 

According to Musk, dropping the requirement on notability, while maintaining the rest of the verification process, is needed to combat purveyors of spam. The reasoning is that it will be significantly more expensive for a spammer to try to fake the verification process (which requires government-issued ID), and therefore spam will no longer be economic. If a Twitter publisher is being beset by spambots, they can simply restrict replies to verified accounts only. Since the spammers won't be able to get their accounts easily verified, they will be locked out of the replies and won't be able to promote their message.

So, on the surface, Musk's basic argument makes sense. The meat of the discussion will take place between only verified accounts. Everyone is able to participate, including the ability to contribute. But you will be disadvantaged in the reach of your comments until you go through verification. As Nassim Taleb would put it, only those with ""skin in the game"" get to play.

So the counter argument is put forward by those who are currently verified and stand to lose the most in terms of lost prestige. They argue that by right of merit they should enjoy a privileged place in the discussion. Their voice should continue to be the loudest because they have undergone the process of verification and are notable.

However, as described above, the only thing that is changing is the notability requirement is being dropped. There is no requirement that the notability that was used to obtain the badge is directly related to the arguments in which the badge holder participates. You might be notable because you had a brief gig on a reality TV show. Why should that person's voice be amplified in a debate about monetary policy? 

It shouldn't.

The correct answer is Twitter has no business trying to assess the credentials someone brings to the debate. Twitter should simply offer a service to verify that someone is literally who they say they are and leave it at that. It should be up to the reader to assess the speaker's background on his or her own. 

Musk talks about the current system as one of ""lords and peasants"". And he's correct to want to do away with it. His proposal to open up the verification process by dropping the notability requirement is a smart first step. Add to this the ability to significantly reduce spam and I think Twitter will be significantly improved by these changes."

For all employees, the ability of employers to dictate employees' speech creates a chilling effect on freedom of speech that is unacceptable. The public interest in political discourse outweighs any interest the companies have. Fundamentally this is no different then the laws preventing companies from firing people for being gay, pregnant, etc

Exceptions to this law:
This restriction does not apply to companies with 15 or fewer total employees (the imposition of freedom of speech, mainly freedom of association argument is fairly reasonable for a small business, but for large businesses it's much less reasonable)

This restriction does not apply if the employee is acting in the name of the company. If you work for Acmy and you are acting in such a way that a reasonable person could think you are representing Acme then you can get fired for that behavior. Examples of this would be wearing corporate swag at a protest, posting on social media with an account that marks you out as working for Acmy, etc

This restriction does not apply for behavior that does carry over into work. The most obvious example is harassment of employees outside of work.

This behavior does not apply for criminal convictions and you can be suspended without pay if charged pending a trial's conclusion.

This restriction does not apply for people hired specifically due to their status as a public figure or specifically to be a public figure. You can still fire a movie actor or other public figures for non-criminal misconduct.

Edit: had internet problems, I'm back now

Edit 2. Almost every argument I'm getting is a variation of ""why should a business be required to not discriminate against someone if a bunch of people are retaliating against the business for not firing that person. I am going to post a question someone gave and my response to it and stop answering this argument.

&gt; Businesses don't exist purely to pay people's wages. They make/sell products and services, and are directly impacted by bad press. Requiring that they retain an employee despite that employee's outside behavior causing national/international outrage is requiring that they be harmed by that employee's behavior with no recourse. 
&gt;
&gt;This bad press only happens because pressuring companies to fire people the mob didn't like works. During reconstruction people firebombed businesses that hired black employees. The firebombing stopped because it wasn't effective because it was illegal to discriminate against someone for their race.
&gt;
&gt;The same thing has happened with being openly gay, being Muslim, or being pregnant.
&gt;
&gt;The fact is that people's rights to freedom of religion and of freedom of sexuality are protected. People know this so they stopped taking their hatred out on businesses that refused to discriminate against them (because they were not allowed to not refuse to discriminate).
&gt;
&gt;Freedom of speech is more important then freedom of religion. Freedom of speech is the only reason we have protections for gays, homosexuals, transgenders, pregnant woman, etc. We absolutely should protect it the same as we protect other rights."
24,2022-11-03,CMV: AI art does more harm to artists than it benefits.,u/burgerkinger_victor,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yl7w9e/cmv_ai_art_does_more_harm_to_artists_than_it/,changemyview,"Before I state my stance on AI art, I must establish what I consider an artist to be. In this case, I am talking about digital artists, fine painters, and concept artists. Like most of you, I believed that AI could never automate creative fields like art, music, and animation. However, since Stable Diffusion was open to the public and open-sourced in recent months, the power of AI art has increased dramatically. Now, there are art pieces that look so human-like, that even I have a hard time distinguishing what's AI and what's human.  


At that point, I'm actually terrified of what these programs could do to art as a whole. So, now I'm dreading what the future holds for artists like me, especially when it comes to digital art. Now, let's establish why I view AI art to be harmful to artists.

1. It will cheapen art: Turns out, artists are humans too, and like humans, we have to eat, sleep, and work. If everyone can create masterpiece looking art without extensive training or education, it will cheapen art and the value that comes from craftsmanship. Why hire someone to paint you a stunning-looking landscape, when you can just generate it yourself? This would, of course, increase the supply of gorgeous art while decreasing the demand for human artists. This would cause a dramatic reduction in wages for artists as art as a whole would be less in demand.
2. Loss of job opportunities: I think this is obvious, but AI art will lead to a decrease in the number of jobs that an artist can have. If I want my favorite character to be drawn fighting Walter White, I would have to commission a digital artist to see my vision come to life. However, with the advent of AI art, I can just write a prompt and select the ones that I like the best.
3. Increase of art scammers: AI art has allowed anyone to pose as an artist, and obviously people will take advantage of this tech to fraud commissioners. I can just simply use AI-generated art and sell it to unsuspecting commissioners on freelance sites like Fiverr. 
4. Unethical gathering of datasets: Do you know why AI-generated music isn't as powerful as AI-generated art? It is because the power of music labels scared these companies into using only Public Domain music for their datasets. Unfortunately for the artists, we don't have a giant, powerful corporation that is looking out for our interests. Therefore, companies like Open AI can just put as many artworks as they can into their datasets without the expressed consent of the artists.

All in all, I know that AI art is here to stay, no matter how much I dread the upcoming AI apocalypse. The only thing that's holding companies from firing their artists is the legal grey area of AI art. As of right now, nobody knows if AI art should be copyrightable or not. Please, I want to be hopeful of AI art, but I just can't see any hope as an artist in the near future..."

I believe that this warning is ineffective at conveying what it is trying to convey: the size of objects that should not be put in your ear. The ""correct"" warning to teach people should be both practical and easily understood in modern conversation - thus, my arguments below largely have to do with how the common person *reacts* incorrectly to the warning, and some parts are rather rhetorical in my attempts to express what people are thinking. Though not in the scope of this CMV, I will state my tentative alternative as ""don't put anything inside your ear"" to help frame my arguments below.

&amp;#x200B;

* **(1) Your elbow is visually unintuitive.** The first time you heard this warning, you probably tried to look at your elbow to see how big it is. This immediately leads to a problem: you can't see your own elbow because your arm is blocking your view. You might have been lucky enough to have a nearby mirror/smartphone, but soon you realize that this doesn't actually tell you how big your *ear* is, which is what's actually important, not your elbow. Your next action, then, is to put your elbow next to your ear. This is not possible, of course, so with some luck you might have a nearby friend to lend an ear. Once you stick your elbow into their ear, however, you find that you are once again back at your original problem: your arm is in the way, so you can't see your elbow - or your friend's ear, for that matter.
* **(2a) Your elbow size is ambiguous** \- and, **the common definition of ""elbow"" does not match what the warning is actually referring to** (unless it actually is your entire elbow?). What is ""your elbow?"" If I say to you, ""show me how big your elbow is,"" you would naturally point your elbow at me and perhaps cup it with your hand. In other words, your ""entire elbow"" is a size that fits comfortably in your hand. Then I follow up with ""don't put your elbow in your ear."" Question marks should now be popping up. This is like me telling you ""don't put a basketball in your mouth."" The natural reaction wouldn't be, ""Oh! That makes sense, I'll endeavor to be more careful from now on,"" but rather something like, ""...? What? How is that even... am I missing something?"" At that point, you would understand not to take my statement at face value and start to investigate your elbow. Sure enough, you come up with evidence that might redefine your concept of ""elbow,"" at least as it pertains to the warning. Is it the bony part sticking out at the end? Or does it also include the other bony part? Or the other one? What if you don't have 3 bony parts? Hmm, let's take the smallest case scenario and say it's just the one bony part. So you use your free hand to trace the bone along your arm to see where it ends... oh wait, you're at your wrist now, that can't be right. Ah, it's because you traced along the bone instead of getting the cross section, of course! So you trace in the other direction... oh wait, your bone goes inside your arm, and now your skin and your other bony part is in the way. What a bummer. Clearly, there is ambiguity in the definition of ""elbow"" at this point: maybe it's the ""entire elbow,"" or ""the bony part,"" or somewhere in between. The only solution to this ambiguity would be to broadcast a PSA to everyone that this warning refers to such-and-such part of your elbow (assuming it is easily identifiable). Otherwise, you might have to resort to using logic to figure out what part of your elbow the warning is talking about, which leads to:
* **(2b) What is ""your ear?""** I'm inclined to believe that everyone would initially assume that ""inside your ear"" means your ear canal. However, when you also include ""don't stick your elbow in"" in the same sentence, that's when this issue crops up (the basketball analogy in 2a). As described in (2a), there are about two possibilities for your elbow. There are also two possibilities for your ear: your outer ear, and your ear canal. Thus, there are 2x2 = 4 combinations. You immediately recognize that your *entire elbow* is way too big to fit inside your ear canal. However, your *bony part* is also far too large to fit inside your ear canal from what you can surmise. After all, you've put your own fingers against your ear canal plenty of times before you ever heard this warning, and it doesn't even get close to going in. From your best estimates (see 3), your finger is smaller than your elbow, too. Thus, the warning must not be referring to your ear canal. Then, does the warning mean that your *bony part* should not go in your outer ear then? That sounds very odd, considering how incredibly large your outer ear is in comparison. By process of elimination then, the warning must be talking about your *entire elbow* going into your outer ear, which makes sense because they're about the same size. Excellent! ... Wait, weren't we talking removing ear wax from inside our ears? What does the outer ear have anything to do with that?
* **(3) There is no practical way to measure your elbow's size.** The first thing you probably did for this part is use your free hand to cup your elbow (as in 1). You're not very satisfied with this measurement, though, because it feels like you're measuring a volume of an arbitrary part of your elbow. Besides, your cupped hand looks far too large to even consider sticking it into your ear (as in 2), so that can't be right. Certainly, a cross section would be more accurate and applicable. If you're lucky enough to have a ring-shaped object lying around nearby, perhaps like a coffee mug, you can try to approximate how large your elbow is. So you stick your elbow in... hmm, how far do you need to put your elbow (or bony part) through for it to count? What about the fact that your bicep is expanding your arm and making it harder to fit your elbow into the coffee mug? Naturally, your follow up is to extend your arm a bit to get your muscles out of the way- OH NO! Now your elbow doesn't go into the coffee mug at all anymore! What a disaster!
* **(4) Even as an approximation, elbows are an inferior reference.** Perhaps you might argue that the warning was not meant to be a strict measurement, just an estimate. My counterargument is that there are better options. Remember how you tried elbowing your friend's ear in (1)? From that, you can at least tell that your friend's ear is about the same size as your elbow, so perhaps you can re-approximate the warning as ""don't put anything smaller than your ear in your ear."" Some other commonly-recognized reference sizes include ping pong balls, your big toe, or just ""an inch."" (I still can't tell if the warning pertains to your entire elbow or the bony part, so I went for examples in the middle).
* **(5) There is no intuition of the danger of putting your elbow in your ear** OR **the warning does not match the danger** (I'm not sure how to concisely summarize this part of the argument). If you told someone ""don't stick a pencil up your nose,"" they would probably immediately wince at the concept. This is because pencils are pointy and thin enough for many people to actually stick them up their noses. Meanwhile, an elbow is a soft, round object that doesn't even get close to going inside your ear canal (again, the finger argument in (2)). And besides, what about all the other things smaller than our elbow that we put in our ears, like airpods, earplugs, or- Heaven forbid, *stethoscopes*? Though stories of injuries exist, it is plain that such things are way too rare to even consider in every day life, and humans are bad at conceptualizing tiny probabilities. Thus, this warning achieves little in deterring someone from picking earwax out of their ears, just like how trying to convince someone to stop drinking because ""you are at greater risk of contracting cancer"" will be similarly unsuccessful.

Deltas will be given to those who can show that any of my 5.5 arguments above are flawed, but to really change my view, I think I would need counterarguments for all of them (luckily, several of them are correlated). Also, if you happen to know which part of the elbow this warning is really talking about, I would love to know.

EDIT: forgot to include one clarification: the reason why this argument exists is because of (5) - we DO put things smaller than our elbow in our ear. Therefore, your counterargument needs to explain how this warning can be justified despite how so many people apparently ignore it."

I recognize that this is a bit subjective, however, I qualify this View with ""coolest"" and ""21st century"" for a few reasons:

1. Engineering feats that needed to happen before this cannot be surpassed. Rocket physics that lead to the moon landing, for example.
2. Feats accomplished with far less technology than is available now in the 21st century should also be categorized differently. Thinking about more construction labor-based feats such as the Panama Canal, Empire State Building, etc.
3. There are a plenty of 21st century engineering feats that may qualify as incredible feats of engineering principles (nuclear physics advancements, for example) but are not as visually spectacular as seeing two rockets fly down from above and land themselves.

Other direct reasons that I consider a SpaceX landing to be incredibly marvelous:

1. The lack of precedence. For decades, the government burned money (both literally and figuratively) on single-use rockets and boosters that were discarded into the sea to be retrieved later. Within 2 decades of R&amp;D, SpaceX effectively made that method go extinct.
2. The math involved. IANARS (I am Not a Rocket Scientist), but I believe that independently, the equations involved are not too complex. But together, nailing a launch window, launch trajectory, thrust physics, wind, booster mass (and changes in mass due to fuel burn), and Earth's rotation among others all together seems nigh-on impossible to my smooth brain.
3. The audiovisual spectacle. How can you beat a rocket launch, (livestreamed to the internet the entire way!) followed by the very same rockets guiding themselves back to Earth for you to see them emerge from the sky above you with glowing thrust beneath them, creating sonic booms before slowing down at remarkable speed to land on a launch pad or drone ship in the ocean, on a precise bullseye as the Earth rotated beneath it the *entire time*?

I love great spectacles of humanity like this. Whether it's engineering spectacles like this that bring a tear to my eye, or sports feats that take a lifetime to achieve. I'm ready to hear about any greater recent engineering marvels. CMV."

I see a trend lately that every company ever is advertising ""Here at xyz we believe that we all need to do our part in climate change, that's why for every $100 spent we'll plant one tree!"" and so on.

You can see it in examples of [greenwashing](https://www.offshore-technology.com/analysis/how-greenwashing-ads-can-be-terrible-for-the-environment/) everywhere.

Companies are realizing they can no longer accept that climate change isn't real, otherwise they will lose customers. They accept climate change is real, do the bare minimum by greenwashing their products, or even making actual efforts such as moving to [solar powered](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/28/10-massive-corporations-going-big-on-solar-power.html) production plants, [carbon-neutral plans](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209580992100429X) for countries like China, or even the a bigger consumer buy-in for [electric cars.](https://www.anl.gov/esia/light-duty-electric-drive-vehicles-monthly-sales-updates)

My point is that all this does is tell us that we can continue to grow and expand our economy and live life as is when there is a lot of [evidence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352550921002931) showing that carbon neutrality by 2050 with business as usual methods of growth in capitalism simply won't work. We need to scale down our production and way of living to even hit 2 degrees warming by [2030.](https://www.ipcc.ch/2022/04/04/ipcc-ar6-wgiii-pressrelease/) 

If these companies continued to deny climate change, most people would start to turn on them, and degrowth ideally would naturally follow. Instead, we follow along blindly because the masses have been told that solar panels will save us and we don't need a larger focus on public transit, less consumption of meat, etc.

TLDR: Companies are greenwashing by saying we can live life as is with electric cars, solar panels, and recycling while continuing to grow under a capitalist system, when in reality the only way to reverse climate change is by reducing our intake, staying local with food production, and overall reducing the way the west consumes."
0,2022-11-03,CMV: NYSRPA v Bruen is bad law and should be overturned or ignored.,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yldmfk/cmv_nysrpa_v_bruen_is_bad_law_and_should_be/,changemyview,"If Roe was (supposedly) bad law (it wasn't), then Bruen is worse law. Gun control very much has a history and tradition within the United States and therefore it's fine. Remember Blair Mountain? Gives it history and tradition. Those miners had their guns controlled by the federal government to the point they were hiding them in the woods like the cowards they were lmao.

  


Remember prohibition and the resulting NFA? Thay gives gun control history and tradition.

  


There has never been a single time in American history where ""history and tradition"" (whatever the fuck that actually means since it's intentionally vague) has ever been used in the making of any law anywhere. This is way worse than trying to say that the right to privacy is also the right to abortion (that tracks unlike saying gun control needs history and tradition to be upheld).

  


Besides, Bruen can be ignored through the power of lawfare. Just keep making gun laws and eventually some will stick. There are two states (the richest I might add! They have all the financial centers) who are currently just ignoring Bruen as we speak with zero pushback from SCOTUS. Blue states can keep making as many gun laws as they want and eventually the gun nut Thomas will resign.

  


I want to hear real responses. If it's less than a paragraph it will be ignored because gun nuts love to just respond to these by getting red in the face, throwing insults, frothing at the mouth and screaming ""STACK UP AND TRY!!!!!"" and ""SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED!!!!!"" even though there is in fact history and tradition for infringement at this point.

Explain it like you're a lawyer. In fact if a lawyer sees this explain it! You'll do a better job than any gun nut I've talked to. They just hurl insults."

Many people seem to instantly hate billionaires like Elon Musk meanwhile raving about how great Taylor Swift or Justin Bieber is.

For instance:

Jeff Bezos started companies many people use today, and created many jobs in the process. Meanwhile Taylor Swift is creating no (or very very minimal) jobs for people, and consuming 8,294 tonnes of carbon emissions in 200 days. Taylor Swift is also very rich. Cardi B used to drug and rob men. Justin Bieber has DUIs and openly said the n word multiple times. I don't recall Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos doing these things yet somehow they still get all the hate.

0,2022-11-04,CMV: Caffeine is not addictive nor harmful (for healthy individuals),u/acorneyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ymcmy8/cmv_caffeine_is_not_addictive_nor_harmful_for/,changemyview,"To be clear, I’m not saying you can’t become addicted to caffeine, or that it can’t become harmful. Physiologically it’s not addictive or harmful, consistent with society’s interpretation of addictive substances which resemble DSM’s criteria for addictive substances.

To draw a comparison, vitamin C is not addictive nor harmful, yet it is technically possible to become psychologically dependent on ingesting vitamin C, and consuming copious amounts of vitamin C is bound to cause issues after a certain dosage.

I wouldn’t normally think this is something that should even be debated because this has been studied before and journals agree caffeine isn’t addictive.

However it seems everytime I post studies regarding caffeine in threads claiming caffeine is addictive, I’m downvoted. Maybe I’m missing something, maybe I’m misinterpreting the studies.

[Caffeine blocks A2a receptors, which adenosine regulates dopamine release.](https://www.nature.com/articles/1395880#Sec17) Indirectly this means caffeine consumption increases dopamine release, making addictive substances not-insignificantly more potent. However because it does not bind to dopamine receptors directly, it does not reinforce self-administration.

You can experience withdrawals, but those side-effects pass and there is no physiological desire to continue using caffeine.

There are no reported negative health effects due to use of caffeine. [Unless you are an at-risk individual.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5445139/) Which aligns with what I said about dopamine release being more potent (though pregnant women and high-blood pressure individuals are at risk too).

Being harmful to at-risk individuals is true of any substance (see vitamin C). 

The what-about-ism that’s posted about caffeine is in my view an outrage-based misinformation campaign that parrots unsubstantiated claims and anecdotal evidence.

Things like addictive substances, and soda (both of which are often used for the what-about-ism) have been studied to have negative health effects on healthy people. The comparison is beyond unfair."

But inflicted pain, suffering, physical and mental trauma is the same now and at least half a hundred thousands years ago.

That's why I believe is fair to judge old figures such as Columbus with today's standards, because from a broader point of view the people that suffered abuses under them are the ones being treated unfairly, forgetting and justifying their suffering with that phrase, as if their suffering was any different than today.

**Edit:** I'm deleting the post, I'm happy for the positive engagement but I just haven't been this mentally exhausted trying to justify my view to that many answers. I've read the big ones but have felt a bit too lazy to answer each point of them individually. I agree that my example is probably not the best given that Columbus was negatively judged even on his time, I agree that presentism has no use on trying to understand a historical character situation or reasoning, but I don't think I have a problem trying to understand why someone did what he/she did, and neither I do it to feel morally superior.

To change my view it would require proof that judging the past with present standards ends up creating lies instead of, *what I believe doing so brings*, truth."

I feel that in a lot of ways it would be much better if being a juror was a paid job just like a lawyer or judge.

For one thing the decided verdicts would be a lot more accurate and professional as the jury would be composed of people who have had experience in analyzing court cases and are more passionate towards the field. Whereas if it were random citizens many of them may either not be as good at analyzing the evidence, or not be willing to take the case as seriously since they just want to get out.

One extra added benefit is of course people not having to do jury duty anymore which would definitely lift a burden off of everyone, but another one is that it would introduce a ton of new jobs into the job market, which could help reduce unemployment.

The arguments I have heard against it is that it could lead to the legal system becoming more corrupt, especially if the jury works under the government, so perhaps to prevent this jury teams could work under private companies, but I'm not exactly sure how this would play out in practice. I think there's a way to do it in a way that makes the system fair, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to be able propose anything concrete."

To begin, I want to point out an important nuance in my view point. Notice my use of the word 'reasonable' in the title as opposed to 'justified' or 'right'. 

I believe Allah forbids alcohol for the same reason that many non-American countries forbid the ownership of guns. 

When you're making a rule for millions or billions of people, you have to be dystopian to some degree. The reason why countries like UK, where I'm from, forbid guns is because there will be a large contingent of people that will abuse their privilege and ruin it for the rest. Yes, sure, perhaps the overwhelming majority will not go around shooting people left, right and centre. But a big enough minority would. Hence, you have to generalise. It's just about prevention rather than cure, which is Islam's general way of doing things.

It's the same with alcohol. Sure, you can make the argument, '*if you just drink responsibly, there's nothing wrong with it*'. And I agree, this is why I didn't use the word 'justified' in my title. There are many people that **do** drink responsibly and **don't** drive drunk or do dumb shit. It is indeed unfair on these people that under Islam they wouldn't be allowed to drink. But if you allow billions of people to drink, there will inevitably be a sizeable amount of people that will do catastrophically dumb shit. It's impossible to make a rule for billions of people that would be 100% fair, because you have to generalise. The legal age to have sex in the UK is 16 because that's the age the government deems the average person is mature enough to have consented sex. If you're 14 and extremely mature, it's unfair you have to wait 2 more years to have sex, but that's just how it is. You have to generalise when making rules for large populations. 

So Allah's decision in forbidding alcohol is completely reasonable, it's not because alcohol is inherently bad, it's because you can't allow billions of people to drink without a large enough minority ruining it for the rest. It's not fair, sure, but it's understandable. You have to generalise within reason when making rules for millions of people. Country leaders and law-makers do this all the time too, they generalise."

Today I tried raising canes for the first time. Everyone just goes on about how good it is. I was so disappointed. Do you want chicken or do you want more chicken? 

The styrofoam is a huge turn off as well. Everything was like wet from it. There’s a huge lack of regard for the environment as well.


They have no side options and the chicken has no flavor. It is just tender. The bread is too soft. The fries are bland and too soft. The coleslaw is odd. The tea/lemonade is good. And the sauce is good. I feel like everyone who is a huge fan just hasn’t had really tender chicken before. That would make sense then that RC was the best chicken they ever had. 

I really don’t think anything could change my view. Idk but you guys can try. I’m all ears."

0,2022-11-06,CMV: The moral panic over the Qatar world cup is stupid and driven by misinformation and self-righteousness,u/college_koschens,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yng2w7/cmv_the_moral_panic_over_the_qatar_world_cup_is/,changemyview,"The football (soccer) World Cup is set to take place in Qatar in a few weeks. It will likely be one of the, if not the, most watched sporting events ever.

There has been a lot of outcry over the way Qatar deals with its workers. For instance, [football fans in Germany](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/ymwivn/banner_by_bayern_fans_in_berlin_against_qatar/) held a poster that read '15,000 dead for 5760 minutes of football. Shame on you'. 

I tried to investigate where this ""15,000"" number comes from and all I could find is this [Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/feb/23/revealed-migrant-worker-deaths-qatar-fifa-world-cup-2022) claiming ""6,500 migrant workers have died in Qatar since World Cup awarded"". However, even this figure is misleading: it is the total number of migrant workers who have died in Qatar since the world cup was awarded 10 years ago **in all projects**. This 6,500 figure includes workers who have died in constructing things that have nothing at all to do with the world cup. In fact, although the article is unclear on this point, it seems to include even accidental deaths that do not come from the workplace, such as car accidents. Therefore, to assign 6,500 deaths (let alone the magical 15,000 number) to the world cup is absurd.

So, how many have actually died in world cup related construction? It is very difficult to say. We have no reason to assume world cup-related construction is any less safe than any other sort of construction in Qatar. So to calculate world-cup related deaths we would need to know the number of People in World Cup Construction in Qatar (PWCCQ) and People in Non-World Cup Construction (PNWCCQ), and calculate (PWCCQ/(PWCCQ+PNWCCQ))\*6500. Dividing this by 10 would give us the annual World Cup-related construction death rate. Even this would be an overestimate if the 6,500 figure includes accidental deaths outside the workplace. 

Secondly, construction workers die in all countries. What we would need to calculate to condemn or exonerate Qatar is worker deaths per unit of construction. This is a difficult thing to do considering there are many things we could use for ""unit of construction"" ($ value, area covered, kg of concrete used, time spent). But let's go with $ spent. Around [4,764](https://www.osha.gov/data/commonstats) construction workers die in the US every year. The US sees around [$1.3 trillion worth of construction a year](https://www.levelset.com/blog/us-construction-statistics-you-need-to-know/). That's 1 death every $272,879,933 spent. The [Qatari construction industry is worth over $50 billion a year](https://www.google.com/search?q=qatar+construction+industry+per+year&amp;ei=Wi5nY7iQNM_CkPIPpaas2A4&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4pcfY0pj7AhVPIUQIHSUTC-sQ4dUDCBA&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=qatar+construction+industry+per+year&amp;gs_lcp=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&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp). If we go with the highly uncharitable 650 deaths per year, that is 1 death for every $76,923,076 spent. This makes Qatari construction about 3.5x more unsafe than all US construction, under some very uncharitable assumptions.

Which brings me to my final point, is a safety performance that is 3.5x worse than the US worth not wanting to associate with the world cup? Construction in South and South-East Asian, African and Latin American countries is also much more unsafe than in the developed west. Should all events held in such countries also be boycotted? Do the [people who are getting on their high horses](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/ymcgjn/gary_neville_challenged_by_ian_hislop_on_have_i/) know what the death rate for construction workers is in various countries, and whether Qatar is out of the norm? Do they have good moral intuitions for how out-of-the-norm a country's construction industry can be before it should be boycotted? Do they know if the risk of dying in Qatar was worth the salary for the construction workers, who hail from very poor backgrounds in other countries and voluntarily immigrate to Qatar? And will boycotting the world cup actually achieve anything? Will middle eastern countries massively improve their construction practices just because people in the West are making up figures like ""15,000 deaths""?

Not a single person criticizing the world cup has answers to any of these or has bothered to numerically analyze the situation, or taken into account the alternatives (these workers stay in their extremely poor and unsafe countries) for the construction workers they supposedly care about. All things considered, I think it's a stupid and childish bit of moralizing from Western armchair humanitarians."

I'll admit I'm biased, I grew up being bullied and no matter if it was them beating me up, slinging insults, pouring paint on my pants, etc I was always told that I need to be the bigger person and not fight back. I want to see if maybe other people can provide insight into the logic of the belief.

However, here are my reasons for this view: 
1. Some people only learn to stop when physical force is brought against them. Admittedly, my evidence for this is anecdotal in nature as it all stems from the fact that it was only once I bit someone for punching me in the gut and calling me a fat f-slur that suddenly him and his friend group stopped targeting me. No amount of getting adults to help did anything, being ""the bigger person"" failed. Which brings me to my second point.
2. Most of the time, being ""the bigger person"" and trying to seek outside help just really won't help in reality. Unless you're just trying to make your posse of people look bigger than the other posse, it's not really gonna do much. People who are hurting other people in the first place are not going to care about someone else telling them they're being mean unless they care about that someone.
3. It teaches people to allow themselves to be victimized in life. It teaches that standing up for yourself is wrong, that you shouldn't fight back, that the only good option is turning the other cheek so they can punch it too.

I really hope I can give out some deltas, I don't like the fact that I have such a depressing stance on things, and this seems like one that could be changed relatively easily by the right people."

It woke more emotions in me and I loved the characters. At the end of House MD I cried for hours and the show left a perminant mark on me all those years ago, Breaking Bad is a great show, it was interesting and I loved it, but it didn't impact me as much as House did. I always wondered why House didn't get as much recognition as Breaking Bad did. As I scroll through Reddit and watch Youtube shorts I see the amount of love and appreciation Breaking Bad gets, don't get me wrong, it deserves the love but I'm wondering why House MD isn't getting the same treatment, that show was always in my mind and still is. Is it because people weren't interested in the idea of the show and never bothered to watch it? Or maybe it simply didn't reach the majority and people didn't know about it. Well, all these questions have an answer. But maybe people really didn't like it, there was a lot of hate and people saying the ending was bad. I don't think so, I believe it was perfect. Sad and depressing but warm at the same time, it showed that House in the end, really did loved Wilson and his team. He got them to where they were at the end of the show. Breaking Bad had a great ending too, Walter accepting defeat and Pinkman escaping to Alaska while Saul goes to jail. Both shows are great, but I believe House MD is better."

Then I realize, it all goes back into the ecosystem anyways, right? I mean, even the bones eventually. It's not like the deer carcass is just deleted from existence. It goes back into the circle of life. So what's with all the anger for hunters not eating all their kills? I'm looking to change my view essentially because I'm thinking there must be more to it, why is it a bad thing to leave a perfectly good deer there for nature to consume. As long as the animal didn't suffer unnecessarily I think I have no qualms about this anymore. Younger me might hate myself.

* I don't want to argue about the ethics of veganism, moreso the ethics of leaving the deer instead of hauling it home and chopping it up. If the only argument is that giving it to humans is a better use, I'm not interested in that approach; thanks! "

It must be abolished.,u/LucasWhitefur7822,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ynpld4/cmv_the_us_supreme_court_cannot_be_reformed_it/,changemyview,"Unless you've been living under a rock for the last few months, you'll know that the US Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, meaning that American women no longer have bodily autonomy. They are likely to overturn affirmative action, gay marriage, and many other basic human rights as well. This trend is unlikely to change unless Alito or Thomas croak in the next two months.

However, this is not a new trend. Throughout most of its history, the Supreme Court has handed down horrendous right-wing rulings; just look at Dred Scott and Plessy. Additionally, in most other countries, people can't even name a Supreme Court member, and when the highest court in your land is so politicized, it's never good.

Any effort to add term limits to SCOTUS justices would require a constitutional amendment, which this nation is far too polarized for. ""Packing"" the court, or adding new justices, would not require that, and could be done in the lame-duck period, but once the GOP takes power again they'll just add more justices, who will probably rule that packing the court further is unconstitutional.

I will not respond to anyone who says something like ""you're a crybaby, these rulings are an unfortunate outcome in a democracy, not the end of democracy."" Sure, people voted for Trump, but Republicans won fewer votes in 2016 and still got to add three justices. I'm sick of living in a country where the death of an 87-year-old woman with pancreatic cancer means that everyone loses their civil liberties.

So there you go. CMV.

Beyond it's addictive nature, it has done considerably more damage to society than drug use. I  believe this because since the wide spread adopting of the internet, and in turn social media, we've seen our biggest spike in mental health issues to date. Not to mention things such as public shootings becoming the norm. 

Along side rises in rates for anxiety, depression, suicide, and mass shootings, we've also found ourselves in an opioid epidemic. I'd argue the need to medicate with such dangerous substances is due to this addiction to social media. 

I think what's worse, and what really proves my point, is that we all know social media is bad for us, yet these platforms continue to grow in active users. When word came out that cigarettes were harmful, rates dropped. When word came out about social media being harmful, nothing changed. Just a few tweaks here and there to work against it's harm. ""Here's a reminder to get off our app, if you chose to enable the feature."" We're all too glued to our screens to unplug, even when confronted with hard evidence of its impact. I think it's sad many parents don't do more to keep their kids off some of these apps.

More things can be argued about the negative impacts of social media, such as desensitizing black communities to the unfair deaths of their own, creating echo chambers driving people to raid the white house and other such things, the harvesting of user data for monetary gain, the creation of cyber bullying, etc.

I won't go as far to say that there are no upsides to these platforms, but I'd argue that the damage they've done outweighs their positive impacts on society. Change my view.

Edit: Most of the discourse here seems to be surrounding how we define and measure the impact of social media vs other topics. I worded this CMV poorly."

That means our officially policies have been getting progressively worse over the last 40 years at pretty much all levels of government. 

Take healthcare for example, sure there are treatments and the like that didn't exist before but wait times are worse than ever certainly worse than in the 80s as is doctors per capita, hell we are at the point where we are closing down ERs on the weekend or in general because we need to consolidate the remaining staff. 

Our policies are so bad that I don't think it would be logistically possible for them to be this bad without the boons of technology, we'd  have all starved and revolted decades ago without cheap entertainment and more efficient means of growing, processing, storing and transporting food."

They advocate for compulsory voting. I fail to see a reason for this, other than some self-righteous view of democracy and people-power.

I've seen some people say that compulsory voting is necessary for a democracy because a democracy is ""rule of the people"" and unless 100% of the people vote, it ain't a rule of the people. However, this view of democracy is problematic from 3 perspectives:

1. People who don't vote essentially vote, ""I don't give an f, go do what you want."" By compulsory voting, you're taking away that vote. To this, some have defended that in some countries, there exists an option ""neither."" I fail to see any reason why people should be forced to vote ""neither"" when they can simply choose not to vote. Some other people have defended that you don't have a choice to not care about others, and that's callous. Well, that's your moral judgement, you cannot force it on others.

2. You may want to reevaluate why we need a democracy in the first place. Why is democracy better than other forms of government? Why should people have the power? One of the reasons is that we don't like being told what to do, without sufficient justification. We don't like being ruled upon. When you say the country should have compulsory voting, you're violating that individual sense of agency, defeating the point of democracy. 

3. There's a fine line between democracy, mob rule, and tyranny of the majority. Why do you think that just because a majority of people think so, an indifferent minority should be threatened with state force to vote?"

Typically being something negative. Maybe we could narrow it down to single people who dont want to be single. That seems to be more fitting for the group I am talking about.

People who have no significant other to share their life with instead intrude on the lives of others. I'd imagine that would be due to loneliness. Of course you can have 3 partners and still feel lonely, however I think loneliness is more than not due to lack of people around you. I don't think the loneliness itself is a toxic feeling but do think it can lead to toxicity. Obvious were all on reddit so we have seen the extreme side of single people trying to be therapist for non single people. Thats a given as we are on the internet. However I do see that in real life too. It's not ever as blatant, its more passive aggressive. 

I think humans are programed to be with other people. We are made to be social beings. Having a partner is a big part of that. Therefore I don't get why not fitting into the mold of what a human is meant to be it would cause frustration if you let it. I also am a firm believer of literally everyone being able to find love. Thats kinda why Im annoyed. Theres people going around nagging and bitching about being single but they aren't truly looking for love. Those people are usually always looking for something physical. 

So long story short, I guess single people just annoy me when bitching about how they are single or bitching about someone else's relationship. To me both those things are toxic, but hey I'm probably toxic for publicly saying those things are annoying. I dont expect any of this to stop but I do think the things I am saying seem very likely to be true. And sure im a hypocrite because I bitch and complain about a lot of things for no reason too, but I'm just one person. I wouldn't say an entire demographic has similar traits as me.

I'm open to a change of view, but I'm not trying to deal with angry people so calm down and collect your thoughts before you give your opposing view. Call me names, sure, but at least have a good opposing view to go with it so we can actually have a conversation."
894,2022-11-06,"CMV: Twitter losing its advertisers is more Musk's own fault than it is ""Activists""",u/B34RD15,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ynwkxz/cmv_twitter_losing_its_advertisers_is_more_musks/,changemyview,"Lately, Twitter has been hemorrhaging advertisers left and right. For example, The Volkswagen Group joined several other companies in recommending that its automotive brands, which include Audi, Lamborghini, Bentley and Porsche, pause their spending on Twitter out of concerns that their ads could appear alongside problematic content.

Musk even acknowledged the plummet in ad revenue, tweeting on Friday morning that Twitter “has had a massive drop in revenue,” which he blamed on activist groups pressuring advertisers.

I believe it's not the fault of ""Activists"" pressuring these companies to revoke or suspend their ad campaigns with Twitter, but in fact the fault of Musk for choosing to enact massive sweeping changes to Twitter creating an unstable product/platform. 

Advertisers need stability in the platforms in order to effectively feel comfortable Advertising their products there. I would hope if I wanted to advertise my product, I could choose to not have it shown next to a tweet calling for far right/left extremist violence. That's awful for brand recognition. Overmoderation can definitely be bad, but under- or even no moderation can be equally bad. Abruptly removing 75% of your moderation team, whether the results end up being good or bad, is going to make others feel unstable with the platform.

Hell, you can even take it from the CEO of MMA, Lou Paskalis, that is one of the many large advertising groups leaving or suspending their ad campaigns with [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LouPas/status/1588599808587345921);

&gt;Elon, Great chat yesterday, As you heard overwhelmingly from senior advertisers on the call, the issue concerning us all is content moderation and its impact on BRAND SAFETY/SUITABILITY. You say you’re committed to moderation, but you just laid off 75% of the moderation team!

&gt;Advertisers are not being manipulated by activist groups, they are being compelled by established principles around the types of companies they can do business with. These principles include an assessment of the platforms commitment to brand safety and suitability.

&gt;That includes the trustworthiness of the leadership team and the behavior of the CEO. You claimed yesterday that you are deeply committed to Content Moderation, yet today you’ve eliminated the vast majority of people who did that work for Twitter. How do we reconcile these?"

0,2022-11-06,CMV: Political ideologies should be treated with the same degree of reverence as religious beliefs.,u/DrakBalek,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ynz1l4/cmv_political_ideologies_should_be_treated_with/,changemyview,"(*This might take me a moment to fully flesh out my thoughts, so please bear with me.*)

I'm starting to think there's no practical distinction between a political ideology and a religious one. If that's the case, then I cannot accept a society that allows discrimination of one but not the other.

I suppose this means I need to explain what I mean by ""discrimination"" . . .

We have the First Amendment which makes it clear that the government cannot make laws which restrict an individual's right to exercise their religious beliefs. In other words, citizens have a constitutional right to be free of government intervention in their religious beliefs. This also extends to our ability to speak our minds and share our thoughts.

In terms of social interactions, however, the Constitution and our laws have no formal restriction on these things. This is due, in no small part, to the idea that in order for a person to be truly free to express themselves, they have to be equally free to choose who to associate with. I see ""freedom of speech"" and ""freedom of association"" as being inextricably linked to ""freedom of religion.""

Granted, yes, there are laws that protect civilians and workers from unfair discrimination. According to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, it's illegal for employers to discriminate against an employee on the basis of race, sexuality, gender, disability status, age, and so on. There are other areas where the law makes discrimination limitations clear, of course, but the point is that there's an argument to be made (and I'm making it) that the ability for *anyone* to discriminate against another should be assessed on the basis of the individual's ability to change themselves. (Immutable qualities should be protected against discrimination.)

*However*, included in the protected categories listed above, we find ""religion."" The Civil Rights Act protects against discrimination against a person on the basis of their religious beliefs. This seems to fly in the face of my contention that these standards are based around immutable qualities, as it's clearly not possible to change your race or your sexuality, but it's absolutely possible to change your religious beliefs.

From here, my mind wants to answer a question: what's the difference between a political ideology and a religion? Because from what I've seen, *a lot* of people treat their political framework as a sacred belief system: inviolable and unquestionable. And even if a person is willing to question it, they're certainly not willing to do much more than that. (I consider myself to be one of these individuals, although I like to think that I can defend most (if not all) of my political ideology from criticism.)

Look, I get it, it's really hard to get people to change their minds about some things. There are certain beliefs that we hold closer to heart than others, for a variety of reasons, but the point is that there's a social and legal attitude toward religion that places it on the same level as race or gender, *even though* it's obvious that you can change the former but you can't change the latter.

In other words, if we're going to treat religion this way \~ and I'm inclined to agree that we should \~ then I think it's fair for people to claim that their political ideology is a deeply held belief, on the level of being equivalent to a religious belief, and it should be treated as such. This means an employer should be legally barred from favoring or mistreating an employee simply because they're a socialist or a conservative or a Marxist or an anarchist or a libertarian . . . and so on.

I don't *want* this conclusion. I genuinely dislike that I'm coming around to this point of view. Therefore, I'm looking for some help with all of this: what are the practical differences between a political ideology and a religious belief system?

Because without that difference, I think we should treat them the same way. And since we can't accept that a political ideology is *actually* worth protecting in this way \~ given how easy it is for bad actors to abuse these things \~ I think that means we need to remove religion from the list of protected categories.

Tough shit, they get to live with you rent free, they have to do what you say, and what your partner says if you decide to let them. If they don't like it, then maybe they'll prefer a stay in military school until they turn 18, and no contact after that since they hate your new spouse so much. Letting you child dictate your personal life is a surefire way to turn them into controlling brats. So the response to a kid whining that they're miserable because they don't like their new step-dad should be that they better get used to being miserable, and they can fuck off once they turn 18.

If I hate sororities, I shouldn't have to pretend to appreciate them in order to keep my living and avoid being homeless. There are hundreds of cultures and subcultures---and most of humanity---that I find distasteful, delusional, and repugnant. Why should I or you be forced to appreciate them if you genuinely don't like them?

The prevailing view nowadays is that if you hate/dislike the wrong cultures, a business has no obligation to keep you on board. But if you want to maintain a free society, that's misguided thinking. So if I don't appreciate the Christian or Muslim religions, then it's okay to fire me, right? But pretending to admire or like these religions---as with all religions for me---when I don't, implies that I'm not really free to form my own opinions and values.

The obvious, hackneyed ""rebuttal"" is that I'm free to think and feel as I please, but I must accept the consequences of being fired.

But that really misinterprets the notion of a free choice. Choices under duress are not real choices. Saying I'm free when I can lose my entire livelihood is about as a free as a person in a country who has the ""freedom"" to say anything but must accept the consequences of prison time!! In neither case are people really free to have their own opinions.

In short, if you believe in the freedom to form your own opinions and values in a way that will guide your feelings and emotions, if you believe in upholding that kind of free society, you should be against businesses controlling your feelings on your free time.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT!**

**To make this practical, so that businesses don't lose money due to boycotts of their particular employees, we should enact anti-discrimination laws on the basis of personal feelings and values, just as we do already with religion and gender. Hence boycotts would become as ineffective as boycotting a restaurant for employing, say, certain races.**"

My tolerance for aggressive dogs is very low. My uncle has a Pitbull that has bitten several members of my family, and my father basically banned the dog from any family functions. I have several clients that have Pitbulls and several times they've brought up the dogs biting them. Anecdotally no other dog owners I know bring up their dogs biting them (all breeds like labs, great danes, or mutts). 

After going through the top posts in /r/BanPitBulls they seem to have pretty good arguments. For example, according to this article, Pitbulls account for approximately 6 percent of dogs in the United States but make up over 60 percent of the dog bites. https://topdogtips.com/statistics-on-dog-bites/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20study%20from,million%20people%20as%20of%202020. 

However, it seems difficult to find unbiased opinions on this subject. It seems like it is politicized or concerns about the breed are dismissed as ""you're not a dog person"" or ""you just don't get it."" This is unconvincing to me, however I am open to explanations.

“A meta-analysis of six studies including more than 87,000 cases found a significant increase – ranging from 4 to 29% – in the risk of having a heart attack the week after the spring time change. Researchers believe this increase is related to the change in our circadian rhythm and the general disruption of biological processes.”

I’m a strong supporter of getting a good night’s sleep and DST is just an unnecessary obstacle in what is already increasingly more difficult as technology improves.

Edit: I prefer to do away with DST rather than staying in it since standard time feels more natural imo, but I mostly just hope that we choose one and leave it at that."

Plus, arriving earlier means you need to get up earlier or spend more time getting ready prior to the event. I'm not saying being early is a bad thing or that you should be late (because being late is obviously bad), but I just don't see why anyone would intentionally come super early to things when they could just come on time (or very close to on time) instead.

6,2022-11-06,"CMV: It is possible to be personally and socially pro-life but be politically pro-choice.

However, I personally believe that abortion is the obstruction of life and, in some instances, it can be considered the taking of an innocent life. 

That said, it is almost impossible to enforce abortion bans given their unpopularity and the ease of underground alternatives to safe abortions. 

Furthermore, there are (admittedly rare) instances where it’s entirely unclear what the “right” thing to do is. Who’s to say whether a 13 year old rape victim, who may die during childbirth, ought to do? That’s between her, her family, and whatever belief system is guiding them. 

Personally, however, I would discourage anyone in my life from having an abortion and do everything in my power to make the choice to keep the child an easier one. 

I also think that we, as a society, should change the narrative around children and child-rearing. We don’t have an overpopulation problem, we have a resource allocation problem. We have a problem of misplaced priorities. Humans are assets, not liabilities. Every child that’s born is the next possible scientist or technologist that may cure cancer or solve climate change. 

We should collectively work to end abortion—not through bans—but through technological advances, improving the adoption process, and by crafting a society that makes is easier to say “yes” to choosing life."

I'm deeply sympathetic to women's perspectives. The issues they face: sexual assault, marginalization in the workplace, media portrayal, etc. are no doubt extremely important.

On many feminist spaces, you'll hear claims that feminism is synonymous with gender equality, and that feminism lifts up both men and women. But I've found this to be mostly untrue.

Most successful suicides, most homeless people, most victims of violent crime, and most victims of workplace accidents are men. Men are disproportionately given longer prison sentences. Only men can be drafted to die for the nation. If anyone suggests that women should be drafted to reproduce for the nation, it would rightfully be regarded as complete bullshit.

But instead of focusing on the lives of the 99%, feminists claim that since Congress is mostly male, men must have all the power and control in society. So all that is shoved under the rug, and sexism is rebranded as ""the patriarchy,"" as if gender expectations were imposed by male CEOs and presidents, rather than thousands of years of social tradition. As if men being politicians more often is proof that they have it better in society.

The thing is, for every assumption made about women, there IS an opposite assumption made about men. If women are weak, men are strongER. If women are innocent, men are LESS innocent. Without the second, the first would be an assumption about all people, not just women. Men are disposable. Women and children matter more. ""Man up,"" because you don't get to complain about injustice. We don’t get sick. Mental health is a nonissue for us. We’re too damn tough to be stopped. We’re encouraged to be hyper-competitive to keep the other workers down and advance ourselves. We're men, we don’t give a fuck.  Every man has to be able to earn bank and become early-era Stevan Segaul at the drop of a hat, cuz real men can fight to defend themselves.

But when these assumptions are made about men, we don't call it ""misandry,"" we just call it a ""side-effect of misogyny."" That's disgusting imo. The worst and most effective double standards are in how we discuss things. Control the language, and you control how we think.

Think about it. Right now 60% of college students are women. Girls outperform boys in all levels of education. If it were the other way around, we would be hearing all about ""the sexist higher education in America."" Instead, feminism focuses on the fact that there aren't enough women in STEM fields and doesn't give a shit about anything else. Now there are a wealth of scholarships, opportunities, and AA programs that exclusively benefit women.

So at the end of the day, I think feminists have their hearts in the right place. They really do. And I don't believe there's some crazy conspiracy to keep men down. But the movement as it exists has never been about ""floating everyone's boats."" Feminism is about women first and foremost, and it should stop pretending to be anything else. It's just sad that no similar movement exists for the rest of us :|. Hopefully someone change my view, because I really want to believe that feminism is here for us all. "

[Wikipedia: Louisiana Purchase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase)

&gt;(With) the Louisiana Purchase...(for)...$15 million, the U.S. nominally acquired a total of 828,000 sq mi. However, France only controlled a small fraction of this area, most of which was inhabited by Native Americans; effectively, for the majority of the area, the U.S. bought the ""preemptive"" right to obtain ""Indian"" lands by treaty or by conquest, to the exclusion of other colonial powers.

As the Wikipedia writeup notes, the French controlled only a small amount of land this land, and were not in a position to contest the U.S. for it, within out initiating a major war.   Two decades early, Britain had already discovered what happens when you try to contest the Americans for real estate in North America. The U.S. would not have to formally announce  any control of the area in any event; they could simply begin occupying the region, just as happened further west with *Manifest Destiny* decades later. 

Meanwhile, the French were preoccupied in any event. This source, [How the Haitian Revolution Resulted in the Selling of Louisiana](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339004109_How_the_Haitian_Revolution_Resulted_in_the_Selling_of_Louisiana_Napoleon's_Loss_of_Saint-Domingue), writes:

&gt;Napoleon had a strategic plan: to gain Louisiana from Spain, restore France's wealthiest colony, Saint-Domingue, and building enterprises...in Louisiana by using the revenue obtained from Saint-Domingue. Napoleon's plan (failed)...due to a slave revolt... 

&gt;France was still in pending war with Britain; in order to fund the impending war and keep the Louisiana Territory out of British hands, Napoleon believed that selling the Territory to the U.S. was more beneficial....

The best that can be said is that the U.S., appreciative to the French for their assistance in the American Revolution two decades earlier, made the deal to financially help the French in their conflict with Britain, whom tensions would again arise with in 1812.  Could have given the French $3 million."

He is only breaking it by deciding what is acceptable speech. As I told him, my comment didn't insult anyone and isn't stealing his livelihood so why speak to me this way? He repeated a second time Shut the F up....so I reported him for harassment which make me feel weird since I never report usually as I believe in free speech but I feel this is abuse of it and if we did it more often it would avoid such toxic comments. My view has nothing to do with a person's political view.

Edit: my view has been changed in that my solution does not consider the automations in place by twitter but also the financial aspect in fermenting conflict on twitter which toxicity thrives on. Thank you all for your opinions"

But economic downturn, the rising price of oil....those things affect everybody on a daily basis ! Yet everytime I turn on the TV and someone Democrat leaning is discuss the mid-terms its always something about ""oh no republicans are going after abortion rights""

Like seriously ? Give it a rest ! Codified abortion protections....isn't gonna lower the price of oil !

Their formula is pretty simple and successful: insist that abortion is murder no matter what and should be made illegal in all cases, but if you are in the position that you need one, do it in secret. If you get caught then it’s just a simple matter of saying that everyone is a sinner and asking for forgiveness. Herschel Walker is just the latest in a long line of hypocritical Republican candidates.

Follow up

Upon seeing the response, there’s many reasonable points and IMO some less than appropriate analogies to other political issues.   
The general consensus is that there’s no way to know what someone truly believes and that politicians be acting like politicians. Granted. The reason that this is a bigger deal in my mind is that the abortion issue is one of morality—the pro-life side literally equates abortion with murder. They claim the moral high ground (this is not the time or place to discuss the myriad ways that this itself hugely problematic) but maybe it would help to clarify my position that I don’t believe that most Republican candidates actually believe that abortion is murder but they’re happy to say that they do. I feel like this jacks up the level of hypocrisy

Many companies have started paying a percentage of their salary in benefits (company wellfare), in the form of vouchers and gift cards.  
Now the value of money is partially subjective and partially objective; on the objective part, sound money, should implement the following properties:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Fungibility
2. Durability
3. Divisibility
4. Recognisability
5. Portability  


Vouchers arguably relax many of these assumptions, creating a degenerate, sub-optimal version of money.  
An example:  
Let's say I receive a 1000$ salary benefits in vouchers.  
\- First of all, often, the smallest unit of these vouchers is not the cent but a far greater (2 orders of   
  magnitude greater) denomination (eg. 5$ or 10$).  
  This greatly relax the ***Divisibility*** property of money (eg. I cannot use a 10$ voucher to pay a $9.99   
  product).  
\- With these 1000$ I can only trade goods and services with a limited number of merchants.  
  This greatly relax the ***Portability*** and ***Recognisability*** properties of money.  
  A by-product of this is the creation of legalised economic cartels.

\- The vast majority of the time, these shopping vouchers have a limited duration (from a few weeks  
  to a few months).  
  This greatly relax the ***Durability*** property of money.  


The worst part of it all is this:  
When I get that 1000$ in salary, I'm not actually getting a thousand dollars but an inefficient subset of that 1000$.

The moment I spend it, however, that debased version of capital immediately goes back to being converted into dollars, dramatically increasing its purchasing power.

If I use those vouchers on amazon (or whatever), from the moment I make the payment, they automagically become real dollars for the seller.

Once again this brings up the centralisation of riches into cartels and actually makes people who get paid with them poorer, once again all this is paired with a splash of marketing to make the gift-card-pay-check more tasty, hiding the scam behind a shining curtain of futility."

Similar to salt on food a little sprinkle can bring out the flavor of the food, but too much will ruin the food.

I'm not talking about ""Extreme Bullying"" like to the point of suicide or school shootings. I'm talking about a light to moderate amount of bullying as a part of the social ecosystem. 

Life is an ecosystem. Taking any part out of any ecosystem can be extremely dangerous and bring the whole thing crashing down or can cause a real catastrophe.

Cracking down on all of the bullies goes way too far! It can and does have many unintended side effects.

Skin is getting thinner and thinner each and every day. We are creating a society where everyone must walk around on egg shells. That is unpleasant.

""Attention Whores"" and people being a ""Total Weirdo"" or ""Anti Social"" can now cause much greater disruptions than they ever could in the past. 

People who lack bullies have less motivation to self improve. Bullies saved my life. When I was in high school I didn't shower every day. I didn't wear deodorant either. Turns out that combination makes you stink for some reason. Bullies have noses, and they noticed. So the bullies made fun of me for being ""The smelly kid."" Did I curl up into a ball and cry myself to sleep? No... I thought about it for a bit... I decided to buy some deodorant, and started taking showers more regularly. After some time I was no longer ""The smelly kid"" anymore. The bullying stopped. I corrected the disruptive behavior. My social standing improved greatly.

I fear what would have happened to me if I never had bullies in high school. I don't think I would have been able to get girlfriends. I would have had far less friends. Maybe some other smelly kids... I would have had a much worse social life. This may have lead to depression and suicide. I would have been that ""Outsider"". I would have grown to hate the other people.

Kids are getting weirder and weirder and getting away with more and more disruptive behavior with bullies taken out of that ecosystem. Nobody is keeping the weird kids in check anymore and they are rampaging through the halls. All the weird kids are making all the normal kids more uncomfortable and ruining their school life and making many of the normal kids act weird too.

I'm sorry if you are one of the ""Weird Kids""... but you shouldn't be able to bring your my little pony toys into school and talk about how you beat off to pony's without facing the consequences for that. Keep that creepy stuff to yourself!"

Here I want to argue that money (i.e., pay or salary) is a better initiative or focus for people than obtaining other common job benefits like healthcare, vacation time, etc… And I’m particularly focusing on America. In other words, this is kinda a reaction to the common question of: “why doesn’t the US have more safety net and vacation time like other developed countries?”

What is valuable is an individual opinion, but in general Americans as a whole value wealth and materialism. Regardless of actual income, Americans love obtaining luxury goods like phones, vehicles, fashion, etc… Therefore, to satisfy this craving we have to give up other priorities (i.e., vacation, healthcare) to obtain the one resource that can get us those things…aka money!

Having more vacation time or less expensive doctors is nice and all, but that doesn’t actually contribute to our ability to obtain our wants. To pay off a home, buy the new iPhone, get that new vehicle, buy Christmas gifts, etc… we need money and not days off. This is why we don’t push for universal healthcare or other things that some consider human rights.

If it was put to vote to decide between a pay raise versus more vacation/less expensive healthcare…pay raise is gonna win. Plus Americans can argue that money itself pays for better healthcare or vacations, if we prioritize those things personally, anyway.

So to CMV in this post, please show how/why Americans shouldn’t value money over these other safety net perks. Because as far as I can see, the American way of life is about  wealth (money) and not necessarily about other benefits. That’s why America is unique amongst developed countries."

Both theists and atheists seem to think that you can somehow choose what you believe in. Someone even said you can choose to believe in god and if you don't you go to hell. This seems to be a common talking point among religion people as well. Leaving the hell part aside aside, I just don't see how you can choose to believe in anything, let alone in god. In the rest of this post I will lay out two argument. The bottom of the post will explain the definitions I use of believe and choice.

Argument 1: If we can choose our beliefs, then we could choose to believe that the moon was made of cheese. You cannot choose to believe that the moon is made of cheese. Therefore we cannot choose our beliefs.

Edit: As pointed out Argument 1 is not actually consistent, because it would be like saying you can't choose where you walk because you can't choose to walk on water. Now I would say that argument 1 is still an argument for the proposition, unless someone can point out that there is a sort of reason why someone would be able to believe in something else without being able to choose that the moon is made of cheese.

Argument 2: If we can choose our beliefs, then we would expect there to be moments of decision making, but this is not the case. I have never had a moment where I consciously chose to believe something. I've had moments where I thought: 'this book/person has a good point, I think this convinced me.' But this is far from a choice, because I didn't have control over it. Compare this to let's say what you are going to make for dinner and it becomes obvious that choosing what to have for dinner feels much more of a choice.

Edit2: Many have pointed out that we can influence our beliefs in a sort of indirect way, by seeking out counterevidence or by restricting yourself of knowledge. I agree with this, but I don't think it's enough to change my view or invalidate argument 2. We could analogise it with getting a sport injury. If someone sport and does so in an unsafe manner, then we can say that this person has a higher risk of getting an injury, but it wouldn't be the same as saying that this person chose to get an injury. The same an be said about changing your mind. Other similar analogies could be falling in love, depression, boredom etc. Although I am sure some of you might find these things to be choices as well.

==============

My definition of the word choice: 'The ability to do otherwise, given that you want to do otherwise.'

i.e. I have the choice to make pasta for dinner, because I have the ability to make past if I wanted to make pasta and I have the ability not to make pasta if I did not want to make pasta.

I chose to use my own definition because I couldn't really find a definition in the dictionary that was applicable to this discussion. It should be noted that this definition of choice is a much weaker definition than common definitions for free will and free choice, which is intentional. Feel free to attack any of these definitions.

=========

My definition of the word believe from the oxford dictionary: 'to feel certain that something is true or that somebody is telling you the truth'

There are other definitions of the word believe, but I think this one suffices."

1,2022-11-07,CMV: Therapy is just as much-if not more so-about enforcing social conformity than it is about helping people and their issues,u/Commercial_Violist,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yp174i/cmv_therapy_is_just_as_muchif_not_more_soabout/,changemyview,"I've been in and out of therapy for about three years now with varying degrees of success. Either that or I'm overly critical about my progress since it feels too slow. Thus I can say that Therapy and Psychiatric drugs do work with enough time, and trial &amp; error. My issue is not of whether therapy is effective, but rather why it has exploded in popularity.

&amp;#x200B;

In years past, people frowned upon therapy and many still do for a variety of reasons. They may see that they're above it, it doesn't work, too expensive (which it is, it should be free for everyone forever), or it's all about the past and/or sex \[in other words, it's all Freudian\]. And yet all of a sudden in the last 5-10 years we see this stigma largely mitigated if not eliminated at least amongst younger generations? How did this happen? While most would say that this is due to people having greater access to information and being more compassionate to one another, I'm not so convinced. 

Zoom popped up out of no where back in March 2020, practically no one who was already using it had heard of it before. And the vast majority of schools, corporations, and other organizations opted to conduct business over Zoom over other existing options such as Cisco Webex, Microsoft Teams, or even Discord. Why is this? Because it was attractive to most company's IT departments since it was ""simple and easy to use"", all the while **100% of calls** were being routed through the Great Firewall and onto Chinese data centers for the Communist Party to see. They got caught by Washington and were forced to use Datacenters elsewhere (usually closer to the user instead in China). This I don't feel is an isolated incident, and I think therapy is another such case. 

The first reason why workplaces would care about their workers seeking therapy is obvious, if they're struggling in life for one reason or another, they're not working or providing as much value as they could be otherwise. They are financially incentivized to give their workers the therapy they need. But I don't trust it, if they truly did care then they wouldn't charge their employees to use it. It'd be 100% covered via their insurance (whether in a fully private system like the US or a partially private system like Germany). This to me suggests that there is another, much more insidious reason for it. And that is a means of thought control. 

A key part of therapy is letting go of repeated negative thoughts and beliefs that only serve to drag us down even if they feel right or letting feels wrong. This is routed in stoicism which suggests happiness can be found by letting go of unhelpful emotions. Not all emotions, just the ones that do more harm than good. Since workplaces decide which insurance they give their employees, what's stopping them from selecting an insurance plan or bringing in therapists or meditation practitioners that align with their political and economic beliefs? That the status quo is perfect and anyone who says otherwise is just a radical that needs to be eliminated? Going back to China, we see this with the CCP kidnaping and likely killing the Panchen Llama following the Dalai Llama fleeing to Nepal. In his place, is a puppet Panchen Llama to espouses how compatible Buddhism and Chinese ~~State Capitalism~~ Communism are fully compatible with each and that this is something to be celebrated. I feel that this is being done on a smaller scale, but in the form of dismissing concerns about current socioeconomic, political, and environmental issues as ""not that big/bad"" or ""not of our concern"". If the company someone works for washes their hands clean of any responsibility to these issues, why not their employees? It'd be bad if workers didn't embody the ""values"" of the company, wouldn't it? The same goes especially when someone suggests that revolutionary action is required to eliminate suffering of people and to avoid the impeding Climate Catastrophe that we only have 6 years or so left before we start to see it unfold before our eyes (in other words, it'll be too late). Since revolution is ""unrealistic"", ""unproductive"", ""dangerous"", ""illegal"", ""immoral"", or some other negative adjective that they come up with since at the end of the day it'd hurt the company. More specifically, it'd hurt the Oligarchy that pulls the strings along with their cronies at all levels of government around the world. Time and time again has shown that **Violent Revolution has been the #1 way to achieve social, political, and environmental progress we all desperately crave.** Without it: Slavery would still exist in the US, France would still be a monarchy, and most of the world would still be under Colonial Rule.

And yet, we've collectively written off Revolution. Nobody wants to put their lives on the line anymore to secure a better life for themselves, their children, and their grandchildren. ""It's not something we do anymore"" is the usual response. We're told we have to make change through the government, which shocker is rigged against the working public since money dictates politics. Your opinions count as much as the amount of money you're paying some politician to act favorably towards. But it's totally not a bribe, *we promise*.  

Additionally, many of the famous (or infamous depending on your perspective) world leaders have been mentally ill. And look where it landed them, right into your history textbook. In other words, the mentally ill people-the ones most willing to do whatever they saw fit regardless of the consequences because they felt it was right-where the ones that were remembered the most. They left the biggest mark on recorded history. If we want to remembered and not forgotten as the other 99.99% of the 55 Billion people who have lived on this planet, being mentally ill if not flat out unhinged is the way to go. They didn't let social norms stop them from accomplishing what they wanted, why should we be any different? Sure, some may not like you, but your life wouldn't have been in vain. 

The media is a Kabal, healthcare is a Kabal, Pharmaceuticals is a Kabal, energy is a Kabal, food is a Kabal, transportation is a Kabal, technology is a Kabal, and our means of communication is a Kabal. Almost every aspect of our lives is controlled by a Kabal of a handful of companies and an equally small number of Oligarchs. All unilaterally aligned together to exploit and extract as much as they physically can out of working people. Then once this planet is sufficiently trashed, they'll move to Mars and trash that planet too. They'll repeat the cycle indefinitely so long as they can enjoy the lavish lifestyles they demand. All the while the workers have to clean up the mess, **psychologically conned** into turning the Earth into an inhospitable wasteland that we, our children, our grandchildren, our great grandchildren, great great grandchildren, and likely our great great great grandchildren will have to suffer through.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: Therapy is a means of social control by making all workers think a like. Any dissent is eliminated and any sparks for revolution are diffused before they even exist. It makes people too content and subsequently complacent to make changes that would improve the lives of themselves and/or others. When therapists tell us to not worry about the future because of socioeconomic, political, and/or environmental issues, they're acting as agents of the Oligarchy to maintain the status quo and to get people to enjoy falling in line. We'll be conned into trashing the planet until it's too late and then we'll be left to fend for ourselves. We must do everything in our power to resist the tempting propaganda of the Oligarchy and not let them poison the well of Therapy for their own selfish gains.**"

So, any argument that shows that a clearly rational and conscientious reviewer could read and fully understand footnote 25, and still pass the paper without change, would change my viewpoint.

DEFINITION OF ACADEMIC FRAUD

For discussion purposes, we shall use this definition of academic fraud from U Chicago, since that's where Bertrand was when she did the study:  

&gt; Academic fraud is defined as plagiarism; fabrication or falsification of evidence, data, or results; the suppression of relevant evidence or data; the conscious misrepresentation of sources; the theft of ideas; or the intentional misappropriation of the research work or data of others.

Later CMVs will dive into the data, which is publicly available.  There is massive fraud, folks.

BACKGROUND:

BM2004, found here - https://web.mit.edu/cortiz/www/Diversity/Bertrand%20and%20Mullainathan,%202004.pdf,  is the most-cited paper in the academic field of employment discrimination.  In late 2001 and early 2002, the authors submitted artificial resumes to employers in Chicago and Boston, for sales and admin positions, and measured the difference in response rate between what they called “black-sounding” and “white-sounding” names.  

They concluded that discrimination was very consistent, with black applicants needing to send exactly 1.50 times as many resumes as white applicants to receive the same number of callbacks.  

The design is 2x2x2x2 -- 2 cities, 2 job categories, 2 sexes, 2 races – and thus the tables should be symmetric, with one line for Chicago for every line for Boston, one line for men for every line for women, and so on. However, in Table 1, there are lines for women that are not matched by a similar line for men.  In fact, the total number of male resumes submitted is less than a third of the number submitted for females.

So what gives?  

*****

EVIDENCE IN FOOTNOTES 

The following explanations are present in the text and footnotes.

&gt; We use male and female names for sales jobs, whereas we use nearly exclusively female names for administrative and clerical jobs to increase callback rates. ^25

&gt; ^25 Male names were used for a few administrative jobs in the first month of the experiment.

&gt; As noted earlier, female names were used in both sales and administrative job openings whereas male names were used close to exclusively for sales openings. ^32

&gt; ^32 Only about 6 percent of all male resumes were sent in response to an administrative job opening.

******

CONCLUSION ONE: If the footnote 25 text is true, then discrimination against men in admin was 100%.

In the context of a discrimination study, this indicates that, after sending between 62 and 73 male resumes to admin roles, the discrimination against men was so egregious that it dwarfed the claimed discrimination against blacks.  Realistically, men in admin roles had to get zero callbacks, because according to a binomial probability confidence interval calculator, a single callback is enough that they would not have 95% confidence that dropping men would increase the callback rate.  

With N=62, 1 callback, 95% confidence interval is 8.662% callbacks, which would be indistinguishable from the rate for all women.   With n=73 and 1 callback, the 95% confidence interval is 7.398%, which would be above the rate for black women.  

Therefore, for the text to be true, they must have received 0 callbacks, and the discrimination against men in Admin must have been measured as 100%, which is 3 times the discrimination against blacks.  

*****

CONCLUSION TWO: If the footnote 25 text is true, then the researchers altered data collection to avoid collecting evidence of discrimination against men.

So, one month after starting, they had determined that the discrimination against men in that quadrant was bigger than any possible discrimination against blacks, and decided to alter the data collection strategy to drop that quadrant.  

Failure to collect the data of discrimination against men, at three times the level of discrimination against blacks,  and intentional misdirection regarding that discrimination, constitutes “suppression of evidence” as per the definition of academic fraud.  

*****

CONCLUSION THREE:  The researchers intentionally concealed the discrimination against men, and calculated their discrimination ratios in a fraudulent way to further the concealment.

The researchers then phrased the paper in such a way as to conceal the omission, and calculated and presented various aspects of the paper in a deceptive and invalid way. 

It is not possible to have a valid discussion of the overall discrimination, the discrimination in the male category, or the discrimination in the admin category, if the data from the male-admin quadrant is avoided.

Concealing this discrimination is, by itself, sufficient to render the paper as academic fraud per the relevant definition.

I think society should strive to not offend people, and prevent intolerence. The 1st amendment just allows people to freely offend whoever they want, and results in a society that tolerates intolerence. Privileges come with obligations to use them properly.

My view will be changed if you can convince me that the 1st amendment is better for society overall than german speech laws, or that letting everybody offend everybody is a good thing in civilized society."

Also, there are some people with valid reasons to struggle, like those with dementia.

There are precisely two skills that are needed, which allow you to use technology to do almost anything you need with it.

1. Basic literacy and logic: being able to read, write, and think
2. Being able to access and use a search engine, like Google

That's it. Once a person is capable of these two things, they can use it as a foundation to do almost everything else. At least 95% (probably a low estimate tbh) of ""issues"" or other questions can be solved with these. The reason they *aren't* solved is because ""tech-illiterate"" elderly people don't even try, and immediately give up. I originally added a few examples, but ultimately they're all drawn-out restatements of the same thing: If you don't know what something is, or what something means, or how to do something, you can almost always use these skills to figure it out within a minute or two.

The excuse is almost always ""this stuff is just too complicated for me"" or sometimes it's even condescending like ""oh, well you young people understand it because that's all you do all day"". No, it's because you couldn't be bothered to try using Google or otherwise attempt solve it by yourself. 

There are definitely exceptions. Sometimes a question is specific and obscure enough that a search engine won't help you, or maybe you don't even know the right terms to search to find the answer. And there are plenty of other skills which only come as a result of getting used to technology. For example, learning how to better formulate search queries, typing/navigating faster, recognizing patterns to become less reliant on Google, etc.

To be fair, I am saying all this as a person who is very familiar with technology and have been using digital devices for the majority of my life. I don't have any way to see it from their perspective. Though I will say that at least 90% of my knowledge of computers is ""self-taught"" by using the internet itself, and the majority of the rest probably could have been learned in that way too. Plus, most products are designed to be usable by the average person, and aren't really *that* complicated, even if you're starting from scratch. Some have even been around for many many years now (like email), yet it's *still* apparently too unfamiliar and complicated. In my experience most issues that older people have are generally due to them being stubborn about ""not understanding"", and refusing to try.

**Edit**: My view has been changed, I don't think it's fair to overgeneralize their lack of understanding as being simple ignorance."

Progress that benefits the majority of citizens of this country is going to be extremely slow because long term policies are no longer guaranteed. Instead, we will continue to see people motivated by tribalism, blocking the opposition at any chance they get instead of critically thinking about what serves our collective well-being. Until the majority of people realize that, we are at the mercy of a system that serves the egos of politicans, even if they have appear to have the best intentions. 

I argue that this is going to lead to America's demise because the tribalistic nature of the system is fostering extremists who will do anything, including undermine democracy, to remain dominant. The pendulum is going to continue to shift in the other direction, leaving many of us with limited options of politicians that represent our needs. 

A ranked system will give us better representation, and data on what citizens actually care about. It may encourage voters to do more research instead of voting purely by party. It could potentially decrease all of this toxic mudslinging. And it may even challenge politicians to develop better campaigns that actually serve the majority of citizens in this country.

*Edit: Thanks for the discourse. I'm aware that the US democracy not a two party system. However, the system that we are currently experiencing is monopolized by two main parties. 

I still believe the American democracy will meet it demise eventually (hopefully not any time soon), but I can agree that it's not because of the ""two party"" system. For now, I continue to remain optimistic. Happy voting!"

It is your civic responsibility to vote and it’s a slap in the face considering other countries don’t have the right to vote. It makes non-voters look bad (rightfully) as they are essentially throwing away their vote.

To start off, if you feel you’re too ignorant on certain topics, you can always engage with others them. Research takes time obviously, but you don’t need to be an expert to know whether or not a policy or legislation is good or bad.

To those who believe their vote won’t matter: imagine if 100,000 people thought like you. Would you then say it wouldn’t matter?

To those who believe both candidates are trash, you could be right, but there has to be at least one policy of theirs you would want put into office. There are times where you need to do tactical voting even if you don’t like either party.
 
You can’t have a perfect politician, so it’s important to choose the one that’s good enough. Sometimes you need to choose a “shitty” President to vote against a bigger threat. Sometimes you have to vote for the lesser of two evils, if you don’t, the greater evil might or will win. Your vote could have stopped the bigger threat, so why forfeit it? 

You probably have interests that align well with a policy or candidate. 

To change my view:
1) give me a good reason why you don’t vote. Provide evidence and good reasoning that isn’t just “both parties bad” “My vote won’t matter” “I want the other guy”. I need your refutation to be as sound as possible that manages to be practical.
2) Show how I’m flawed in my “Lesser of two evils” reasoning. I’m not sure if you can, but you can try.
3) Show how your vote actually doesn’t matter
4) What moral or personal reason do you have for not voting?"
16,2022-11-07,CMV: There are no significant ethical issues with current AI-generated artwork,u/Antistone,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yp9t0v/cmv_there_are_no_significant_ethical_issues_with/,changemyview,"I'm not actively involved in any artistic communities and haven't done a deep dive on AI art, but I'm encountering ""spillover"" in some forums about topics that could potentially be impacted by AI art, and these sometimes include some ethical arguments that I feel are...wanting.

Before my opinions calcify, I'd like to try to find out if there are some better arguments that just haven't successfully crossed the gap to these tangential communities.

(edit) **Clarifications:**

* I am talking about the entire process, from training the AI to generating images to possibly using those images to make money.  I will entertain arguments about any part of this chain.

* However, I do not mean to assert that it is *impossible* to do anything unethical with art-generating AIs, if you were trying on purpose.  I mean that it won't *incidentally* be unethical in typical ordinary cases where you're not specifically trying to do something nefarious, such as harassing a specific person.

.

My discussions so far have gone something like this:

Them:  AI-generated artwork is being bad!

Me:  How so?

Them:  The AIs are trained using copyrighted images, but without seeking permission from the copyright holders or compensating them.

Me:  Don't human artists do that all the time?  That is, look at copyrighted artwork in order to learn techniques or gain inspiration, and then incorporate that into their own original artwork, without asking permission or giving compensation to the copyright holders?

Them:  You can't **prove** that what human artists are doing is **exactly** the same as what the AIs are doing.

Me:  Why would I need to prove that?

If you want me to support a norm of not-doing-X (for some ""X""), then the onus is on you to establish some relevant difference between X and the stuff that everyone agrees is OK.  If the answer to the question ""would this norm disallow all *human* artwork?"" is ""maybe"" then that's a non-starter.

Also, I'm skeptical that this hypothetical difference matters even *to you*.  Imagine, as a thought experiment, that there were two different art-generating AIs, and one of them actually does exactly whatever-it-is that humans do, while the other AI does something different under the covers but it generates similar results and you can't tell the difference by casual inspection.  Do you really **want** to apply different rules to those two AIs?  Why?

Them:  -stop responding-

.

I am interested in hearing either a better-formulated version of the above argument or a different argument.

.

(edit)  I have noticed a number of comments making arguments that I would broadly characterize as:

*""Humans have an ineffable divine spark of creativity, which no mere soulless machine could ever possess.  Only through this spark can an unethical act of copying be redeemed into an ethical act of being-inspired-by.""*

If you are going to attempt to make an argument that looks vaguely like the above (I don't care what words you substituted for ""ineffable divine spark""), please make sure to answer these questions:

1.  How can you tell that humans have this spark?

2.  How can you tell that AIs don't have this spark?

3.  Why is this spark morally relevant?"

I would appreciate some examples of opposing viewpoints to further my understanding of the topic. The argument is as follows:

1:  **Hungry People Behave Hungrily:** There is evidence to show that when people are undernourished, they behave selfishly/irrationally and will seek out substances/behaviors that distract them from hunger. These are often crimes.

2:  **Basic Needs, Wrongly Acquired:** When people can’t have their basic needs met, they still need them. Water, food, and shelter are not the only needs in our society: car, gas, insurance (auto, apartment, health, etc), medicine, etc. There are more expenses in life than one thinks, and when you can't meet them, there are laws in place that can put a person in prison or on the streets for it. 

So, change my view: how would you argue against these points?"

I decided to make this post because I am curious to see what I feel like I am missing.

**Issues with this change and how I might address them:**

""the new model raised alarm about the consequences the system could have on disinformation for the 2022 midterm elections"" ( [https://www.npr.org/2022/11/05/1134561542/twitter-blue-check-paid-verification-elon-musk](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/05/1134561542/twitter-blue-check-paid-verification-elon-musk)): Verification requires an ID for individuals, and a website that references the twitter username for verification, so it is unlikely this change will increase impersonation. ([https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts#requirements](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts#requirements))

Verification won't be a sign of reliability: If one believes that verification is a sign of reliability currently, it is good that it won't be a sign of reliability going forwards. Many verified twitter accounts post things that aren't reliable, such as Kanye West (antisemitism), Elon Musk (Paul Pelosi conspiracy), etc.

**Potential benefits:**

Verified accounts will be more likely to be owned by a verified user. Since old accounts that aren't paying for the subscription will lose verification, there will be fewer opportunity for hackers to sell verified accounts to unverified users. Thus, more verified accounts will actually be verified.

**Edit:** 

This post was made before we had full information about twitter blue. It seems that a checkmark is available for purchase, and the label ""official"" has replaced the verification checkmark in function. In this case,  it is certainly bad since it results in deception to anyone who isn't hyper aware of the distinction between the check and the ""official"" label."

And I don't quite get it. While I'm no globetrotter I consider myself fairly well-traveled and it hasn't given me a desire to travel *more*. Rather the opposite: I've lost the taste for travel, if I ever had that desire.

Firstly, the process itself is a pain in the neck. The stress of catching a flight; the long lines; the waiting; the cramped airplanes. The *cost*. All the planning involved and the stress involved in that. Leaving your pets behind and arranging for their care.

Secondly, and this may just be because I'm an uncultured oaf, but I've never been overly moved by the sights I've seen. I've been to various parts of Asia, Europe and North America and I've only rarely been impressed or awed by the sights.

While I don't mind museums and such, they will occupy at most a few hours of a trip that will usually last between one to two weeks. What will I do with the rest of my time?

In later years I've had hopes for the food in whatever country I'm traveling to. Because I love food! But thus far I've mostly been disappointed.

And before somebody points it out to me, I've never felt that traveling broadened my horizons or gave me a different view of life. I didn't have to walk down a heaving south-east Asian street to get a feel for the different life challenges in other parts of the world. If anything I felt that my empathy was challenged by the people I encountered when traveling (pickpockets, aggressively pushy salespeople, etc.).

Maybe my view comes from having an ""international"" family (parents from different countries) and having lived abroad during parts of my childhood. But in other such cases that I've heard about it seems to have given people a desire for more travel rather than lessening their desire to travel. 

In conclusion I feel that the costs and stress of traveling far outweigh the positives.

And yet I feel like something of a freak for holding this view. ""Everybody"" loves traveling, and yet here I sit like some kind of travel-Grinch, frowning at the whole idea.

Please change my view on travel."

In Italy our nouns, adjectives ecc have a sex: if I'm a male I'll be ""Studente"", but if I'm female I'll be ""Studentessa"" (Student).

So if I'm expressing to someone specific I'll use the noun that express his/her gender (note: gender and not sex). 

When we're talking in plural, so if I'm talking to a group of people of mixed genders, we use the male form of nouns (""Studenti"") to express the neutral.

If I'm talking to a group of girls (only girls, no boys) I'll use the female form (""Studentesse"").

Nowadays, many people expressed the feeling that this kind of language is not inclusive, because for expressing to a group of people the neutral shouldn't be male. These people believe that we should use a different form with ""*"" or with the schwa ""Ə"" (""Student*"" or ""StudentƏ""). 
This form has no oral meaning, only written (the oral would be ""Studentu"", which is nonsense in italian language).

I believe that if I'm talking to a group of people, and I use italian neutral (""Studenti""), I'm referring to everyone, no one excluded. If you feel excluded it's not my problem cause I use the neutral, in my opinion. How can a letter be a reason to feel discriminated, when I'm obviously expressing and talking to everyone.

I realized how little I know about the world, and came to the belief that I would only be reasonably confident in being able to identify a reasonably good leader if I studied this topic as a full time job. Which means 99% of people are not qualified to vote or run the country, and actively hurt the country by voting or running the country compared to someone more qualified but perhaps less famous. Therefore we have a moral obligation to create a political test, all multiple choice in order to remove human bias from marking essays, kind of like a driver's license test but much more difficult than that joke of a test (perhaps as difficult as the medical college admission test, which in my experience requires strong soundness of mind and months of rigourous study). Upon passing this test you can get your license to be involved in the political process. And if you really care about voting, you can study the required material in order to prove that you know what's going on.

You might ask, who gets to decide what content will be tested? Wouldn't the content be biased? The current government would decide for now, with the input of universities and whatever other advisory bodies they have. This would be continually revised as part of the constitution or similarly constant laws to reflect the changing times and should not be changeable unless by a supermajority of those in power, in order to prevent whimsical changing.

TLDR: we dont allow 5 year old children to run the country and adults shouldn't either until proven otherwise.

Edit: example questions might be: 
How did Hitler rise to power in a previously democratic government? ABCD
How did Genghis Khan's empire start to fracture and ultimately fall? ABCD
What is the process of how greenhouse gases contribute to global warming, according to most climate scientists? ABCD

EDIT2: many of these comments refer to how the test questions themselves can be stupid, corrupt, or propaganda. Why is this any different from the tests made in schools today that can also potentially be stupid, corrupt, or propaganda, but in practice rarely are, or even if so, can be passed regardless? If bad questions were such a problem, why aren't schools today, which are government controlled, causing votes today to be completely brainwashed by schools?"

The same is true for many dilusions, like If I think I am sick all the time when I'm not, I'm a hypochondriac and so on.

Only gender is treated like this holy cow, completely untouchable and unquestionable. ""Oh, you are gender fluid? Neutral? You are wolfborn, demonfolk, omnigender? Amazing! How should we all call you?""

Like, if you feel like something, or want to express yourself a certain way. Go ahead. But why do we, medically and societally, not only need to embrace all forms of gender dysphoria but also bend over backwards to include all rights the target gender enjoys, like participating in professional sports? I can't be a Heavyweight Boxer competing in the flyweight category if I have body dysmorphia and feel like I am much lighter than I actually am. In fact, I could just PROCLAIM that I feel that way to enter if we treated and like some people think we should treat gender.

I can't go to a doctor and get prescribed drugs for illnesses that I FEEL I have, and so on.

Why is it so unquestionable that having a divergent gender perception, especially if it as out there as some of them have become, there is no legitimate response other than celebration. You can get in trouble for not acknowledging it even. Like, isn't this even worth a discussion? Isn't there an issue with treating somebodies feelings as fact if there are so many ways in which our perception can be affected by mental health? Or not even necessarily by mental health, if a friend of mine thinks that drinking alcohol is good for them and makes them confident and cope with life better, should I encourage them? ""Look, maybe what you feel like isn't entirely true and could be detrimental to your health"" Is sentence that is completely out of the question in common discourse when it comes to gender, and I feel that's wrong."

If there's a new discovery or a changed detail that requires the most minor of updates, the nerds over at Wikipedia will have the appropriate pages updated in nanoseconds with sources to match. 

Meanwhile you need to wait for the next encyclopedia set for that update, and there could be a mistake in that set too, which can't get fixed until the NEXT edition. Plus those bitches costs hundreds of dollars. Who has the money to update it EVERY cycle?

 And if you need to find something hyper specific about a certain radiology tech procedure in the encyclopedia? Good fucking luck, kid. You'll maybe find one article about radiology in the 17,000 articles that are supposed to cover all the topics in the *world*. You'll flip to ""radio-"" section and find ""radio broadband network"" and ""radioscope"" with nothing inbetween. Figures, that's just your luck, isn't it?

Beyond that, most people have the encyclopedia set circa 1600 sitting on their bookshelves collecting dust. You open that bitch up and it says ""our solar system is geocentric, here's 52 reasons Galileo is a dumbass:"" in old printingpress lettering. 

""B-B-BUT DUDE! There's trolls that change wiki pages!"" No they don't, go on Wikipedia and make an account. Try and change something. It either won't work because your account hasn't been established since before the dawn of the internet and you're not trusted, or it'll be changed back in half an attosecond and you'll catch a seven trillion year ban that you can't appeal. 

Wikipedia is more accurate than encyclopedias. Hands down, no contest. Actual encyclopedia books are turbo-ass in the information era.

0,2022-11-08,"CMV: Incels are right to some degree, but I don't care",u/Logical_Round_5935,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yps2xu/cmv_incels_are_right_to_some_degree_but_i_dont/,changemyview,"How to change my view: Incels are wrong, or I should care.

I don't want to argue what incels actually mean, but I'm using the broad stereotypical points people think 'incels' have.

First lets break down things in points and why I don't care.

I know people don't like it, but I do think to a degree women care more about money then men in what their partner make. It's true that a woman just existing will get more people wanting to fuck them then men. Women will have more criteria who they want to fuck. You must be x, y, z. While there are more men who are content to just say, 'as long as she's presentable' I'm willing to fuck. I'm a woman, but women don't like hearing this.

Now, why I don't care is because I think at the end of the day, it boils down to wants and desires. I've made points outside of this topic that people aren't entitled to things. If you are looking to fuck or date someone, cool, what have you got? I don't care if it's a shallow view. I don't care if men and women are shallow. This isn't a societal problem. If you wanna fuck only hot men or hot models, cool. I'm not gonna try fixing anything. Fix it? How? What's there to fix? That people like what they like? There's no shame in that.

Say for simplicity sake, women are asking price of 100k, which is more than the average man makes. So what? If the asking price is out of your range, don't buy then. No matter how ridiculous it is. If men are asking me to birth 5 children, care for 5 children, be his and their cook, maid, laundry lady, etc. Then I just wont do it. I don't get how hard of a concept it is.

If men are getting a lot of dates but I'm not, I'll still say the same thing. It's their choice. I'm not jealous that hot women get a bunch of compliments. I'm not mad that hot women get more pick of men then I am. Because it's the men and women's choice. You can't enter a relationship based on YOUR wants.

TLDR: I don't care if men are less picky then women or that women get more 'matches/dates' then men because it how the 'free' market works.

1. There exist more men who will fuck anything that breaths then women. 
2. There exist more men who have less criteria for women then women for men. 
3. Dates are an exchange and if you aren't getting your 'money's worth' just back out.
4. No one is entitled to dates, therefore, if someone wants something more than another, that's on them to present a higher 'bid'. 
5. If the price is unreasonable, you aren't entitled to the product anyhow. "

Perhaps an extra 50% increase in sentencing for police officers that commit a serious crime.

The police are supposed to uphold our laws, but there are plenty of officers who use there job to get in a position of power over the vulnerable.  I think we change the law to reflect the seriousness of officers breaching there position of power and trust to hurt others.

If you can't trust yourself not to prey on the vulnerable - don't join the police!!

**I'm not sure that I've changed my opinion that police should be held to a higher standard and that sentencing should reflect this, but I may have changed my mind on how we go about this.**

**The most compelling argument that I found against my view is that the law should be blind and without bias for anyone, but I do think that this bias already exists in our laws. For example if you hurt a child, you are likely to receive a higher sentence that if you hurt an adult, or if you kill a police office, you will likely receive a higher sentence than if you kill a member of the public.**

**I'm also not sure I agree with the opinions that all views need to fully researched and based on pure fact before engaging in conversation, we all have views that aren't yet fully formed, and I think that conversations with other people are a great way to change or strengthen views and grow as a person.**

Between people blocking roads and throwing soup at paintings over climate change, there are a ton of posts on Reddit raging over protestors doing it the ‘wrong’ way. 

First, the road blocks. These are nominally nonviolent but very disruptive. They get a LOT of media attention whenever they do it (as compared to self immolating in front of the Supreme Court which no one seems to care about). The only people at risk are the protestors. And in theory it could draw attention to the lack of public transport available because people lack alternatives. This isn’t perfect though, while most people are just very inconvenienced by it, there was that one guy who missed his parole because of it. 

There is also the hypothetical ambulance criticism. What if they don’t let an ambulance through? Extinction Rebellion claims (or at the very least used to claim) they let EMS through. Other groups may or may not but ER is the most visible. Yet every time there’s a post people seem so worried about what if there was an ambulance (which there isn’t) and they didn’t let it through (which they say they would) and someone got hurt (which no one did because it didn’t happen). What if they ignored their own protocol for a hypothetical situation that isn’t happening but one day could?

Needless to say, I find that criticism disingenuous at best. Because of these protests, some states passed or discussed passing laws making it legal to run over protestors who are in the streets. In the comments people always seem very in favor of this and don’t think about the consequences of such a law. 

Here’s a question for all you people who want to run over anyone standing in the street. Some states have passed laws making that legal (ie Florida), some states have stand your ground laws (ie Florida). Say this happens in a state with both. Someone is protesting for whatever cause. Someone sees it and decides it’s legal and they don’t want to be inconvenienced. They don’t slow down and run one of them over going 45. The protestor sees the driver trying to kill them with a 1 ton vehicle going 45 and defends themself. They have concealed carry license and are carrying their legally acquired firearm which they defend themself with. 

Who’s in the right. Are they just legally allowed to murder each other? The driver was mildly inconvenienced but people want to pass laws and some have already passed them letting them get away with killing the people inconveniencing them. The protestor definitely fears for their life since in this example they die of their injuries afterwards and both driver and protestor end up dead. 

Enough about road blocks. Let’s go on to the new hotness, throwing soup on paintings. Despite these being completely nonviolent, harming no one, and inconveniencing nearly no one, the response is nearly identical. Rage, saying it’s the ‘wrong’ way to protest, claiming they are hurting their own cause. For the record, no paintings are damaged. They chose targets that are protected, typically by a pane of glass. It just creates the appearance of defacing the painting. And this gets even more news coverage than the road blocks while harming/inconveniencing even fewer people. 

Their message is a bit vague admittedly. It is something along the lines of people are upset about us defacing paintings but not oil destroying the world or we put all this effort into protecting paintings but not the earth. Either way the message is we are valuing art over the earth when the earth is much more important and we wouldn’t have any art if not for it.

Yet this is still the ‘wrong’ way. People claim they should be going after Pol companies directly instead of making symbolic gestures that get them millions of dollars of free publicity and liking a lot of revenue from donations. Incidentally, they do target oil companies. They block roads to refineries. This doesn’t get coverage because it can be easily hidden from public view by the media not reporting it unlike blocking a major street or defacing artwork in a museum. 

One of the only times those ‘legitimate targets’ got enough coverage for me to notice it was when they vandalized one of Rupert Murdoch’s buildings. Yet this too was told it was targeting the wrong people. If Murdoch and his right wing media empire that has spread climate denial for decades is not a fair target, nothing is. 


Let’s come up with what would be the hypothetical ‘right’ way to protest. It would have to be nonviolent obviously. But that’s not enough apparently. You can’t just not hurt anyone, you can’t even inconvenience them. So something peaceful that doesn’t disrupt anything. But you need an audience to get your message out. So something peaceful and not disruptive in front of a large crowd or better yet a national audience. Perhaps if you were a famous performer or athlete you could make a symbolic gesture in support of a cause before a game. Like for instance, refusing to stand for the national anthem. But some people may interpret that as disrespectful so to be on the safe side you should talk with a veteran about the plan and instead kneel during the anthem. That way you are respectful to the troops and still sending a message while being peaceful and not even inconveniencing them by delaying the game. 

Except no. Even Kapernick got massive amounts of hate in the media with even the president saying he should be fired and thrown out. 

Even things like boycotts get criticized and even made illegal. It seems pointless to care about criticism if the criticism for a riot is less harsh than for kneeling. 

Just to be clear to people who want to cmv, I’m not saying these forms of protests are good or effective or there aren’t better. I’m saying that no matter what protestors do, they will be criticized for it not being the ‘right’ way to protest."

0,2022-11-08,CMV: There are no good and sound arguments to encourage voting on a micro level and people are scared to address it because they know voting is objectively pointless on an individual level,u/adoreroda,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ypyy5z/cmv_there_are_no_good_and_sound_arguments_to/,changemyview,"Note for title: micro level means individual level. Macro in this context would be more of a broad meaning such as overarching or group level, such as an entire demographic(s)

I believe voting to be largely a social and emotional thing; people vote out of emotion and/or out of social pressure. They vote for things they believe in to make themselves feel good and to validate their feelings, or sometimes out of social pressure because of whatever environment they're in to stay en vogue/in good graces with their peers. On a macro level, voting has its purposes and is sound, but on a micro level, it has no real world impact as one vote is meaningless. As said above, aside from swing vote elections which are irrelevant and not worth bringing up, you cannot point to me an election where there is a real world impact because of one vote (anonymous vote, at that). For someone like me who genuinely does not care or have a community that I need to be represented on a legal level, there are zero incentives for me to vote and I think in general on a micro level, for anyone to vote. 

I notice when people talk about voting they only talk about it on a macro level. I understand why this is so, but considering how in some places (or perhaps a general trend worldwide) that younger people are a lot less inclined to vote compared to their older counterparts, trying to encourage people to vote/making arguments on a macro level is outdated and the convincing arguments for incentives on the micro level are basically none or the arguments are so bad that it’s almost embarrassing.  

The argument for voting on a macro level, or collective voting, is sound. The issue with this however is that it’s argued on a micro level to a specific individual as if it’s their responsibility to garner enough attraction to vote, especially for a particular candidate. The reality is that some people see the issue of voting predominately in two ways: macro level or micro level. And the argument for the latter is really pathetic as of late and it only gets worse as time goes on because it showcases how traditional arguments for voting have gotten so fucking bad.

Anyway here are other bullet points for my argument:

\- The argument to encourage voting is absolutely pathetic and outdated on a micro level

\- People fail to engage with the impact of voting on a micro level.

\- People also tend to get super emotional when you shoot down their arguments against voting when they’re doing it from a macro perspective. It often times reduces to ad hominems such as calling you immature, sometimes slurs or other insults, etc. Not voting has nothing to do with intellect or maturity.

* \&gt;A common tactic is to try and bully and/or harass people who a) vote for someone you don’t like (in particular) or b) don’t vote in general. Whether you like it or not, choosing to vote (just like who you vote for) is a personal matter, and the fact that it’s so common place to bully/harass people who don’t vote makes voting even less attractive, ironically.  

\- The individual is not responsible for the collective unless you can show niche situations where one vote would’ve had a major impact, such as something like a swing vote. Even still, you kind of have to pick a side to argue for one at a time, not do a combination of both.

* \&gt;An individual isn’t responsible for how the collective behaves and so arguments like “well if everyone acted like you \[not voting\] then elections would get nowhere” is a fucking terrible argument considering how that’s objectively not true and whether or not you convince someone has no real world impact on how **the lot of others** are going to act. So this means even something like trying to encourage the said individual convincing friends and family isn’t enough to impact almost any election, and it’s also unreasonable to expect all of them to vote let alone vote in the same way if they even did.

\- “People died for your right to vote” Ok that’s great, I don’t care. That’s kind of an appeal to emotion. I don’t care. Many younger people like me also do not care. Moot point. Sounds like a dismissal but it’s a fair rebuttal since the right to vote =/= obligation to vote and how one feels about it *is* important in context of this conversation.  

\- People often conflate voting for someone and having their desired candidate win as being responsible for them winning when that’s not the case. Simply because you participated doesn’t mean your vote was impactful enough to actually mean anything. This common notion also implies the inverse was a waste of a vote if they voted for someone who ultimately would lose.  

\- People fail to acknowledge that often times people who don’t vote don’t care enough about “one side” or any particular candidates enough to vote, so the fact that they do not feel like there’s anyone who is worth voting for in the first place is already another problem. Even if it’s a “lesser of two evils” situation.

\- Common arguments like “well if you don’t vote then you can’t complain” is basically trying to say that you’re voting for the right to complain, which implicitly showcases the shallow value of voting on a micro level

\- Using arguments such as showcasing to people how they didn’t like X and person Y in a previous election was responsible for it and so things like that don’t happen again is why they should vote is also another bad example unless you can showcase how their individual vote would’ve changed the election if you’re going to look back on the situation in retrospect like that. Otherwise, their vote is...worthless.  

\- it’s your “civil responsibility”. I don’t know about all throughout the world, but in some places like Australia you get fined for not voting, and I’m not sure if you have to vote for a candidate or not or if you can leave your voting option on the ballot or whatever blank. Even in this instance it’s mostly a moral superimposition onto the person you’re trying to convince that voting is important and it’s basically “I *think* it’s important and so should you.” Not very convincing.

\- People fail to acknowledge the emotional motivations many have for voting. People *feel* like they are making an impact, so they vote. People want to vote because it makes them feel good, etc. And there’s nothing wrong with that, but people never address these points when it comes to motivations for voting and try to mask it behind a bunch of other reasonings that aren’t really accurate to why they’re actually voting.

* \&gt;I think this point could be mostly me but I don’t doubt other people feel this as well, but people also fail to address that many times there are candidates that you have no push towards. I’m an American, and the past few presidential elections had candidates that were not good that didn’t encourage me to waste my time and take time off of work to go vote, even if it would still count as a break. If I vote, I generally want it to be someone who I support somewhat wholeheartedly, and no one did. Let’s say I kind of favoured Biden for whatever reason (I did to a little degree), how would my individual vote change anything? It wouldn’t.

\- Voting encouragement arguments never address the point of trying to showcase the impact of voting on a micro level, and I understand why this is so because there is none. Especially in major elections, a singular vote for a candidate doesn’t matter and has zero real world impact on the direction of an election unless it’s a swing vote which virtually does not exist anymore and is unrealistic to expect.

\- Whether or not you vote, unless it’s a swing vote or virtually the same, your vote has no impact. 

* \&gt;Whether or not your desired candidate won and you voted, it didn’t matter; the result was going to happen anyway."

It's been her fathers clear message for decades, and yet when he is not in his right mind (on his deathbed) he whispers something that could be misconstrued as changing it to Aegon, and Alicent jumps on it.  Lords were made to swear to Rhaenera, never to Aegon.

**Morals**

The Greens:

* Have Larys, a guy who murders his own brother and father.  All around an evil character.

* Have Criston Cole, a guy who murders a noble who did nothing wrong (Joffrey).  Also just an asshole as the series progresses.

* Alicent stabbed Rhaenera and groomed her children to hate the blacks.

* Alicent's children are pretty terrible.  Aegon rapes, watches kids fight to the death for entertainment, and is overall a dick.  Aemond kills Luke (it was an accident, but he should not have been chasing him with a metaphorical nuke.  The death is on his hands).

* The council conspires to undermine the king's wishes because sexism (can't have a female ruler.)

The Blacks:

* Have Daemon, a guy who kills his own wife.  All around an evil character.

* Have Rhaenis, a gal who kills a number of peasants without any remorse or second-thought (when she breaks out of the dragon pit).

* Rhaenera conspires to kill a random guard and cause her children and Laenor's family grief in staging his death.

* Luke was bad, stabbing Aemond's eye out.

Looking at the facts, I can see not wanting to support either side morally.  But I can't see choosing the greens over the blacks here.  The greens have worse kids, worse motivations (sexism vs holding to their oaths), and just as bad villains as the blacks do.

**Acting**

I could concede Alicent's actress is better than Rhaenera's, but not by much.  Rhaenera's actress is still very good.  And when you start looking at the side characters, the blacks win again.  The blacks have great actors/actresses for Daemon, Corlys, and Rhaenis, while the greens just have Larys.  Everyone else is mediocre to bland.  And if you count Viserys as a black (he technically did support Rhaenera), then blacks win hands down in the acting category.

**Conclusion** : The blacks are the rightful rulers, have better actors, and are either morally superior or on the same level as the greens.  I would think everyone would be rooting for the blacks, yet I hear a lot of people are rooting for the greens.  So, CMV.

*Deltas*

* There is an argument for stability of the realm being better under the greens.  Rhaenera's kids are illegitimate, and the realm is used to male rulers.

* The black advisers and nobles first reaction was to go to war, while the greens were trying to kidnap the blacks and avoid a war.  War is worse than kidnapping a few nobles.

* Rhaenera did indicate that she doesn't care for the nobles when she had her night out with Daemon.  She was young so I take it with a grain of salt, but it is something.

* Otto is not as bad a character as I thought (I forgot to mention him in my OP but I thought he was pretty evil).  It is possible is just looking out for the realm and his daughter, and would have been a more pragmatic hand.

* Allicent was more wanting her kids to be on the throne, which is slightly more altruistic than Rhaenera wanting herself to be on the throne."

This exact behavior is against the law in, for example, Denmark, which last I checked hasn't seen an economic collapse because scalpers can be prosecuted for scalping.

It harms quite literally everyone BUT the scalper - this is not victimless behavior.

It messes with how well a producer can gauge public interest in their product if the moment it goes on sale, its entire stock is instantly bought out by resellers. Rather than indicating real levels of public demand for the product, it only indicates the willingness of scalpers to BET that there is in fact public demand for the product.

It harms the stores that are meant to be selling the product. If you're a general manager at Target, for example, and you just got in a shipment of PS5's and they're all instantly sold the moment they go on sale, you might intuitively think ""great, whatever, same difference, more shelf space for me!"" But guess where nobody's coming to buy PS5's anymore? Your store. Guess what that means? Less foot traffic, fewer people physically in your store, fewer auxiliary purchases that might have happened had people been walking through the store looking for the item, less money spent at your store.

Finally it harms the consumers. Sure, if you choose to buy a PS5 for a 200% markup that part is arguably on you (although the previous two points still stand here), but what if you need an essential good and can no longer get it due to artificial scarcity created by scalpers? Who here remembers the toilet paper wars at the start of the pandemic?

I'm not saying it should be a felony or anything, but certainly if you get caught engaging in this behavior you should at least be fined enough to wipe out any profit you may have made in the process. Maybe make it a fixed formula: if it can be proven that you scalped x number of products and resold them for a y% markup, you then have to pay the state x times y% the value of the product at the time you purchased it.

I'm here because I would be FASCINATED to see if someone can get me to come around on the idea that ""scalpers should be allowed to do what they do without consequence, actually"".

Everywhere i have been i always had this feeling that there were always a lot more men than women.

I lived in different countries and cities.

Even though they say that there are more women in the world than men, I dont really see that.

More men in groups than women can cause them to fight between themselves to garner the attention of women.

Overall i think the world would be much more peaceful, if there was like a proportion of 90 women to 10 men.

Women libido is comparetively lower than that of men.

Men can have sexual relations several times a day with different partners. Not only can have, seems they are in pain for not having.

Whereas women are mostly fine even if gone for long periods of time without a partner.

Men are less picky than women, and more prone to be polygamous.

For example, when big tribal wars happened, you only needed a handful of male survivors to make sure the tribe replenishes itself.

That tells me men dont really have a problem with who they have relations with and how many.

Its like in most cases, its all fair game to them.

Men also become angry and resentful if they dont find a partner, which happens more often than not.

So i dont understand why nature did this to us. Is it perhaps because nature intends men to fight between themselves for the survival of the fittest?

If you ask me a better world would be a world with much less men and a lot more women.

We would have less violence, less of everything that is bad."

This year, the series's viewership has gone down from last year, according to [BARB figures](https://www.barb.co.uk/), and it's not yet reached nine million in the United Kingdom this year. If the finals week isn't viewed by more than nine million viewers in the UK, then the series may possibly be in trouble next year.

I really wish the Queen's death this year would have played the major factor in the series's viewership decline. However, constant numbers that still didn't reach nine million make me think of other numerous reasons.

Probably *Bake Off* might no longer be appealing, especially to casual viewers. Probably fans, casual and hardcore alike, got tired of the series any more. Or maybe the series has become predictable, dull, or whatever. Or maybe the contestants' charisma and baking skills this year have been... lacking compared to ones from prior seasons/series. Or maybe viewers got tired of producers' perceived offstage interference on the outcome of the competition. Or maybe viewers got tired of current co-hosts' comedy gags. Or maybe viewers got tired of current judges. Or maybe viewers got tired of the series's awkward and poorly executed tribute to international cuisines, like tacos and egg/spring rolls.

There must be other reasons for the viewership decline that I'm unaware of.

UPDATE:
I think I'm getting misunderstood, so I'm just gonna clear things up. This is not about twitter, facebook or any particular company. This is not about corporations and profits.



This is about consumers demanding a service ""for free"" while someone else attempts to make money off their content rather than coughing up a few bucks for something they spend years of life scrolling. You can't compete with FREE, so you can only compete using the same model.

Thanks to everyone who has participated. I came here with some concerns and proposed a solution. My main concern is that we as masses don't pay attention to these technologies, as much as we should and the fact that they're ""for free"" let's them off the hook, because they have to find other (evil) ways of making profit.


I voiced my frustration over how hard it must be to compete against someone who does it seemingly for free. I was reminded that it's the user content, making the money, isn't it technically slavery then?

However, the term ""pedophile"" has also been conflated with ""child sex offenders"". This also plays into why some people wish to use the term ""Minor Attracted Person"", while I disagree with this term, as it almost normalises pedophillic *relationships*, which are inherently immoral, I agree that there is a lot of stigma tied to the term ""pedophile"". 

Society's refusal to morally distinguish between a non-offending pedophile and an actual child sex offender leads to prejudice and harm against innocent people who have done nothing wrong. While you may not particularly *care* about the feelings of non-offending pedophiles, it's thought among sexologists that stigma against them actually increases the risk of a pedophile offending, since they'll be less likely to open up about their disorder.

Even if you do not care about non-offending pedophiles, perpetuating the stigma against pedophiles causes real world harm to children. I believe that reducing the stigma against non-offending pedophiles will lead to a safer world for children.

&gt; having a public that is informed about the difference between pedophilia as a sexual preference versus child sexual abuse as a sexual offense most likely represents an important precondition for the success of preventive measures against child sexual abuse

&gt; Although the stigma attached to pedophilia may be motivated by good intentions (e.g., the desire to protect children), there is also a growing awareness among sexologists and forensic practitioners that public stigma might increase the risk of sexual offenses against children—e.g., by impairing the mental health of persons with pedophilia, or discouraging persons with pedophilia who are at risk for sexual offending from seeking help [5,26,29,30]. Thereby, media coverage which conflates pedophilia and child sexual offending perpetuates the existing public stigma, i.e., [31,32,33].

Furthermore, I really hate when online activists put pressure specifically on Non-Americans to share their posts and spread awareness. When was the last time they posted something about us? And who would I help with sharing their post? The majority of someone's followers (if they aren't a celebrity/influencer) are from the same country as them. Does it really help an American black person if someone who cannot even vote in their country/go to protests/etc shares a random post? Why are we expected to care so much and educate ourselves about a country that knows nothing about us?

For anyone who doesn't know,  ran through means they have been with a lot of partners sexually. 

But I see too often women get called sluts for having sexual partners , but there's no shortage of men that will try to sleep with them.  

And I understand society ties our values to our sexual life while men's are more financial,  but its so crazy how easy the hypocrisy is overlooked. If a woman doesn't value herself in your eyes bc of her sexual life then why would you sleep with her? That makes you just as easy as her and clearly you aren't respecting yourself just like her.

It's sad that we're deemed sluts for willingly sleeping with men that wanted to sleep with us. But as soon as we decline, we're still the bad guys. We're ""wrong"" either way. And I won't even get started on how many people it takes to be deemed a ""slut"" bc it could be any number depending just how stupid someone is willing to be. I was deemed one just at one sexual partner.

Its disturbing women are attacked for willingly sleeping with men who want sleep with them too.


Double standards exist everywhere, and I'm not sure why we don't point out the illogical thinking in them. 

And this isn't to say all men are like this, or even that's its only men who think like this. People who uphold this thinking are all equally stupid in my eyes.

I also noticed that a lot of people share this opinion, their argument is helping others should be selfless and altruistic. I understand how selfless care for others is almost the peak of nobleness but is that really possible? I think there are only a few people on this planet who are willing to do that and their intentions may be noble and selfless. But, it's the sad reality that a few people helping other people cannot make a dent in the world's problems.

To make the most change and impact, people should be able to gain popularity through videos of them helping the homeless or whoever. At the end of the day, they are helping people, doesn't matter what their intentions are, the person getting the help would not complain about it. So, why is it that we the bystanders show such despise for the act?

In the current world, there are not a lot of things people won't do if you promise popularity and social media clout. It's messed up but that's the world we live in, so might as well put this messed-up reality to some use. Imagine people actively gaining popularity through deeds of charity without any backlash, others would also jump on this to pave their way to stardom. Their intentions are shallow and impure, I agree, but it will be an indisputable fact that they will have helped a lot of people. A lot more than a few selfless, altruistic individuals can help.

I agree that by doing this, there will inevitably be some people who pretend to donate and take it all back, basically doing it only for the screen. Then they should be the target of backlash and public scrutiny but not people who are doing it for just a few social media pictures. 

That's my opinion, what do you think?"

I had no history of addiction to amphetamine derivatives, no heart or cardiovascular conditions, had the capability to pay for my stimulants and medical consultations financially, had no major side effects or pharmacological contraindications, and had short-term weight gain due to the bad mental health that came with COVID over the past 2-3 years.

I understand that I have very specific circumstances. However the argument that I'm making is that due to social stigma specifically, there exist a non-trivial proportion of obesity cases wherein drug treatment does not come to mind or is otherwise not considered by both patients and medical professionals, even though it could be determined more probabilistically likely than not that it would have done more good than harm than the alternative treatment (or lack thereof) in that specific demographic:

Many different people use and are prescribed by medical professionals traditionally addictive drugs to treat conditions they were both meant and not meant to, and for reasons they were and were not originally synthesized for.

Why is weight loss the only scenario wherein people who are uninformed pharmacologically outright reject the treatment for themselves in situations where it may have caused more good than harm overall, and pass judgement on people who have specific circumstances where they state that it was the best medical decision?

Obesity kills so many fucking people per year, imagine if people reacted to medical therapy for heart disease or vaccines for inectious diseases in the same way they reacted to drug treatment for weight loss.

It's not as if stimulants aren't prescribed for binge eating disorder and obesity, it's just that it doesn't happen widely. The idea that ""there's no magic pill that will make you lose weight without effort"" is literally false, it's just that those magic pills come with negative side effects that will a decent amount of the time outweigh the positives."

The Reddit consensus about this video appears to be that although the cameraman was being obnoxious and sanctimonious in the *way* he chose to deliver his lesson, his lesson was sorely needed:

&gt; **10.1k upvotes:** Seems like a great time to sit down and educate a new father calmly and rationally…

&gt; **5.9k upvotes:** I get it, but I think it's really shitty to record this guy and put him on blast. I wish people would realize the long term value of a private conversation... He could have taught that young man a legitimate life lesson, instead of doing all this sanctimonious nonsense for social media clout.

What lesson is that? The legitimate life lesson that your child is unsafe if left unattended for a brief moment in a mall?

1.	⁠The [base rate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy) of child abductions in the US is [incredibly low.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping_in_the_United_States)

&gt; The federal government estimated about 50,000 people reported missing in 2001 who were younger than 18. **Only about 100 cases** per year can be classified as abductions by strangers.[2]

If you follow the source, you’ll find that only *34* of these child abductions every year are children under the age of 10. If we narrowed the stats down to just stroller-carried ages, we’d most likely be talking about between 0-10 abductions annually in a country with [23.4 million children below the age of 5.](https://www.childstats.gov/americaschildren/tables/pop1.asp)

2.	Over ⁠99% of child abductions are by a family member in the aftermath of an unfavorable custody arrangement.

3.	⁠in a mall, in public, in the richest and safest part of the richest and safest country in the world, surrounded by security officers, with a father who probably maintained a line of sight with his child for some amount of those 3 minutes, and other concerned strangers present, the objective probability of the child being taken is less than it dying by lightning strike or by a motor vehicle accident on the way to the mall.

He may as well have berated a random stranger for letting their child travel in a car.

This is a classic example of the [availability bias](Wikipediahttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability _heuristic), when we assume the likelihood of something is equivalent to how easy it is to think of vivid examples. Just like the fact that fear of plane travel, the safest form of travel that exists (safer than pedestrian travel, AKA “walking” for my non-intellectuals) is significantly more common than the fear of driving.

**Edit 1:** A friend couldn’t believe that plane travel is safer than walking in the United States, so here’s the statistical evidence:

&gt; Since 1997, the number of fatal air accidents has been no more than 1 for every 2,000,000,000 person-miles flown (e.g., 100 people flying a plane for 1,000 miles (1,600 km) counts as 100,000 person-miles, making it comparable with methods of transportation with different numbers of passengers, such as one person ...

According to the CDC:

&gt; More than 7,000 pedestrians were killed on our nation's roads in crashes involving a motor vehicle in 2020.1 That's about one death every 75 minutes.1.

[Source 1](https://www.cdc.gov/transportationsafety/pedestrian_safety/index.html)

[Source 2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#Transport_comparisons)

There have been only [2 fatal accidents](https://www.airlines.org/dataset/safety-record-of-u-s-air-carriers/) in the last 10 years of commercial aviation in the United States, killing a grand total of *2 people.*

**Edit 2:** Also [Sweden](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi-tPDlvKL7AhVWL0QIHcfpD-4QFnoECA8QAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelocal.se%2Fdiscuss%2Findex.php%3Fshowtopic%3D89622&amp;usg=AOvVaw15Lqb2vceWv0c2Pb_oqBlO) is at least an existence proof that it’s possible to leave one’s children outside, stroller-bound, without incident. Presumably we could just condition the probability on whatever the rate of the relevant types of crimes is for the mall the man was, compare that to the relative to the probability of child abductions in Sweden, and come away with a figure. I don’t feel like doing that, so maybe someone can do my homework for me in the comments? (I get that there are national differences in rates of crime; my point is that the rate of crime in a mall court area is probably considerably lower than the national crime rate in Sweden, even if we’re talking about an America mall, but who am I kidding? I must be some kind of child murderer, with all this apologia.)"

In fact, some members of each group seem to act in the opposite manner consistently.

To start with body size and shape, I think it's absurd that it is even a discussion. Everyone finds different things attractive, including different body shapes. Some men(I'm using that as an example because I'm a guy so it's easier) find women with larger breasts more attractive, while others find women with smaller breasts more attractive and neither is considered a problem. So if finding someone more or less attractive due to size and shape of breasts for instance, it should also be ok to find someone more or less attractive due to shape and weight?

With ethnicity and skin color it's more complicated. While some people do find members of certain ethnicities unattractive due to racist reasons, I think it isn't inherently racist to find some ethnicities more or less attractive physically. Members of different ethnicities may have largely different physical features for members of other ethnicities. Not only that people tend to find what looks closer to them in general to be more attractive, hence why interracial marriages are somewhat uncommon. Not only that, like I said before, finding some hair colors more attractive is seen as ok, so why can't that be the case for skin color too? I'm not saying that making derogatory claims such as ""x group is hideous"" but simply not finding someone pretty  does not mean you hate them

I hope this makes sense, English is not my first language and I have a hard time writing

Edit: finding someone unattractive because they're not a minor is problematic but that's not what I meant originally. My general point is: it isn't bigotry to find someone physically unattractive, and I'm talking specifically physical attraction here"

Why are we so invested in cults of political allegiance, that we miss the potential value of independent representatives?

If we're looking for more political diversity and stability in the long run I think political parties should be regulated in the same way governments *should* regulate corporate monopolies.   


If political parties were banned outright, I believe that we'd have more political innovation, more governmental efficiency, and voters would need to research more before voting because their choice doesn't come pre-labelled. I believe that representatives would be more effective at representing their citizens because the party is no longer the primary shareholder in their beliefs.   


Everyone being independent would make our government more stable because it avoids the extremes of political swings and overshoots.

They are correct that it's happening, people don't talk to their neighboors and extended family as much as they used to in the west. But it really is a good thing when you look at it closely. Back in the day, yes you had a close knit community. Said community was more than happy to shun anybody who didn't perfectly conform to whatever arbitrary standards the community set. This is how LGBT people, and even those who just disagreed overall ended up being outcast or even killed by their own family. They were different, and therefore ""not really family"" so they were discarded.


Sure it may be a little more lonely these day's, but people are allowed to be different. Sure I don't speak to my cousins, which is great because most of them are horrible people. Most of mt extended family is religious and hates me because I'm not. If I existed 100 years ago, I'd have probably been killed by them for that.

0,2022-11-10,CMV: Being a SAHM is not enjoyable,u/Lyrae-NightWolf,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yrv1hv/cmv_being_a_sahm_is_not_enjoyable/,changemyview,"SAHM = Stay at home mom

I'm not a parent, in fact I'm very childfree, so I admit that my position can be biased.

My mom's been a SAHM for most of her parenting years. She has had a career for 19 years but only worked 4 of them, which is very sad. She had to reject a scholarship she was offered because I was a baby and she didn't have time. She regrets having me too early.

In her case it was not her choice. It was the situation she had to live. She's not miserable, but wishes to stop being a SAHM soon. I feel bad for her as she had to stop working on what she is passionate about and she's stressed and busy every day.

But I recently discovered that there are SAHMs by choice. Some of them never had a career and became mothers early while others quit their jobs. It seems crazy that someone would want to throw their dreams and personal life in the trash just to live for another person. A person that not only is incapable of taking care of themself, but is also annoying, stressful and demanding.

You sure may love them, but they are hard work, and there are too many parts that are not enjoyable.

I can't understand how someone can be happy being locked in the house with annoying children, doing housework and caretaking all day. In the case of small children you can't leave them alone, so you have to take them everywhere. For the most part, it seems that being a SAHM leaves no time to have a personal life. It's just being there to do chores and live for another person.

I also find concerning that some people make ""being a mom"" their entire personality and devote to their children, leaving behind their own self, their dreams, their career. Like they lose who they were before and their whole identity becomes being a ""mommy"". It's almost like they are so frustrated with their own personal life that they look for a new purpose.

Not having time for yourself, to make activities you enjoy and maybe working doesn't seems healthy, forgetting who you are is not healthy. Being a parent is not just a nice activity, it's hard and stressful, it can damage your mind. Balancing personal life and parenting duties is possible. Getting a time away from the children is good for you. I don't think someone can be happy being around their children 24/7 doing things for them while they scream and whine and talk and drive you crazy. There should be a break from that, and it seems that being a SAHM by choice is torturing yourself."

6,2022-11-10,CMV: Typesetting should use two spaces after a period ending a sentence.,u/DannyTheBrick,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yrvopz/cmv_typesetting_should_use_two_spaces_after_a/,changemyview,"There's been a similar CMV in the past ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/pz0w6x/cmv_putting_two_spaces_after_a_periodfull_stop_is/)), but bear with me here.

The general debate about two spaces versus one after a period that ends a sentence largely focuses on issues of typesetting.  The claim being that two spaces arose from typewriters, which used fixed-with fonts, whereas modern word processors automatically add the appropriate spacing after a period to create the appropriate spacing required for proper reading.

In my perspective, modern typesetting should allow for (it mostly already does), if not *prefer* two spaces after the end of a sentence rather than one.  Here's why:

* In many cases, this is what most compilers already do.  Comments from the linked post, note that the OP appeared to use single spaces between their sentences, because Reddit (and likely just as a carryover from HTML) automatically treats multiple spaces as a single space.  So the actual visual spacing observed between sentences, whether the person typing uses one or two spaces is the same.  (Though, I acknowledge this is not true for many word processors.)
* Implicit in a lot of the discussion is that the space following a sentence is *supposed to be* longer than the space between words (but a compiler handles this).  Though this is never suggested, in principle, this implies that the space following a sentence could be thought of as a different character than the space between words--they just look remarkably similar.  And there's another set of characters that look remarkably similar: the hyphen, en-dash, and em-dash.  In this very bullet point I used both hyphens and an em-dash... and guess how I indicate an em-dash?  I used two hyphens.  (Sorry, en-dash, you get much less compiler love.)
* Finally, as someone who codes, I am often using fixed-width font anyway.  So unless we claim that it was always a mistake to use two spaces, even with fixed-width fonts (maybe), then it seems using two spaces after the end of a sentence leads to more robust typesetting.  When in an uncompiled state (e.g., if using LaTeX), you have the two spaces which would make it easier to read; and in the compiled state you have the proper spacing (which is typically accepted to be the width between one and two spaces).

Other quick notes: (1) yes, two spaces requires 1 more keystroke, but I don't mind (I also prefer double quotes over single quotes even when they can be interchanged... call me an extra-stroke masochist); (2) I agree that the Johnson, Bui, Schmitt article is unconvincing even if it supports two spaces.  It's also largely inconsequential given my focus on typesetting, above.

**EDIT:** My title might be a bit misleading, what I mean is that we should encode the space between sentences as two spaces (hit the space bar twice), and have whatever typesetting system we are using translate those two spaces into the appropriate distance between sentences (whatever it is that you think is appropriate).  I am **not** saying that the visual distance between two sentences should be twice the width of spaces between words.

**EDIT 2:** Thanks to u/RaisinBranKing for helping a bit with the clarifying questions, perhaps another way to word the post is: \[1\] It is useful to have a two characters: one that is used to separate words and one that is used to separate sentences. \[2\] It seems reasonable to encode the word-separator as a single space and the sentence-separator as two spaces."

With Elon Musk buying Twitter, and the resulting fallout with the aftermath (8 dollar verification, parody accounts, banning anyone he wants), this could spell the end of Twitter. To be honest, despite popular consensus, I think that that's a positive outcome for 2 primary reasons:

a) *It continues to expose more people to the fact that Elon Musk is a fool*. I remember in 2015, he was a media darling that so many people admired. Now since the pandemic, for many reasons, his popularity has plummeted. This is good, for we as a society should stop idolizing billionaires. Plus this is a positive outcome because it shows that bad choices can lead to bad outcomes for even people like Elon Musk. He is living proof of ""A fool and his money soon parted.""

b) *Twitter has been a net negative for society as a whole.* Social Media, and Twitter especially, have been a disaster for humanity. If it wasn't for Twitter, we would've never gotten Donald Trump as president. Knowing what's on the mind of a politician, athlete, or entertainer should be of no concern to us anyway, not that they say anything relevant anyway. I'll admit, I don't use twitter, and I don't plan on it, as the whole platform looks objectively terrible anyway.  


I guess I'm curious if there is a good argument for why Twitter not going under is a net positive for society."

Memorial Day is similar to Veterans Day, as we too remember veterans on Memorial Day, and Memorial Day’s date fluctuates annually, it’s anywhere from May 25-May 31. 

Veterans Day can easily be moved to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, as there is no one perfect date to choose for Veterans Day, why not just make it Election Day? It reminds us of what veterans fought for, which includes the right to representation via voting. 

Election Day should be a federal holiday regardless, but instead of having two federal holidays in such close proximity, and having to have businesses/schools/towns adjust to such, it can all happen on the same day."

They make it impossible to cancel your membership through the website / app. Literally everything else is doable through those services, just not cancelling. As far as I know, there's no legit reason to force us to call to cancel. 

Calling shouldn't be the only option. I should be able to just send an email ""This is my 30 day notice to cancel my account"" but it's intentionally (I believe) made difficult to discourage cancellation. 

But I think this is where the law needs to step in. There's many other consumer protection laws in place and I feel like this one would do a lot of good. Charter and ADT should be legally required to make it as easy to cancel as it is to create an account. 

ADT Says that for security reasons they require phone calls, but I don't believe it. They already have two separate passwords and two security questions they could use. I am frustrated!"

An immoral action is often treated as though it contravenes some greater law of cosmic justice. However, I feel like morality is, as mentioned, relative in nature. Theres nothing inherently right or wrong about certain actions. Something is adjudged to be moral if it aided survival for primitive humans.

For instance,  murder was considered to be, to put it lightly, extremely immoral because it could potentiate inter tribal strife/conflict, and such infighting was likely to result in injuries to tribemembers who were then less able to hunt and survive. The extent to which something is 'immoral' is actually simply a measure of how much it reduced chances of survival. Significant net negative? Extremely Immoral. A slight negative? Its less of a transgression.

Change my view! Hoping to spark some debate about this topic.\\

9,2022-11-11,cmv: the r/Communism subreddit is echochamber and should change its rules to accommodate better discussion or simply go private.,u/GeneralPierogi,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ysief8/cmv_the_rcommunism_subreddit_is_echochamber_and/,changemyview,"I understand the necessity of creating ""safe spaces"" where people do not feel judged and can freely express their opinions. I also understand that ideas develop within their own community and parties exist to increase cooperation between policy-makers.

However, it took me 15 minutes of scrolling through the r/Communism sub to realise it's one massive echochamber that refuses to be criticised. Their rules specifically require you to subscribe to the ideology to join and categorically exclude members of the armed forces or police.

This sort of thing is very dangerous and I'm unsure how this is different to there being a Fascism/National Socialism subreddit.

Politics is not a place for ""safe spaces"", it is (at least in the Democratic sense of the word) a place for ideas to be discussed and critically analysed; in fact, I would argue that political discussions require a great deal of scepticism to be applied to all sides of any argument, something the r/Communism sub bans users for.

Once again, blind faith is a dangerous practice that radicalises people and alienates others. Furthermore, someone who subscribes to an ideology should be able to defend it in a debate setting and provide reasons for their beliefs, something that cannot be done within an echochamber.

Other ideology-specific subreddits do not ban users who are not subscribed to their ideology and even promote discussion. Even when they do have rules that require discussion from their perspective, they do not ban sceptics and simply ask for the discussion to be had from their point of view.

They instead recommend people go to r/debatecommunism for discussion but if that's the case, why create the subreddit in the first place? Reddit does not need parties, it doesn't legislate or run anything, so I don't see why rejecting sceptics is justifiable.

I may be biased, as I'm against Communism, but I'd expect any political subreddit I'm in to be favourable to discussing anything.

Any justifications for this sort of thing?"

The ñ evolved after centuries of writing: from nn, to n^(n) to ñ. It's used to represent the  **/ɲ/** sound in the language and it appears in over 15.700 words in Spanish. In the 90s, the EU asked Spain to stop using the letter ñ as they didn't want to import new keyboards with this letter, something that even Gabriel García Márquez and Mario Vargas Llosa criticized.

The reason it should be adopted in other languages outside Spanish, Galician, Astur-Leonese and a some Indigenous languages in America is that it's really useful, especially for most Romance languages.

In Portuguese they use nh, and they use gn in French and Italian. Words with such sounds get translated into Spanish with an ñ:

Champagne: champaña

Gnocchi: ñoqui

Gafanhoto: gafañote

Lasagna: lasaña

Champignon: champiñón

Patihno: Patiño

&amp;#x200B;

And there are lots of examples. It saves space and it can be applied to lots of languages. The same can be said about languages that don't change their sentence structure when making a question. In Spanish we don't change the structure of the sentences and it's only of intonation when you speak, so the RAE (Royal Spanish Academy) suggested the usage of an inverted symbol when making an exclamation or a question in 1754.

Vas a ir al concierto, cierto = You'll go to the concert, right

¡Vas a ir al concierto, cierto! = You'll go to the concert, right!

¿Vas a ir al concierto, cierto? = Will you go to the concert, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Even in English, these symbols can be really useful under certain contexts:

When you were walking around the market you ate that apple, didn't you?

If you add the ¿ at the beginning of the sentence you'll already know they are making a question and not an statement:

¿When you were walking around the market you ate that apple, didn't you?

&amp;#x200B;

It helps you save time when reading a large sentence that don't start with the verb or an interrogative word and knowing the person is making a question or shouting instead of reading it again because it didn't give you a direct hint. It'd also be extremely helpful for Wh-in-situ languages."

EDIT: **Mods, it took this two hours to be approved and the rule says 3 hour to respond before deletion. Please give me more time as it was not approved before some time.**

(Note: This is not a discussion if socialism is bad, there are too many threads on that already. The discussion is about how this specific branch is worse compared intents of being a socialist. I hope some of you who respond will actually be socialist and not just haters!)

I think socialism can be good for mankind, especially from an empathy standpoint if one cares about ethics or morality. Nature is inherently unfair and harsh, and focusing on technological advancement can make people more equal. This has put me on the path towards socialism. However, because Marxist theory is difficult (Dialectics, Hegel, das kapital is massive) I end up watching those long Youtube essays by left-wing youtubers, hoping it can be a good introduction.

But what I have garnered after watching Breadtuber and adjacent socialists, who do not call themselves Breadtubers and is a fan term, is that they seem to hold Art as the most important thing about socialism. They seem to hold the belief that capitalism strangles art and literature, and socialism is mainly good because they will be free to make art in itself, instead of art for income or for entertaining others (I don't see why creating something that the masses enjoy is bad if it did not inherently exploit anyone).

People who are Aesthetic socialists seem to use Nietzsche and Oscar Wilde to openly admit you should not help the poor out of empathy, but because ""we will have a more aesthetically pleasing environment"".

Here is a disturbing quote which I will source below - Bold text has been added to the parts I find best for this discussion: "" Oscar Wilde's essay ""[The Soul of Man under Socialism](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/wilde-oscar/soul-man/)"" is a great example of a Socialist type of ideology that ***isn't*** **driven by slave morality. In his essay he claims that we should solve poverty, not because of compassion for the poor, but simply because in doing so we will have a more aesthetically pleasing environment.** The majority of people, he claims, ""find themselves surrounded by hideous poverty, by hideous ugliness, by hideous starvation."" a fact that degrades us as a society. Wilde wasn't in favour of equality in the sense that he strived to degrade the rest of society, pulling down everyone else. On the contrary - he wanted to lift everybody, which is a clear *affirmation*. Real socialism, then, according to Wilde, isn't the compassionate Socialism of Marxists and Anarchists, but rather an ""Aesthetic Socialism"".

[On how one can in fact be a Nietzschean Socialist : Nietzsche (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nietzsche/comments/p9qaqw/on_how_one_can_in_fact_be_a_nietzschean_socialist/)

I do not think slave morality and glorifying weakness is bad at all.  If the world was lead by slave morality socialism, but without religion, homophobia/transphobia and sexism, I fail to see why this would be so bad. I am not arguing that it will realistically happen, but I don't see what is so bad about encouraging weakness combined with slave morality. And I think that people like Contrapoints and other Aesthetic socialists would be better off as wine socialists or LGBT feminist artists, because capitalism glorifies art above compassion in many cases.

I REALLY want my view on this changed, because I struggle to find people like me who are tired of academic socialists, and instead find slave-morality driven socialists, but without religion as I am an atheist. And people like Contrapoints are super popular, so I assume they must be good philosophers and know what they are doing."

That means nobody should receive punishments simply because they ""deserve"" them, since that is irrelevant when it comes to maximizing overall wellbeing. Instead, consequences for crime should exclusively focus on what is beneficial to the community at large, including the offender. 

To be clear, if it were true that some kind of harsh punishment maximized overall wellbeing by dissuading others from committing the crime, and that punishment ended up being the best way to maximize wellbeing, then I would support that punishment. My only point is that I would not support the punishment on the basis that the person deserved it, or as punishment for its own sake. I would only support it as a means to an end.

Why don’t we require every journalist to have a university degree in journalism?

The Internet has unlocked large viewership for the common folk. You no longer need capital to buy a printing press, or a TV station.

Now, it requires a $10 webcam, which means you can make journalistic content at a zero budget. That includes a zero budget for the investigative reporters. The staff can be $0.

What has this led to? Excesses like Alex Jones.

In 1970, there would not be a single TV host who had the liberty of making up any crazy story they wanted, and present it while mentally completely gone.

It is popular to denounce elitism, but current society needs an educated, balanced elite and cannot leave information dissemination to the mentally deranged.

Every Tom, Dick and Harry with a million viewer platform is **not** a good thing.

I personally think the USA needs to either have guns everywhere or no guns at all. This weird limbo state we’re in right now where there is a bunch of regulations and states with weird gun laws is making people victims. You have easy access to firearms but a ton of people that are against firearms or places where firearms aren’t allowed and are easy targets for lunatics. 


I think the intention of the second amendment was to have the large majority of the population armed to put everyone on an even playing field. You can’t have it both ways otherwise people are gonna be victimized. “An armed society is a polite society” I do believe that phrase is true when the whole of society is armed. 

I don’t need statistics on guns and gun crime and good guys with guns not stopping shootings or whatever else. That has nothing to do with my point. 

Before the 60s to my knowledge there was almost completely no regulation on firearms. You could own whatever you wanted. People in schools had guns. Everyone had guns under their seats and in their back windows of their cars and trucks. There was very very little mass shootings in the same way that we have them currently. It’s either THAT or get rid of them in general and get rid of the second amendment. There is no middle ground. You’re only hurting people on both sides of the spectrum.

I think in a world with firearms banned there would be major problems and in a world where everyone has firearms galore there would be major problems to. But I’d personally rather live in the latter."

Apart from the fact that **forcing** anyone to perform work is slavery, the fact that it removes job opportunities from people who would do it for a reasonable wage.

14,2022-11-12,"CMV: Vehicle (and maybe other similar) repossessions should be conducted in a more formal manner with a bank rep along with a legitimate towing person, and maybe a LEO present.",u/blz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ytjne3/cmv_vehicle_and_maybe_other_similar_repossessions/,changemyview,"This is something I started thinking about after a dear friend of mine was recently the victim of an errant repossession of his pickup truck that had already been paid off for more than a year. That's right, a clerical error by the bank resulted in a ""repo man"" being dispatched to my friend's home where they came and took off with said pickup in under a minute (gone in sixty seconds indeed.)

We were both witness to the tow vehicle pulling away when we took notice of the unusual sounds coming from the front, unfenced, driveway.

To add insult to injury, it took most of the week for him to get his truck released when someone at the bank was able to finally look at his papers proving the pickup was in fact fully owned by him and had been since mid 2021 (he originally started off making payments then was later able to pay of the rest all in one go after his financial situation drastically improved. He had never fallen behind on any payments, he just couldn't afford to buy it outright until later on.)

So this got me thinking. Why exactly is it that banks use these hired guns (what I've learned after some research are effectively mercenaries) that operate in what is a rather legal grey area at times, rather then just sending a representative from the bank, with papers proving they have a right to take back the vehicle, accompanied by a legitimate towing service, and maybe a law enforcement officer if needed if trouble is feared (e.g., known bad neighborhood) ?

I feel it would be a lot better due to:

1) The act of preparing papers of proof might flush out mistakes similar to what happened to my friend, where they realize that they were wrong (it is paid off already) and call off the repossession,

2) It will make it a lot clearer that a repossession is legitimate; there have been scams (e.g., fake repo-men stealing cars), that I have seen discussed when I did my research and some good videos on that in YouTube,

3 ) Having an official representative from the bank would allow the target to produce proof (something my friend was given NO opportunity to do) which could quickly show when the bank was in error, or, say, a payment was in fact sent (a copy could be shown, receipt from the post office, etc), and

4) It would still be possible to have that surprise-attack angle that I understand is sometimes replied on to make sure the more crazy/pretty out there don't try to hide or intentionally cause damage to the vehicle. With my idea, it would just be a rep arriving with (perhaps *in*) a legitimate towing vehicle and maybe a police office, sheriff, etc.


What it comes down to for me is, if the bank has the legal right already to reclaim what is really their property (it's not fully yours until it's paid off), then why not do it using straight forward way where there can be no rational confusion when paper work and also an official from the lender is present (with law enforcement as backup when needed.) Right now where there isn't even a chance to talk to anyone before the vehicle is just whisked away just feels like a broken system that should be moved away from."

It doesn’t matter at all. The size of a flaccid penis has no impact on a man’s sexual prowess or his ability to please a woman in bed. It’s not inside a pussy when it’s flaccid. It’s not trying to pleasure a woman when it’s flaccid. You don’t try to make a woman cum with a flaccid penis. A flaccid penis plays no role in providing a woman sexual pleasure. No woman picks a man based on the size of his flaccid penis.

OK, yes, a large flaccid penis may provide some occasional, brief, mild visual stimulation. A woman might feel a thrill when she takes a peak at a big bulge in a man’s pants. She might feel a flush of excitement when a man pulls down his pants, and he has a big dick dangling between his legs. But those feelings are transitory, and, ultimately, have no effect on her sexual pleasure. Or her orgasm.

More over, your children aren't paying rent, and can't complain if they are mandated to assist in children care. However, expecting an emotional bond to form is harmful. It forces the child to have to feel emotions they may not want to feel towards someone. For some reason, people are torn to shreds if they don't have a good reason for not being close to their siblings. It's expected that they put up with wrong behavior from them under the guise of ""family"" even if they never wanted a sibling. I think it would be better if children were told they did not have to form emotional bonds to their siblings, just tolerate them until they move out. After that, there is no reason to expect them to maintain contact. Why would they if they never wanted them to exist in the first place?"

It seems to me that people who have kids young struggle to find their identity outside of their family, and may have crises when their kids finally move away from home.

It also seems that people whose sole purpose is to get married and have kids may not have developed enough interests or purpose outside of this - as if kids will bring meaning to their life. If you have a great relationship with yourself and others, have hobbies and maybe a career you enjoy, wouldn't the idea of having kids that would effectively change your life forever be quite daunting?

EDIT:
From most of the comments it seems like younger parents nowadays, or at least the ones on here, are able to find a balance between raising children and rounding out their lives with other things, which is great to see. The context surrounding my initial opinion is that I have often been surrounded by traditional conservative individuals who seem to jump into marriage and kids and seem to be resentful of their choices or have lost themselves in their roles as parents while simultaneously praising parenthood as their sole purpose in life. I recognise my bias - thank you everyone for your thoughts!"

So I was thinking about this during Remembrance Day, and it was no doubt helped by my thinking about what's going on in Ukraine. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that even though I've never been to war myself, I'm certain that being in or around war is one of the worst experiences humans can go through.

But I realize that much of ours, and certainly my own, entertainment is war. Lots of movies/tv shows/video games depict not just violence, but WAR, and they use it for fun.

Personally for me, it's Star Wars and Warhammer 40k, but another great example would be the call of Duty video game series. These games and movies are \*fun\* experiences. Someone could argue that no, Star Wars is meant to teach us about the necessity of rebellion in the face of fascism, or that CoD is really about teaching history to young people in a medium they understand. And while these might not be wrong, I think they omit the larger truth: People enjoy these properties because they are \*fun.\*

In CoD,  it is \*fun\* to storm Omaha Beach. It is fun to fight as a Russian soldier on the Eastern front in CoD 5. In the Star Wars battlefront games it is \*fun\* to get in a tie fighter and have dogfights with rebel X-wings.

I worry this might be deeply insulting to the real pain suffered by past and present soldiers, and those civilians whose's lives were also destroyed by these conflicts. WWII wasn't just horrific for the soldiers, but also for millions of civilians across the world. To take these events and treat them like a game might show a lack of appreciation for the very real suffering people have gone though.

And while properties like Star Wars/40k/Starcraft may not be legit history and they don't show real people, it's obvious that Star Wars battles or 40k battles are indeed inspired by real life conflict - the 40k imperial guard is easily inspired by real militaries and the Empire is partially inspired by the Nazis.

I think there are exceptions to this though. Saving Private Ryan and Tolstoy's War and Peace come to mind, but I think the difference is that both of these properties try to depict war in a way that is not fun, but can actually educate people in how bad war is. So if, say, every person on earth was forced to watch Saving Private Ryan, or were forced to read War and Peace, maybe some people who are currently very pro-war would rethink whether or not war is always the most desirable solution.

So I am not saying that ALL depictions of war in media are immoral, just those where the main purpose of depicting the warfare is for fun.

Note: I'm not saying this to be a purity. I adore these properties, but I'm not sure if enjoying them is really ethical, especially since I've been cloaked in the privilege of living my life largely untouched by war."

This person sees US government allowing to kill almost a million innocent people every year ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion\_statistics\_in\_the\_United\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_statistics_in_the_United_States)). Vietnam war lasted 20 years and US inflicted less than a million casualties during that period (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam\_War). These are comparable crises for a person in consideration.
2. Today information travels much faster that 50 years ago. It took more than 10 years for an anti-war movement to fully rump up in the US during Vietnam war. Estimated 15-25 million people protested on the streets during just one month after George Floyd death.
3. From 1 and 2, if there were tens of millions people thinking that abortion is just as bad as killing an innocent person, there would be huge anti abortion protests all over the country."

I though that, if I refuse to talk to people having opposite views, I could only fight them. If I was not ready to fight them, I should talk to them. Try to understand why they think what they think.  


Do they have a point ? Do I have a blind spot ? Can I change them ? Can we understand each other ? Can we find a common ground or are we fundamentally adversaries ?  


Do debating with ideas I found dangerous is good because it's being democratic and pacific and I should not be dogmatic and too sure of my beliefs ? Or is it bad because some ideas aren't worth debating ?  


Do debating racist ideas, for example,  make them stronger ? If I want less racism should I speak to racists or should I try to ignore them ?"

17,2022-11-13,CMV: ACAB utilises black and white thinking,u/Apo-cone-lypse,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yty6d2/cmv_acab_utilises_black_and_white_thinking/,changemyview,"I do want to start of by saying that I live in Australia, so we don't have a lot of police brutality here, and our laws against minorities are relatively okay (could be better but compared to other countries it's fine). Okay, so I was in a post in r/lgbt recently where everyone was bashing a post and calling it ""copaganda"". The logic from what i can tell for people who push ACAB is something like 'if police cooperate in punishing an ill-fitted law (arresting gay people, POC, etc) then they are a bad cop, and should leave and if not, it makes them a bad person'. This is a general overview of what I think their point is, and I have so many problems with it.

For starters, it completely invalidates the good that cops do. Let's say that Cop(A) arrests someone for kissing another of the same sex, but that same officer also stopped 3 assaults from occurring. Why does one bad deed outway the good? I dont think this cop would necessarily be good or bad, I think they would be neutral. By singling in on one fault your ignoring the good things people do, and generalising.  Your actions don't always define you. This isnt the best argument and i understand people have a problem with that one, so let's push on from this now, the second problem I have with this is the 'if your a good person you will quit' ideology. If more good cops do start to leave, then slowly, the police force will only be filled with truly bad cops. I'm talking the ones committing police brutality, and actively committing acts of violence or blatant discrimination against minority groups. If these ""neutral"" or ""good"" cops stay however, they can act as whistle blowers for the bad ones, and attempt to change things from the inside. I want to make it very clear that I know there are a lot of bad cops, as well as issues with whistleblowing, however I don't believe the problem here is the individual cops, but the system itself. I do believe there should be change in the system, but don't blame the individual officers, *especially* the ones who do actual good, as the problem. The good cops have to stay, because if they don't no one will be there to balance out the actually bad ones. If your angry about cops pushing the law, we'll guess what, the LAW is the problem, not the cops! They are monitored (actions recorded) and could get fired for not doing their jobs. Your also all forgetting about the POC and LGBT+ cops. It's also a lot harder to quit then people seem to think. It's fantastic If you've managed to quit your career and successfully start fresh before, but that doesn't mean everyone can. Staying in the police force because it allows you to feed your family, and staying to support the discriminatory laws are 2 very different things. Your intention does impact whether your philosophically seen as good or bad, yet people are defining a whole career as bad, neglecting to mention those who feel they have to stay, those who try to actively challenge the law and attempt whisteblowing, and those who have done a lot of good for the community. I think the whole argument for ACAB can be summed up to extremely black and white thinking. The majority of cops aren't good or bad, they're neutral. You've likely done some bad things in your life, maybe a mistake or something you had to do, that doesn't define you, and make you a bad human. So why does doing some bad to try and push for good inherently make an officer a bad cop? What about the people they saved, the actually bad people they put away, does that mean nothing  to you? 
This seems to be a popular issue, so I've posted here incase I'm missing something, but no one I've seen has refuted the claims I made on other posts and seemed to not understand how philosophy works whilst exercising the fallacy that is black and white thinking. I also want to ask if ACAB only applies to places where the laws are discriminatory? If cops don't have to push unjust laws, then are they not bad? Does ACAB only apply in places where the law is discriminatory? Where I live we dont really have any laws against minority groups (from my knowledge, please correct me if im wrong). I also just feel like asking cops to quit their jobs would actually do the opposite of help. We need cops who disagree with the system to stay and fight it, getting fired by facing up to the system makes a statement and is better than quitting quietly. These cops need to stay, and fight these laws and the truly bad cops (in this case I'm referring to the ones who actually agree with discriminatory laws and commit police brutality).

TLDR: the problem isnt with individuals in the police force, it's with the system which needs to change to account for whistleblowing, with more punishment for abusive cops, and the laws shouldn't be this discriminatory in the first place. Blame the system/law, not the people, and stop thinking of others are either ""bad"" or ""good"", maybe their just people.

Edit: I'm not going to reply to people who are either repeating what others have said, or are replying in a passive aggressive/unhelpful manner.

Edit 2: here are the main  problems I still have with it:

 There are still a lot of problems I have with ACAB, but  this time it's more to do with how people would fix the system. I'm referring in this case to what people expect the police officers to do.

1. Quit. People are all over the place with this one, saying that all cops should just quit, but admitting that cops are needed so not all of them can quit? Okay, first things first, im basing this in my country because not everyone lives in America. We habe antidiscrimination  laws here, so assume anything bad done by cops wasnt from an order, but from cips abusing power/being assholes. Here are the definitions im using so there isn't any confusion: ""Good cop"" = a cop who hasn't committed any acts if aggression, isn't racist/sexist, and actively whistleblows whether anonymous or not, or hasnt witnessed something that needs whistleblowing. ""Neutral cop"" = someone who is a cop, but hasn't participated in any racism/acts of aggression, however they may not whistleblow on a fellow officer. ""Bad cop"" - someone who has committed an act of aggression, bodice brutality, or general discrimination against someone. I want to be clear that these are the definitions that I'm using, and their purpose is to provide clarity on who I'm talking about. 

Now we can get into it with these definitions set. Okay so a lot of people here are saying that there are no good cops, because they all quit, and if your in the force, you should quit. For starters, I know there are a lot of cases where no one whistleblows, but that doesn't mean you can dismiss the cases where anonymous cops have dobbed in co-workers. Good cops are also people who haven't witnessed their co-workers do anything worthy of whistleblowing yet, therefore they haven't done anything ""bad"" by allow another to get away with committing an act of violence or discrimination. Now, let's say everyone does up and quit like people want. We are now left with no cops all of a sudden, and most people seem to agree that that wouldn't lead to anything good. We can't just suddenly have no cops, it would be anarchy. But then, what about the argument ""if your a good cop you will leave?"" All we are doing here is pushing ""good cops"" and ""neutral cops"" out of the system. Do you really want a police force made up of just ""bad cops""? I dont think so. Yes, not whistleblowing isn't a good thing, but it's a hell of a lot better than committing the act itself. All this objective is doing is pushing ""good cops"" and ""neutral cops"" out of the force, leaving bad ones behind. I think it can be agreed that this is a bad thing.


The other option I've seen is not for the cops already  in the force to quit, but for no one to join, as this would slowly reduce the number compared to everyone suddenly quitting. The problem I have with this is that there is No Proof (from my knowledge) that proves that people not applying to be officers would allow for reform. In fact, I think it would do the opposite. What's happening in Queensland for example - we dont have enough people joining the police force, so you know what they did? They didn't reform, they lowered the highering standards. I'm not sure about other countries, but I have  a feeling that they would do the same thing. By saying ""don't become an officer"" all your really doing is lowering the highering standards, leasing to less educated people becoming officers, which can't be a good thing. 

Basically, if all cops quit we are fucked, but if no one joins things will get worse. What we need is for people to protest against the laws that allow cops to get away with discrimination, and supply them with places to anonymously report eachother."

The debt limit is a stupid, procedural aspect of government and there is no rational reason to not increase it whenever it needs to be increased.  If the spending has already been approved by other legislative measures, it's stupid to intentionally default on the debts of the United States government because the credit limit that we set on ourselves isn't sufficient to cover the already-approved spending.

Depending upon how many responses I get here, I probably won't spend a lot of time dealing with responses that don't understand the difference between government debt and household debt.  My view is less centered on the mechanics of government spending and the debt limit and more on my belief that the Republicans will hold the debt limit hostage to get what they want, and willingly tank the economy if they don't get it."
0,2022-11-13,"CMV: US Congressional districts should not be apportioned geographically, but by demographic features, specifically age.",u/beingsubmitted,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yu26sq/cmv_us_congressional_districts_should_not_be/,changemyview,"Gerrymandering is a big problem, and where it isn't a big problem yet, it's only a matter of no one taking advantage of it. The supreme court has previously expressed interest in ending gerrymandering, but lacks a clear way to measure and test it. There have been proposals for guidelines to limit gerrymandering, though each has it's pros and cons, and while I support that over the current system, I'm still left questioning if districts ought to be divided geographically at all.  


On one hand we could have a parliamentary system, where people vote for a party, and the parties fill their seats proportional to the vote. The downside here is you can't directly hold individual representatives accountable. I prefer for people to vote for the actual people, so that if they were to act corruptly, they could be held accountable by the voters themselves.  


I believe that the main reason for geographic districts is, at it's origin, mainly logistical. 200 years ago, it was way easier to just say ""you live here, you vote here"". Secondarily, it would be assumed that people that lived near one another geographically likely had shared interests. They likely shared economic factors, worked in similar industries, etc. Today, geography says very little about someone's interests. Telephones, internet, remote work, all of these things limit how important your actual address is (socioeconomically, your address says a lot about you, but that's not something we would want to reinforce).  


It could be seen as a positive that your representative would care about local spending on things like infrastructure, but that's not proving to be the case, and I think it would be better for representatives to work together for the betterment of the state as a whole than to chase pork for a bridge in their district.  


I think if you want to split voters into shared interests and things that will actually effect them, you should do so by age. Older voters are going to care more about stability in the stock market, for example, as it effects their day to day life in retirement. Younger voters are going to care more about climate change, as older voters won't live to see the more severe consequences that younger voters will have to face. Each group's healthcare needs and safety concerns are unique as well. It will still be clear to each person who their representative is and will be. Some people will vote for a representative in one election and find themselves in a different district the next, but that's also true now because people move and maps are redrawn. It would be trivial from a technological standpoint to implement it and impossible to gerrymander. How each state splits it's age groups will be based on the census, and you even have 18 years (nearly 2 census warning) with new people entering the voting block in order to predict a future split, with the only unknowns between censuses being immigration/emigration (in and out of the state) and death. On death, that should add additional incentive for the representative of the oldest voters to actually protect the health and wellbeing of their voters.  


I think it's an all around better system, but I only started thinking about it in the shower yesterday. What are the cons that I'm missing (aside from how likely it is to actually happen, particularly as it would likely disadvantage those currently in power)."

* Severely truant students are much more often struggling with logistical issues around poverty

   * Students being responsible for a dependent at home such as another sibling or a handicapped adult
   * Students directly experiencing homelessness or abject poverty who are facing difficulties fulfilling their basic needs such as having clean clothes to wear to school, avoiding violence, fulfilling a physical addiction, being sheltered from the climate, or meeting the minimum number of sleep hours during the night to remain conscious during the day
* Fining these families won't help
   * It only increases the source of the problem which is their financial means and capacity to prioritize school
   * They literally can't get to school in a lot of cases, no matter what you threaten them with
* I'm sure you can point to anecdotal examples of families who have the capacity to get to school but their kid fucks around smoking cigarettes across the block instead of going to class. I'd say:
   * This is *not* the majority of extreme truancy.
   * If they *do* have the comfort and capacity to get to school, is a slap on the wrist fine really going to make the difference for them? They are probably already aware that their financial future is being discarded for this but they're on a self-destructive kick. You can't fine someone out of reckless self-destruction.

This is just something I've noticed and wanted to see conversation on.

\~20 years ago, in the US particularly, the Republican and conservative movements were the party of war. They believed in strong intervention in Iraq, and they would do anything to retain American global dominance. Progressives and the Democrats were diametrically opposed to that. They believed that asserting American dominance in these areas only made conflict worse and caused more suffering. Now, Republicans are the ones opposing US involvement in the war in Ukraine. Certainly, some far-right conservatives do this because they have a weird fascination with the socially conservative nationalism that Russia seems to define itself with, but from my observations, many mainline conservatives genuinely seem to be distrustful of US authority when it comes to foreign intervention. Democrats, on the other hand, and even many ""democratic socialists"" seem to be very supportive of US involvement in a similar way to how Republicans were in the early 2000s. They see support of Ukraine to be essential for retaining American influence on the rest of the world.

Another example: institutions. To find a better example for how progressives and conservatives used to differ, let's go back to the 1960s. Government institutions, according to the progressivism of the '60s, were not to be trusted. They were the ones responsible for racial discrimination on a number of levels, from limiting the rights of blacks to vote to redlining. Conservatives of the time saw government institutions as mostly good, and these flaws to be minor outliers. Compare this to progressive and conservative views on government institutions today, say, the CDC. Now, I don't have any strong feelings towards the trustworthiness of the CDC. I personally believe that they have gotten some stuff wrong and some stuff right. But that's besides the point. What I have noticed is that conservatives have tended to be much more skeptical of this government institution than progressives, a complete reversal of prior trends.

Anyway, let me know your rebuttals and stuff."

**My CMV opinion:**

* Good tasting things, when mixed, will taste good together
* i.e. Foods I enjoy, when combined, will not be unpleasant to eat

**What is NOT my CMV opinion:**

* I'm **not** saying that it will always make them *better*, or even that it will be *as good* as eating them separately. I'm merely saying that if they're good by themselves it won't be suddenly *bad* by mixing them.
* This is of course barring things that actually have a chemical reaction together (lemon juice curdling milk)  or things that alter the functioning of your taste buds (like toothpaste + OJ).

&amp;#x200B;

I've been combining random crap in my kitchen a lot more recently, and I've noticed a lot of rules we have about what can be combined is pretty arbitrary.

Burrito + Yogurt? Great

Peanut-butter sandwich with pickles in it? Totally great

Mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs and fish? Yeah, it's fine. Wouldn't have minded the fish separately

Sautéd mushrooms, onions and blueberries? It was a'ight, probably better separate, but not at all unpleasant.

Sesame sticks + tapioca pudding? Wow, fuck yeah.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I must be getting ahead of myself here, but it seems like sweet, salty, fatty, sour, crunchy, soft, they all go together if you have an open mind. Surely there's something that makes this fall apart, but I can't think of it!

My girlfriend's dad is a chef and will probably roast me if I develop this opinion, so someone needs to change it for me!

&amp;#x200B;

**My view can be changed by:**

I know this is subjective, but you can CMV by telling me two foods that are awesome independently, but garbage when mixed.  If I have access to them I will try them together, and give you a delta if I agree. Might have time to go to the grocery store tomorrow for some follow ups, but I live in a house with a lot of other people, so we stay stocked with a variety of stuff.

Also if you can name something that's this is obvious for that I just haven't thought of, I'll delta as well, I just literally can't think of anything that would be repulsive together that I like by itself!\~"

The 4 core arguments of Antinatalism/Efilism, in my opinion: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Consent of the unborn - people say consent doesnt matter if the entity doesnt exist, but how do you counter the non identity problem? There are many things that is STILL immoral even if nobody is affected at the time, such as making a child when both parents have AIDS or other terrible heritable diseases. Is it not the same immorality if parents create children when they KNOW for a fact that the risk of harm is non trivial and statistically unpreventable for some due to pure bad luck (you cant prevent bad luck)? Is taking this risk ok according to our basic moral intuition? Isnt this a contradiction for preventing known harm? Additionally, even if we live in a utopia with no risks, does this not violate the right of choice for the unborn? I mean, even when you do something good without someone's consent, they still have the right to reject it no? But with birth, they cant reject it, thus a violation of right of choice by default, no?
2. The perpetual Trolley problem - even if we were to accept that the extreme sufferers who scream in pain and prefer not to live (or be born) are the minority, is it not immoral to keep making them as unpreventable statistical fodder for the ""ok-ish"" lives of the majority? Are we morally coherent to play the trolley game by crushing the few just to maintain the ok-ish lives of the many, especially when we have a way to prevent it through antinatalism or efilism? All for one Vs one for all? Some say its justified because we are improving and could one day create a painless utopia, but we have no idea if this is even possible and even if it is, how can we justify the mountains of victims it will take to reach such a utopia? Does this vague end really justifies any means to get there? (The world could get worse too, the reverse of utopia, lol)
3. Creation of ""bad"" people - Then we have the bad people, like really bad people, people who will end up doing unspeakable act of cruelty to others and if we really have a choice, do we prefer for them to be born? Is it good for them to be evil or for their victims to suffer/die? How do we even begin to prevent bad people? They have always existed and will probably still be around far into the future. It doesnt matter if its due to nature, nurture or combination of both, the point is they will exist if we keep procreating, they are as much a victim of statistic as the people they will hurt/kill/torture.
4. Suffering of animals (wild and domestic) - Veganism aside, how do we even prevent suffering for animals, both wild and domesticated? The amount of animals that could suffer on earth is HUGE, there is no way we could help them all, unless we create some kind of biological transformation using nanotech or something, basically turning them into cyborg hybrid that cant suffer, way too sci fi to even be taken seriously. lol 

So, how do you answer/counter these 4 big core arguments for Antinatalism/Efilism?"
0,2022-11-14,CMV: There are no good arguments against vegetarianism based on morality,u/ILoveShinyRocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yuvvtw/cmv_there_are_no_good_arguments_against/,changemyview,"As I mentioned in the title, I am talking about vegetarians (who refrain from eating meat but consume eggs and milks), not vegans. 

You could argue that being a vegetarian isn't healthy for humans- but that's not an argument based on morality.
What are some of the arguments people often bring up to say that vegetarians are hypocrats?

""But if you were an abandoned island with animals and no plants to eat, you would probably eat meat.""
Okay, but what are the chances that I will be? And if you were in the same situation with an infant but no animals, after months you'd probably eat the infant. That doesn't mean in your everyday life you would be morally okay with that. That is an extreme circumstance.

""But vegetarians wouldn't eat animals that had a nice, long, healthy life in a local farm!""
No, I wouldn't, because you still slaughtered the animal. I don't care they had a healthy life, they didn't wanna be killed. 

The only argument I could think of is how the increasing demand for tofu and meat substitutes is bad for the environment and ends up killing more animals than you save. But being a vegetarian doesn't automatically mean you have to consume tofu. The avarage tofu has 10-20 g of proteins in it- you could easily eat beans or other foods rich in protein instead (the ones I have at home have 13 g in them/100 g). 

You cannot make an argument based on morality that being a vegetarian is bad."

0,2022-11-14,"CMV: Right wing conspiracy theorists, and contraversial figures (Jordan Peterson, Alex Jones, Andrew Tate) should not be banned from social media. Instead the algorithms should be rewritten to stop pushing their content.",u/Fando1234,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yuwx8t/cmv_right_wing_conspiracy_theorists_and/,changemyview,"Let me caveat by saying I'm no fan of the names I've listed in the title. Or the ideologies they stand for. For anyone who is blissfully unaware: 

Alex Jones has been deplatformed in particular for giving airtime to conspiracy theories that Sandy hook was a hoax.

Jordan Peterson has many anti-trans views and has been banned from Twitter for comments made about Elliott Page claiming his transition was a 'criminal' procedure.

Andrew Tate: is seen by domestic abuse charities as a misogynist. Preaching a life style of objectifying women, and even alluding to violence against women as being acceptable. 


But all of them have considerable followings (11.6 billion views on Tate's tik tok videos, 3.5 million subscribers to Peterson's YouTube channel). Not to mention that they are the tip of the iceberg when it comes to hate speech online. 

None of them have disappeared from public life since their deplatforming. In fact, to the contrary many have grown in fame (thanks to news coverage of their deplatforming). And the fact that they have been removed from social media platforms is seen by their supporters as further evidence of a liberal conspiracy to silence them. 

As well as throwing up difficult questions around free speech, it has proven logistically very difficult to decide who to ban and who to allow. And very few platforms are seen as having got this delicate balance right. 

Now this is where my ignorance comes in to play:

It seems to me that whilst social media companies all release press statements that they are 'cracking down' on hate speech. Putting out fires left right and centre (and occasionally missing the mark). 

They are still actively promoting this content through their algorithms.

A friend of mine recently complained his YouTube feed was full of Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro videos, despite being a hard line leftist his whole life (online and irl). Presumably because he fit the bill of 'straight white man in his mind thirties' - probably conservative. 

Similarly because I follow science channels like Veritasium, Physics Girl and Smarter Everyday. The algorithms have seen fit to push me flat earth/climate change hoax conspiracies as 'something I might be interested in'.

In fact many channels seem to promote generic, often harmful content, instead of content I actively subscribe to. 

Less emphasis needs to be put on who to ban. And arbitrating what is satire Vs hate speech. Or what political views are permissable. And more on untangling the algorithms that actively push this content out, and grow these followings.

I have no issue with Peterson and Tate having platforms (Jones is a bit different). If you are desperate to go see what Peterson is saying, proactively go and find his latest tweets/videos. But don't actively push this content up people's news feeds and recommend it to more and more new users. And then act surprised their ideas have such a wide appeal.

So my questions are:

Have I fundamentally misunderstood how these algorithms work? 

Have there been examples where deplatforming has worked? And followings have shrunk (and become less belligerent).


Final points:

I do not agree with any speech that directly promotes or incites violence. This should be removed. 

I am less interested in these particular cases (Jones, Peterson Tate). And the arguments around whether they specifically deserved their bans. Some probably did. More with the concept of banning as opposed to changes what content is promoted."

Also, pantheism and belief in reincarnation is becoming more common.   


Hinduism is taught about in UK schools (I don't know about other Western countries) and incense is popular. Murtis are being sold in the West too. ""New Age"" is becoming more popular. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lots of ""New Age"" ideas are just Hinduism under a new name. Bhagavad Gita is also being sold in mainstream bookstores, along with many books about yoga and meditation. The Colour Run brought Holi to the West and Leicester in the UK has the biggest Diwali celebrations outside of India.

Yes, in many places in the West, yoga is being practiced for non spiritual reasons, but I am happy that people get to experience this ancient wisdom. Lots of Westerners are aware of ""Om"" and that makes me very happy.

All of this without proselytising and evangelising! Shows that you don't need proselytizing/evangelism to spread your culture and beliefs.

However, my family say Hinduism is not spreading in the West, despite all the evidence I have presented. They have tried to explain why it isn’t spreading, but I don’t get it. Please explain."

2209,2022-11-14,"CMV: Most of what we call ""mental illness"" is related to abuse and neglect, not chemical imbalance",u/PugnansFidicen,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yvdpng/cmv_most_of_what_we_call_mental_illness_is/,changemyview,"Trauma researcher John Briere (a professor of psychiatry and psychology at USC) once said:

&gt;If we could somehow end child abuse and neglect, the eight hundred pages of DSM \[the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\] would be shrunk to a pamphlet in two generations.

I agree with this basic contention. In my experience, most of what people experience as mental illness is a result of something that has happened to them in the past (traumatic events like physical or emotional abuse, natural disaster, or other highly stressful situations), or something that hasn't happened to them that they needed to be physically and mentally healthy (emotional or physical neglect, which can also be considered a form of trauma).

In other words, ""mental illness"" is mostly a manifestation of a person's adaptations to trauma. Due to stressful and difficult situations of abuse or neglect, the brain naturally develops adaptations to help that person cope with the difficult situation that is (or seems to be) beyond their control. Even if they are removed from the traumatic situation later, these learned adaptations, these patterns of thinking and behavior, persist. Hyper-vigilance. Anxiety. Lethargy and depression. Hyperactivity. Dissociation/""zoning out"". And so on.

Many of these cognitive patterns and behaviors that were originally learned for a ""good"" reason (to help that person mentally protect themselves from the trauma they experienced) can later get in the way of that person living a happy and fulfilling life. We then call those mal-adaptations ""mental illness"".

I take issue with this because thinking of these adaptations (that once were good but now are counter-productive) as an ""illness"" encourages us to treat them the same way we treat physical illnesses. We look for physical/chemical explanations of the problem (imbalance of serotonin / norepinephrine / dopamine, for example) and physical/chemical solutions to the problem (psychiatric medication).

I don't deny that chemical medications can be helpful in many cases, but the core of this argument is that chemical medications are treating the symptoms, rather than the root cause, of mental illness. For a person to truly heal, addressing the root cause is necessary. In most people, this requires restoring the inner sense of safety that they were deprived of in some way through their traumatic experiences. Allowing them to safely re-process their traumatic memories and recontextualize them in the present, and understand on a deep emotional and psychological level that they are safe now, is the best way to help them heal.

I also recognize that there are some conditions labeled as mental disorders that do provably result from congenital neurological abnormalities or physical injury to the brain, but as I see it these are a small minority of all ""mental health"" cases. Most mental illnesses, in my view, fall under the broad category of ""induced maladaptations"", with their primary causes being experiential in nature (trauma) rather than chemical.

I am curious to hear other perspectives or evidence suggesting that the chemical imbalance theory of mental illness is more appropriate - either that it enhances our understanding of mental disorders and how to treat them effectively more than I am giving it credit for, or that it is otherwise more correct than the trauma-focused approach in some other aspects.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

I've become a bit overwhelmed by all the replies and response to this post.  I have learned a lot about the genetic basis for some common mental health conditions (especially ADHD and bipolar) and also about epigenetic markers for trauma, suggesting that it the picture of mental health isn't as black and white as I had pictured it. I wouldn't say my view has entirely flipped, it's but definitely become more moderate and nuanced. Thank you for a great conversation."

Now, here's kind of the thing. We need mass produced meat to ensure the survival of human population. I don't like it, but at this juncture I don't think there's a way around it. So what if we tried to move away from a growth based economy? I don't have an answer for how that would be done but I'd be shocked if nobody could figure out an alternative to keep fucking and making more idiots that look like you. 

We have the technology. We can keep sticking our dicks in and out of each other without making more people.

I want to know what specific problems they could be creating by donating to a charity)

Billionaires do not donate for selfish reasons because that would be a terrible way to spend money. There are significantly better ways they could use their money to get what they want.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""They donate to make money or avoid taxes""

If a billionaire wanted to make more money they would keep doing whatever made them a billionaire. Charities don't make people rich.

The Patagonia CEO donated $3 billion of stock. If he sold it and paid taxes it would be worth more than $1.2 billion after tax.

Show me someone that has personally made $1 billion from a charity.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""They donate to improve their reputation""

This is unfalsifiable and not a specific problem. Billionaires don't require the public to like them to implement harmful policies. People disliking Jeff Bezos has never stopped him from exploiting workers.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**What argument could change my mind?**

The following would need to be proven:

1. Billionaires receive a specific and discreet benefit when they donate to charity.
2. They use that benefit to do bad things that they could not have done if they did not have that benefit.
3. Donating is more effective than other ways to achieve that bad result"

When every word is capitalized, you know when it's no longer the title and you're in another part of the sentence.

I just want to stop seeing people write titles like Adjective of the Noun.

It's like reading Spongebob doing that cOnDeScEnDiNg MoCkInG tOnE.


EDIT: After two days of reading your arguments, I can see that most of you are arguing from tradition or aesthetics instead of utility. I was hoping maybe there was a good, practical reason for leaving certain words in a title uncapitalized. However, there is no unity in the arguments this sub is giving me. The responses I've gotten here are the kind of scattershot, post-hoc justifications I would get if I asked several different feng shui practitioners or crystal healers to explain how their technique works. You're arguing that what's familiar to you is what must be best.

I especially liked the user who made an impassioned argument that capitalization's purpose in a title is to emphasize words, and how Ernest Hemingway carefully and deliberately chose the capitalization rules for The Old Man and the Sea, to show how these two forces are separate and opposed to one another. I then pointed out that the user completely made this up: all the first edition copies of the book have the title in all-caps.

This according to a lotta people seems like a trans people only issue and that people in general don't care being misgendered, wrong named.

That is incorrect, being misgendered is a people issue, most people wouldn't care if some random person misgenders them, but if it is targeted at them, most people would be offended.

For example, men call other men with 'she/her' as an insult, or say they're too feminine as a way to demean or disrespect them. Same for women when someone calls a woman too ""mannish"" and so on.

Another example would be [Muhammad Ali being called by a name he didn't want to be referred to as.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXreetFnnzE&amp;ab_channel=TaylanYay)

I am new to the US and am very confused as to why we allow the amount of money we do for campaigning.

Reasons:

\- campaign money establishes a quid pro quo exchange that can easily skew decisions that don't serve the American people. This includes anywhere from skewing American votes based on fear to downright dirty deals. The IRS and watchdog committees spend enormous time and resources on reviewing and policing contributions.

\- campaign money takes time to spend (advertising, strategy, etc) and causes political parties to focus on campaigning instead of getting things done for the country. Campaigning doesn't stop from election to election.

\- aggressive campaign marketing dupes people into giving what savings they have, older people getting hit the hardest

\- without TV ads, for example, messaging would be less sensationalized. Also less money for parties to infiltrate with social media bots.

\- Americans would spend less time in the mind-frame of being in battle with the other side and more time and more time focussing on the current government, and local issues.

\- it is universally agreed that campaign money helps people get elected. How are we allowing money to vote? 

When I've asked for what purpose it serves, I get ""First Amendment"". But isn't this a perfect example of where the Constitution is not serving the good of the country and should be amended? If people on both sides of the isle agree that campaign spending, at least to the magnitude it is allowed, isn't serving the American people, why can't this be changed?"

In this I am mainly focusing on discriminating language, (comments, insults, casual -isms etc). Because it isn't realistic in today's society for such discrimination to happen in the law. People will not be less likely to hire you because you are 5'5 for example. I still think my point is worthy for debate because the majority of 'cancellations' from the online left happen from people saying comments that, to be honest, don't physically affect someone in any way.

In my opinion, insulting someone for their height or dick size is just as reprehensible as insulting somebody for their race. Now I am not short or have a small dick (which is what a lot leftists seem to use as a response), I just think if people are going to be so adamantly against some discrimination, it should encompass all forms of discrimination.

0,2022-11-15,CMV: (Serious TW for Discussion of Suicide) Most People Want the Severely Mentally Ill to Disappear by Any Means Necessary,u/IHaveTheGrimoire,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yw8q1q/cmv_serious_tw_for_discussion_of_suicide_most/,changemyview,"This is not Devil's Advocate. I truly believe this and would like my view to be changed. However, I expect it to be removed based on the content alone, and I understand why. I do not personally believe this, and I am not advocating for it in any way. This is just what I have noticed other people believe, and it has weighed on my mind for many years. Please don't read this if you think it may be triggering for you. 

Each time I go back to reevaluate, I come to the same conclusion: most people are so frightened and bothered by the severely mentally ill that they want them to disappear through any method including those as extreme as lobotomy or death.

I'm not talking about generalized anxiety or depression here. I'm talking about the ""scary"" mental illnesses: psychosis, severe bipolar, low-functioning ASD, BPD, NPD, etc.

Historical:

For as long as psychology has existed, it has categorized and outgrouped people who have abnormal psychology, especially those whose psychology is frightening to the average, neurotypical person which I'll refer to as NT after this. The language has evolved, and we'd like to think we have a more whole, humanizing, accurate view of the severely mentally ill now. However, this method of categorizing and classifying leads to dehumanization and denial of rights to this day, and I believe most people are content with and agree with this view.

Even farther back, people made up fairytales as to why their autistic children and those with other disabilities did not behave ""human"" enough for them: so-called ""changelings"". But since the inception of psychology, psychology has been used as an explanation for why these children and grown people don't deserve rights and don't belong in society.

For a while, there was mass-incarceration of the mentally ill in asylums where the mentally ill were badly mistreated, but society paid little mind until well after waking up to other humanitarian crises. Asylums were not largely closed until 1967. For NTs, the mentally ill were no longer bothering them, and that made asylums a moral good no matter what happened to those in there. Society's biggest problem with the asylums was how full they were getting and how much of a drain on resources they were. In the modern era, I have heard many harken back nostalgically to this time because they didn't have to deal with seeing the suffering of the mentally ill on their streets.

In the 1930s, the lobotomy was invented, so that they could mitigate overcrowding in mental institutions and the supposed drain on resources. In a sense, I understand why it was adopted so quickly, was so lauded (it won a Nobel prize), and why, in a messed up way, it worked. It didn't help anyone who was mentally ill, but it made them less of a bother which is what actually mattered to people at large.

Nazi Germany around this time adopted many of the eugenics rhetoric from their American counterparts. This included their views that the mentally ill were so detrimental to society that they should be removed from the gene pool through sterilization and ultimately, genocide. It is estimated [between 73% and 100% of people with schizophrenia were sterilized or killed in Nazi Germany during this time](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2800142/). The Nazis began with this group since they were very easy targets due to their systemic dehumanization. They didn't need as much of a propaganda machine to justify this genocide in the eyes of their people because the work of dehumanization had been done already.

Today:

Psychiatry no longer performs lobotomies or commits active forms of genocide, but is how society treats the severely mentally ill that much better and has the sentiment truly changed? I don't think so, and the more I learn the less I believe so.

On the psychiatric side, there was a big ""reveal"" earlier this year that depression is not caused by a chemical imbalance or serotonin abnormalities. Reveal is in quotes here because as soon as this study came out, many large institutions in the research side of the field claimed this has been a known fact for many years. Despite this, those on the clinical side repeatedly used this rhetoric to deny people their rights, and place them on involuntary holds to supposedly correct their chemical imbalance. Keep in mind, this is one of the more acceptable forms of mental illness to have with large numbers of sufferers and thus larger populations to derive data from. Yet, those sufferers were knowingly given misleading information so that they would be taken from their homes and no longer a bother to those around them.

Related to this, here on reddit you see many in the Psychiatry subreddit and uneducated NTs advocating for aggressive polypharmacy for those suffering with severe mental illnesses. The underlying mechanisms of these disorders and medications are even more poorly understood as those of depression. Clinicians will admit here on reddit that finding the right pharmaceuticals is just as much luck as science. Behind closed doors with patients, however, they will not admit this. They will give a standard spiel about the importance of taking the meds and maybe a note about potential side effects, but the emphasis is always on taking the meds. If the meds make the person easier for those around them to deal with, the psychiatrist will side with those people regardless of the discomfort and side effects. Blunted affect, tardive dyskinesia, extreme weight gain, loss of sexual interest, and other life-altering side-effects are so normalized that I think if we had a chemical form of lobotomy it would go unnoticed. It would be normalized and accepted regardless of the detrimental effects to the mentally ill.

On the point of mental institutionalization, this still happens to a lesser extent and with some more safeguards, but not nearly enough safeguards. There are often only a couple psychiatrists to oversee groups of 50 severely mentally ill people. Staff is often overworked and take their frustrations out on patients. Staff, even if they are well-trained which they often aren't, know that they can harm the mentally ill and no one will believe them so it occurs regularly. The focus is often to overmedicate patients to make them controllable since that's what the system incentivizes. Giving patients drugs through traumatic violent intervention and coercion (you aren't leaving until you're medicated) is normalized, common, and something I think most people agree with.

On the therapeutic side, it is not until very recently that scrutiny has come to practices like Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) therapy for forcing the neurodivergent to behave more neurotypically for what are pretty absurd reasons. ABA is largely basic Pavlovian conditioning usually used on young autistic children so their parents recognize them as less autistic despite having no bearing on the underlying autism. Many who underwent ABA are coming out as adults to note the punishment aspect, and even without the punishment aspect, they argue that the therapy encouraged masking and discouraged them from engaging in healthy coping mechanisms such as nonharmful forms of stimming.

Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) for those with BPD also implements punishment as a way to achieve the desired behavior from sufferers. These punishments include withdrawing warmth and cutting the person off from therapy for displaying signs of mental illness. Keep in mind, a part of BPD diagnosis is an extreme fear of abandonment, they have the highest suicide rate of any mental illness, and DBT is often the last resort BPD sufferers have for treatment. Many other therapists refuse to work with those diagnosed with BPD.

On the interpersonal side, many subreddits have cropped up going under names like bpdlovedones and BipolarSOs which center around active disdain for those suffering from these disorders. At least NarcissisticAbuse is aptly named and is what it says on the can. I'm not saying people who have been abused by the mentally ill shouldn't have a place to air their grievances. What I am saying is this is a pretty good insight into what people actually feel about the mentally ill. There have been somewhat of a crackdown on the most extreme posts in these subs. However, the subs center not around support, compassion, improvement, overcoming their own issues that lead them to shitty relationships, or even venting. Instead, disdain and often open hatred for their supposed loved ones is the topic. To go against this narrative results in an instant ban.

In the BPD sub, you will find classics like ""BPD can't love and don't deserve love."" ""They are mentally children."" ""Are they even human?"" and even more extreme ones such as ""She tried to kill herself, and I can't help but be miffed that she didn't"" and ""Yours actually died? Mine just faked it for attention."" These are paraphrases, but they crop up. If anything, I'm making them sound better. If this was about any other group, it would be shut down long ago as a hate sub. However, because the group is about the severely mentally ill, it is completely acceptable to most NTs. BipolarSOs is a bit milder, but still, there are overgeneralizations and advocating for the significant other to have full control of their meds and robbing them of their agency. Posts like ""Don't listen to him if he tells you they make him feel bad. Meds, meds, meds. He must be on meds. He must listen to you and you alone about his meds."", ""My only hope is that he will be committed against his will."" and ""There's no helping these people."" are common.

Dehumanization, demonization, and robbing the mentally ill of their agency is 100% fine to most people, and I don't think we've improved very much from the days where lobotomy and desire for genocide were common.

I know this is long, and I thank anyone who reads it. This is a pretty dark view of the world, so I hope you can change my mind. If you have any questions about my personal history, that's fair. I have some biases which I tried to keep out as much as I could, but I'm open to discussing them."

Which is ridiculous. Any food or beverage should be required by law to have nutritional facts. Calories, carbs, sugar all of these contribute to an unhealthy lifestyle when it’s unknown to the consumer. Hell there are people who believe alcohol like vodka has zero calories when actually it’s around 100 calories for one shot. 

Yes people may ignore these labels and drink in excess anyway but they can do that with soda and chips but it’s still required for those companies or even ignore warnings on cigarettes. There’s zero reason why we shouldn’t know what we are drinking. Yea there are beverages with nutritional label on them but when I go to buy a bottle of vodka why are they allowed to just have their branding and basically nothing else.

Having no nutritional labels can potentially lead to people living an even more unhealthy lifestyle by thinking they are drinking nothing high in calories, carbs, or sugar."

Edit #2: I can see why commenters might think I’m a working teenager. I’m not, I just think the stance is logically consistent. 

This is somewhat tangentially related to the GOP saying they want to raise the voting age.

The American Revolution was sparked by Taxation **Without** Representation. 

You can start working in America &amp; pay taxes years before you can vote (14y for working, 18 for voting). 

That’s 4 years of taxation without representation. 

People are saying in response to GOP that if the voting age were increased, that we should up the age for enlisting in the military, or up the age for ownership of firearms. I think the opposite response is in order. 

Either lower the voting age or remove all federal and state income tax for anyone under 18. You should be able to vote if you’re being taxed.

29,2022-11-15,"CMV: 'Be yourself' or 'do whatever you like' is a pretty terrible advice for one that is so overrated. In fact, the entire self-love movement is problematic.",u/MintIsSpicyCold,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ywgqvd/cmv_be_yourself_or_do_whatever_you_like_is_a/,changemyview,"**Edit: I've mentioned some of these things elsewhere in the comments but I thought I'd put it here for anyone who had just stumbled upon this post. It appears to me that most opposers on this thread have interpreted this post to be arguing against 'be yourself' as an advice in itself, which I don't blame them for, since I may have made the mistake of putting it in the title in the first place. In reality, however, I was trying to argue against the notion and/or mindset that it could result in, or upon which it is based, wherein people would regard ""staying true to themselves"" to be a priority, and with that, shun others who refuse to ""accept themselves for who they are"", instead of trying to see things more objectively and see how they could themselves be flawed, or how they could improve, both for themselves and for others. Alongside that, I argue that being one's self and taking care of one's self, if it does any good, could not be an end in itself (as it is commonly preached) and would only have any practical value for the good that one could then impose upon others through it. I think it should also be noted that I wasn't initially intending to provide a solution here, but was merely pointing out the inconsistency and ungeneralizability of this notion/mindset, such as if it were to be applied to criminals and sadists, among others.**

---

I suppose I could start from the mere fact that it’s clearly ungeneralizable. If the right thing to do is to “be one’s self” and to do “whatever one wishes to do”, then what about criminals, let alone serial killers and mass murderers? How does this apply to them and their situation? What, then, would be the point of forming laws in the first place, given that everyone has, at least to some extent, different personalities (i.e. ways of “being themselves”) and different tendencies to act (i.e. ways of doing “whatever they wish to do”)? It’s inevitable that we should, to some extent, restrict ourselves in some way, or force ourselves to do certain things that we might not like doing for the greater good of others and society.

I think a pretty apparent problem with this mindset when taken to the extreme is that it leads to ignorance. When you think so highly of yourself, it's to be expected that you would prioritize your own feelings regardless of facts and logic and/or the well-being of others, and become defensive towards any views opposing your own, instead of seeing them as an opinion to consider to arrive to an objective truth. Apart from that, it could also breed narcissism, when people would take ""staying true to themselves"" on a whole new level by spending so much time than necessary obsessing over creating a ""unique"" identity of their own and/or exploiting themselves and their lives for others to see, all of which has become increasingly common in today's internet era. Self-expression and self-discovery can be valuable, but only, I would argue, when what has been expressed or discovered could be shared and be of service to others in one way or another. If for some reason expressing/discovering yourself helps you to become a ""better person"", then it is those around you and society that ultimately benefits from it and gives it value. 

Moreover, being one’s self seems to me to be a pretty flimsy concept. What does it mean to be one’s self, exactly? Is there supposed to some kind of image or mold within each of us that we’re meant to put or shape ourselves into, and if so, how do we do so and how could we tell whether or not we’ve accomplished this? Is it not more plausible to believe that we are constantly subject to change, not just in a more holistic sense, that is, throughout our lives, but as well as on a day-to-day or situational basis? Sure, we might have certain traits, opinions and preferences, but are these not in and of themselves subject to change?

As for self-love, I understand that it has its benefits when it comes to dealing with certain mental health issues or day-to-day challenges in general, and could perhaps motivate some people to achieve certain things by first “accepting themselves”. I am also aware that some degree of self-love or self-care is necessary for survival, and is perhaps an evolutionary instinct encoded within us to accomplish just that. With that in mind, I’m not saying we must shun self-love altogether (that is probably impossible to do anyway). I would argue, however, that at its core, self-love should not (and perhaps could not) be done solely for its own sake or as an end in itself, but must also be done such that one could remain a functional member of society (e.g. taking a day off such that you could get back to work the following day feeling more refreshed, buying new clothes to make yourself appear more presentable to others, etc.). I say this because the self-love movement appears to me to be preaching the former.

I do agree that one would ultimately have to return to one's self in the end, in the sense of fulfilling one's own ""purpose"" (real or perceived). Yet this, I argue, could only be done through serving or contributing to society in one way or another, whether directly or indirectly -- and not merely by staying true to one's self (whatever that really means).

This is a view I've been holding and refining for a while now, and while it seems to me to be quite consistent at the moment, I acknowledge the possibility that it might not be perfect. As a footnote, I would just like to clarify that I understand that those who support self-love are not necessarily narcissists and are probably not intending to promote narcissism either; my point here is merely to discuss how irrational this notion is and how it could become problematic."

1. some charters heavily market their product to poor minority students, luring them (and the federal and state money allotted them) away from traditional public schools to schools where the teachers have a significantly smaller total compensation package than their public school counterparts. 

2. other charters cater to high-achieving students and lure them (and the money) from their public schools to schools where they can focus on their studies away from the bother of students who can’t achieve because they don’t live in a safe and stable home, don’t have access to technology, don’t have invested parents, don’t have food, etc. 

These students would be high achievers wherever they went to school. These charters are simply skimming off the cream of the crop and saying “see!! Look how high our test scores are!! Our way is better!!”, when in reality their teachers are generally inferior due to lower compensation. 

They simultaneously implement an array of strategies designed to prevent undesirable students from enrolling and remove those who do manage to enroll. 

Those kids can stay in the public schools or pick a different charter. Either way the traditional public schools are left with fewer students and fewer resources. And either way, poor students are getting shafted. 

Charter schools are resegregating our education system to the benefit of the privileged and detriment of those most in need of help. cmv."

My basic refusal to believe in Christianity started by simple methods of critical thinking, like ""who created God?"". Although this possibly the worst argument against an omnipotent being, it was the start of my skepticism. This post isn't more so focused on the argument of God's existence, but rather the potential of it.

God is often portrayed as an omnibenevolent being in Christianity, having personal relationships with every human being. First and foremost, we need to understand that there is suffering happening right now, for all animals (including humans). To me this points to God not being omnibenevolent, although I'll go over some potential explanations. And after that, I'll explain why I think it's more plausible that God is either evil, or not an omnipotential being (which would contradict Christianity as a whole).

""Suffering in this world happens because God gave us free will"". I find plenty of things wrong with this argument. First of all, while we might have a so called ""free will"", we cannot choose what our desires are freely. I can choose to listen to progressive metal, as my brain likes the sound of the genre. I can also choose to not listen to it and rather listen to music I dislike, which seems like it proves free will. However, the reason I listen to something else is in that case is because I desire to disprove the argument. I still won't do something without a desire behind it. And we cannot choose our desires freely. If suffering truly is a consequence of free will, how come we can't choose what we want? Are we even truly free then? To me, that either points to the evolutionary theory or that God didn't give us total free will. And by that standard, suffering shouldn't be a necessity. If we're not free anyway, why should suffering still be a consequence?

""In order for us to feel pleasure and happiness, we need suffering to compare"". This is completely true in our world today I'd say. We cannot feel safe without the knowledge of danger, and we cannot feel satisfaction without the knowledge of dissatisfaction. A world without pain is also a world without pleasures, a totally neutral world (I'd argue that would be a better world for us, but that is besides the point). To me, this argument falls flat when we describe God as an omnibenevolent being. What is stopping him from creating a reality in which suffering is not needed for us to feel pleasure? A truly omnibenevolent being would have no issue with this.

""God has a different goal, unknown to us"". This I find the most compelling argument, and hard to argue. This might very well be the case, but how can we even rationalize this? What goal could an omnibenevolent being have, which is not to create pleasure? Moreso, why would his goal include suffering as the means? Wouldn't an omnibenevolent being's goal be to minimize suffering as he loves us all equally? I don't see a way where our suffering is a necessity for any goal which is benevolent.

The last point I'll make is a reason that points to God not being omnibenevolent, or in fact evil. If the case is that the believers of God will go to Heaven, and non-believers will go to Hell, why is he hiding from most of us? I have been around Christianity my whole life, gone to sunday-school, been in COUNTLESS social events with Christianity ingrained. I've tried to pray, tried to feel his presence during ceremonies, I feel as if he won't respond to me. My whole life has been extremely tough due to emetophobia, and I don't see how that suffering is justifiable for any goal. If he is so omnibenevolent and want us to be with him in Heaven, why is he hiding? I've seen people make the claim that Hell isn't endless torture and suffering, but rather a place separate for his non-believers to not be with him. What about those that want to be with him, but can't get any response?

There are probably many flaws in my argument, so please point them out if you notice! Thanks for reading!"

Not only are people more likely to reflect that positive and friendly attitude back to you, it can help to convince others that you are worth investing time or energy into. Examples are during calls to a customer service help line, at work (both to customers as well as other employees), shopping at a grocery store, visiting a new area, asking for directions from others, meeting new people at an event, and in any encounter with someone who interacts with a negative outlook or attitude either at first or consistently. 
I have noticed that when I am friendly and pleasant in my demeanor, even if I don’t feel the best physically or mentally, other people most often return the same expression of kindness and treat me with the same respect I give them.
Working for mostly tips right now, this positive attitude is essential to getting the best results of my service even if there are mistakes made outside of my control. It’s also important when I do make a mistake, because being positive and friendly means that I do what I can to correct the situation and sometimes go further out of my way for the customer to ensure they feel taken care of.
Nobody naturally wants to be kind to someone who is being rude or mean, but being kind and positive anyways is a skill and an asset to me.
Are there any reasons or circumstances that being positive or friendly to others would be negative to yourself?
I’d love to know if there are, and why."

Marriage licenses sound exactly like the petty administrative challenges that serve only to annoy people and can be used to supress minorities like LGBTQ that the US people complain so much about.

The only benefit I see is to prove that the couple has been planning to get married for a while (and that it's not some Vegas spontaneous marriage). However, I think that something as simple as a social media post or a dated email would be enough to prove this in front of a lawyer.

Some say that marriage license facilitate lawyers checking that the marriage is legal (that both parties are of age, that none of the parties is already married). Without the institution of marriage licenses, weddings might sound like this: ""before you kiss the bride, can I see your birth certificates?"" ""omg, I forgot to bring it! I was too busy choosing the flowers!"" But I feel like marriage licenses just change one document for another. I think the conversation should be, ""before you kiss the bride, can I see your birth certificate/ drivers license? How about a post about your engagement of at least 30 days ago?""

I know literally nothing about marriage licenses so CMV

Edit 1: I should've made this more clear. I'm not opposed to a legal document that verifies your marriage. The biggest problem I have is that in some countries, you need BOTH a marriage *license* and a marriage *certificate* ([\[1\]](https://www.theknot.com/content/marriage-license-vs-certificate), [\[2\]](https://www.usbirthcertificates.com/articles/marriage-license-vs-marriage-certificate)). As far as I know, where I come from we need only one, not two documents. Why are marriage certificates not enough?

I never had any strong emotional bonding with anyone, not even with my family, maybe because I have never felt what a love is, or I am just emotionless bum.

Whenever I see people  falling in love, acting all lovey-dovey, it feels like just a game to pretend to be in love, faking co-operation between two people to make a connection in the name of love. It's just a bizzare game where you gotta give your everything and gamble-just either to win or to be shatttered in pieces.All my attempts at building relationships stayed at gear-1,never really went to something meaningful.

Yeah, you can say, OP sucks at communication, it's okay because I won't deny. I am a socially awkward person. So what? It doesn't make me attractive or shit so that anyone would come up and say - "" Hey handsome, wanna date? ""

Love is all about give and take. I am bisexual,so I have atleast dated few men and women to have enough experience to make this post.

Gay men have their own preferences , and you really gotta be good looking, otherwise just considered as a pile of shit, especially in the dating apps, where only superficial looks matters rather than emotional bonding and making connections. In gay community- it's all about hookups and sex, you gotta have sex unless your body vibes with the right person.Whereas, if you date women, you really need to be good looking ( or atleast above average), have money, look cool , gotta own a car, a house .

&amp;#x200B;

see, love is all about superficial things, or I would say it's not love, but attraction?  You get judged for what you have. If you don't meet the requirements, geeting dumped is a immediate answer, heck- looks matters more than just making connections.. Just going out with a shitty looking face gonna make everyone tug their tails behind their back and run away on dates.  If love really existed, boys and husbands wouldn't find their gf/wives cheating on them behind their back.

Yeah , you can say-"" There are so many people who are happily living together, what about them? "" .  I think everyone simply wants something, and once they get it, they move on. In a relationship- you are just there , as an extension of their reality. If anything gets compromised or one becomes at a disadvantage, it won't take long to break it apart. If love really existed, it won't happen at all. Relationships are just two people getting together in the name of marriage to have sex . If a partner gets injured physically which makes them unable to have sex, it won't take long for a divorce.

&amp;#x200B;

So ultimately love comes down to have being an euphuism for- ""I want to have sex with you"".Yea, there are people who are still living together because it's either morally wrong to leave your partner at their time of distress or they just try to get along together- with the relationship goal going nowhere.

&amp;#x200B;

It's hard to believe that I have lived quite a amount of life without any friends and lovers. Am i just a ungrateful man, being not grateful for what has been given to me? Or am I ugly from Inside?

I try to  be a good person and yeah sometimes I can honestly say - "" Often that much or not, I am a good person. "" I've thinking all day and came to realize that No one cares about you.Everyone cares about themselves and we are all on a broken record on repeat.

Feel free to take offense but that's not my goal and I am willing to discuss with anyone.

Sex exist, love doesn't.

0,2022-11-16,"CMV: A more modern, progressive version of Confucianism spread and appropriated around the world could significantly ease a lot of the social decadence, like the rise in mental health issues in youth and declining marriages/birthrates, seen throughout the developed world.",u/godlike_hikikomori,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ywzbcl/cmv_a_more_modern_progressive_version_of/,changemyview,"Due to my upbringing in Eastern culture, Confucianism was basically a way of life for me and my family. I was taught to be humble, to care for your family, to commit to family, to commit to starting and families/loving relationships, to be respectful to strangers and elders, and most importantly, to not be selfish and materialistic.

Now, I am not from Asia; but I am an Asian-American who was exposed to a lot of Western values. While I respect the notion of ""being your own person"" mindset, the problem is that this is taken too far to the extreme, especially in the US. Too many selfish people are leading to sky high divorce rates, lack of family values,too much time spent with mass media/entertainment(social media, video games, etc.) , and a popularity contest that is really penetrating outside of school and childhood. Why risk the happiness of your children just for the sake of your happiness by divorcing your spouse? Many politicians, especially Conservatives, espouse family values yet many of them have had multiple wives. Everyone is looking to put down others and ""one-up"" themselves. It's disgusting, and some sort of Confucianism should be introduced and incorporated into the fabric of Western society, in order to balance out the excesses of Western individualism. But, I understand this should be done by non-authoritarian means; because I personally prefer a socially democratic system with a moral  framework of Confucianism. Pretty much everything has to be viewed as a popularity contest, in terms of wealth, success, and fame... from childhood to adulthood, and even among romantic couples looking to start a family. I don't view the world as black and white, but I do have to admit that it can come off as sickening sometimes.

I personally believe this is a beautiful ideology that teaches people, especially young men, important values that lead to a fulfilling life for not only for the individual but also for a whole community. To be a good man, a good husband, to be a good wife, a good son, a good daughter, etc. This would be a great philosophy(you could even call it a religion almost) IF ONLY it wasn't so abused and corrupted by people in power, especially in East Asian countries. I am well aware of the social decadence that's going on in even East Asia proper(Korea, Japan, and China). Lowest birth rates in the world, and rising divorce rates. This is largely because the elders, the ones who hold the most seats in power, have neglected to catch up on updating their labor laws, with respect to more paid time off and bargaining power. Also, housing system in Korea is getting more unaffordable recently, due to rising prices from an increasingly speculatively market. The elders in power are using Confucianism to save their own asses and escape accountability. I think this goes against the core tenets of Confucianism about not being selfish and being a fatherly or motherly figure to other.

This is why I think IF ONLY Confucianism, as an ideology, can be updated to include certain democratic and progressive values, it would be near-perfect. Like, for example, although you must respect your elders due to the fact that they just simply have more experience in life, you should also be allowed to ""question them"" if veer away from virtue and selflessness themselves, or simply that they display incompetency in positions of power.

I am always open to other possible ideologies that may veer the developed world away from social decadence, or y'all could even argue against my argument itself."

Israel has, from the very beginning, offered several two-state solutions, all of which were vehemently rejected by Palestinian authorities. Neighbouring Arab countries initially invade Palestine in the 1948 war, after which Israel has taken a much more offensive position. 

We've seen a similar cycle over the years. Israel offers solutions, Palestine vehemently rejects, launches a loss offensive, and is caught by a strong counter offense. This kind of rejection followed by violence perpetuates the growth of Israeli settlement and the hostility of the IDF towards the Palestinian people. 

From a policy point of view, Israel has maintained relative consistency. They crack down hard on the people of Palestine so long as HAMAS refuses to lay their weapons down and negotiate a peace deal, as they are committed to the destruction of Israel. This policy position, especially right now, seems very clear on Israel's end. 

None of HAMAS or neighbouring middle east countries' actions rid Israel of any accountability, but I sure see HAMAS as one of the key instigators of warfare and a prime force in preventing peace negotiations. The hope for Palestinian people diminishes a lot stronger when their struggle is warped with essentially a somewhat criminal state in Gaza and an IDF crackdown in the West Bank. This can only stop if HAMAS renounces violence, considering Israel's much clearer policy positions."
0,2022-11-16,CMV: The issue with theistic/religious moral theories is that it makes all morality contingent,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yx2web/cmv_the_issue_with_theisticreligious_moral/,changemyview,"NOTE: I use “Divine Command Theory” and “Theological Voluntarism” interchangeably throughout the post. This is simply how I was thought it.

So recently, I’ve been trying to do more research into theistic understandings of morality. From what I’ve read about the issues, I’ll simply explain the obvious issue in the most simple way possible.

From the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy:

(NTV)Normative Theological voluntarism: The normative state of affairs has to obey God. Normative obligations happen because of God

From this we infer:

1) “Any X is moral/immoral if God commands X is moral/immoral”

2) “it is obligatory for a person to do X if God commands a person to do X”

The issue:

This is clearly unintuitive and ultimately contradictory stance to take. If any X can be moral according to God’s commands then even the most atrocious acts can become moral. It is a stance that makes it impossible for theists to ever debate morality with a non-theist because theists are always at a disadvantage.

A theist would have to admit that if God came down right now and commanded Ryan to torture his friend Sally for the rest of eternity, it would be moral for Ryan to do so even if Ryan could simply just ignore God’s commands and no negative repercussions to him and Sally would follow.

A common and expected objection would be:

“God commands what is good because it is good so God would not command Ryan to torture Sally”

This objection does not work however as the question being asked is NOT a WOULD GOD question it is a CAN GOD &amp; WOULD YOU question.

If God CANNOT command someone to torture another person for eternity then he is not all powerful and thus the theist must give up Omnipotence.

I’d also argue that God not having complete control over morality is a pretty big deal since this effectively paves the way too God being irrelevant towards morality.

The issue is so bad, that in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on Divine Command Theory, the author flat out gives up on Normative Divine Command Theory at the start. Although he also explains that he realizes that this is an extraordinarily serious issue:

Another expected objection:

“God is unchanging so the idea that he would change is views on morality is impossible”

At first this makes sense. After all, God is the unactualized actualizer so he has no potential for change.

This objection fails:

a) God being unchanging doesn’t change the fact that he still had the opportunity to command Ryan to torture Sally or make Ryan torturing Sally compatible with his definition of morality"
0,2022-11-16,CMV: A Nuclear Holocaust or other mass Euthanasia Event would greatly benefit the Environment and help curb Climate Change,u/Commercial_Violist,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yx37ow/cmv_a_nuclear_holocaust_or_other_mass_euthanasia/,changemyview," **TL;DR: Because of our short-sided greed, arrogance, and lust for material goods; we’ve all but condemned ourselves to a massive population shrinkage as the planet becomes less hospitable and its carrying capacity shrinks. Thus, we might as well do ourselves a favor and cull the population quickly and efficiently via a nuclear holocaust that seems imminent with Russia almost certainly starting World War III. This would spare the world of needless suffering and frankly, we deserve it for the suffering we've inflicted onto nature and especially onto ourselves.**

Russia just accidentally (or intentionally depending on your perspective) launched a missile into Poland. Which will likely and finally give our Oligarchs an excuse to activate Article 5 of the NATO Defense Pact and ship off all the young men of Europe, Canada, and the US to be slaughtered to nobly stop Putin and his “dream” of a new Soviet Union. Oh how I’m looking forward to having to fight the Kremlin as an American male in his 20s with my M4, I just can’t wait. With this direct conflict in mind, it’s almost certain that nuclear war will come into play to get the upper hand. “Just a few” they’ll say before the world is thrown into a nuclear holocaust. But then again, I’m not sure if that is that dramatically worse than our current trajectory. 

Let’s face it Climate Change is coming and there’s nothing we can do to stop it. There’s just too much momentum to overcome. Big problems require big action plans, and no one wants to implement or accept such a plan. It’d require getting too many people involved and too many people aren’t willing to make the necessary sacrifices to prevent the Climate Catastrophe until it’s too little too late which is only 6 years away. We could barely convince people to social distance and wear masks over the past 3 years. Do you seriously expect that people will just give up driving cars, consuming red meat, and fight for the mass adoption of green energy or nuclear energy as a stopgap? They'll say it's un-American. And in the case of Nuclear, they'll point to Three-Mile-Island, Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl that ""it's too dangerous"" and will never happen. It doesn't matter if reactor designs and safety protocols have improved to render a Chernobyl style melt-down impossible or if Fukushima was casued by building a nuclear reactor where it shouldn't have been. People do what feels right, not what is right. Degrowing the economy isn’t possible when everyone at the top in government and international relations is in the pocket of big business. The world will be thrown into chaos and mass suffering will occur, and all because the Oligarchy and our politicians sold us and the planet out for a quick buck and fairy tales of unlimited economic growth. 

The situation will become dire as drinking water becomes harder and harder to come by. Crop failure from previously fertile regions undergoing desertification, leading to mass starvation as food exponentially becomes more expensive. Extreme weather will become the norm as forest fires, Blizzards, Hurricanes, Tornados, Earthquakes, Volcanic Eruptions, and Tsunamis become increasingly and scaringly common. The planet’s carrying capacity will slowly but surely be chipped away as the planet becomes more and more inhospitable. Especially once the Oligarchy takes their leave and flies off to Mars to repeat the cycle of humans selfishly trashing their host planets. We’ll be forced to degrow the population (or more accurately we will join the 6th mass extinction currently going on that’s 100% our fault) since we lacked the foresight and willingness to degrow consumption and the economy since we only tunnel-vision on what will maximize profits next quarter as opposed to whether our children and grandchildren will inherit a wasteland devoid of all beauty and life. Humanity is undoubtedly the most invasive and destructive species this planet has ever seen. A cruel cancer that’s merciless to both itself and it’s surrounding environment, mercilessly taking more and more to satisfy its lust for material wealth. Humanity lacks any redeemable qualities in the eyes of any God(s) or extraterrestrials, I would not blame them if they wished to enslave humanity or otherwise eradicate us. 

Thus, to minimize our own suffering during the upcoming Climate Catastrophe era, we will need to dramatically and rapidly reduce our own numbers to prevent needless suffering from occurring as Billions of people are set to starve or die of thirst in my eyes. Or another pandemic will rip its way through society, and we may be even less prepared then if society begins falling apart. If someone knew they would die in a certain amount of time, they would want to go as quickly and painlessly as possible. Hence why I feel lethal injections or firing squads would be ideal to accomplish this. Mass infertility and/or sterilization campaigns I feel would be too slow or otherwise, would all be too easily circumvented so that people could selfishly have as many children as possible with zero regards for the environmental consequences. Not to mention the pushback, but this I feel would be much more easily accepted by the Oligarchy and politicians. It’s their dream to exterminate the poor since they despite them all as dirty leeches to society. They just love to make us masses their playthings. So they’d love the formation of death squads or just giving everyone an AK-47 to kill everyone that disagrees with them even after it comes back to them (the ultimate goal). Besides, people will accept just about anything with the correct buzzwords and marketing. Whether this is a fascist dictatorship or genocide. I bet people would accept pedophiles in charge of Washington DC with the correct marketing, the same goes for a revolution that produces a Fascist Theocracy like that of Gilead in *The Handmaid’s Tale*. You may say people are against euthanasia but then how come so many healthy dogs and cats are put down each year? It’s once again because people are selfish, they want the newest trendiest dogs and cats available. Plus their current animal is too old and slow, they’d much rather start fresh with a new puppy or kitten instead. 

An even better and more efficient method in my opinion would be to finally get rid of the world powers’ stockpiles of nuclear weapons by deploying and leveling their nukes against them. In other words, wipe the likes of the US, Europe, Canada, Australia, Japan, India, Pakistan, and China off the face of the Earth. These nations have the highest carbon dioxide emissions per capita and most actively indulge in neo-colonialism around the rest of the world. Getting rid of them would in turn eliminate the biggest polluters and harbingers of suffering for the rest of the world that has been exploited and bullied for centuries by other countries for their own selfish gains. Thus, it would be a net positive for everyone left as they would freely be able to do as they please instead of being forced to do things in certain ways because of money and/or politics. The countries nuked in this scenario 100% deserve it for the suffering they have caused. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. The power of enriched uranium and plutonium will wash them away and cleanse the world of them for good. Then and only then will world peace be secured for all of the present and future humanity. In a perfect world, we would pull a page from SEELE’s page and Third Impact ourselves, so that our physical bodies cease, and instead we’re merged into a singular collective consciousness. This way we would end suffering once and for all while ridding the planet of our intrinsically selfish and exploitative desires. The planet and universe would finally be rid of us and the human threat would be contained."
0,2022-11-16,CMV: Everyone is inherently racist,u/JustAZeph,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yx3j8b/cmv_everyone_is_inherently_racist/,changemyview,"I cannot think of an instance where racism is not based off of ignorance, fear, or hate.

Most people picture simply hate as racism, like the KKK, but walking on the other aide of the street, and making assumptions about people is also racist.

This leads me to my conclusion, we all have preconceived notions and judgments about people based off of superficial traits. When you have less experience with a different culture, it will give you biases that you can’t account for. In my mind this means everyone has some form of racist tendencies. 

This would also explain why people who say, “I don’t see color” are wrong.

A lack of experience with a culture leads to fear out of ignorance, which in my opinion is a form of racism.

This also would apply to sexism. 

Are all people inherently racist? Should we all be examining our behaviors constantly? 

CMV

EDIT: asked to define racism, “prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against a person or people on the basis of their membership in a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.”

EDIT2: zuluportero said “If it depends on the experiences you make with people then it's not inherent, is it?” Which is true. The fear is inherent, but the lack of experience is not. This form of racism would be a sort of “anti-learning”

EDIT3: Racist tendencies vs racists. I am being overly harsh with the term Racist, which ends up using all utility if you do that. Maybe a term like racist tendencies would be more fitting. - u/Polikonomist

EDIT4: copying Alien_invader44’a comment because it summarizes the largest issue of my initial view

“What your talking about is basically inherent bias. Our brains are built to form patterns, and stuff like over representation of black people in crime reporting leads to patterns where we think black people are criminals.

Stuff like that happens all the time and there isnt really anything you can do about it.

What you can do is recognise the patterns for what they are and not act on them.

Inherent bias is universal. Failing to recognise or acting on racist patterns is a better definition of actual racism than inherent bias. And that's something people can do to a greater or lesser degree.”"

I said far right, too. If there's anyone here who aligns with the far right, please give your take. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not saying far leftists and far rightists are the same thing, I am saying they are just as bad as one another. They are just as intolerant. They are just as authoritarian. They are just as radical. They are just as violent. They are different in how they carry out these things, but while their ends are different, their means are the same.

Far rightist are intolerant to those who disagree with and challenge their ideas and to anyone whom they deem ""bad guys.""

Far leftists are the same in this, the difference being in that the *targets* are different.

They are just as authoritarian. Both historically and in modern examples, communists and fascists (far leftists and far rightists) are just as authoritarian. They are *not* the same thing; they have drastically different policies. But this does not mean that they are not equal in authoritarianism. Historically, freedom suffers greatly in communist regimes and fascist regimes. Socially, like we see today, modern leftwing radicals, though different, still seek authoritarianism comparable to that of rightwing radicals.  Both love censorship, though of different things.  I am not referring to politicians--aside from a few examples there's few who are all that radical--I am referring to citizens who align with the far left or far right. Think antifa and the Proud Boys. Two groups with very different ideas.

I think it can best be exemplified in two groups that exemplify this: Antifa and the Proud Boys. Two groups with very different ideas. One far left. One far right. Both are intolerant to those who are their ""enemy,"" though who the ""enemy"" is differs. Both advocate for an authoritarian government, though the ideal government differs (one being far left and the other being far right). They are certainly just as radical, though radical for different reasons and for different ideas. And they are just as violent (though, again, violent for different causes).

I am not trying to be some ""enlightened centrist,"" that's not what I'm saying. I am *not* saying they are the same thing, I'm saying that, though different, they are just as bad as each other and should both be rejected.  Change my view!"

0,2022-11-16,CMV: it’s white peoples responsibility to educate white racists. Not poc,u/iloveturkeyyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yxh1d1/cmv_its_white_peoples_responsibility_to_educate/,changemyview,"I’m white and this post is more aimed at other white ppl for context. 

I’ve always thought this. It can be exhausting for anyone to have to try to debate with ppl who constantly call you a snowflake when they don’t have a counterpoint. But nevertheless, I think if you’re in as situation where you discover maybe a friend is racist or a grandparent or something. It’s up to us (other yt ppl) to try to educate them. I was actually racist when I was younger. Like 11- 13 ish. It wasn’t as bad as some ppl are, but I said the n word casually, didn’t believe in cultural appropriation, thought blm was racist (?? Idek). My mom and dad said the N word with the hard R with no hesitation. But eventually I went to live with other family. After a while I’d argue with poc on the internet, my black friends would educate me, and creators like Onision made me feel entitled to my racist opinions so it wasn’t exactly easy for the other ppl debating with me. I eventually started to accept what others told me and I’d say by the time I was 14 -15 I completely kicked it and I now fully support blm and reject the ideas of things like “white lives matter, police lives matter ect” I believe in police brutality now and try to listen more when poc talk about their experiences with racism.  I’m glad I had patient friends who educated me and corrected me . Even the ppl I argued with online just wanted me to see their point, they didn’t say anything I didn’t deserve. But looking back I feel very guilty that I relied on POC to educate me. Ofc poc will always be able to relate with experiences of racism more making their opinions more valid. But, I remember I watched a video a while back of a black activist saying she’s encountered more racism with ppl trying to debate with her online than with blatant racists. Sense then I’ve realized the toll it takes one poc to constantly be the people correcting racism upheld by white supremacy. Like we started this mess , it should really be up to yt ppl to educate one another given that it’s our people who have put down poc in the first place. I think poc activists and creators are crucial to achieving racial equality and should always be the top voices in these movements.  I’m white, so when someone says something racist,I know it’s wrong but it dosent offend ME. So if I know the person making these comments I think it’s better for me to be the one to correct them so hopefully a poc won’t be on the receiving end of their ignorance. Because it will actually offend poc. We may be annoyed hearing this stuff but it doesn’t hurt us in the same way it would hurt poc. My grandma used to be racist she grew up in the 1940s in segregated indiana. I’d hear a one off remark from time to time but after actually making an honest attempt at correcting her behavior and educating her she’s not like that anymore. She grew up with different values, While this doesn’t absolve her from guilt, if someone hadn’t educated her she wouldn’t have changed on her own. It’s possible to change others opinion and it’s actually been proven that defining a clear middle ground with someone and agreeing with a part  of their point makes them more willing to change there view, but I think it’s unreasonable to expect poc to do this constantly when it’s much less mentally taxing for other white people to. Obviously pick your battles. Some ppl are just a lost cause. 

This is just my opinion I’d love to hear more perspectives. Apologies for any bad grammar

Edit: I’m American and can only speak of where I live. I know racism exists else where and it’s “not alll white ppl” secondly, id like to add my overall sentiment is that silence is complicity . Poc are forced into situations that make speaking up difficult. Some could be ostracized or even hurt. Other white ppl won’t ever have to worry about this. We have a privilege and letting the ppl around us be racist is something we just shouldn’t do. I still hold that sentiment 

Edit 2: at 160 comments and 0 upvotes I think I’m done here😂 this is obviously a very unpopular opinion but I don’t think it’s been changed much. I’m done replying and I recommend you check the deltas before commenting. I’ve made my bed and I’m gonna lay in it."

Trump is a bombastic orator that creates explosive drama and talk about a wide variety of oft-unexplained or ignored sections of the political discourse. Hes not a political figure, hes a media one and knows how to work a crowd, ergo his appearances on TV are bent more towards leading people to watch or hate-watch. This is good for him as a candidate for his supporters, and just as good for his opponents.

Trump is willing to dive down in the mud to dig up stuff thats personal on his opponent that are entertaining, part of his drive, but is also more willing than anybody else in the field to bring up weaknesses his opponents have **with their own dedicated base**. During his 2016 elections, despite this being a lie, he promised to do Blue Dog manufacturing renewal work that is only required because of the Clinton machine in the 90s. This basically painted Hillary as ""Republican Lite"" for Left-Dems suppressing her vote, unfortunately for us this did not result in a left-resurgence, but a crackdown on us economic leftists by said ""Republican Lite"" wing of the party.

I approach this topic with the idea that real political change in America cannot happen without most of us at-large understanding the **infrastructure that underlies our political situation**, and I think the obstructionism of Trumps own party to pass policies that are incredibly popular with Republicans (Hearing Protection Act, Comprehensive Border Protection) **greatly highlighted this issue**. Then those same people, inflamed by the Trump election to vote Biden came to the same understanding when Bidens cabinet wrote a Student Debt relief bill that was designed to not hold up to constitutional muster (yes, I'm saying they self-sabotaged their own bill as a stunt). Now as we stand poised for yet another Biden election, the people planning to run in his stead (should he choose not to) are ALSO ""Republican Lite"" without a single progressive in the field.

My hopes for 2024 is a Democrat loss so hopefully the Democrats revise their strategy and give us Social Democrat Candidates, or at least someone who isn't a ""Swamp Creature"" as Trump would describe them. I believe the education that people will be forced to do to follow along with a Trump election will help is get there much quicker than 4-8 more years of blue tie republicans running things. Especially considering the Supreme Court is not going to change with this election."

My answer always is, ""I would love those programs, but I don't trust the USA government to run those correctly and not overreach.

In this scenario, I would say that a European government announced ""on this date, the USA government will be in charge of our government. We all quit. However, they agreed to run the programs/ policies that we have in currently in place. Good luck everyone. ""

My view is that Europeans would balk at the USA government running their universal healthcare systems, school funding, road funding,labor laws, climate change enactions ,and other things. Maybe would even want those programs ceased to be provided by the new USA ran government programs.

The view I want to be changed is that Europeans would still want to continue their government policies/programs despite the USA government's takeover in this case. (or vice versa, Americans would accept a European government running a NHS like system in the USA)

&amp;#x200B;

Edit for clarification:In this example, the USA government still has not started running European-style programs. They are just new management, since the current European governments quit.

Edit for further clarification: In this case, the USA government makes the key mistake of not listening to the local population, and therefore ignores what the citizens want.

Edit: In this case, a GOP American government official takes the new management role.

Drum-stans commonly like to point out that drums have a ""natural handle"", flats are far trickier and messier to eat, and that ""you can't get a good bite off it"".

There are two devastating counter-methods to this, both of which annihilate all three of these issues.

**First Method**

The first is the fancy method ""[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRcOY-PvOC8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRcOY-PvOC8)"" where the two bones of the flat are removed before being eaten.

In response, Drum-stans have two counters to this specific method.

**First counter,** is that it defeats the point of bone-in wings and that you're better off getting nuggies. This is utter tripe and horseshit, as a boneless flat is often more tender than any fucking chicken breast nuggie could dream of. Plus, no Drum-stan cares to explain why knawing around a piece of bone, saucing up your face like a savage, is such a necessary quality for enjoying wings.

**Second counter** is that this method dirties both of your hands, making it less attractive for scenarios such as your car. Now this, admittedly, is one of the few and rare valid counters Drum-stans have.

However, this second method not only obliterates the original three arguments but also the ""dirty hands"" counter-argument.

**Second Method**

That method is this, [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UwBRRX98EH0](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UwBRRX98EH0) where the meat is simply pushed down with one hand and sucked off the end in one big delicious bite. No second hand action is needed.

**Final Drumette argument**

Drum-stans are now secretly terrified and quaking under their skin. Therefore, they subside into aimless counters and drivel by claiming that this divine 2nd method simply makes a knock-off Drumette.

FALSE, for if you will recall the opening to this post, Flats had Drums beat in every category except for the eating process. This second method has solved all the eating problems of the Flat while retaining the advantages, thus atomizing the last advantage the Drumette possessed.

The 2nd method doesn't turn Flats into ""knock-off drumettes"". It would be more apt to say, it turns them into SUPER drumettes. Flats = Super Drumettes.

**Finale**

Lastly, drum-stans like to bring up that both methods are rendered useless if the flat isn't cooked properly. However, that is not the fault of the flat but instead, the shitty wing joint they go to.

(This post is half-joking. I hope nobody's going to get genuinely offended by ""Drum-stan"". Eat and enjoy what you want)

Our friends have fun bringing their kids, but I don’t think that it’s worth bringing them to visit Santa for a few reasons:

1. The crowd is too big and the wait is too long (though apparently you can book an appointment now…).

2. I don’t want to pay $45 for pictures that I don’t think will come out all that great.

3. My kids will have so many questions that I can’t answer about how Santa can visit the mall, since they already have tons of questions about him. 

4. Even though I know my parents took me to visit Santa, I don't particularly remember details about those visits, so I don't think that the visit matters a ton to the kids in the long term (even if they'd be really excited at that moment). 

So, I welcome you to change my view and convince me that I should forget about the wait, crowds, money, and difficult questions, and take my kids to tell Santa about their Christmas lists!"

Let's talk about the International Christian.  Everywhere the International Christian goes, war and exploitation follow. The International Christian is in a constant state of preparing for war, fighting war, or recovering from war. Every place the International Christian goes gets infected with the Christian's racism, oligarchy, 
consumerism, perversion, etc.  

The International Christian owns all the oil conglomerates, coal mines, rare earth mines, etc.  The international christian controls all the governments of Europe and the Americas.  The International Christian controls most of the world's military weapons and most of the world's resources.  

The International Christian conducted the African slave trade.  The International Christian conducted WW1 and WW2 and the cold War.  

Now you might say that certain countries aren't ""christian"".  You might say that Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia weren't christian.  But, they were ethnically Christian.  It doesn't matter if they actually practiced Christianity.  It's almost like Christianity is an infection.  Their cultures were formed by Christianity, even if they never sat in a pew on Sunday in their lives.

If we have an honest conversation about the International christian maybe we could eliminate International war, oligarchy, exploitative capitalism, etc

Edit:  lets replace international ""christian"" with international ""european"". Aren't you concerned about the power wielded by the international European?  Does the international jew have more power than the international European?

Edit 2:  Suppose a person did not want to live near members of a certain group because the group is associated with higher crime statistics.  That's a rational position to hold, even though it commits the attribution error.  

What is it about Jews that causes people to point out the things that they own?what characteristic of jewishness does Kanye, kyrie Irving, dave Chapelle, nick Cannon, candace Owens  think matters when talking about who owns what?"

My argument is simple:

The officer has a gun.  The officer is already overstepping his/her authority and is not generally going to be MORE likely to leave me be if I start resisting.

Yes, there will be specific instances where a cop has it in their head that they are going to shoot/kill me, so if I can read their mind(which I can’t) I would be better off trying to defend myself and/or just escaping.  

Outside of these specific scenarios, broadly speaking I am better off complying.  

The odds of surviving will change based on my race, but I do not believe that being a particular race will make disobeying a broadly better strategy.

EDIT:  I just want to clarify my position regarding police brutality in general.  There are plenty of circumstances where it makes sense to disobey a cop, knowing that you are likely to die doing so.

Most people who say “Just comply.” Tend to imply that if people would just comply they would see that there is no issue with our police and things are fine.  This is not my belief.  There are serious problems that need fixing.  Just complying doesn’t solve anything.   Regardless, that isnt my argument.   You, nor I, are going to be Rosa Parks. If a cop is unjustly overstepping their bounds, disobeying will USUALLY decrease your odds of survival.

Edit#2: I awarded a delta for a hilariously specific scenario that I didn’t think of.  If a cop is ordering me to confess to a murder I didn’t commit.  I would never comply here.  Maybe there’s a small chance that I could comply and the Justice system would understand that I was being coerced, but I’ve seen seen some obviously coerced confessions hold up, so there’s absolutely zero chance I’m ever complying to a ridiculous order like “confess to this murder”."
0,2022-11-17,CMV: People are a lower class by choice (in America),u/Vuiito,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yy5y3w/cmv_people_are_a_lower_class_by_choice_in_america/,changemyview,"I know this sounds bad and I honestly can't think of a better way to phrase it

Basically, I'm very lacking in knowledge regarding why the lower class tend to stay lower class. It doesn't really connect with me since I've been in a family from lower class who were able to make it up to upper middle class despite all the struggles. Here in america it seems like everyone has endless opportunities to be anything and live somewhat comfortably. Even if you're an immigrant who comes here with nothing. My aunt and uncle are immigrants, my aunt started a maid's business which makes 100K a year as the median despite having 0 education like most others who are lower class. My dad's an immigrant who makes 80k a year with no college degree.

In america I cant help but feel that its the people's fault if they don't live comfortably. In fact I have friends who make decent money and live with their parents but still do not save money or pursue something permanent. They'd rather live in the moment spending their entire paycheck on clothes or drugs and all sorts of stuff that's just temporary entertainment. They'd rather drop out of highschool or not go to college pursuing 20/hr for the rest of their lives and wonder why they can't live comfortably. This is my experience with most poor people I know, cousins, and aunts, they always have a running theme of not going to school and living in the moment/impulsive.

Even regarding college, you can go to college and get a job that pays decent money enough to live decently and comfortably. I know you can't get hired off the spot with no experience but you can volunteer, you can build experience if you just look it up even before you get your college degree. I know some people have kids at young ages etc, but its still their fault and even then they can still go to college with a baby. You even get school benefits for having a baby and going to school.

I know I'm very narrowminded right now so I just really want to see whats up, CMV?

EDIT: URBAN NOT RURAL, RURAL ARE JUST LESS FORTUNATE SO ITS NOT RLLY THEIR FAULT IMOOops I mean not less fortunate, less developed, in the sense that you can work a cider mill and have a big house, plus I don't know too much about the rural working classes  


Edit2: I realized I was being too much of a stubborn prick, I've learned a lot throughout this post so I'm extremely grateful.   
Two major things that I learned is that   
1. The economy physically couldn't support a nonexistent lower class so it's not purely the fault of the lower class, its just how the economy is structured and they are the victims of it.  
2. Just because theoretically you can work 80+ hour work weeks and risk a lifetime of debt doesnt mean you have to just to have a chance of living a comfortable life. That is not the fault of the people again, but of the system we're under.  


I also made the big mistake of harshly ridiculing those who were unfortunate, that was not my intent just a byproduct of trying to dig too deep into an issue that is not as deep as I thought. I like to thank everyone and apologize to everyone who I hurt. I will admit i'm not 100% changed in my view but the more I give it thought, the better I understand what those were trying to tell me. This post will stay up as a way for me to remind myself of what not to do and how to process other social issues as well. "

Do not reply with arguments for or against existence of free will. **This is not about if humans have free will and I won't reply to those comments.** No this is about concept of free will. First I will give two though experiments to illustrate this idea.

First imagine you find a bottled genie in a cave. You rub them vigorously until they come and they grant you wish. ""I wish people don't have free will"". Genie grants your wish and you leave the cave. How has the world around you changed? Well you go back to the cave and rub them more and they come again and grant you a second wish. ""I wish people do have free will."" Again you leave the cave. What in the world have changed? Or did you just rub genie twice without getting anything?

Second though experiment is as following. In first one you were just a person. But what if you worked in a universe factory and have practical omniscience to observe whole universes. One day your co-worker comes with two exactly identical universes and tell you that they added ""free will"" ^(tm) to one but not to the other, but they forgot which one was which. How can you tell these two universes apart?

Both these though experiments ask the same fundamental question. **What is free will and how do we detect it?** I cannot answer this question and have concluded that free will as a concept cannot exist. No other concept behaves like free will (and it's adjacent concepts of destiny and fate). For example we know that magic doesn't exist in our world but I can write a book where magic is real. I can write a book where sky is always yellow. But I cannot write a book where characters have free will (or don't have free will).

To change my view either tell what I'm missing with concept of free will and how can we detect it or write a book about it or tell other concepts that behave in similar way."

I'm not really sure whether consistently breaking speed limits is a cause or effect in adults (I'm still interested in reading others' views on that) but in order to actually change my view on this you'd need to convince me that there's no relationship between adults breaking this law and children growing to hold the view that breaking the law is generally no big deal.

Edit: to clarify my view, it is not that all respect for law is lost but that it's generally believed to be OK to break rules as long as you don't get caught and even that it's OK to get caught as long as you're willing to pay the price.

I also am not saying that the only way people develop this view is by watching adults speed... Just that it doesn't help!"

Often times I here people say they hate cats but I've never heard really any good reason to hate cats. The only one I can really understand is that they're allergic. But other than that, cats are pretty easy to maintain and take care of especially compared to dogs. Whenever someone says they hate cats they always use vague terms like, ""cats are evil"", or ""cats are just mean"". I think what people don't understand is that cats don't love unconditionally like dogs do. From my experience if you treat a cat with love and take care of it as you should cats can be the most love able creatures on the planet. With dogs however, you could literally be abusive to a dog as long as you feed it it'll still obey your command. 
That's why I think majority of people say they hate cats. Because cats aren't going to blindly follow all your commands like a dog would so therefore they aren't as programmable as dogs if that makes sense. Each cat has its own unique personality and what it likes. 
Cats also don't attack people like dogs do cats for the most part just mind their own business and don't require much attention. Cats are much more hygienic than dogs, cats don't bark all the time and disturb people, cats overall don't really bother anyone. So why do so many people claim they ""hate"" cats when cats have never done anything bad to them? I think it's just because hating on cats is the ""trendy"" and socially acceptable thing to do so many people just follow the trend."

0,2022-11-18,CMV: France and the U.S. should pay reparations to Haiti sufficient to rebuild the country,u/Kosta7785,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yyokcu/cmv_france_and_the_us_should_pay_reparations_to/,changemyview,"Haiti is one of the most impoverished countries on the earth and U.S. and France are directly responsible for it. Haiti was one of the wealthiest possessions in the Caribbean, but at a massive cost of human lives. Slaves brought to the island had extremely short life spans and were literally worked to death in short order. In 1791, the Haitian Revolution began, leading to the only successful slave revolt in the period. It caused untold destruction, mostly due to the reprisals. The slaves were officially freed by the French revolutionary government, but that was rescinded by Napoleon Bonaparte who sent an invasion force to retake the island and reenslave the peoples. While they experienced some success, mostly by trickery, it was ulimtately a failure. In spite of massive horrific acts against the population, including genocide, the expedition was a failure, leading not only to the French abandoning the island, but also to the sale of the Louisiana territory to the United States.

France finally agreed to recognize the independence of Haiti in exchange for an indemnity payment. France had no control over Haiti at the time, so you would have thought it would be a bad deal for Haiti, but in reality, without French recognition, they were crippled because no one else in the world would deal with them, fearful of their own successful slave rebellions, including the United States, Spain, and Britain, all who had supported them in the past in an attempt to weaken France. Blackmailed into paying for their own hardfought freedom, Haitian government agreed do the indemnity. This agreement crippled the state of Haiti, with the majority of their national budget going to France for the payments, insane interest, and the fees if they missed a payment. It took Haiti 122 years to pay off this ""debt"".

To make it even worse, in the early 20th century, the banks in the United States, many of which had loaned Haiti money and invested in the island, convinced the U.S. government to intervene in order to get their money. This led to the nearly 20 year occupation of Haiti by the U.S. marines in which times numerous human rights violations took place and the nation and its people were exploited for the profit of American business interests. The U.S. at one point was extracting up to 40% of the income of the island, further degrading the economy. They used forced labor and while they completed some infrastructure projects, they mostly were only used to support the business interests and extraction of wealth abroad and did little to help the residents. The U.S. also forced the dismantling of the education system which had focused on advanced education and instead replaced it with one that focused on trades and agriculture, hampering the development of the Haitian state long-term.

While these events occurred long ago, it's impossible to overstate the continued impact these actions by these two wealthy and powerful world powers had on the state of Haiti, which have been compounded by corruption and natural disasters. The U.S. sponsored local gangs to enforce their will and this has led to unstable governments in the ensuing time period. It's impossible to overstate the blame France and the U.S. deserve for what they did to the state of Haiti.

Reparations should come in the form of financial support, including from the U.S. banks that instigated and benefited from the U.S. occupation, and infrastructure projects to repair damage from earthquakes and to raise the standard of living across the country. While no one in the U.S. and France today was responsible for the policies, every single citizen of those two nations benefits from them to this day.

I'm not suggesting that they just hand the money over. There would have to be a system in place to incentivize it going to the right places. That would be the hard part. But just because it's hard doesn't mean it shouldn't be attempted or absolve France and the U.S. of culpability. "

I hope not though.

1. I have not finished Elden Ring yet. I beat Morgott and made my way to the snowy mountains. I think I was close to beating Fire Giant but I got distracted and beat Lichdragon Fortisax and haven't played since. 

2. I dislike open world games. Something about them puts me off. I've tried everything, Skyrim, Fallout, Witcher, Horizon Zero Dawn, Days Gone, Far Cry, Red Dead Redemption 1, Assassins Creed, Metal Gear Solid 5, etc. The last open world games I genuinely loved were Ghost of Tsushima and that was 100% because of its story. The side missions were plain and repetitive (with exceptions) and horse back traversal is just slow.

TLDR; Overall, the game just didn't click for me not because its hard. Its a wonderful game but I might be playing it wrong or open world games are really not thing. I love the souls games. I'd love to go forward and beat the cool bosses like Malenia and Malekith. But I can't. 

I've been a MASSIVE fan of souls games since I played Bloodborne for the first time. I've played every From Software game since then, even Demon Souls on PS3. I loved them all. My personal favourites are Bloodborne, DS1 and Sekiro. They were linear and had a clear progression path. The weapons in Bloodborne were stellar and DS1's world design superb.

But I don't get that in Elden Ring. Like with other open world games I've played, I tried to be a perfectionist. I try exploring every ? on the map, find every cave, find every spell even though I might use it, talk to every NPC. But that gets old extremely quick for me. Might just be my mentality but in most games, the side content is filler. Every cave and catacomb is similar with a few exceptions and the rewards aren't great. But there's an itch to do it when I see. I really tried hard to find them.

And that's when I stopped playing. And played Bloodborne for the 5th time. 

I've had similar issues with every open world game I mentioned above. I try to be the completionist and avoid story missions. And sometimes I keep doing them till I'm bored. That leads to me being bored of the game as a whole. It's hard to get immersed. I wandered into high level areas in Witcher, Skyrim, Fallout and stay there until I beat it even if I'm severely under levelled. And the rewards are never great. 

I'd love to give Elden Ring (and hopefully other games) another shot because I'm a souls fan. The open world puts me off. It might just be my approach to playing them. Same with Skyrim and Witcher 3 etc. How does everyone else play them? I haven't played Elden Ring in months, should I restart with a new character or just get back into it? I really don't remember where I need to go now."

It’s a young, usually white, “woke-looking” person who’s thrown food at some priceless art piece. On Reddit and other forums, comments underneath tend to lean towards scathing. “Why don’t these people actually *do* something about climate change?” “This just makes climate activists look petty and stupid.” Etc.

But actually, I can’t help but think that these protests are incredibly creative and probably effective at what they’re trying to do. A few reasons for this: 

If anyone actually thinks about it, they’ll recognize that their outrage at the protest is incredibly misplaced. They are madder that someone *didn’t even destroy* an art piece than they are about the climate emergency. The contrast between symbolic destruction and actual destruction is kind of hard to ignore. 

Additionally and most importantly, these protests have been incredibly successful at doing the thing that protests are supposed to do: generate attention. They went viral and were covered all over the world in various outlets. Yes, at least some of that coverage was critical but so what? The point of protest has never been to make everyone happy. All of the most successful protest movements throughout history faced significant backlash and the exact same flavor of criticism that these protests do.

Do I think these protests will solve climate change? No. Do I think that these protests achieved their goal of generating attention in a creative way and forced some people to think critically about their relationship to climate change? Absolutely."

My first reaction to this was, ""wow that is stupid and selfish and completely ignores the fact that the most important thing is for humanity, not Russia, to survive."" 

Then it occurred to me that this is the rationale behind M.A.D., and the United States (my country) adopts the same perspective: 'why do we need a world if the USA is not in it?' Typically not framed like that. More framed as, 'if Russia were to try to destroy us with nukes, we would trigger a global nuclear war, killing everyone.'

Sure, the rationale behind M.A.D. prevents an insane superpower from striking first. They have to think we're not bluffing.

But morally, I believe it SHOULD be a bluff. Perhaps if I were the president, I would overtly endorse M.A.D., but if that first strike were on the way, I would not launch. A world where only the USA is dead is better than a world where everyone is dead.

EDIT: my view has been changed, conditionally, by these discussions. If nuclear retaliation would not in fact make humanity go extinct, destroying a nuclear aggressor would be the right thing to do. However, if a retaliation *was* a world-ender, my view has not changed: humanity must survive, don't retaliate. Naturally, this post makes me a bad candidate for president, because MAD only works if everyone believes retaliation is likely."

It's something I've pondered from time to time throughout the years and given how far the acceptance and recognition of mental illness have come and the fact that it has nothing to do with character or will-power, people that ended their own lives shouldn't be labeled as selfish or anything of the sort.

For years and years, mental illness such as depression wasn't takes seriously, most likely because it wasn't as obvious and easily spotted as a broken leg for instance.

Cancer research has come a very long way, but depending on what kind of cancer you've got and what stage it has reached, the prognosis varies greatly. Regardless of the advancement of modern medicine, not all cancer patients will be saved.

Despite the more recent achievements of mental health research, same goes: Not all patients that are suicidal will be saved, and it's not because they had a flaw in character or didn't find the right treatment.

Just as the cancer patient who is terminally ill, the suicidal patient that has reached an advanced stage in its depression/suicidal tendency won't be able to be saved. I don't believe a lot of people would oppose to that, but given that we don't have more power over our depression (you can't just get over it or being positive) than a cancer patient has over its cancer.

I would assume that people who end their lives don't see any way out of it and often it's not like they didn't know that a thing called psychologist existed. Their actions weren't selfish towards the people they left behind. They we terminally ill, just like a cancer patient can be and their suicide shouldn't be frowned upon, there should only be grief."

The issue I see is that more often than not, people with low socioeconomic status are contributing less to the society. They may be homeless, unemployed or otherwise problematic people with issues. It is known that poverty correlates with crime as poor people have less to lose and much more to gain and, therefore willing to take more risks. This creates ghettos where the scum live because it's cheap and everyone else avoids because it's dangerous.

I propose that we correlate the punishment according to the victims status. If a homeless person punches an upper claas while trying to rob, a punishment could be long prison sentence. Reverse the roles, and an upper class would only get fined for punching the homeless person. Upper class people likely have better things to do than punching homeless people and have little reason to rob anybody.

If gun ownership is allowed, I would only allow it to people who have something to defend; Business owners or homeowners. For everybody else, getting a gun should be much more difficult.

The second is about the right to bodily and executive autonomy. It's about the right to reconcile your vision of yourself with your reality. It wants protections so that the only person who can determine your identity is yourself. It needs for society to accept that you are the sole judge of what you can do with your body and how you live your life.

This of course doesn't mean that there isn't overlap between the groups, but people are more than just one thing.

While both fights for rights are equally important I think that bundling them together muddies the waters and makes it harder to address the very real issues these communities face."

Which got me thinking. Maybe women have such issues with skincare because they're required to plaster their faces with cosmetics, remove hair far more than men do, and generally put various things on themselves in order to meet some societal standard.

Which got me thinking even further. The skincare industry exists to fix problems it has caused.

Cosmetics companies advertise unrealistically beauty standards&gt;women are compelled to wear make up to meet these standards&gt;they develop skin issues because of this make up&gt;they feel worse about their skin&gt;wear make-up to compensate.

Obviously this is ignoring the people who do generally have issues with their skin, like dryness, eczema, acne etc. who probably need to take care of their skin more anyway.

The strength and capability of NATO, EU and US power is a greater deterrent than the nuclear weapons in the US arsenal, so from a position of strength abandoning the nuclear weapons as a show of leadership. We could signal to our allies to keep a stockpile as a deterrent against common adversaries and to disarm when or if our adversaries also disarm.

_EDIT: it boggles my mind and frankly saddens me that people need this clarified, but I think it needs clarifying... I am NOT in favor of rape (strongly opposed to it, in fact). I do not think anyone should force anyone to do any sort of sexual acts that they do not consent to. Ever. I do not think you should manipulate people to get sex out of them when they'd otherwise refuse. I should let my partner have sex with me, but I don't have to let them. We always have the right to refuse. You don't have the right to anyone else's body._

I posted something similar some weeks ago but due to circumstance I wasn't able to continue it and the post was locked. I'm trying again. Also, before passionate redditors make assumptions and fling accusations - I am in a happy and sexually fulfilling marriage (we basically don't deny each other unless we need a sick day). I argue these points philosophically, and taking as a given that there is no abuse. If someone is in an abusive relationship, this view doesn't apply to them.

Nobody is ever required to offer up their own body. But if person A and person B are in a monogamous relationship, then when person A wants sex and person B refuses - A is denied access to *all* other human's bodies, not merely denied access to person B's body. If I'm not in the mood but am physically and mentally fine/healthy, I should let my partner have sex with me. If I refuse to let my partner have sex with me, I should allow my partner to have sex with someone else. Otherwise you basically have ultimate power over your partner's sexual pleasure (excepting masturbation).

Now I already know that people (*probably young people*) will say stuff that amounts to ""but if your relationship is perfect, and you figured everything out in advance, and everyone in the relationship lives up to their end of the bargain, then monogamy is okay!"" Sure maybe, but what percentage of relationships are in such a state? I don't have numbers, but I'd bet 100:1 odds that it's less than half of all relationships, and probably closer to 0% than it is to 50%."
16,2022-11-19,CMV: Many on the left focus too much on white privilege,u/Kasunex,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yzffib/cmv_many_on_the_left_focus_too_much_on_white/,changemyview,"I believe that white privilege does exist, at least to a degree. Some amount of ardent white supremacists still exist, and a larger number of people who hold discriminatory views without being hostile also exist. This is a problem, and I support efforts to address this problem as we can.  

However, a growing trend since the 2010's has been to place white privilege as one of, if not the, biggest problems in society. Scarcely can leftists even mention another issue without making it about race, too. It's not enough to say ""10,000 people are homeless in x city"", they've also got to say ""a disproportionate number are black"". Does that really change anything? Is it not enough for some people that they're homeless? Why does their race factor at all? You see this on issue, after issue, after issue. If it's not made about race, it's as if some people don't care. 

I'm a leftist. I live in a deep blue state. I've voted Democrat or further in every election I've ever voted in. I want to feel less agitated about this topic. But I do, and for a number of reasons. 

1) Class is more important than race. In just about any scenario, a rich black man lives a better life than an impoverished white man. Given this alone, poverty should be considered the most important issue with regards to privilege and power, and yet race so often seems to distract from this. Talking about white privilege as such a central issue implies racism is a bigger problem than poverty. 

2) It misses the trees for the forest. Any generalized statement like ""white people are privileged"" is going to have a million caveats to it. You can say, for example, black people are disproportionately killed by police, and this is a fact. Some go the extra step and say that whites don't know what it's like to fear police. Sad to say, it's also a fact that police kill thousands of white people every year. This fact is, for some reason, very rarely ever mentioned in discussions of police brutality. Plus, on an even more basic level, there's just people who are exceptions to any rule. Assumptions, in that way, are kind of inherently toxic when taken uncritically. 

3) It's counterproductive. Focusing on race is inherently divisive. It reinforces that race is something that matters, which moves us further away from the goal of a colorblind society. Some reply to this by saying we're just not ready for a colorblind society. To that I say, how exactly will a colorblind society ever come about on the path we're headed? At what point do we get to say enough is enough? The historical realities of discrimination will never truly go away, and focusing on race only strengthens it. 

My biases: I'm white, I grew up in a low income family in a racially diverse minority-majority community in a blue state, I'm Irish by ethnicity, my dad would probably go further on all this than what I've said here. 

Alright, tldr, basically I think white privilege is real but it's secondary to class and toxic to focus on so much besides. 

If you want a delta, be respectful and try to build off what I've written here.

Today Qatar decided to ban the sale of alcohol in stadiums 2 days before the world cup starts. I wouldn’t care if this was Qatar banning alcohol in their local league but this is the WORLD cup. 

The whole point is to bring the world together to watch football and have a good time. And yes in many cultures that includes drinking beer. World cups have been hosted all round globe from Korea to South Africa to the Americas to Europe  and the sale of beer has always been allowed. I know in brazil they had to change the law but at least brazil was accommodating of other cultures in order to do so. 

They finally decide to host a world cup in the muslim world and of course it all goes hey wire. Slavery is used to build stadiums and gay rights are thrown out the window. Catholic countries like Mexico or Brazil had no problem with gays at the world cup. Neither did Protestant countries like USA or Germany. But you bring in the muslim country and it is the end of the world. And no country before had slave labor being used to build stadiums bc any modern religion realizes slavery is bad. But not islam of course. 

I can’t help to feel Islamophobic saying this and mind you I don’t think every muslim country would act like this. But I do think it sorta cements the incompatibility of islamic ideals with the modern world.

Now I'm not completely endorsing slut shaming here but it makes sense why men and women are held to different standards when it comes to sex.
First of all females get pregnant, are more susceptible to stds, more likely to be kidnapped and overall bear far more risks from sex from multiple different partners than men. Second of all it's WAAAAY easier for women to have multiple sexual partners than a man. As long as she's not completely hideous looking any woman can go to any bar or club, walk up to a guy and just ask for it and it's very likely she's getting laid. If a man wants sex he actually has to earn it. He likely has to initiate the conversation, take her out on a nice date, have great social skills and be ambitious, be very financially successful and so on. For men it takes skill and game to get a lot of girls which is why it's praised when men bang a lot of chicks. The way the sexual market works is that men pursue and women pick and choose who gets sex that's just how it is."

Geopolitically speaking, cross border diplomacy with Canada seems like it should be a priority for Northern States in general. The New England states, for instance, have an annual conference with the premiers of East Canada, and I think that NY as a state would be greatly benefitted by improved relations between our state and Canada.

I think we should prioritize our relationship with them at least as much, if not more, than our relationships with other states. It takes me a few hours to get to Ottawa, but a few days to get to California. Why should I prioritize distant regions over my immediate neighbors, nationality aside?  I think any investment in Ontario would benefit me more than an investment in Hawaii, and think that our state government needs to pursue that idea aggressively.

Edit 1: People seem to misunderstand. I don't think that we need to cut off all relationships whatsoever with other states. I think that relatively speaking, we need to care about nearby provinces just as much, if not more so, than states. Perhaps this would incur stateside funding cuts, maybe not, but in any case I want our relationship with Canada to be a pillar of state politics, rather than being eternally secondary to our interstate relationships.

Edit 2: Thought of another point I wanted to add. Upstate New York would see a lot of economic benefits from this, as they would be the connection between Canada and NYC. It would revitalize Upstate in a way that our current arrangements with the Southern and Western US simply couldn't, so it makes sense to support them as someone from Upstate"

**This post is branching out more to a philosophical way of understanding instead of putting out statistics why said issue is good/bad.** 

Society is slowly regressing. Too many ideas. Way too much virtue signalling. People refusing to see the gray area regarding issues. People labelling others into extreme groups if they disagree or question anything (eg. person is skeptical of the covid-19 vaccine, immediately gets called an anti-vaxxer) Way too many ‘rules and regulations’ about living life. 

Whilst the general image is shown that people are trying to be more accepting of people and ideas, we’re not. That’s the image we portray, and the media portrays. As a whole species, we don’t give a fuck about others. It’s always been a 1 person for themselves mentality. 

With an increasing population, there’s gonna be more issues, more resentment, more hatred, more negativity. It’s not like we see much positivity in the world anyway, news and the media certainly do not show that. 

With Earth finally surpassing 8 billion people, I just think life is gonna get even harder and worse, with society slowly regressing despite the image the media shows us. 

If we come to the physical aspect of things, it’s also gonna cause more global warming, more pollution, more hungry people, famine, unnecessary death."

Freedom of speech is paradoxical/contradiction/etc. Given that speech can be conflicting, freedom of speech cannot exist.

Example: If a protest forms, and a counter-protest comes with a super expensive speaker to drown out the protest to where the protestors *physically* are not able to communicate due to the sound waves, a government/power cannot resolve this without limiting one of the group's freedom of speech.

If you silence the counter-protestors, you're preventing them from communicating their message in the way they choose, and if you allow that behavior, the protestors will be silenced.

158,2022-11-19,CMV: The best case scenario for the GOP is for Trump to die of natural causes as soon as possible.,u/ChipChimney,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yzo6lf/cmv_the_best_case_scenario_for_the_gop_is_for/,changemyview,"Let’s take a look at the options the remain in life for former US President Donald Trump. 

1. He could win the Republican Primary
2. He could lose the Republican Primary
3. He could be arrested and imprisoned for any of the cases he currently has pending in jurisdictions both state and federal. 
4. He could fade into obscurity (his recent filing fir running for president pretty much destroyed this option)
5. He could die. 

The crux of my argument is that the first 3 options are all worse for the GOP then the 5th option, with the 4th being dismissed by Trump’s recent announcement of running in 2024. 

In option 1, he would most likely lose the general election. This midterm election seemed to be a rebuke to all candidates supported by Trump, and his election denial did not play well either. A loss in the general, and a drag on the ticket, the GOP could lose the House as well. This is obviously not in the GOP’s best interests. 

Not only does he probably lose the general election, but he would permanently muddy any rising star politician (Desantis) in the primaries should they choose to run against him. Trump doesn’t hold punches in primaries, we’ve seen this. 

In option 2, there is plenty to say here, but almost none of it good for the GOP. Trump has quiet a few plays should he lose the primary. He could support the winning candidate. This might actually be the only outcome the doesn’t really hurt them as a party. But come on. We all know Trump. He detests losing. Can anyone really see him bending the knee and stumping for someone who beat him? So that leaves other options for Trump.

He could run as a 3rd party candidate. This is of course the worst case scenario for the GOP as they can expect a minimum of 15% (I would say really closer to 30%) of their base to vote for the “MAGA” party or whatever. This would ensure a democrat win in the general (with unknown effects on the House and Senate). It could fracture an ancient (in American terms) party. 

He could just stay back and do nothing/talk shit about both nominees, potentially lowering GOP turnout, and again, losing them the election. 

Option 3 is unlikely, seeing as it hasn’t happened yet and now he is a presidential candidate. But if it did happen, it would be huge. And I’d love to see one of you redditors spin it as good for the Republicans, because I can’t see how it would be. Maybe you could say they would be very angry, which would drive turnout. But turnout to who? And aren’t they already really angry? 

This leaves option 5. Trump dies (of natural causes; I cannot predict what would happen if he were assassinated). This would allow the GOP to move on from Trump without losing his base. The next guy can come in and say “Yeah Trump was great, a true legend, and I’m here to pick up where he left off.” But they couldn’t do this unless he dies."

You could say this about any silencing of freedom of speech. “Well you have a right to speak out in Russia against the invasion of Ukraine, but you aren’t free from the consequences of ending up in jail for 5 years for speaking it.” 


Freedom of speech DOES equal freedom from consequences. I could march on D.C. mall, protesting and the president to choose to kill himself and for the capital and white house to be nuked if I wanted to, and as long as I go through the proper channels and get the proper permits and don’t DO anything illegal, I don’t have to worry about any consequences from the government for speaking it.

Edit: So everyone has been pretty much saying the same thing. I will try and give deltas to some of you guys as it did clear up the confusion, I will argue that it is a very vague argument and would be better if it was more defined. Such as if it were to say your freedom of speech does not mean others can’t use their right to free speech against you."

The Oasis has been online for 20 years now, and apparently nothing has improved.  I suppose calling it ""The Opium"" might've been too on-the-nose, but for the masses that's all it acts as--something to keep them too doped up and distracted to rebel against their terrible living standards.

People live perched atop _precarious mountains of garbage,_ or _tent-cities in dilapidated buildings,_ with smog so thick they can't see the sky, fueling their fun with _discarded car batteries_ in horizon-spanning scrapyards like junkies lighting crack pipes off trash fires.  The rest are corporate pod-people debt slaves, literally _locked into their workstations,_ whose only job is to be disposable cogs in an enormous machine that fuels this **capitalist hellscape nightmare world.**  At no point does anyone so much as mention taking action to fight this real world system or improve their living standards.

These people ought to be taking to the streets and **throwing those car batteries at their local politicians and corporate overlords** for daring to make them live like that.  The only reason they don't demand better seems to be that they have a distraction that occupies all of their waking time and energy.  They're satiated because they're addicts getting a high.  The ""rebellion"" only moves, _VIRTUALLY,_ when the _virtual_ world is threatened to become something they don't like, not motivated by the demand for any real world change.

How Halliday is presented as some heroic savior is beyond me.  It's like rooting for the machines in the Matrix, praying that they make your virtual experience better than _other_ machines are trying to make it.  Were it not for Halliday, people would be rightly bombing government buildings and getting the real change they deserve.

You can CMV by answering ""Why aren't these people violently rebelling?"" with some issue more pressing than ""They decided to take the blue pill and live in a comfortable distraction.""

To change my view, commentators here must convince my the situation with Qatar is different.

In other words, convince me that all this controversy won't simply be forgotten a couple months from now."

This has tragically lead to ""death by overwork"" being a consistent societal issue, along with their work culture partially resulting in their low birth rate.

I'm bothered by the way I feel they are constantly conflated, and I dislike the idea that evil is about a greater level of badness.

Evil is rooted in ideological axioms. Evil a trait a person possesses. It is not an action. Actions can be bad because of or independent of relation to an evil person.  I believe that some bad things can be worse than some evil things.

I would posit that the definition of evil is ""an belief that causes harm"" where I would say bad is ""an action that harms"".

I'll list of some examples of both concepts in my view.

Random examples of Evil:

-The belief that humans should not be permitted to be taller than 6ft.

-The view that encouraging all children to participate in butchering animals is the best way for society to be 
prosperous. 

-The feeling that it is profane for some people to be healthier than others.


Random examples of Bad acts:


-Stealing


-Murder


-Rape

Here is a key thing to note about my view that I feel many will find contentious. Someone murdering another person because murder makes them feel good is not evil. Its very very bad, but has nothing to do with evil. A tangential example of evil would be a belief that enables such a person to justify them killing one type of person. A belief that causes harm. It would be possible that a person had no evil beliefs, but regularly engaged in murder, rape, and cannibalism. Conversely, it would also be possible that someone be evil without ever engaging in a single harmful action. 

I think there is value in holding these concepts separate, and I'm bothered when someone assumes someone who does something very bad is evil when they know nothing of their beliefs. I'm even more bothered when someone asserts that someone claiming evil beliefs is not evil because they haven't engaged in any harmful actions. I feel that discourse surrounding evil people and bad people is almost always a mess because most people mix these concepts up. I think society is worse off for not being able to have logical conversations regarding these. I hold plenty of more views surrounding this one, but I'm not here today to discuss those. I'm here to hear a counterargument to my view and want to see if people can provide a good reason that these concepts should not be distinct from one another.

Edit: Thanks for discussing this with me. I consider this matter closed at least from my perspective as my view has been sufficiently changed. I will be unlikely to continue responding."

The opening ceremony and opening game will take place in the Khalifa International Stadium, just by the world's tallest building in the Burj Khalifa.

Qatar is another massively rich Gulf state that's expanded upwards and outwards within a relatively short period of time. But the foundation of its growth, and its World Cup related infrastructure is tied to slave labour.

Migrant labour laws in the state are heavily skewed towards the employer, who has final say over whether a migrant can formerly quit and leave his or her job, with them easily being able to cancel their work visa without notice. I can go on, but let's just say that the presence of slave labour across the country is large. 

In fact, according to a [Guardian investigation](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/feb/23/revealed-migrant-worker-deaths-qatar-fifa-world-cup-2022), **6500** migrant workers from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka died between 2010 and 2020 during construction of World Cup venues in Qatar. 

In many instances, unjust exploitation of migrant or undocumented labour is a form of slavery in my eyes. 

Just like how demand was strong for chattel slavery across the world in the aftermath of the discovery of the New World, and later on, throughout the industrial age, and slaves had very few rights and protections identified and enforced by the law, as is the case for migrant labour and undocumented labour in different parts of the world.

Depending on the country (especially those in the Gulf Region), migrants operate in a labour market that's heavily skewed towards employers as a result of local laws and customs. Or, in the case of undocumented labour, they tend to have no rights at all. In both cases, this leaves workers open to unfair exploitation and wrongdoing from others. Life and work for these folks is not the same as everyone else, they operate with limited rights, and are treated as second class ci (wait)....

My solution to this is a world with open borders, where people can formally migrate, work and live anywhere they like, as a registered worker. Granted, this still doesn't address the issue of exploited, legally employed migrant labour, but it goes some way to putting a dent in the issue of global slavery. Just like how the role and title of slave generally doesn't exist anymore, nor should it be made possible for undocumented workers to exist."

I generally watch foreign movies and shows dubbed.  One thing I don't understand is why the shows almost always use the character names in the native language vs an ""equivalent"" name in the dubbed language.  Using the native name adds nothing to the show since the actual name of a person is almost never relevant to the plot, e.g. some being named Otto or Oliver doesn't change the story.  Also it makes the show more difficult to follow at times since the names are unfamiliar to the audience, sometimes not immediately clear if it's a male or female name, and can be hard to recognize as a name.  

For instance the show Dark I think is more confusing than it needs or wants to be to a non German audience because all the names are German in the dub.  So people have to catalog a new name in their mind along with all else that is going on I the show. The show would lose nothing it the names were changed to English names (for example).  I also think this issue is greatly magnified for English speakers in Asian shows as the names are even less familiar to the audience."

I am also against nationalism and think a one-world earth state like you see in Sci-fi stories would be a good thing. For me an utopia would be something like Star Trek TNG, but with the removal of the Prime Directive and adding a ""reverse"" prime directive, where we force people to accept lgbt rights, feminism and science and help them gain a post scarcity economy, then we leave them alone and search for the next planet/culture.

However, I am against cultural and moral relativism and want the harsher and punitive punishments of conservative ideologies. 

This leaves me in a very difficult position, or perhaps impossible, as I am arguing in this CMV. Due to the LGBT rights and women's rights and socialist economics there is no point in being a conservative. Due to relativism there is no point in being neoliberal/socialist.

I can't think of ANY ideology that fits this.

So, yeah. I think there is no choice for me, and I should not try to join a political party at all, although I really want to improve certain things (physical punishment for sexual crimes, more lgbt and women's rights).

I really want my CMV changed on this, as I desperately want to make the world better with the goals said above, but still refuse unless the party i join is not relativist."
11,2022-11-20,CMV: The US should lift the naval Blockade on Cuba,u/B34RD15,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/z09aar/cmv_the_us_should_lift_the_naval_blockade_on_cuba/,changemyview,"For over six decades, The US has been strangling Cuba with an embargo. There were a few lifted restrictions under the Obama administration, but then the Trump administration reimplemented them and the Biden administration is refusing to lift them without forcing western imperialist ideologies on the country.


I'll address the main 3 arguments I've seen for advocacy of maintaining the embargo and why these don't change my view.

1. ""The Blockade was a reasonable reaction to the Cuban Missle Crisis""

While out of context, I would agree a nation has a right to defend itself from neighboring threats. In context, it is hypocritical for the US Government to use this justification. The Cuban Missle Crisis was a reactionary move. What was it reacting to? The failed Bay of Pigs invasion.

For those who aren't aware, The invasion was coordinated by the US government using cuban exiles and US Airforce soldiers. They invaded Cuba and caused upwards of 2000 casualties on Cuba's side.

To put that into further context, Pearl Harbor suffered about 2.5k casualties and that ultimately resulted in the US dropping nuclear weaponry on innocent Japanese citizens. Cuba was just trying to defend itself from a neighboring threat that actually attacked.

2. America is trying to help Cubans gain freedom!

I've seen tons of western media outlets try to portray the communist regime in Cuba as oppressive. That tons of Cubans are fleeing the island or stuck there just wishing for some American democracy. 

This is so far out of touch with reality it's ridiculous. A majority of the cuban citizens support its current communist regime. They even voted to amend their constitution in 2019 and had overwhelming popular vote support to maintain the current communist economy.

In 2021, there were ""anti government protests"" covered by tons of western media outlets. They said tens of thousands of Cubans were taking to the streets protesting the government, but this is wildly inaccurate.

I'm not saying there aren't Cubans who are advocating for capitalism to be introduced to and embraced by Cuba, but they are a very, and I mean very, small vocal opposition. Similar to how the US probably won't adopt a socialist regime because the overwhelming majority of US elected officials support Capitalism. Even the protests that occurred in Little Havana in Florida only had a few hundred supporters show up, and a similar amount in Cuba back in July 2021. Compare this to the literal hundreds of thousands of Cuban citizens who took the the streets following this to show support for their government. 

Western Media has been pushing a false narrative of an oppressive regime every chance it gets. From ""interviews"" with nameless and faceless people, to straight up [lying](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/440877-delegation-for-7-13-21-cuba-liberty-defunding-police-statue-en-route-natural-beauty/) about photos showing support for the cuban government and claiming its anti government protests. If you reverse image search the miscaptioned photo provided by [AP](https://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/CORRECTION-Cuba-Protest/6ba8cad5cfca42309c0be195d9d96fab/329/0) (Which AP admitted to misidentifying and correcting, albeit after media went crazy with it during the protests) on that link, you will find a multitude of Western Media outlets from Fox, to CNN, to MSNBC, and beyond, all spouting the exact same false caption on the photo.

3. Communism/Socialism is bad!

Look, I won't try to change your mind on that. I already know, especially in America, talks of socialism and communism is met with disgust by many countries.

You don't have to love communism or socialism, but you also don't have to actively seek it out and destroy it. If you truly want what's best for the cuban citizens, lift the stranglehold and let them live the way they want to.

If you just think communism/socialism is doomed to fail? Then lift the Blockade and let it fail!


In order to CMV, you must either provide a point that counters the 3 arguments here, or provide an entirely different argument that I agree with. Please feel free to ask any clarifying questions and I'll be very happy to answer them. Again, I am not here to advocate for Socialism or Communism in America, I simply just want my home country to be free to decide their path."

Secondly, there is no reason to pander to ""Russians"" living in Ukraine. If they want to be Russian so badly they can go home. The only reason there are so many ""Russians"" in Ukraine is because of Russias centuries long ethnic cleansing.

As things are now, an ass tap and holding someone down while humping them, kissing their neck, jerking them off, and whispering in their ear are both sexual assault, even though one is way worst than the other ( not to say they aren’t both bad). I believe this causes the word to be interpreted in very different ways when it is used, and it is often used to equivocate what is happening to push one’s agenda. 

And when I say this, I don’t just mean people making low scale sexual assault a bigger deal than it actually is. I am also referring to some hearing “sexual assault” and not taking it seriously enough before hearing more, as they assume it’s the lighter forms, due to it being used so broadly. Ultimately the only way to know the difference between a random kiss on the cheek and something much worst is for the victim to explain their trauma. I believe creating a new word for low scale sexual assault , and using “sexual assault” for high scale sexual assault ( or vice versa) would fix some of this confusion. It would make it easier to describe what happened and talk about sexual violence in a more clear and honest manner ( with less down playing, or over exaggerating). I would also be fine with keeping sexual assault as a blanket term and making two new words for low and high scale sexual assault, but this might over complicate things."

If you don’t want to read all that here’s the short version of it: In the 90s Pepsi ran a marketing campaign where you would get “Pepsi Points” by buying Pepsi products and you could exchange those points for things such as T-shirts, jackets, sunglasses, backpacks and so on. Pretty standard stuff.

The difference is that the TV ad for this campaign ended with a fighter jet landing and a very unambiguous message that you could exchange 7 million points for the jet, the other, more normal things all cost a few hundred to a couple thousand points, so the jet was by a huge margin the most expensive thing.

The kicker is that the campaign also sold points directly for 10 cents each, so instead of spending however many millions on Pepsi cans you could just pay 700,000 USD for the necessary points to get the jet.

In the end a judge ruled that it wasn’t reasonable to believe that you could actually get a jet from a soda company’s marketing campaign, so the guy who actually got the money together to buy the necessary points didn’t get his jet after all.

I think it’s a gross miscarriage of justice, a jury should have decided wether or not it was “reasonable” or “believable” to expect Pepsi to make good on their unambiguous claims. But both my sister and father (who are lawyers) agree with the ending of the case and say Pepsi should not have been made to give the guy a jet, and since these are two people whom I deeply respect I’m wondering if I’m the one who’s thinking about this in the wrong way or if more people agree with me that it was a classic case of false advertising."

Besides the assumption about rehabilitation being impossible (which is another can of worms) I fundamentally disagree with the notion that we shouldn't treat people humanely just because we can't rehabilitate them.

I assume the people who post those comments think of it as something like a barrel with two types of fruit, ""punishment"" and ""rehabilitatiom"".

So all the humane treatment, decent facilities, good food, psychological services, hobby and work programs etc are in the ""rehabilitation"" fruit type. The theory is that when rehabilitation is off the table, all that goes away and there's only the ""punishment"" fruit left in the barrel.

That's the notion I disagree with and I think it has no place in modern civilized society.

The *desire* for retribution is valid and a vital part of human nature. It's natural for the harmed to wish harm upon the harmer.

What we definitely should **not** do is take that and *actually make it a reality*. 

The best example for an ""ideal"" prison system would be Norway's. Being in prison *is the punishment*. Anything more degrading or punishing on the prisoner is regressive of modern society in general."

Anybody that looks at the spending habits of many lottery winners will understand this.

Saving money is a choice. People always complain that money begets money and this is true, but it's true for anyone that's willing to invest. It definitely will not happen overnight, but in time it will happen. Donate plasma. Take the money from that and buy vanguard ETFs. In ten years you will be wealthy. Investing is more than possible for the average person and investing is the cornerstone to building wealth.

Im sure it seems like I'm being harsh here, but I'm just trying to tell my point of view. Im sure many people will disagree, it will be interesting to see what everyone has to say.

&gt;There was also an inscription over him, ""This is the King of the Jews.""

This should be punctuated thus:

&gt;There was also an inscription over him; ""This is the King of the Jews.""

*Chicago Manual of Style* and other style guides say that only a comma or colon can be used before quotes, but the guides don't provide a good reason. Using a semi-colon in such a situation is more consistent with other rules of punctuation. Which are:

**Comma usage**

* For setting off parenthetical material
* After an introductory clause.
* Before a conjunction that joins two independent clauses.
* Between 2 adjectives.
* To indicate a pause.
* To separate items in a list.
* Commas should only be used to join independent clauses if there is also a conjunction.

**Semicolon usage**

* To join independent clauses when there is no conjunction.
* To separate items in a list when commas would be confusing.

**Colon usage**

* To introduce a list
* In place of a semi-colon when the second phrase is an amplification of the first.
* To introduce a formal statement.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There was also an inscription over him; ""This is the King of the Jews.""

Should have a semicolon because the two clauses are independent. They are both complete sentences. Using a comma results in a comma splice, which is verboten.

But the two phrases are closely connected, so a period isn't right.

Nor is a colon.

Here is a colon used correctly to introduce a quote:

&gt;And this is the name by which he will be called: ""The Lord is our righteousness.""

In this situation, the first clause is incomplete without the material within the quotes.

Please provide me with a rationale for why a semi-colon should not be used in the demonstrated situation.  I will not be convinced by appeals to authority. I already know what *The Chicago Manual of Style* says.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to all of you who have gone down this punctuation rabbit hole with me. 

Here is my current view:

The semicolon and colon came into use in the 15th century and were initially used in Latin text.  The comma, semicolon, colon, and period were seen as steps, each indicating a longer pause.

In the 16th century, William Tyndale made the first translation of the Bible into English, a seminal work within the development of the English language. Tyndale used colons in situations where we would use commas. From what I can tell. Tyndale didn't use semi-colons.

Fast forward to the start of the 20th century. Strunk and White produced a style guide called *Elements of Style.* Strunk and White set forth some basic principles that remain in use. Strunk and White laid out that coma splices shouldn't be used, except for short independent clauses. Later editors took this further with the idea that comma splices should never be used. A semicolon should be used instead. Other languages didn't go along with this. I believe the intent was to simplify decision-making and taking out guesswork so that editors didn't have to consider meaning all that much. But it also led to more work for editors. One former editor said that her job was almost entirely replacing commas with semicolons.

This rule about comma splices was not applied when the second independent clause was contained inside quotes. I still don't know why but I've got some ideas.

The quote I used was from the Bible. The translators follow 2 different traditions. One is Tyndale, who preferred colons. The other is Greek, which allows comma splices, and neither tradition looks to Strunk and White.

In the Strunk and White tradition, someone declared that semicolons should no longer be used. The result has been writers using periods for nearly everything.

&gt;There was also an inscription over him. ""This is the King of the Jews.""

Thanks go to all of you. I  have a better understanding of punctuation.

Some people say it's progressivism vs. traditionalism, but again there lie contradictions here. It's also just a really hard discussion to have seeing as what progress is is sorta subjective.

**In my opinion, the key defining factor in identifying where an ideology falls on the ""political spectrum"" is it's view on hierarchies.**

Leftist ideologies see social hierarchies as:  Mostly unnatural, a cause of inequality, a way for bad people to maintain power, but almost never as a good thing. 

Right wing ideologies see social hierarches as: They either deny their existence, fight against them being destroyed, or promote them."

I feel empathy, and I was always told that empathy is a good thing to have, but valid reasons were never given as to why exactly. It seems that empathy, much like the female reproductive system, exists to mind control you and benefit the collective human species at your own expense.

Psychopaths are able to take advantage of the system of natural human kindness without the drawback of conscience, objectively examine emotionally manipulative content, not feel the pain of other people, basically a bunch of positives. I'm starting to feel that being a psychopath is actually a superior experience and people only call psychopaths defective because they can't admit that deep down, they're jealous they can't be one themselves.

And I have tried to change my view by googling and reading forums. But all of the results I get provide the same answer: that the downside of being a psychopath is that *other people* are negatively impacted by your actions.

Because these answers ignore the main point of being a psychopath - that being that other people's suffering doesn't cause you any pain - perhaps I should reframe my question. **Does being a psychopath provide any downsides to the *individual*?** Are they more likely to get bored? Drained from masking? Etc. etc.

(For reference, the definition of psychopath I will be using is a high-functioning individual who has cognitive empathy but biologically cannot feel affective empathy. This definition controls other variables and simply focuses on the advantages and disadvantages gained by the loss of this one trait.)

The American Bar Association recently decided to make the test optional. There are several reasons why this is a bad idea.

First, the test tells prospective students whether or not they are suitable candidates for law school. People argue that the test and preparation for it is prohibitively expensive, but something that costs far more is a semester of law school that one can't handle.

Second, the test provides schools with an even way of evaluating students. There is no way to compare GPAs from different schools or for students who took different classes. Not all 4.0s are created equally. People argue that getting rid of the test will increase diversity, but really law schools will just choose from more elite schools, which typically are less diverse.

Third, it takes away chances for bright students to set themselves apart despite going to a local college out of necessity. Get a 180, and the fact that you went to State University instead of Yale is not as relevant.

I recently saw a book in my girlfriends bathroom entitled ""She doesn't owe you anything pretty"" ( I'm not sure about the title but something in that general direction) I read a few pages and it turned out to be a summary of radical feminism for young girls. Now I fully agree with the concept of such a book up to the content of it. It kept saying how the gender roles needed to be reversed and have a matriarchy, but how is a matriarchy any better than a patriarchy?
In my point of view feminism is all about equity and that your gender shouldn't dictate as many aspects of your life as it does today. Typically a patriarchy doesn't allow women to thrive which is clearly a problem. But how does a matriarchy differ in that aspect? It still limits the ability to live in freedom to group of people. I was kind of disappointed in that kind of feminism, because it wanted me, as a man to be punished for the actions of other men in the past even though I disagreed with them and I think it is books like this which make most men who disagree with feminism disagree so violently. I feel like people are telling me I am a terrible person for spreading my legs a bit in public transport because it isn't comfortable otherwise. Can't we have equality while appreciating our differences?
 So my question is, can't we have feminism which promotes equality and not women over men? Cause to me that is just as bad as a man wanting women to be inferior...

Conversely, if you're a woman who is happily married and all she does all day is cook, clean, and take care of the kids while relying solely on the income of her working husband who's occupying the traditionally masculine role, your not.

However, I'm tired of seeing fake displays of ""awareness"" from teams, TV channels and companies in the West, which simultaneously stand to gain a lot of money from participating in this tournament.

I'm writing this from Germany, where our public television has aired a 15 minute interview with Amnesty International right before airing the opening match of Qatar v Ecuador. Something similar has happened today before they aired the England v Iran match.

On top of it, the National Team which was supposed to be playing with an arm band saying ""One Love"" in support of the LGBTQ+ community, has now publicly refrained to do so after a threat of yellow card penalty by FIFA - If your convictions are as strong as a yellow card, maybe you should reevaluate your convictions.

So after this rant of an intro, my point is the following: The time to protest Qatar 2022 and stop it from happening was in the past. The last chance any country had, was to entirely boycott the event by not sending their team (like so many national teams in history have done at the Olympics). 

But to now, to willingly attend the event, earn the championship money, sponsorship deals and television fees while simultaneously displaying a holier-than-thou attitude, is the peak of hypocrisy and honestly it is super annoying."

Instrumentally valuable is the belief that freedom is only good if it serves for a net-benefit for humanity, i.e. used for good deeds. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

To my estimation, the following conditions must be true for freedom to be instrically valuable.

1. If 2 logically-sound parties disagree on a particular issue, then there is value in that freedom of choice.
2. If more options become available that are unanimously less ideal than the previous options, the freedom of choice doesn't have increased value, it remains the same
3. If more options become available, the value of freedom of choice doesn't decrease.
4. If there is only ONE option, there is no intrinsically good freedom of choice.
5. The relation ""at least as good freedom of choice as"" is transitive logic. 

The issue arrises that when the statements are conjoined, there exists easy counter examples. Additionally, I believe statement 1, commonly known as *The Value of Rational Diversity*, is where issues arrise.

&amp;#x200B;

**For example, lets follow the train of thought from this example:** [**Paradox**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nous.12290)

I offer you 3 choices (buy insurance, skip insurance, get free insurance)

* All 3 options have *just as much* intrinisc value as just get free insurance.
* All 3 options do not offer *better* value than just get free insurance.
* Get free insurance is equally valuable as all 3.
* All 3 choices offer intrinsically at last as much value as just buy insurance and skip insurance on their own.
* Buy Insurance and skip insurance, together, offers instrinsically better freedom of choice than just the buy insurance option.
* Just the choice, get free insurance, offers intrinsically better freedom of choice than just the choice to buy insurance.
* However, due to 3rd condition before, the option to get free insurance doesn't offer intrinsically better freedom of choice as just the option to buy insurance. (Single choice sets)

Therefore, since the last two statements contradict, the conditions must be inconsistent.

&amp;#x200B;

**Common Rebuttal**

 If freedom of choice is intrinsically valuable, then the discussion over instrinsic value should appeal to the intuition about what it even means to talk about the intrinsic value of freedom. Yet, if the argument is correct, there can be no such thing as intrinsic value of freedom of choice. So, how could we ever realiably know? 

Consider this common line of argument:

* If God exists, the following two claims are true. There are objectives values, and an objective evil. There is a wholly good omnipotent being. A wholly good omnipotent being would, therefore, eliminate evil. 

If an atheist says that, assuming they, themselves, don't believe in objective values, doesnt lower the reliability of his intuition about what would be the case if those values existed. This follows the common form of argument by *reductio ad absurdum* which can therefore be applied to this argument.

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional Info**

If this topic intrests you, i strongly recommend reading this: [**Paradox**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nous.12290)**.** It does a much better job outlining the specific issues, one by one. I completely align with the author's position, so any argument against that publication is applicable here. I did my best to paraphrase, but its a very in depth discussion.

Not all stories demand complex mediums, some stories are meant to be digested in a simple form. These mediums also save you time, which i concede. However, if the primary goal is to explore a world/story in the fullest and most rich manner, video games are by far the best way to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

**More Substance to Create Theories**

* All of the best video game stories I can think of utilize their worlds to tell a story, alongside the actual story itself. As the story is progressing through *Bioshock*, the player is exploring Rapture, listening to tapes, and creating theories of their own. In *Silent Hill 2*, you explore Silent Hill and discover clues in the world, and even in your own inventory, completely seperate from the cutscenes themselves. The cutscenes and the explicit storytelling are *complimented* by the video game medium.

**Exploration/Mystery**

* Exploring a world on your own, at your own pace, is a more engaging and thought-provoking way of exploring a setting/world than watching at a predetermined pace.
* There is more to digest and explore in a game than in a 2 hour movie, or even a TV Show.
* Exploration lends itself to a differing experience for each individual if the game designers choose to. One player can pick up on clues one other player completely walked right past. This is also the case in movies, but you can allocate more time for exploration and theory crafting in a game.

**Decisions/Split-Storytelling/Diverging Stories**

* While I'm aware there are ""shows"" that implement choice based decision making, I would argue these are *actually* video games. Ill explain why.
   * Video games are a medium that allow you to interact with the story itself, Tv shows and movies are predetermined, on rails. If you can make choices to change the ending of  a story, your actions are changing the story.
* This allows writers to create scenarios where a player can explore the possible ""what-ifs"" of a story. While I concede that not all stories should have this, Its a nice feature for select few stories. *Heavy Rain* is a good example of this.

**Common Criticisms**

* While I concede that, yes, most of these games do require constant action. You can't just lay down and enjoy most of these games; you have to be actively involved. I do, however, think that there are various levels of storytelling in video games. Some games, like the previously mentioned *Heavy Rain*, along with all of David Cage's games, do allow you to more casually explore the story without the stressful action gameplay.
* Many will argue that these complex video games actually are the worst form of story telling, because they don't give you much direction on what things mean or where to go (think *Bloodborne).* This is a strawman of the position I initially made. Just because one complex game tells its story in a very nuanced way, doesn't discredit the medium as a whole. Games like *Sekiro,* from the same studio, streamline a series of games known for complex storytelling.
* I kind of think of the Book/Movie/Video Game as a spectrum of storytelling mediums. On the far left we have books, with the least amount of information, most rooms for personal exploration, and most room for fillling in the gaps with your own imagination. On the far right we have movies and TV Shows, where everything is deliberately shown and illustrated. Even the more complex/visually confusing shows are still delivering more ""information"" than the books. They also are time constrained/streamlined. You can't really reread or read at your own pace, without stopping and restarting and sort of escaping the medium itself. Books allow you to jump back and forth, read slowly, etc. Video Games offer the best of both worlds, allowing you to visualize and explore, all while the creators deliberately can show you certain areas or certain themes at various points.

While I think books are far superior to films to convey deep messaging, they don't have the depth and capabitliy of video games. I will concede though, that in 2022, Video Games are FAR less explored as a medium than Books, which have had hundreds of years of growth in this endeavor.

&amp;#x200B;

The only way that Movies are better than video games at telling a complex story is through ease-of-use (saving time, lack of involvement)

--
EDIT:

**After reading a lot of your comments (too many to comment to each) i'll use this space to clarify my new position. The primary error i made in this post is labeling (any) medium as best. This falls in line with the orchestral issue of ""what is the best instrument?"". The obvious answer is there is no ""best"" instrument, because each instrument has its individual utility. Even though one can be used more often than others, doesn't make it better, just more versatile.**"

0,2022-11-21,CMV: American football is significantly more interesting to watch than soccer/regular football,u/BjornWashington,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/z19g2u/cmv_american_football_is_significantly_more/,changemyview,"I've been thinking about this a bit since the World Cup started, but I've always thought that American football is a more interesting spectator sport by a large margin.

&amp;#x200B;

1. American football strikes the right balance between having frequent scores and having meaningful scores. In a sport like basketball, scoring is far too frequent; the significance of each individual basket is very low. Soccer goes too far in the other direction. Each goal is very meaningful, but they occur far too infrequently to remain engaged throughout the match. American football has some low scoring games, but the pace of scoring in a typical game strikes a good balance: each score is quite meaningful, but they occur often enough to keep a viewer engaged throughout.
2. To address a counterpoint to #1: soccer fans often claim that the action that happens between goals is exciting if you're a knowledgeable viewer. I find this somewhat convincing, but at the end of the day, goals are the only factor affecting a match's outcome. Sure, the battle for field control and possession can be interesting strategically, but those only affect the outcome of a match indirectly (i.e. a team with more control of the field is more likely to score goals). So while I see why paying attention to these things makes the viewing experience more interesting, wouldn't it be more engaging if these strategic battles were reflected through more frequent scores? American football has just as much strategy (if not more -- more on this in #3) than soccer, but those strategic battles play out through more frequent scores that actually affect the outcome.
3. American football's frequent stoppages give players and viewers time to make high-leverage strategic decisions. People who don't like American football often cite its regular play stoppages as a drawback. To use an argument similar to something that soccer fans often say, these stoppages don't detract from a viewer's enjoyment if the viewer is knowledgeable about the game. In fact, they contribute to a viewer's enjoyment -- it gives them time to think about what kind of decision a team should make. How can an offense try to adapt to a defense's scheme? Is it better to take a risk and go for it on fourth down, or is it better to play it safe? If a particular receiver is being shut down, where else can the QB look? The time between plays gives players, coaches, and viewers frequent opportunities to reflect on the state of the game. Soccer viewers certainly get to think about strategy, but strategic decisions are more of a ""slow burn"" -- strategies are implemented for a particular match, but the structure of the sport doesn't really lend itself to big, on-the-fly decisions.
4. American football offers multiple ways to score. This creates a lot of interesting optimization problems and dilemmas. Most frequently, the decision is between kicking a field goal for some ""safe"" points and taking a big risk to go for a touchdown. This doesn't exist in soccer. Sure, a team can take a strategic risk by pressing the field and leaving themselves more vulnerable to attack, but this doesn't feel quite as high-stakes as the decisions that are made on a regular basis in football.
5. American football has significantly more differentiation between roles. I know that keepers, defenders, midfielders, and strikers have quite different jobs, but every position (except for keepers) demands a somewhat similar skillset. Each position has a different point of emphasis, but every player performs some combination of dribbling, passing, and shooting. Roles in American football, on the other hand, are extremely specialized. Only one person throws the ball; some players' primary responsibility is getting open and catching passes (with a bit of blocking mixed in); although they get a lot of flak for just being large and running into each other, there's a ton of strategy that goes into playing as a lineman. This differentiation of roles makes for a really dynamic sport -- people with extremely varied skillsets need to work together effectively. I also think it's really interesting that a football team has a clearly defined offensive leader. It's pretty compelling and unique among sports to have every offensive play run through a single player (QB) who also acts as a kind of on-the-field coach.
6. This isn't really inherent to the sports themselves, but NFL football has significantly more parity than most European leagues. I won't focus on this because it's more of a salary cap argument that a sport argument, but it does make me far more interested in football than soccer.

I have some other reasons, but these are the main points. I'm genuinely interested in the strategic demands of different sports, so I'd love to hear what you all think. American football gets a lot of justified hate for its health consequences, but I do think it's probably the most strategically rich sport out there."

Qualified immunity works by protecting any government “official” from lawsuits only allowing them to be punished if the “official” violated a “clearly established” statutory or constitutional right. This makes it impossible to ever prosecute government members unless what they did was verbatim explicitly stated as a law.
I can’t see any reason why this should remain legal as it is a net negative for the general populous and it encourages police to hit first and hit again later.
Edit: If anyone is still reading through the comments and thus post it seems some clarification could help on what I mean when I say abolish Qualified immunity, wether thats the fault of my lack of understanding or detail. My post meant to discuss if QI for government “officials” to the tune of law enforcement and the endless extensions of and departments similar to that field. i.e. ATF, DOJ, DEA, FBI, CIA, IRS-CI, Police officers (swat, detectives, sheriffs, etc.), Border Patrol, and any other three letter agency."
1,2022-11-21,CMV: leveraged buyouts should be illegal,u/their-holiness,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/z1af9n/cmv_leveraged_buyouts_should_be_illegal/,changemyview,"I believe leveraged buyouts should be illegal. This is when people acquire companies and put their debt from the acquisition onto the company rather than personally holding it. Elon Musk did this with Twitter and that’s why Twitter has so much debt now.

I see this as economically harmful because it encourages wealthy people and corporations to buy productive companies and then risk the productivity of the company instead of their own finances. If the company goes under they won’t have to pay the acquisition debt, even though the debt harmed the ability of the company to function anyways by requiring it to pay the debt which is unrelated to business expenses instead of reinvesting in its products and services.

Now I do believe people can do something similar by trying to squeeze money out of a company they bought to pay their personal debt, and having shares in the company as collateral for the loan, this is similar but it still involves the person actually taking on risk of their own."

0,2022-11-21,CMV: parenthood is a privilege you EARN,u/Opposite_Yam_5511,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/z1c9dx/cmv_parenthood_is_a_privilege_you_earn/,changemyview,"CLARIFICATION — this opinion operates on the principle of “just because you can doesn’t mean you should”. Creating life is a beautiful experience but it is a privilege earned through becoming an adult who can provide for the new life’s needs. If you cannot nurture and provide for the life you wish to create don’t do it just because you can. 

First off — I think everyone has a right to their own bodies and a human right to reproduce but…. bringing innocent life into this world is a privilege and if one cannot fulfill the obligations of parenthood they are not entitled to experience parenthood. 

Creating a child isn’t a joke. And I believe if you take on the responsibility of creating life — you are responsible for them. For their whole life. This means doing the best you can to meeting all their basic needs and as many ancillary/luxury desires as you can! If you are unable to meet these needs for yourself let alone another human you should not even entertain the idea of parenthood. 

Again none of this applies for people deprived of family planning educations and access to such resources or Individuals forced into parenthood etc. great we’ve covered the base rules. This is for ppl who intentionally want kids and make them. 

Now here’s where this opinion gets criticized….. 
Let’s assume we all have full reproductive control of whether or not we have kids:

I believe having a child when dealing with food insecurity, money troubles, housing instability etc is cruel and selfish. Not only are you suffering through these issues you are bringing a child into the picture to have them suffer the same way. If you cannot provide your child an environment where they can go to school through 12th grade without needing to work to support the family/support their base needs it just feels like an inability to fulfill parental duty. Like this really isn’t meant to be classist but more of a reality check. The world can be cruel and unforgiving and we can bitch about society not doing enough to support parents without enough money as much as we want — but people should not create a child KNOWING they will 100% need the help and assistance of a 3rd party to do so. 

If you cannot provide the physical, emotional, social, and material needs of a child you have NO business thinking about creating life. 

I also feel that the rich or celebrities with incredibly busy lifestyles and constant jet setting have no business having kids if Nannies are essentially raising them. The bulk of your child’s emotional and psychological needs are being met by a 3rd party. One could argue atleast the kids needs are met through some avenue but these kids miss out on time with their parents which will hurt them.

This is where my opinions have been called ableist. Because I staunchly think individuals who require full time assistance or caretaking should not have children and create a life that a 3rd party or partner caretaker will essentially raise physically speaking. Additionally if you have a disability that limits your ability to have a stable home environment/money/housing/psychiatric stability —&gt; you should not have a child. Again if you require 3rd party assistance to live on your own you have no business having a child on top of this.

Lastly if you have a genetic condition/disease/disability that severely impacts your quality of life, health, reasonable expectations of longevity. I think it is selfish having a child that might seriously suffer.

It sucks society can’t help everyone and can’t provide for peoples basic needs but it’s our reality. Parents choose to create their  children and they and they ALONE are obligated to meet their needs and care for them. People need to stop having kids if they can’t accept this fundamental value."

This is me arguing that it's not a revolutionary movement.  It's always existed.  We just created a label for it. 

Quiet quitting in concept is not new.  It's very odd to me how it's getting portrayed as this workplace revolution. 

Throughout history around the world,  there have always been people who don't do extra at work.  I'm actually one of them! 

 I show up and do the job that I'm paid to do at a high level.  I don't work overtime. But I take my job very seriously.  I've been told several times that my numbers are higher than those of my fellow teammates. I'm happy to hear that.  

But I very rarely do anything out of my job description.  Why?  Because I believe that if my employer is going to ask me for more than what my job entails, then I deserve compensation for that.  I signed a contract for what I have agreed to do. I refuse to get manipulated into doing more than that. 
I don't get stressed at work this way. I put my mental health above that. 

I understand that what I have described above is not exactly quiet quitting. But I'm trying to illustrate that none of this is new. It's not a revolution.  Every office or workplace has a person who does it."

There were people back then that were nice but it’s gotten worse especially since pandemic. And I am sure you all have had difficulty as well for a variety of different reasons.

I know I have definitely heard the phrase “If shit stinks check yourself first” and it’s like… yeah, but even shitty people have friends. Even the most monster of people have people that love them. and it’s kind of fact that vulnerable people are actually the ones at most risk of having a low support network or friends. I even went to therapy in my teens and they couldn’t even help too much. And had old friends tell me I’m beyond fixing lol. 

But anyways back on the pandemic thing I have seen a massive uptick of people being rude, not just on the road but in all aspects in life. To the point where I have agoraphobia. So am I wrong for thinking this perspective even if I have attempted to change? Sometimes you can change but people can stay the same right??

Hope y’all understand or can atleast relate if my view can’t be changed. Open for discussion of course lol"

Especially so when we consider *what* countries will get the money and *how* it will be paid. 

In New York State alone there’s several high profile examples of unemployment  fraud in the hundreds of millions of dollars that happened when the state was flush with federal funding in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

Taxpayers of one country that don’t feel personally responsible for flooding in Pakistan will be put out to hear their money was wasted by bureaucratic inefficiency and corruption. And if an opposition party finds out, the Republican Party in the US for example, and runs on pulling out of the agreement or slashing the amount of funding, then this was all for nought.

The US has poured billions of dollars in aid to Latin America all in the hopes of stemming the flow of refugees and asylum seekers attempting to cross the Rio Grande for a better life. 

It’s yet to work. 

And though there’s plenty of discussion to be had on *how* the money was spent and if it was spent wisely or invested well, people’s generosity has limits. If a taxpayer hears they’ve helped fund millions of dollars of aid to Colombia or Guatemala that’s done jack squat to stop the refugees coming over the border, they aren’t gonna want to hear “well wait a minute here, you guys didn’t give us enough and in the right ways so you’re still on the hook and owe us more. this is a moral duty and if you fail to pony up **again** so we can do this right, America sucks as a nation”

At which point the voter has long since tuned out the criticism because it starts to sound like we’ll never make up the imbalance and they’re still demanding more money."

An interdimensional being would be a being or entity that possess more than 3 dimensions. More specifically, they exist as part of a system with a greater number of coordinates axes than our own. They'd be able to time-travel and move out of the physical body into a spiritual one, or perhaps never having a physical body at all, or just in our realm.

My life experiences, knowledge, and research has led me to believe that Interdimensional beings exist. I've had supernatural experiences and have seen entities and light beings with my own eyes multiple times. I was in denial for a long time and still partly am, which is why we're here. Looking for answers. I'm open to pretty much any interpretation of ghosts and anything under that umbrella being possible. In my eyes, even aliens would fall into Interdimensional beings. It seems like a pretty solid explanation for the supernatural (assuming you already believe it can exist)

988,2022-11-22,CMV: Emotional Regulation should be a required course that goes from Preschool to College.,u/poppinchips,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/z20bvh/cmv_emotional_regulation_should_be_a_required/,changemyview,"As someone in his 30s currently going through emotional regulation. Mindfulness. And the idea that *you don't have to trust every thought you have*. I've lived inside my own head for a long time, and I've found that it had an overly detrimental effect on my ability to deal with my emotions, with my traumas, or even noticing how I actually felt. Even though I felt like someone who was very capable emotionally, the truth is emotions ran amok in me. 

Raising my kid now, and seeing television shows talking more about how you need to acknowledge all your emotions, and let them sink in until you feel better is new to me. Having gone through several therapists, I've learned that accepting an emotion, and not acting on the urges they push is the best way to deal with them. 

Breathing techniques, mindfulness as a given, and acceptance of your thoughts are all things that are extremely beneficial. I feel as though these are skills that should be taught to young children continuously so that they can utilize them. 

It is unfortunate that Media tends to glamorize and loves people that lash out with their emotional trauma, and act on those emotional urges (the negative kind). Real strength is learning to accept those emotions and not acting on them. Beyond just children's parents teaching them this, and TV shows, I would love if this was a part of the overall school syllabus.

**Edit**: For anyone curious about why it would need to be taught for so long when the reference material is just a few short pages. Here's why - 

A big part of emotional regulation is mindfulness. The requirement for mindfulness is slowing things down, learning to accept thoughts, and being aware of your emotions/body. A part of getting there is through meditation and breathing. This can be guided, or not. People meditate for years since it's a skill that takes practice, and it takes a lot of practice to do it well. I would assume that would be a part of the daily learning as much as PE is."

0,2022-11-22,CMV: The combined air forces of Middle East nations is superior to the combined air forces of the European Union member nations,u/GreenRyan33,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/z2c66d/cmv_the_combined_air_forces_of_middle_east/,changemyview,"**I believe that the combined air forces of Middle East nations is superior to the combined air forces of the EU.**

**The Middle East I define as**: Egypt, Pakistan, Turkey, Israel, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iran, Jordan, Oman, Yemen, Iraq, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Syria, Lebanon

**When I say superior I mean that if in theory there were a hypothetical fight between EU nations' air forces and Middle East nations' air forces for air supremacy then the Middle East would likely win.**  This is based on a combination of factors:

1. The quantity of the air assets
2. The quality of the air assets
3. The quality of the pilots, including the effects of the training and experience of the pilots and other personnel

**I looked at each of these three factors holistically, as documented below.  Based on the facts below I think that the quality of air assets, quality of pilots, and the quantity of air assets are all superior in the combined ME forces than in the combined EU forces overall.**

**Quality of air assets** refers to factors that enable air assets to prevail in the struggle for air supremacy, including the following factors:

1. How advanced the tech systems are
2. Weapons systems and munitions
3. Cruise, max speed
4. Agile airframe and power
5. Avionics systems
6. Stealth and low probability of intercept
7. Electronic warfare capabilities
8. Networking and command and control capabilities
9. Situational awareness
10. Other capabilities

**Quality of the pilots**

1. Countries in the ME on average consider the likelihood of being at war to be much higher than EU countries.  For example, Israel, Pakistan, Egypt, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia all consider the chances of their countries being in a war to be more higher than Sweden, Spain, France, Italy, and Netherlands do.  As a result, ME nations devote more focus and more attention on the quality of their pilots and making sure they are top notch.  Also ME nations invest heavily into training programs and making their pilots and personnel as best as possible.
2. Countries in the ME have a lot more experience in conflicts and wars in recent years and decades than countries in the EU, on average.  As a result, ME pilots have more real combat experience.  Additionally, the air forces of the ME have more inherited wisdom and understanding about real combat scenarios in the modern era from actually fighting real wars in modern times.  These understandings and information have been integrated into their training courses and military programs for their pilots and personnel so they have superior training programs.

Overall, I think people underrate the quality of the pilots in the Middle East and over-rate the quality of the pilots of EU countries.  Israel, Saudi Arabia, and UAE have top notch pilots that are generally superior to the quality and training of pilots of the EU.  And the average pilot quality of Pakistan, Egypt, Qatar, Bahrain, Jordan, and Turkey is on par with the EU nation average.  The pilots and training of Iraq, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and Kuwait I concede are a bit worse in quality.

**Quantity of the air assets**

The below data are incomplete.  I didn't keep track of every single aircraft type, but did my best of tracking what I thought are the most important.  Also I may have missed certain countries even for the models listed below.  If I did, please let me know and I will edit this post to make it more accurate.

Here are some reasons: 

- Women takes the name of their husbands: I know it doesn't happend ALWAYS but it's still a tradition that I still don't understand. So if a coupke wants to be affiliated to each other the woman must me the one taking the first step? 

- I see many men wanting their girlfriend to be younger than them. While we women accept men in a highly wide range of age, they don't. Yes I know "" not all men"" but c'mon don't ignore the fact that most relationship around you consists of a man older than the woman. 

- Who gets raped the most? Who is kidnapped the most? Who is killed or beaten by their lover? Who is catcalled the most? Who is paid less? 

- A lot of pople focus on our appearance or our age more than our personality. Yes it can happend to men but don't deny that part of feminity is focused on ""Appearance "" like we are some piece of meat and that ugly people don't deserve equal rights.

A large part of the reason I wouldn't generally describe myself as a fan is that, what I see as the fundamental attitude of football players stops me from being able to really respect it as a sport. 

I know that no sport is completely clean and free from scandals, cheating attempts, specific athletes with bad reputations etc. But nowhere *more* than football does the baseline expectation of good-faith playing and sportsmanship seem to be set so low. Players play, seemingly by default and as a tactic, in a way which constantly pushes rules as far as they can or outright tries to break them. The diving is the most obvious thing, and calling it for what it is, it's just outright attempts at cheating and I'm endlessly frustrated by how it's not heavily penalised. But for every dive there's also a heavy-handed tackle that the offending player will argue till they're blue in the face was fine, no matter how clear cut. All the shirt grabbing, OTT appeals to the referee whenever any decision goes slightly against them. Stalling for time to run down the clock if your team is ahead may be the least of these things, but it's still sad to see and clearly against the spirit of the game. 

I'll put it this way; can you imagine another major sport that would fall to pieces so completely if there wasn't a referee there to enforce things? I'd mostly trust two professional tennis players to run a fair game between themselves, but it's almost funny thinking of the circus that would happen if Argentina played France without a ref. 

As I say, no sport is squeaky clean. As I write this I'm reminded of steroids in athletics / horse racing, illegal components in F1 cars etc. But my argument is that football is the most extreme example of a sport where you can set your watch on players lacking desire, care or respect for a game to be done fairly."

It's ironic, even, considering the amount of sexual predators that have been found in the Catholic Church. We should do everything we can to remove homophobic stereotypes from our culture, even changing the language. The problem with ""sexual orientation"" is it makes you immediately think of sex when you think of gay, lesbian, or bi people. This is problematic because not only is it reducing people to one quality, but it also doesn't fully reflect what sexual orientation is. It is also love, and sometimes family.

The word _sexual_ in the phrase ""sexual orientation"" was _
originally meant to refer to ""having to do with the sexes,"" but has been confused and misused over the years. In other words, originally, it was not just about having sex, but romance, etc, as well. Being gay is so much more than sex. You don't watch straight romances and automatically think about the couple boning, for instance. If everyone thought that, I don't think we would allow kids to see any Disney movies at all. But the phrase ""sexual orientation"" has an association with lust because it has the word _sex_ in it, so we need to use a different phrase.

How to change my view: show either that the phrase sexual orientation is a good one to continue using, or that it has no connotation with sex.

How NOT to change my view: anyone claiming that language as a whole doesn't matter. Sociologists and psychologists clearly disagree, so I think science is behind me on this one. Also, anyone claiming that being gay is a sin is not changing my view.

Edit: there are a lot of comments that are similar which I have responded to, so I will read through all of the new ones and if a bunch of my answers are also similar, I will post it up here."

However, most of the nations that face severe sanctions are autocratic and the people themselves have little to no say in who leads the nation and what they do.

So, you get examples like North Korea where we (and most of the rest of the Western world) have heavily sanctioned them since the 1950s. In those 70 years, North Koreans have seen their material well being plummet. Hundreds of thousands - millions of people have starved to death. Millions more have been stunted due to malnourishment or died of related diseases. But the Kim family still rules. The people don’t vote for them, and any who oppose them are killed. The people have no power to change their government, yet they are punished for the actions of them. This arrangement will likely continue for the foreseeable future and claim millions more lives.

We are beginning to see this play out with Russia as well. It’s happened with Iran for a few decades, and Cuba for about 60 years. People suffer, but the sanctions don’t actually accomplish anything. We shouldn’t sanction these nations, unless actively engaged in war. Punishing civilians for having a bad government that they can’t reasonable replace is just morally wrong. It’s inflicting gratuitous suffering on powerless people."

Quick disclaimers: I know that ACAB is not a new term and that for the majority of its century long history it's meant ""all coppers are bastards"". This appeal to tradition means nothing to me as I'm not arguing about the historically correct usage, I'm arguing about the more effective, relevant, and accurate usage as it relates to the modern movement. Also, I'm not arguing for or against ACAB as a concept or a slogan, I'm not saying that ACAB is the best slogan to use or that it's even a good one, I'm only saying that when comparing ACAB meaning bastards and ACAB meaning bad, bad is the better option. Telling me that ACAB originally meant bastards or that ACAB is a bad slogan and just shouldn't be used at all won't change my view.

1. Bad just sounds better, it rolls off the tongue better, and it's a one syllable word like the rest of the acronym. Comparatively, bastards is big and clunky and doesn't flow as well. While this isn't a big deal, I think that catchiness, quippiness, quotability, and brevity are all important aspects to a slogan being effective.

You can change my view if you can convince me that, disregarding meaning and looking at it purely aesthetically, bastards makes a better slogan than bad.

2. Bad creates a conversation more easily and makes more logical sense than bastards.

""All cops are bad.""  
""Why would you say that? I know good cops.""  
""The system of policing in America is bad, and no matter how much good someone wants to do or how good an individual may be, the act of policing in America necessarily forces them to do bad things. If people choose to work a job that forces them to do bad things, then they condone those bad things.""  
""Oh, I understand now. By choosing to support a bad system, you are necessarily bad. When your job forces you to be immoral the moral choice is to find a different job. You're not necessarily speaking out against people who are cops, you're speaking out against the job position of police officer.""

""All cops are bastards.""  
""Why would you say that? I know cops that aren't bastards.""  
""The system of policing in America is bad, and no matter how much good someone wants to do or how good an individual may be, the act of policing in America necessarily forces them to do bad things. If people choose to work a job that forces them to do bad things, then they condone those bad things.""  
""Okay so maybe the system is bad, but that doesn't make them bastards. What does being a bastard have to do with anything?""

3. Bastard, according to Oxford, is ""1. an unpleasant or despicable person."" or ""2. no longer in its pure or original form; debased."" In it's first definition, bastard is a personal attack, whereas bad is a moral judgement. Bastard validates Ad Hominem accusations, takes the focus away from the system and the role, and just attacks the person. In it's second definition, bastard is just incorrect. The system hasn't been debased, corrupted, or no longer functioning in it's pure, original form, the system is functioning exactly like it's always been designed to function. Modern cops aren't a bastardization of the role of police, they're exemplary of it, and that's the problem.

You can change my view if you can convince me that bastards makes more logical sense to describe the idea behind the slogan than bad does, that bastards allows for an open conversation better than bad does, or that bastards has a lower chance of the meaning being misconstrued or being taken as a personal attack than bad does.

4. Bastard's original usage was to describe an illegitimate child. It was a denotation of a second class citizen, born out of wedlock and therefore undeserving of inheritance. The concept devalues non-traditional relationships and non-nuclear families and the term, to this day, is used as a slur against people for something they had no control over and that doesn't have any real impact on them. Using it so widely and for such a progressive movement normalizes the word more than it should be, and by extension it propagates the idea that being a bastard is a bad thing. My parents were married when they had me, but I have friends that were bullied for being from broken homes or the products of one-night-stands and called bastard as a slur. They don't like the word and I respect that. I'm queer and I would be very uncomfortable with a slogan like ""Cops Are Fags"". I think a slogan that doesn't utilize a derogatory word against an unrelated people group is better than one that does.

You can change my view by convincing me that bastards doesn't propagate any negativity towards people born out of wedlock or that as a whole they don't care about the usage of the word.

2357,2022-11-23,CMV: I still don't understand the importance of pronouns.,u/goatDowry,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/z2v6gu/cmv_i_still_dont_understand_the_importance_of/,changemyview,"The whole thing seems confusing to me.

There is biological sex --&gt; Which led to different social roles, and then socialized gender.

In the modern day with modern technology. You can live life how you generally please. Women don't need to be child bearers. And men don't need to be out risking their lives killing things.

To me this means, that the traditional gender roles don't matter. You can be a male and wear makeup, high heels and a dress. Who cares?

Likewise if you're a biological female, you can do things that used to be considered masculine. It's a free country.You can also fit squarely into those old gender roles if you so choose.

So I don't understand why someone feels the need to be addressed with a particular set of pronouns. To me, it's like ok, I can call you that, but then it seems to me that you're just doubling down on the idea that rigid gender differences do matter. Which I don't think they do. You're just you, an individual person. And all this language of he/she is just what we've been using for a long time, so I don't see how a different pronoun will change anything that matters.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. before one of you goes calling me a bigot, one of my best friends and former roommate transitioned while I was living with her. I'll obviously call her by whatever pronouns she asks bc it's just polite. We've been friends for over 10 years. I'll call someone by their preferred pronouns, but I don't understand why it's so important.

**EDIT: The point of this is to try and understand why it's important. Maybe that wasn't clear before. Obviously I've talked to my friend about this a lot.**"

However, it seems that there are instrumental harms that this creates in our current America. Without a doubt, gun violence and mass shootings have increased alongside increasing gun restrictions. After world war 2 you could get a military surplus m1 carbine delivered to your door through a mail order. High capacity magazines were common with this gun. However, mass shootings were not a problem at the time. Banning ar-15’s or high capacity magazines will not reduce mass shootings significantly, perhaps 10 people will be killed instead of 15. 

Imo this shows that guns are not intrinsically bad for society, but our American society has degraded so much that the average person cannot be trusted to own one. At this point, the only solution to this problem would be restricting all guns heavily. However, this will not solve Americans’ psychotic needs to murder random people. Sure restricting guns will make mass murder less deadly, but there will still be a demented culture full of psychotic murderers.

More discussion needs to be focused around why people have the convictions to randomly murder their community members in the first place. And the blanket answer of “America needs better mental health resources”, does not work. Why do so many Americans need mental health resources to stop themselves from killing each-other in the first place? Guns help enable psychopaths, but way more focus needs to be placed upon why there are so many American psychopaths who want to use guns."

265,2022-11-23,CMV: Telling random people to smile is rude and inconsiderate of their feelings,u/Actual_Parsnip4707,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/z32qlz/cmv_telling_random_people_to_smile_is_rude_and/,changemyview,"My view is that when people tell others to smile it's often comes from a place of selfishness rather than wanting that person to express themselves how they see fit. People want to see others smile mainly for aesthetic purposes than anything else. When you see someone down the street you have absolutely no idea what trials &amp; tribulations they've faced, their life story, what they are currently going through and so on. So I think it's extremely dismissive to tell someone to put on a mask which is a smile because it personally looks appealing to you rather than actually try to brighten that persons day in any other regards. Like imagine if something tragic just happened to you where you lost your job, a love one got into a car accident or something in which it negatively impacted you. How would you feel if someone randomly came up and told you ""smile!"". Me personally it would piss me off quite a bit. 
And on top of that nobody owes anyone anything when it comes to facial expression. How one chooses to express their face has no impact on anyone else's well being. Peoples faces aren't here to make someone else feel better so I feel like telling someone how they should handle their facial expression isn't any different than telling them how they should dress, walk etc. in my opinion telling people to smile comes from a form a narcissism in a sense that you want others to express themselves just for your own personal benefit. Because you find someone smiling more aesthetically pleasing than someone who doesn't look happy. Well what do you guys think?"

She opportunistically shot her trafficker in the ~~back of the head~~ edit: neck. She was tried as an adult and sentenced to ~~20 years to life~~ edit: life without possibility of parole. She recounted that she felt like she had no other option, she didn’t have a support network, anyone to turn to for help, or know of any other way out of that situation other than killing herself (which I believe would have been a greater tragedy). All she knew is that she didn’t like being abused and wanted a way out of that situation.

My view is that a person, and particularly a juvenile who kills someone to get away from a life of being trafficked and/or abused should not face a murder conviction. If it can be proven that the deceased victim was routinely abusing or trafficking them, the charge should be significantly less severe than a standard murder conviction, even if it’s not directly in self defence (by this I mean, if they aren’t facing an immediate threat of violence, rape or death).

I’m interested in counterpoints to this, because murder is, I believe, one of the most severe crimes a person can commit. I cannot think of any other scenario outside of direct, immediate self defence where killing a person would be ok. But it doesn’t sit right with me that a 15yo girl can be put away for most of her life when, as best she could tell the only other options were a life of abuse and sex trafficking, or suicide.. I don’t know what an appropriate “punishment” for killing your sex trafficker should be, if it even should be punished, but it shouldn’t be a murder conviction.

Of course there would be a heavy burden of proof that the deceased victim was in fact trafficking them - it being difficult to prove would not change my view. I’m saying IF it was proven, the conviction should not be murder.

Edit: Facts of the specific case in first paragraph. Since people are asking, the case that prompted this for me was that of [Sara Kruzan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Kruzan) which I heard on the Ear Hustle episode [Dirty Water](https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/ear-hustle/id1240841298). Ultimately Kruzan's conviction was reduced to second degree manslaughter and she has now been released for time served. I believe that second degree manslaughter is still too severe of a conviction in Kruzan's case."

In recent years I've read posts from loads of people (mostly left-leaning) hurling this term at conservative pundits, (e.g. Ben Shapiro) politicians, (Trump or any of his supporters) the entire republican voter population, and even relative moderates like Jordan Peterson. (not to say JP is politically neutral by any means)

None of the people mentioned above by name fit the fascist definition. Fascists are severely and openly authoritarian, nationalistic to the point of religious zealotry, and so racist that history's best example of the philosophy perpetrated the single worst genocide ever.

I just don't see any signs that indicate that the US is anywhere close to becoming a fascist nation. Trump's presidency was maybe the closest we've come in a while. He had the authoritarian spirit and populist rhetoric in spades, no doubt, but in the end he was ousted by the democratic process just like everyone before him.

It's also important to remember that in the past strong fascist regimes have really only taken power in countries with desperate populations facing dire economic circumstances. The US is most certainly not in that boat.

P.S.

I can't help but liken this to the cold war-era practice of using ""commie"" as a generically pejorative term, which--of course--was stupid and closed-minded.

To be clear, I do not personally support him, Trump, or DeSantis; I think they are all awful and should be allowed within 1000 feet of the White House. But I want to address the “why is Pence running?” question pundits keep bringing up and argue that his run is quite rational, and that he has a better chance of winning the nomination than most realise. 

To start, the two lanes in the 2024 GOP primary will be Trump and the anti-Trumps/Trump alternatives. Pence would clearly be in the latter group. Currently, polling at the top of the Trump alternative group is Ron DeSantis. He starts this race as an underdog, but he is widely seen as having the best chance of being competitive with Trump. 

Mike Pence is often described as not having much of a constituency, he’s polling a distant third, and many are questioning why he is considering running. I think his reasons for running are compelling because: 

1) DeSantis could implode. This is arguably the norm in Republican politics. There have been hyped up candidates that the donors and right wing media love and push, but they end up being total duds as candidates (think Rick Perry 2012, Scott Walker 2016). The GOP also has a “flavor of the month” phenomenon, where they swing from candidate to candidate and move on once they stumble. Think 2012 (Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, and Rick Santorum all having led in the polls before voters settled on Romney) and the Trump alternatives in 2016 (Jen Bush, Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz). DeSantis has also not been subject to the “Trump treatment” yet - the one that ruined careers of the most promising GOP talent in 2016. He’s not been subject to the level of national media scrutiny that comes with a presidential campaign. While he makes many shrewd moves in politics, he is not a strong debater and is charismatically challenged when compared to Trump. There is a fairly good chance he either gets eaten alive by Trump or his campaign just doesn’t gain traction. If that happens, Pence is the most convenient candidate for the anti-Trump establishment to fall back on. 

2) DeSantis might not even run. While he’s a lot likelier to today than 2 weeks ago, he could still decide primarying Trump would be career-suicide and that he has a better chance of actually being president if he waits until 2028. If that happens, Pence is the most logical fall back for the anti-Trump establishment.

3) Pence could do well in Iowa. He’s midwestern and evangelical, a good fit for the first in the nation caucus. Winning Iowa could make the race more of a toss-up. 

4) Pence is tied to the Trump presidency, which Republican voters love, without being directly tied to the Trump scandals. He has a powerful argument to make to take the mantle as “MAGA without the drama.” 

5) The voters who are actually mad at him for doing his job on 1/6 are firmly in Trump’s camp already, and are not that consequential. The anti-Trump field won’t be playing for those voters. 

6) Vice-Presidents have a historically good track record of winning nominations. Walter Mondale, George Bush Sr, Al Gore, Joe Biden… when they want it they tend to get it. 

To CMV, convince me that from a political standpoint that Mike Pence running for President is not an objectively good idea for him."

286,2022-11-24,CMV: 'cancel culture' is not new and it is a misleading descriptor for what people use it for in the first place.,u/scerye,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/z3eoiz/cmv_cancel_culture_is_not_new_and_it_is_a/,changemyview,"I am posting this because I'm pretty sure I'm right but also feel like I'm missing some context or history to this since I am not on Twitter. Feel free to respond if you mostly agree but see holes in my argument or exceptions to what I am saying. Just please don't be mean or condescending, I am super open to my opinion being changed.

Whenever I see the term 'cancel culture' being used, it is one of two things

1. A celebrity or entity that is mad people are boycotting them because they genuinely did something awful (ex. billionaire 'Geoffrey' angry that people are boycotting his company after he set the entire north pole on fire)
2. or it is a celebrity, entity, or random online people who are upset about people dogpiling and harassing them or others for anything from minor or made-up offenses to actually bad things. (ex. people on social media platform sending death threats to fans of youtuber 'Rachel' and doxxing her because she misattributed a quote) Note: 'Rachel' could have done something genuinely bad and this would still be not ok.

The latter is bad in my opinion. However, I would argue that it is not cancel culture, as cancel culture refers to social or economic ostracism and not harassment towards the person in question or their fans/followers. Saying ""I no longer want to follow CoolestYoutuber6573 because she likes the color purple and that is morally reprehensible and I think others with my mindset should do the same"" is fine. Sure I would not agree, but as long as that person is not lying about CoolestYoutuber6573, is not harassing her, and is not harassing her fans for continuing to follow her, I think that's fine. The problem comes when harassment, doxxing, and just generally being unnecessarily cruel to the person you don't like or their fans occur. And while those things often coincide with 'cancelling', they themselves are not cancelling and shouldn't be misconstrued as being the same thing.

The former is an important extension of free speech in my opinion. Ordinary people should have the freedom to use their limited economic influence in ways that correlate with their viewpoints to a certain extent. This includes the ability to be able to boycott things without being criticized for the act of boycotting if they are able to. I also think it's something people have done for all of human history... If your neighbor Jeff does something awful and unforgivable, most of your neighbors who are aware will collectively agree to stop talking to him or at least stop bringing him cookies. You wouldn't call that 'cancel culture', but it's the same thing. And while there's a discussion to be had about when it is and isn't ok to abandon someone who has done something wrong and when you should forgive them, the ability to decide to leave behind someone who is causing you mental harm (if they are not dependent on you such as a child would be, I'm sure there are other cases) and the culture of accepting when people choose to do that is not a bad thing. Even if that someone is a celebrity or politician. *Especially* if that someone is a celebrity or a politician since you don't personally know them and have no obligation to be nice to them, only an obligation to not harass or endanger them by way of doxxing or other. Even if you disagree that it is ok to 'cancel' someone when the bad thing they did wasn't to you personally, I think people can agree that the 'culture' of attempting to socially or economically ostracize someone who does something that someone considers to be bad is pretty universal. Yes it's more accessible now for anyone to propose any reason to cancel someone, before regular people could do it by using virality online, media, celebrities, and rich people did it all the time by way of shit-talking, black-listing, and false accusations. It was the same thing and probably happened (on a large scale) just as frequently. If you are referring to the act of normal people doing it as opposed to more powerful people cancelling, that would go back to my point of 'cancel culture' being a misleading descriptor.

I think people use it to describe the culture of internet harassment and doxxing too often when that's not what it means. I also think it's just generally a silly term to use for a widespread phenomenon that isn't new and isn't really a 'culture' in the typical sense the word culture is used, even if you could argue that it isn't technically wrong.

***I think it would be similar to if people referred to breaking up a relationship as 'breakup culture'. Kind of weird because it's by no means an uncommon or new thing and while you can disagree as to when it is appropriate or if it is ever moral, I wouldn't really call it a 'culture'.***

'Cancel culture' seems like a misleading term to me, and I feel that it could be put in a better way.

TLDR: Whether you think it's good or bad it's a pretty normal part of human society to decide to stop interacting with someone you think did something bad even if it wasn't to you and even if you don't know them personally, so I don't see why it's referred to as a 'culture' and could be referred to in a more apt way.

**If possible I'd like to hear whether or not you think 'cancel culture' could be phrased better and what it should be called instead, and if not why.**

Edit: A lot of people are telling me why cancel culture is bad. My argument is NOT whether cancel culture is good or not. I am asking whether or not it should be called that. Please respond to my argument."

I’m from Virginia and the Mid-Atlantic has a strong sense of self as do other regions, even if there are disagreements inside. The US is far too large to accommodate for the needs of all, and growing partisan divides will be a lot harder to dissolve than past waves with the advent of commercial socialization. 

Take that and consider that the US is an incredibly young country who has only faced one civil war, far less than other states, though it improbable it will will happen in this generation, disunification is inevitable. 

I commonly see people say, well what about states like Mississippi or Alabama who have slower economies and will suffer from divisions. Frankly, the people in the Deep South have no direct correlation to my life in the Mid-Atlantic.

TLDR: The United States should downsize into a European Style of individual nation-states, who share a relatively free trade agreement, a common currency, and standing military. Of course this does not ignore the flaws within Supra-National bodies themselves."

3,2022-11-24,CMV: Parents indoctrinating their children into their religion is an ethical issue that needs to be considered with due seriousness instead of having it accepted as a norm in our modern-day society.,u/Blackmeinster,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/z3ho45/cmv_parents_indoctrinating_their_children_into/,changemyview,"For the most part of our human history, raising a child within a religion has been the norm, and even till today, the birth certificate of a new-born baby has its religious affiliation included in certain countries. Religious affiliation is about belief in a god and the teachings of said god to lead their lives. Unlike race, which is determined by the genetics of our parents, religion has no place in a birth certificate for a literal new-born. Parents should also not be raising their children within their religion as though it is the absolute truth, and it should be considered as indoctrination and brainwashing of the child. At such an age, children are highly impressionable, and those beliefs will be inculcated into them as irrefutable truth. Unlike our studies of maths, sciences and humanities – which are based on rigorous logic, testing and analysis – religion is based on faith alone. I understand that religion is, by its very nature, unable to be tested or analysed. But that is all the more reason why children should not be taught about religion and gods by their parents as truth, as children will simply accept it at the same level of scientific truth, without questioning it. One could argue that children could decide for themselves about their faith when they are older, but I argue that most people tend to be indoctrinated strongly as children to the point that they see it as an absolute truth and subscribe to it all their life. And it also still does not deal with the issue of indoctrinating children to begin with. 

Religion is a part of the culture that the parents and their extended family is a part of, and it is inevitable for a child to partake in it simply by attending family meetups or events. Even so, young children can still be a part of it without necessarily having to be indoctrinated to begin with, as at that age, they will be more concerned with playing with other children or entertaining themselves. Understandably, some children may wonder about it and question it, and in that case, I believe that adults can still share with them about it without pushing their agenda onto them. Anecdotally, I have met a few couples from interfaith bringing their children to cultural and religious occasions with family without having their children be indoctrinated in it while still talking about it with their children, and so it should also be possible for same-faith families to achieve the same. 

Belief in religion should be a personal matter that a person deals with when they are of a mature age and with a reasonably developed cognitive function (teenage and older). Parents can then open up conversation about their beliefs and faith with their children at an appropriate age, and let them decide for themselves if they subscribe to that belief. As an Asian, I have seen amongst friends and acquaintances as well as personally experienced exclusion from family as a consequence of not subscribing to the religion of our parents, and this issue is still rather prevalent in Asia as well despite its modernization over the past couple decades. Due to this mentality of indoctrination and associating religion so equivocally with family to the extent that family ties can be broken over religious differences, it only goes to show even further how damning such a system can be.

I see religious upbringing as brainwashing of impressionable children as it stands, but I am open to have my view changed on it or shown a different perspective on this issue. But I do believe that this issue should not just be accepted as a norm and should be considered as a serious ethical issue that needs to be discussed seriously. 

As an added note, I stand against any form of indoctrination of children, which also includes patriotism towards a country, or about sacrificing oneself for a country, religion or cause etc.

It's hard to draw the line, to decide where cordiality ends and kindness begins, because we live in a grey world so to speak: people can be cordial and kind, and they can vary a lot for a lot of different reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

My point is: the moment you make something a taboo, you're drawing the line of 'end of discussion': people will not discuss about what is beyond the line (note that my point is based on an ongoing taboo and not one that's in the making). 

&amp;#x200B;

Once people stop discussing about rudeness, they'll not question social norms on cordiality and they'll not question what it means to be personally attacked: that is, they'll decide what's rude or not based on something as arbitrary as a personal norm of cordiality. For instance, in my country, you cannot question, propose a discussion or infer a question if that means, in any way, that an elderly person \*can\* be in the wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that, in the moment rudeness becomes a taboo in a social group, people will stop to question what it means to be rude, and they'll believe in something arbitrary, which will inevitably result in people making plain disagreement a wrongdoing: and by 'people', I mean it as a common reccurence to the point it may seem to be a norm."

Once you get there, you wake up at 5:00 every morning because you can't ""waste the day"". You drag the screaming brat to every attraction, still having to keep them entertained, because kids today need a screen in their face constantly. You spend a shitload of money and vacation days making your family miserable for a week, then it's another hellish car ride home. The best part? The day after, you get up and you're back to the grind. Your vacation did nothing but stress you out and waste your money, what's the point of that?

You are physically and mentally exhausted, and you have some ideas of how to improve, but you're not sure how things will work out. Perhaps some negative thoughts begin to enter your mind such as ""why am I not stronger"" or ""why is this specific technique so difficult for me"" etc., but in an effort to maintain good mental health, you tell yourself that it's okay and things will work out, and not to be so hard on yourself. In my view, having this mindset is not acceptable if your goal was to win the Olympics or do anything great, and someone who practices self-love in a situation like this would not be driven to improve. I believe that you have to have to be self-critical in order to improve, and that mantras of self-love actually inhibit self-improvement by giving yourself an excuse to quit or not fulfill your full potential.

But with that said, I think we should also unconditionally respect ourselves and not measure our self-worth based on our accomplishments or success. In my view, pure self-love and self-criticism are fundamentally incompatible, meaning you cannot have both at the same time, and if your goal is to improve in whatever it is that your are pursuing, you should opt for a self-critical mindset over a self-loving one. With that said, perhaps there is a grey area that I am missing here, and would be willing to change my view if someone can demonstrate an example where self-love, self-criticism, and self-improvement are all co-existent."

Except one, but more on that later.

I have seen cigarettes on the ground, on floors, in carts, outside of a cigarette basin. I have worked around people who need to smole on every break or got outside in single digit weather to smoke. I've seen people hold their infant with a cigarette in the other hand. I have seen cigarettes in people's lawns. I have seen smoldering cigarettes left in busy parking lots.

The only person I ever saw put their cigarette back or generally try was my mother. My mother just died from Stage 4 lung cancer after years of smoking despite many telling her to stop. Since then I've found it hard to sympathize with any smokers.

Even her though - her emotional problems I could at least outline and make sense of. There were a lot, very dysfunctional family. And I acknowledge it's unfair because I don't know their story and that's apathy.

Honestly though? I've heard smokers and non-smokers admit they just don't care about the choice they're making. So I don't care about their problems. They're making a decision to do something that affects other people in a very negative fashion. My Mom took efforts to remove herself and even that caused a lot of problems in my fanily.

Some smokers don't give even that much. The sheer amount of cigarette butts you find in any given street, road, or park? It baffles me that the owner couldn't put them back in the box or put them in a bag. 

These people reek of cigarettes. They throw their trash anywhere. They give so little care about others or their environment.

Some of them say they can't quit. You'll forgive my deafness to this, but my father, too, smoked like my Mom did, but he ultimately decided to quit because he wanted to be around for his kids. He hasn't smoked in over 30 years and was in great health whilr my Mom, who never stopped, was falling apart.

EDIT - In other words I have seen thst it is very possible to quit if you care enough to. It's not an inescapable mist that you should be accepted for or coddled out of.

I genuinely feel that empathy is important and there was a time in my life I really sympathized with almosy anybody short of rapists and murderers. But I can't bring myself to understand or sympathize with the psychological bile that seems to emerge from heavy smokers - beyond a chemical addiction that they can't necessarily control.

I used to sit with a coworker who smoked on every one of her breaks, and I used to enjoy talking with her so I dom't feel like I've always been this way.

EDIT - Someone made a good point that in spite of how I feel about cigarette smoking it doesn't make every smoker awful. And asking someone to counter my anecdotal evidence is unfair. I guess that's about where I have to concede this one. Thanks everyone participating and sorry if I didn't answer or delta properly. I have some emotions to sort through."
0,2022-11-24,CMV: Joe Biden is a better president than Barack Obama,u/ottolouis,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/z3xdj2/cmv_joe_biden_is_a_better_president_than_barack/,changemyview,"Far too few people — especially liberals — acknowledge how weak America's recovery was after the financial crisis of 2008. (And for what it's worth, I am a Democrat.) The unemployment wouldn't fall to its pre-recession level until 2016. So the full recovery really took eight years. But it didn't have to be this way. [While the Recovery Act of 2009 provided a stimulus of $800 billion, the economy really needed more like $2 trillion.](https://theweek.com/articles/450788/obamas-stimulus-succeeded--even-small) And Obama didn't try too hard to get a larger stimulus through; he could have vetoed proposals he found too small.

On the other hand, Biden also entered office during an ongoing crisis. He signed the American Rescue Plan, which stimulated the economy with $1.9 trillion. [In fact, the US stimulated its economy by about 25% of its GDP, more than any other developed country.](https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Fiscal-Policies-Database-in-Response-to-COVID-19)

What are the results? Only two years after the recession, the unemployment rate was back to its pre-recession level. The US does have high inflation at 8%, but a large portion of that is from supply chain issues. [This Federal Reserve study estimates that 2.5% of inflation can be traced to Covid fiscal stimulus .](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/fiscal-policy-and-excess-inflation-during-covid-19-a-cross-country-view-20220715.html) But keep in mind that over half of Covid stimulus ($2.2 trillion) was passed via the CARES Act under Trump.

We'll never know what inflation would be without the stimulus, but we can compare American inflation to that of similar developed countries. [It turns out that inflation in the US is lower than it is in the Eurozone.](https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/inflation-rate) What about economic growth? [Well, the US has the highest GDP growth of any developed country.](https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/gdp-growth-rate)

The lesson everyone took from the 2008 was that the stimulus was too small. Underspend and the recession goes on too long, overspend and you get inflation. You're never going to get a bullseye, but as you can imagine, I believe that Biden's efforts in using massive stimulus to guide America's economy out of crisis have been masterful. He's following the advice of economists who learned the right lessons from 2008.

Back to Obama. What were his other domestic accomplishments? He passed the Affordable Care Act, which made healthcare accessible to millions more people. I do believe the ACA remains the greatest piece of American legislation since the 1960s, but other than that, Obama doesn't have much of a legacy. The Recovery Act was weak, and Obama never signed any other important legislation, besides Dodd-Frank.

Biden, on the other hand, was just getting started with the American Rescue Plan. Biden has also signed:

* A $1 trillion infrastructure bill (which Obama and Trump both wanted to get done)
* The CHIPS Act which invests tens of billions of dollars in American semiconductor industry, so we don't have to rely on China for such a vital resource
* The Inflation Reduction Act, which capped insulin costs for seniors, capped out-of-pocket drug expenses for those on Medicare at $2000, allows Medicare to negotiate drug prices (I have no idea how anyone could oppose this), is expected to reduce US greenhouse emissions by 40 percent of its 2005 levels by 2030, and gives the IRS more resources so it can crack down on tax evasion of the super-rich
* Also, Biden even passed some gun control measures (even if they were a little modest)

Now let's talk foreign policy. My view on foreign policy is that the US is effective when it comes to containing violence, but it should not be in the business of regime change or spreading democracy. These are the lessons of the past 30 years. The US military was incredibly effective in ousting Iraq from Kuwait in the Gulf War of 1991, and the US also prevented genocide in Bosnia and Kosovo later in the decade. However, we should have learned from the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars that altering another country's system of government is unwise. So this a pretty straightforward line to walk: Prevent bad actors from doing harm to others, but don't try to undermine authoritarians.

Obama's foreign policy was, unfortunately, a continuation of Bush's foreign policy — not in degree, but in kind. Obama prolonged/expanded the war in Afghanistan by implementing a surge, created a no-fly zone over Libya (look how that turned out), and armed Syrian rebels. In the same way that Bush failed to confront Russia over its annexation of Georgian territories in 2008, Obama didn't do nearly enough after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. In a 2012 debate with Romney, Obama mocked him for taking a hard stance on Russia, and that point has since aged like milk. Although, I do support the JCPOA, so I'll give Obama credit for that.

On the other hand, Biden took the brave position of ending the Afghanistan War. He took a ton of flak for it, but it was clearly a futile project that was costing the US $50 billion annually, and Afghanistan can finally be at peace. Biden made the point that there are many places in the world that have backwards social values, but that's not an excuse for American intervention. That's the lesson of the Bush administration. Also, Biden is arming Ukraine to the teeth.

So, as far as foreign policy goes, I think Biden is nailing it. He's walking the line I want presidents to walk, and is choosing to fight battles that can be won.

In wrapping up, I'll acknowledge that Joe Biden's isn't eloquent or particularly inspiring. And yes, he does slur his words — although, I see no evidence of cognitive decline. But at the end of the day, Joe Biden gets things done. Policy is kind of boring and often complicated, so lots of people don't know too much about what's going on. You might see gas prices rising and Biden stumbling as he speaks, and draw your conclusions there. I've seen a lot people say that they just voted for Biden because he wasn't Trump. But if you pay attention to what really matters, I think Biden has been a fantastic president. I genuinely believe he's the best president America has had in decades.

Obama, on the other hand, was an amazing speaker, and it was easy for people to love him. He was articulate and exciting, and managed to be pretty modest. But other than the ACA, he has no legacy. He failed the American people by passing a weak stimulus, and resigned the economy to a weak recovery that lasted almost a decade. And his foreign policy was mostly bad.

Keep in mind that Biden has accomplished everything with 50 Democratic senators whereas Obama entered office with a filibuster-proof 60 Democratic senators.

So, yes. Joe Biden is a better president than Barack Obama. Change my view."

0,2022-11-25,CMV: Hypocrisy is ok.,u/Cronos988,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/z48tor/cmv_hypocrisy_is_ok/,changemyview,"Hypocrisy, or the allegation thereof, occupies a significant part of political discourse today in the developed world. Perhaps this has always been the case. Recently though, I feel like the ""argument from hypocrisy"" has been the go-to for shutting down a discussion, be it in the way of ""whataboutism"" or more direct personal attacks.

So what exactly do I mean by ""hypocrisy"" here? I mean intentionally or knowingly taking actions that are at odds with your stated moral principles or goals.

Humans, at least today, seem to have a very keen sense of hypocrisy. It is a good way to instantly create negative and, I'd argue, self-defensive emotional reactions.

This is bad, for as I believe, hypocrisy is not just a) perfectly normal, in the sense that everyone does it sometimes, but also b) not on itself an additional moral failing and not a sign of bad character.

In other words, hypocrisy is ok. Not good perhaps, but ok.

Now I said ""additional moral failing"" and what I mean by that is that the actions you're taking are themselves always subject to moral evaluation. If you say that all people are equal, but then treat some as second class citizens, doing that is wrong. But it's not more wrong because you claimed otherwise.

The exception to this is when you intentionally mislead people about your goals or positions in order to mislead them. That, to me is not hypocrisy, but rather lying or fraud. The moral failing in this case is the manipulation of others, not the mismatch between what's said and what's done.

Now, as to the claim that hypocrisy is normal, I don't think that requires much explanation. Being consistent is hard. And it's harder to more stuff you care about. That's not a reason not to try, but it is a reason to be lenient with others.

Second, hypocrisy is not a sigh of bad character. This is because, the people most in danger of being hypocrites are people who deeply care about things. The more things you care about and want to improve, the harder it'll get to do it all at once. You will fail occasionally. On the flipside, if your position is simply that only your own interests and wellbeing matter, it's quite easy to be consistent.

Third, hypocrisy does not make good or bad actions worse. Actions should be judged on their own merits. If I claim I care about animal welfare and then eat a fast food burger, eating a fast food burger is bad. But it's still better to have cared and failed then to never have cared at all.

People seem to make the assumption that hypocrisy is a sign of deception. Proof that you weren't really holding the position you claimed you did. But this, I think, is unfounded. Without additional evidence of intentional manipulation, hypocrisy is not sufficient grounds to conclude that someone is lying or manipulative.

I also think it's very attractive to latch on to (real or perceived) hypocrisy in others to protect one's own self image. But this is a destructive impulse, which prevents you from improving yourself and, on a social scale, fosters apathy and cynicism. 

Thus, I think we should all pay attention to and question attempts to dismiss others as hypocrites.  We should be lenient with people who fail to be consistent, and instead focus on the good (or bad) they actually do, regardless of their statements."

In Season 1 of GoT Ned Stark reveals that the heir to the Iron Throne is a bastard. He is punished by losing his head. The fandom and show portrays his quest to reveal the true nature of the royal heir as a good thing, and his punishment as a bad thing. 

In Season 1 of House of the Dragon, many characters such as  Vaemond Velaryon reveal that the royal heir is a bastard. In contrast to GoT the fandom and show portray this as bad. Vaemond is punished by losing his head. The fandom and show portray this as good. 

It's illogical to treat the exact same situation in two different ways. If you feel that Ned's actions were correct and noble, then you must logically agree with the Greens in House of the Dragons. Instead, vast majority of fans feel the Greens are manipulative and evil for doing the same thing that Ned did. 

I'll address some potential counter arguments:  


\- ""But the Greens are doing it to get power, Ned was doing it out of the goodness of his heart for a friend"" Uh...not exactly. Ned had arranged a marriage of his daughter to Joffrey, a marriage that would secure political power for his house. Whether or not Joffrey is a bastard has a direct effect on his own political power and the power of his house. 

\- ""But Joffrey would have been a horrible king, and so would Aegon"" In terms of poor ruling Blacks and Greens are both pretty shitty to be honest - King Consert Daemon slaughtered a bunch of peasants when he was Gold Cloak commander (and his first wife), ally Rhaenys killed dozens and dozens of civilians just to make a more dramatic exist, and Rhenyera herself stated ""who cares about \[the common people\]"" 

\- ""The royal line is all just made up so let's put the better person in there"" I 100% agree - So why does Rhenyera and her bastard children get to rule? Surely there is a small folk with better ethics and skills to rule than either Greens or Blacks."

I believe Begum should not have had her British citizenship revoked. I'm American but I've been reading up on this situation, and I'm deeply against the Reddit consensus on this issue. My stance is that giving the government the power to mess with people's citizenship, even a bit, opens the door to a wide variety of human rights abuses. It may be an unsympathetic character in Begum today, but it could be Just Stop Oil protesters tomorrow. The British government has shown through recent laws that they're okay trampling the right to protest. Giving them extra power over citizenship is just begging to be abused against political opponents.

On a more philosophical note, I find it giving the government the power to abandon its own disturbing. Once you have citizenship you should be considered 100% apart of that country, you should no longer be considered a guest like someone on a visa or residency. Removing it because of political convenience or because the citizen is an unsympathetic character undermines that purpose and makes second class citizens out of those entitled to another passport. Begum should have never had her citizenship revoked and it should be reinstated, effective immediately. CMV!"

In addition I am glad Halder was incompetent because it conclusively led to the defeat of Germany.

My view that Halder was a terrible general is predicated on his objectives for barborrossa. Most significantly his insistence on Moscow and Leningrad.

I am of the opinion that Moscow, Leningrad and the north in general did not hold strategic significance where opportunity cost is involved. In other words the resources needed to take these objectives far outweighed the significance of meeting the objectives.

Instead I believe that the swing south in Ukraine was the right thing to do. I also believe that instead of focusing on the north they should have committed most resources on Grozny and Stalingrad (essentially do case blue in 41). I believe that typhoon was a waste, and at most should have just acted as a diversionary attack.

My central reasoning for this change of objectives is that oil is the central factor for Germany in 1941 (even as far back as 1939). Additionally Napoleon proved Moscow has no significance."

659,2022-11-25,CMV: Some sports have subpar scoring frequency when it comes to entertainment value,u/Tommyblockhead20,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/z4puvr/cmv_some_sports_have_subpar_scoring_frequency/,changemyview,"In summary: in some sports, scoring happens to often, while in others, scoring happens too little. I feel it makes them less entertaining than they could be. 

When scoring is frequent (ie in Basketball) this makes the excitement when scoring pretty low. It only really matters right near the end (unless one team has pulled way ahead, then they never really matter).

But some sports go too far the other direction. Soccer is a prime example of this. Goals are absolutely a big deal when they happen, very exciting. But since they are so rare, they often never happen. [On average, nearly half of all games, 1 team never scores. 8% of the time, neither team scores.](https://footystats.org/stats/common-score) so far in the World Cup (which is what inspired me to finally post this), 60% of games, one team never scored, and 25% ended 0-0! That is just seems objectively less entertaining to me than if they scored a few more times per game. There should always be at least some scoring. 

**edit: a ton of soccer fans are getting confused. I’m not saying more scoring is good. I literally said the exact opposite in my second paragraph. My issue with low scoring games like soccer is sometimes the score is so low, nobody scores, which seems fundamentally flawed to me.**

I feel the sweet spot is scoring an average of about 4-8 times per game. It means there probably is some scoring in the game, but it’s not so common that scoring becomes significantly less exciting. I sports like Hockey, Baseball, and American Football fall into this category.

So do sports like Tennis and Volleyball. They solved the problem of frequent scoring with sets. It guarantees there are 3-5 exciting moments when one side wins a set.

For sports with low scoring, there’s a variety of easy ways to slightly increase the score without breaking the format.

Unfortunately, it’s hard to change sports now since humans are very adverse to change, but if we could go back and influence the creation of these sports, I think they should have been done differently.

They are tacky and weird and I feel like the point is to draw attention, the last thing I want in fashion is to wear something tacky to work in an office I want simple, cute and chic. I know I know….some people like the different and “innovative” I’m sorry but you are wrong, if things keep progressing like this I will forever miss the classics and the classic vintage look of 90s fashion. I think a little innovation is good but everything from clothes to bags is just so bland and odd looking there is no in between. For example, I’m purchasing a ferragamo bag that is not sold anymore. I went to look at the online store and the bags are all just odd and the leather work is bland and it looks like corners were cut and they put a weird design on them. I liked 2 of the bags, I could see one or two of them being a nice piece for an outfit, the others are just odd shapes and designs. The older ferragamo is simple, elegant and the craftsman’s ship is very nice. People used to take pride in the things they created, what happened.

Edit: there is one trend that has ruined fashion for me. The branding, I get that a lot of designers get ripped off and copied but it ruins something to have a logo all over it, it’s tacky as hell, that’s why I love most ferragamo, it’s implied and they have a trademark design and not everyone recognizes it but the people who are into fashion will and it’s so simple. I love that dior bags you can take off the charms most of the time(this was more common with vintage bags, now less common). When things are branded you can’t mix them together in an outfit, I if I have Gucci frames and a Versace chain and a Prada bag it’s looks tacky as fuck and it’s awful, the subtlety is just gone.

If you think my opinion is bad or You think I’m saying I’m the god of what’s good and what’s, thats fine,these are my opinions of you disagree change my mind god dammit. Don’t virtue signal me and say “oh well what qualifies you to say these things”…nothing, this is what I think of you disagree show me what you like that has been trending recently from designers that were around a long time and we will compare what they made then and now. That’s a lot more fun, my post is specifically designer (“luxury” items made by well known designers) if you got nice shoes at Payless, great they have some nice shoes this is specifically for people who have strong opinions as well and who disagree. I kind of changed my mind on the early 00s as well a lot of it is bad and I hate it but 90s and 80s are fire."

1. Let's say a college student has to pay tuition and receives a scholarship for 500$. They were going to pay for that tuition (exceptional conditions excluded) regardless, so this scholarship, in a sense, wasn't 500$ for tuition, but 500$ *cash* (for anything). Why? Because once the tuition is paid, regardless of whether the scholarship was limited to tuition or just a briefcase of money, the college student still ends up with 500$ more at the end of the day than they otherwise did. When you receive a scholarship for 500$, then, you've basically received 500$ cash.
2. Imagine two more scenarios: in the first one, you get a Toys R Us gift card, and in the second, you get a Walmart Gas gift card. In the Walmart situation, let's assume you were going to buy gas no matter what. You were going to lose 20$. The fact that you saved 20$ by using this gift card means you ended up with 20$ more than you otherwise would have. Thus, you've essentially been handed a 20$ bill. For the Toys R Us card, you were **NOT** going to buy anything from there, and, as a result, you were handed a Toys R Us giftcard — NOT 20$.
3. Here's where it gets tricky: if Bob's sister has 20$ and she can buy either drugs OR gas, I would argue that giving her money, no matter what, is subsidizing her drug use (/addiction, to make the point clearer). If she spends the 20$ on gas and then asks for 20$, Bob would say nah I'm not paying for your drugs. This is the same thing, in my mind, as her asking for 20$ up front for gas, because now she was allowed to buy both gas and drugs, when she otherwise wouldn't have. Assume she spent the 20$ on drugs instantly and then asked for gas money, I would argue that you're still subsidizing the drug addiction, but its maybe the moral thing to do (if, for example, she needs the gas to go to work, and it's either ur indirectly responsible for supporting her drug addiction at that moment, or you're responsible for her getting fired, which will probably make everything worse than it would be otherwise). I would distinguish accountability (limited-use, narrowly-intended money, such as a gift card for gas or scholarship money) from morality (whether it's actually the right thing to do to give said person money).
4. And this brings me to donating to charity. A way to imagine this is that giving someone or something money isn't, like, you can follow that specific 20$ bill to its destination, but rather it is absorbed into a larger collection of money, which means you can see your 20$ as going either to someone's gas or a bottle of alcohol. This same logic would apply to charity: the money you donate is just going into the (likely wealthy) CEO's pockets, rather than to the cause you actually intend it to go to. I can also see, however, the money going to CEO's pockets, replacing the same quantity of money donated by someone else, and thus, regardless, the money you donate goes to the intended cause because your money merely displaces the CEO's income and moves the older money into the cause; THEREFORE, indirectly, your money went to the intended cause. The problem there is that I'm not sure how this conflicts with the rest of the logic I've put forth. Scholarship example: they give 500$, you imagine the money going towards drugs, which lets assume it would, and instead the optional leisure money is going towards like a ball pit. The drug money that already exists is being displaced and thus the money provided by scholarship is going to scholarship. 

Essentially, I think the logic is consistent between '20$ gas gift card = 20$ cash' and '20$ donated to charity = 20$ donated to CEO,' which means either you're helping the CEO buy a new car, or the 20$ giftcard is *just* a 20$ limited giftcard, and not 20$ cash. I'm tempted to lean towards the idea of 'donating is just giving money to CEO' to maintain the consistency of gift card argument which I think is strong, but that seems intuitively wrong.

Not going to name drop because that's the point of this post. You can easily rattle off 5-10 people I'm referring to, but just assume you are right and carry on.

Celebrities, rich people, and politicians are at a point in society where they are often addicted to having their name trending in the news and on social media, and being controversial and ridiculous is the best way to ensure this happens. Main character syndrome is exhausting to see, and I'm tired of my entire internet feed being plagued by it from famous people who I couldn't possibly care less about.

Opponents of their agenda plaster screenshots of their quotes everywhere, and then they rip those people apart in the echo chamber comment sections of their choosing. Why? To validate yourself?

That's some weak stuff. If you actually want to shut somebody up, stop talking about them entirely, and stop using their products (if relevant). If you can't do this, you are the problem.

This applies only to hollow, meaningless banter that is not *truly* dangerous. I understand politicians and rich people have power to be dangerous, but them getting in a petty online fight hardly qualifies as such. Think 2 or 3 times whether or not their words are *actually* imminently dangerous.

edit - this is slamming the echo chambers of people who make these idiots famous, not necessarily the idiots themselves."

The latest statistics on gun deaths seem to be that there are a little less than 20,000 intentional homicides per year with guns in the United States. In context, that number doesn't even come close to the top 12 causes of death in this country.  Chronic liver disease kills twice as many people, the flu kills 2.5 times as many people, diabetes kills 4x as many people, accidents including car accidents kill about 8 x people per year. I am a Democrat, but in my mind gun control is merely a progressive culture war issue, similar to trans panic coming from Republicans, and given the actual numbers of deaths, just isn't a serious issue worth political energy. If we cared about saving lives then time and energy is much better invested into healthy eating, mental health, and crime prevention and criminal justice reform, and it seems like this only becomes an issue because we tend to fixate on horrible and shocking stories that reach the news.  Maybe it would be wrong to say that this isn't a concern at all, but it is honestly a top 100 concern and priority for me, not a top 20 or 10. It is an issue that gets a progressive few excited but alienates many many voters and will ultimately accomplish nothing. Interested to see any other viewpoints, change my mind."

**All of this applies to old people as well.** 

But in our society, you cant really tell old people that they are being a bit silly and they need to listen to you because you know better.   
Example: I come to my parents' flat and it's completely dark in there. Mom opens the door and *I can't even see her face*. So I'm like, why is it so dark in here? And they say, well you know light wastes electricity. Yea, but a 10W LED bulb kept on wastes 1€ of electricity per month. You can afford 1€ of electricity. You can afford 10 even. And do you really wanna fall over in the dark and break a hip? How much is *that* going to cost? But this logic just doesn't come through. It genuinely feels worse than talking to children, because at least with a child, when all else fails, you have the good ol' ""because I said so"". This is not acceptable with old people, and can be seen as disrespectful.

Also, they keep falling for stupid phone scams, and scammers know that old people are much more likely to take the bait.

So my view is that there should be some kind of legal protection here, something like you cant sign some contracts without a third party, or at least it should be socially acceptable to step in when you see your elderly relatives acting against their best interest, without it being seen as meddling in their affairs.

Of course this could be exploited, just like terrible parrents can exploit their children, but that doesn't mean it's bad in principle."

A lot of people have spoken about how something uncomfortable can be typically evil, but justified because of the circumstances. I don't believe that the act would be evil at all, or require any justification or absolution if the circumstances required it.

This still might not be a great way of wording it, so bear with me.

Hey all, me and my girlfriend were watching an episode of TV last night and it prompted an interesting discussion.

An alien scientist has fled to an western town. He has helped the town however he can, but one day a cyborg shows up seeking to kill him. The town won't hand him over so the cyborg tries to starve the town out.

Its discovered that the alien scientist is a little bit more of a mad scientist. He kidnapped an uncertain number of people (implied to be in the thousands) and forcefully turned them into cyborgs, many dying as part of his experiments, because a genocidal alien race was invading his homeworld, and had allready wiped out half of the population. Once the project was complete, the genocidal aliens were pushed off the world in less than a year.

This cyborg was one of his experiments, and wants revenge, and the episode centres around ""Can this mad scientist be reformed"".

And thats where I take objection. I don't believe the scientist did anything wrong. He did what was nessecary, and there is absolutely nothing wrong about that. If not for his actions everyone on that world would be dead. In fact, I'd argue its straight up morally good, and to spare yourself the uncomfortable feelings and not do it would be the truely evil decision."

1224,2022-11-26,CMV: People who value designer goods and labels just want to show off their wealth to others,u/DannyRicFan4Lyfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/z5imyg/cmv_people_who_value_designer_goods_and_labels/,changemyview,"Okay so I know this sounds like a “duh” kinda post but I was talking with some friends about how I’m not at all impressed by designer stores and wearing things with designer logos. In my eyes, I think I would rather save or invest the $5K people use for LV bags. Or, I would rather donate a set amount to charity or really change a person’s life in some way. I think the craftsmanship argument could be valid, but there are many not as well-known designers, or logo-free items, that are of the same craftsmanship level or better. The purpose of buying something like an Hermes Birkin is because you want the world to know you can afford that. I think it also depends on the item. The quality and craftsmanship of a car for example, something you drive every single day and if it breaks down you could be in danger, is a separate consideration. I highly doubt these people buying Birkins are using that bag every single day until it rips apart. I for example live in leggings. I’ve had so many over the years that just didn’t hold up, poor fabrics, poor construction. Will I buy leggings from other stores? Yes. But I’ve found the craftsmanship is the best from one designer store, and I feel justified because I use them daily, AND, no one can really tell it’s from there unless i wear a crop top or something (which I never do). If it didn’t have the logo and it was the same patented fabric type, I would still buy it. 

Perhaps it’s how I grew up, but from a young age I never liked how people would notice things first before me. Too many times as a kid and growing up, people would just assume I was broke or whatever by looking at me, because I’m a private person and not obvious, and they would act condescending; upon visiting my home for whatever reason, their tune would change, and I HATED it. I hated that reaction and I felt it showed their true colors and what they really valued in a person. I like people who I can be myself around, even in a Walmart tshirt and jeans and who aren’t impressed with my clothes/accessories/material goods. I would also rather be healthy and physically fit/athletic and wear Walmart clothing than out of shape and in designer. I understand the high fashion argument, and if some people are just into fashion and want to spend their money that way, just because they like that stuff, fine. But idk, they wouldn’t get the exact same pair of glasses if it had no logo and they didn’t know it was from that particular company, you know? 

I think it’s all about what you prioritize in life. At the same time, I realize it’s judgmental to feel this way, and I have friends who do love this stuff who are wonderful people. CMV: people who wear designer goods plastered with logos, or designer goods that are obviously identifiable as designer, do so to show off their wealth."
0,2022-11-26,"CMV: I have failed the scientific community, and I have failed my nation.",u/Real_Carl_Ramirez,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/z5irzb/cmv_i_have_failed_the_scientific_community_and_i/,changemyview,"I have had to withdraw from my PhD position. During my Confirmation of Candidature, the panel pointed out that they cannot confirm my candidature because I failed to display multiple skills necessary to do a PhD. My 2 options were to downgrade or withdraw, and the downgrade involves completing a lot of work in a shorter time. 

I signed up for a PhD position in the first place so that I can help scientific advancement. The fact that I have failed to exhibit the necessary skills means that I have failed the scientific community. Sure, I have completed a Master of Research 3 years ago, but that's too far back to count now. On top of that, I had very supportive supervisors and team members, yet I still managed to screw it all up.

As for the ""I have failed my nation"" bit - [Australia has a low and still falling rank in the Global Innovation Index](https://www.ussc.edu.au/analysis/australia-the-united-states-and-the-threat-of-inefficient-innovation-failure-to-launch):

* Considering [Australia's severe lack of economic complexity](https://thediplomat.com/2022/03/australias-lack-of-economic-complexity-is-a-problem), and high wages making us uncompetitive, innovation is especially crucial to get us out of this rut. Me failing to contribute to research means that I have contributed to our failure to innovate, and our failure to improve our economic complexity.
* Growing up, a small proportion of my classmates resented Indigenous Australians for not taking responsibility for their lack of innovation making their demise inevitable. Such logic horrified me because I realised from an early age that this logic can be used against us by more innovative nations.
* Before you tell me, ""dude, you're Filipino Australian"", my point still stands. My failure also reflects poorly on my ethnicity.

So now I'll start looking for a new job. But there will be no reason for anyone to respect me, nor will I demand that they do (unless I do something to earn it of course). I have practically min-maxed to divert all my energies to developing as a scientist, so I have no other redeeming features. 

If you're wondering why I'm so hard on myself, it's for 2 reasons:

1. If I stopped being hard on myself and just became content with my life, I would probably just play computer games during all my waking hours.
2. If the shoe were on the other foot and I encountered someone being the dud that I am now, I'd be really hard on them too.

Don't worry, I'm not going to kill myself. I refuse to kill myself (even if I should) because it would be a waste of my unlikely survival of a car crash."

I've spent my life in several different 1st world and 3rd world countries and the standard reasons for strict immigration didn't make sense to me.  


Vetting criminals and would be criminals - One of the 1st world countries(Country A) I lived in had extremely strict laws and harsh punishments regarding criminals, contraband, weapons and immigration yet it practically does nothing to stop crime. There is an entire district in the country that is basically a black market that criminals thrive in, selling all sorts of weapons and contrabands. In fact, if crime does happen, it is often on a far more gruesome scale than any other country. Ironically, Country A is internationally known for their strict and almost ridiculous laws. In my view, it has only stopped the non-criminals, those willing to work along the lines of written law to gain entry into the country. To me it seems like criminals always have a way no matter what was written on paper. In fact the wealthiest, who can outright bypass law through expensive loopholes, are often criminals and criminal enablers.

  
Our humanitarian cause - We as a species pride ourselves in our empathy and rightfully so as it has brought us this far, from us as cavemen huddling together, helping each other out, to the last few hundred years when ideas of individual rights, freedom and autonomy replaced backwards ideas such as feudalism and serfdom. If our empathy is what made us the dominant species in the first place, why forsake it now; for example, the standard for an asylum seeker is to deceive the recipient country to gain entry because if a recipient country KNOWS the true purpose of entry, they are thus denied entry. That or they spend time in their home country which is dangerous since they are seeking asylum in the first place, going through a humiliating, adversarial and convoluted process to gain a ""humanitarian permit"" to gain entry into a country. Isn't this system of distrust and deceit flawed and unproductive?

  
The threat of mass immigration - I feel people tend to overestimate a 3rd worlders' eagerness to move to a ""better place"". People are bound by things like family, culture and most people are unwilling to move unless their home doesn't let them stay. Why would a 1st worlder worry about mass immigration from every single corner of the world when majority of the people are not detached enough to migrate into an entirely new country. From my experience, people of other 1st worlds are more eager to move, especially from Country A I mentioned earlier because of how suffocating their law was despite the notion of ""higher quality of life"". In the 2 third world countries that I've lived, majority are unwilling to move due to family, convenience and disinterest in learning and adapting a new culture. The most mobile people, set aside financial reasons and based on just pure desire, are always and will always be 1st worlders.

  
A country's security and welfare - If criminals, criminal activity and such are enabled so easily despite the laws and control put in place. What purpose does a strict immigration that many countries in this world have, serve? It feels like it just stops those earnest people who has genuinely lost their home and are desperate to continue their life. That or people who were born to be part of that country, who has an innate attachment to it and are willing to learn to adapt and be part of ""the tribe"".  
This all seems so... exclusionary, mean almost... no entirely. Not only does strict immigration not serve any purpose, it feels like some sort of a messed up roleplay with toys we call VISAs and the game is to navigate convoluted bureaucracy intentionally designed to have the most losers.  


Wouldn't it benefit us all to have relaxed immigration laws internationally? Please prove me wrong."

I want to specify, I am not trying to avoid work, and I am not trying to say there is no personal benefit to doing work. I'm trying to figure out why grading can be based on a rubric of academic criteria (understanding, argumentation, use of vocabulary, &amp;c.) but then a submission can be considered a automatic failure solely on the basis of previous submission status, regardless of whether it meets these criteria. It seems to be largely inconsistent with the overall philosophy of grading, which is why I can't understand the rationale behind these policies.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The university I attend just gave their freshmen anti-plagiarism lecture, and I find myself particularly troubled by their ban on what they refer to as double submission, which they define as turning in the same work (paper, essay, poem, presentation &amp;c.) in more than one class. I fail to see any real problem with doing so.

Teachers normally have a issue with plagiarism principally because it violates a belief that what you put down are is authentically yours; that is the whole basis for grading work in the first place. You cannot evaluate someone's skill or attentiveness unless their work is representative of their academic prowess, which naturally requires their work to be their own. This itself is enough to make plagiarism academically inviable, but this does not carry any sort of moral implication about 'cheating' or the like. Plagiarism fails to fulfill the intentions of an assignment, and thus does not belong in schoolwork, ethics aside.

Just because a work is submitted multiple times by the same person, that doesn't mean it cannot be used as a basis for assessment. Practically speaking, each teacher can grade the assignment independently of each other according to their own specific criteria, and still have it fairly represent the academic prowess of the author. It is not misconduct at all, nor is it laziness, nor is it cheating, nor is it any of the other derogatory things teachers like to call it. You asked for a sample of my writing, I am giving you what you asked for. Judge my work by the worth of the submission, not by some contrived sense of personal morality that has nothing to back it up. You can grade my work perfectly fine, don't refuse it to satisfy your ego.

There is also nothing unique about double submission that cannot be said about single submission. If I was able to repurpose a work from another class, what is stopping me from submitting an essay I wrote on my own free time for its 'first submission'? If that is allowed, than why is it not allowed a second time?

It is not laziness, because that whole notion rests solely on the assumption that I was trying to avoid work. I am not avoiding work— I have done the work, and have likely still spent more time on the assignment than some people that you *are* willing to grade. How is this being lazy at all? Even so, laziness is hardly an academic measure— Some people might only spend 20 minutes on a final paper and still get a good grade, despite that being obviously less time than the teacher would have preferred had they known about this individual. There are going to be lazy people in every class that get good grades, so that is simply not something that a teacher should or even is logically able to disqualify a double submission for.

Teachers cannot argue grades on the basis of ethics. All that matters is whether they can be graded as a reflection of the skill and knowledge of the submitter, and on that account double submissions are perfectly reasonable. What am I missing here?

Edit 1: Assignments are not graded on effort, personal growth, or ethics under normal circumstances. They are purely graded academically, while double submissions are graded ethically. This is the discrepancy that makes absolutely no sense. If you grade my neighbor 's work according to a rubric, then you should use the same rubric for everyone, regardless of your opinions on their ethical responsibilities.

Edit 2: Some have pointed out that a few teachers do grade based on progression, so in that case it is important that work be recent from the time of submission, and that is completely fair in my opinion. I think that most teachers don't grade that way however.

Edit 3: If you are repeating a course and submitting work again would result in the whole course being meaningless, this is an extreme circumstance that would mean double submission is rightly forbidden. If you failed a class the first time, then doing work again is a reasonable punishment.

Edit 4: If writing and art classes measure your average performance, than being able to deliberately cherry pick submissions you already know will do well based on their past submissions is sort of unfair and will throw the data off, which is a reasonable justification for requiring new work for every submission. When classes are only concerned about your understanding of facts, then the assignment should be graded chiefly on whether those facts are presented in the assignment, and not worry about whether they were presented in the assignment yesterday or two months ago."

I would suggest that freedom of speech doesn’t exist and cannot exist, every community has restrictions on speech and has done since the beginning of history, and each  community has punished people who have Strayed from what is deemed to be acceptable either through the death penalty, imprisonment or social ostracism and shunning.
I also don’t think anyone is actually interested in applying so-called free speech principles consistently, only when it benefits their own arguments and worldview. 
I also think there are certain ideas and values which are just so abhorrent that the expression of them should be curtailed and banned.
Often people refer to John Stuart Mill‘s marketplace of ideas and suggest that freedom of speech is necessary to get at the truth, but I would say that even mille himself didn’t extend his consideration to Catholics who he thought were addicted to censorship and so it was okay to ban their speech, and also he said that people should be educated."

Let me be clear, I think both are wrong. But if you think one is but the other isn't, what is the necessary condition?

This post is about one cannot be wrong but the other is ok.

So if you think both are wrong or both are ok, this post doesn't apply to you. I'm also not talking about the sex alone. I'm talking about purposefully having sex to procreate. That is, you have sex and agree that if a pregnancy occurs you will try to take it to term, birth it and raise it until whatever legal adulthood age.

Now, people can bring up numbers. If incest results in the 50% chance of genetic defects, if that's your only base, then any genetic defect that has the same change to be passed on should apply.

Edit: In both scenarios everyone is consenting. So if a muslim believes god wants them to fuck their first cousin, it's not wrong if genetic fucking with consent isn't wrong either.

Also edit. For the people saying I wanna fuck my family. That does not contribute to the discussion. i also mentioned I think both are wrong. Incest is wrong. But I'm the bad guy for saying the same genetic disabilities shouldn't be passed down"

I do not personally support either position, and I am not interested in debating either individually. But I do believe that the two are compatible. 

Being anti abortion means that you believe that a person begins life (at conception), with a right to it.

Being pro death penalty means that you believe that a person can use their free will to forfeit that right (e.g. by taking someone else's life). 

I find these two positions compatible. (Though again, I support neither)

However, believing that you can forfeit your right to life, to my mind, requires that you also be able to waive it (i.e. consent to be euthanised), since both of them require that the right to life is not inalienable (i.e. that there are circumstances under which it can morally be taken away, specifically as a result of their individual choices),

And this goes with every other national team like Switzerland who has lots of people with non-swiss origins.

It is absolutely right that they choose to represent the country who literally taught them football and invested on them, making them footballers.

If they were to choose their country of origins there would be nothing wrong too, of course.

But saying that France is stealing other countries's talents it's false.

Who says that Mbappé, if he was born and raised in Camerun, would have find the right conditions to grow and become a football player? Nobody.

It is absurd to me because, it's almost like saying that those countries are so unlucky because their talents are born overseas. It doesn't make sense.

Those countries have plenty of talents too, they just have to improve their system when it comes to football and making their talents grow.

So, to me it's not unjust if a player with foreign roots chooses to represent the country where he was raised and became a football player."
6,2022-11-27,CMV: the current structure of academia (USA) with respect to grad students and research labor should be revised.,u/quantum_dan,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/z66cy4/cmv_the_current_structure_of_academia_usa_with/,changemyview,"**Edit: view solidly changed**

* At this point I'm still arguing that it would be a good idea, but actually pushing the change through in the nearish term is not feasible, so ""should be revised [in the near future]"" has changed to ""revisions should be encouraged when and as feasible in the long run"".
* Full change of view: a competitive salary for an *average* (not just starting) researcher is more like the cost of three or more PhD students, and it's not feasible for one full-time researcher to replace that much labor, so the finances don't work out.  I'd still argue for some tweaking, but that level of dependence on full-time researchers would require significant changes to funding as well, etc, which is well outside the scope of what I'd proposed.

**Edit to clarify**: I'm not suggesting *eliminating* grad student labor, just *reducing* it and shifting some over to full-time employees.

In the context of the university strikes lately, something that's been coming up on academia-focused subs, at least, is the need for piles of grad student labor, and in particular the need for that to be cheap because tuition and so on makes the total cost so high (edit: to be clear, I'm not saying this is a valid excuse for unlivable stipends, where applicable).

And this always brings up another issue: the current structure of academic research requires hordes of grad students, who dramatically outnumber the available academic jobs.  Most of them do fine outside of academia (I'm not arguing against the value of a PhD), but if a majority come in on the idea of an academic career and then the jobs just aren't there, that's a sustainability problem.  There's also the issue of students leaving at the end, which creates an incentive to get people to stick around as long as possible, which isn't in their own interest.

All of this is to say: it doesn't seem to be in anyone's interest for academic labor to be heavily dependent on grad students.  It's expensive for faculty (at least relative to the paycheck), a nontrivial fraction of the labor is done by trainees who aren't very good at it yet, and it makes it very difficult for students - who vastly outnumber the available openings - to get an academic job.

I would argue that it would make much more sense to reduce the number of graduate student positions and transfer much of the work to professional researchers and lecturers.

The exact details aren't critical to my view, but in case we need a rough ballpark for discussion, I'd suggest taking on something on the order of 4 PhD students for every academic job opening (assuming that half won't graduate and half of the rest will intend to go industry or government - those appear to be reasonable estimates from a cursory search).  Currently, the US graduates about 200k PhDs per year and there are about 800k full-time faculty, so assuming a 30-year faculty career this is about 8 PhDs per full-time faculty opening, which means about 16 new students per opening.  My version would suggest shifting to something like 1:2 faculty:(researcher/lecturer) and about 3/4 the new PhD students, so 12:3 students:openings compared to the current setup.  This would require each researcher/lecturer to do the equivalent work of 2 PhD students (RAs or TAs, respectively), which I think is entirely plausible.

Advantages:

1. Faculty would have more experienced research labor focused wholly on the research projects in question (no coursework, no dissertation).
2. Graduate students would have a reasonable chance of getting an academic job, especially with much more positions available as a researcher or lecturer (vs just regular faculty).
3. Research funding would not have to cover the researchers' tuition for professional researchers.
4. Professional lecturers could plausibly be cheaper (per class) than TAs, since they would handle several courses.
5. Distributing what would have been the extra cost of more PhD students across the remaining students and full-time employees would allow solid wages for the full-time employees and more reasonable pay for the remaining students.
5. Academic careers could, for those so inclined, be wholly focused on research or teaching, so a dedicated researcher wouldn't be forced to teach if they wanted to do academic research.
6. A graduate degree would be worth more, since there would be fewer of them.
7. The grad students in a research group would have access to some mentorship from more professional researchers (the full-time researchers), which is a great way to get detailed technical advice and so on.  [My research group sort of does this with the postdocs/further-along PhD students, and it works great.]

For context: this is a case of ""seems fairly obvious to me, but I haven't done much digging and I don't have much insider knowledge, so there's a good chance I'm wrong""; I can't point to specific likely challenges, but I'm reasonably sure they exist.  To clarify where I personally am coming from, I have a few years of academic (engineering and applied science) research experience and am starting a PhD, but do not plan on going into academia, so the availability of academic jobs is not personally relevant."

I'm not under any pretense that this is novel thought - I think Kant's good will is the origin. I think an action can only be called virtuous (indicative of good character) if that action involves acting against your intuition. To give some examples:  

 * The non-bigot is not automatically more virtuous than the bigot if the non-bigot has never felt the urge to act in a bigoted manner. Perhaps the bigot is showing better character of patience and tolerance than the non-racist in holding back his true feelings. You can only tolerate what you dislike.  
 * The liberal who ""tolerates"" offensive views is not more virtuous than the progressive who refuses to do so if the liberal is not grossly angered by the bigoted view in question. You can only tolerate what you dislike.  
 * The progressive who ""doesn't tolerate intolerance"" is not more virtuous than the ""tolerant"" liberal if the progressive is angered by the intolerant view, and is acting upon that anger. You can only be righteous if you incur risk to either your wellbeing or reputation by ousting someone.
 * The monogamist is not necessarily more virtuous than the cheater if he has never been strongly tempted to cheat. Honesty is only a virtue if you are tempted to lie.    
 * The pacifist is not necessarily more virtuous than the warmonger if the pacifist has a strong intuitive distaste for all forms of violence. Non-violence is only virtuous if you wish to act violently.    

To push the boat out a little bit, I'd even venture that these views are not even useful as signaling devices. I don't think it's possible to infer any information regarding virtue solely from a viewpoint alone. You might get utility points for a view that reduces harm, but it's not sufficient to infer character. For context, I also like to think from a self-critical perspective that these views are not self serving. I fall into most of the camps that in contemporary western liberal politics would assign me a property of ""virtuous"". I am not racist, nor have I ever felt the desire to be racist. I oppose nationalism and warmongering because I was bullied as a child and therefore dislike violence. I ""tolerate"" offensive views in those around me because I intuitively want to try and change them.  

I'd like this view changed in particular because I find myself frequently at odds with feminist and progressive activists. I consider myself a feminist, but some of my behaviors (in particular the oft-criticized centrist style of tolerance) are not aligned with these ideals, and I would like to reflect on these values to self-improve."

I get there is a level of embellishment here to sell a foul in favor of your team but that’s not what I’m talking about. There are many many rough falls in a soccer game that anyone would need a minute to recover from but many Americans right off as “dramatic” or say soccer players are weak. If those critics would let me knock them over while they’re in a dead sprint they’d be hurting.

I think Americans have this opinion because for one most have never played a fast paced competitive game of soccer and also because American contact sports are played with padding and a different expectation of physicality (American Football &amp; Ice Hockey).

Baseball, no contact.

 American football is played with pads and every player knows when to expect a hit coming. Very physical, very very tough dudes but played with pads. Also linemen start from a stationary position. Just saying. 

Hockey dudes, are also crazy tough. Like freakishly tough. I’m not even talking about fighting. Puck to the face, back the next game. Just whack. 

Basketball is a joke. There is bumping, backing down, posting up but embellishment is so baked in and so annoying. More arms flailing over a light wrist tap in basketball then getting knocked over in full sprint in soccer.

There’s also rugby. Pretty much football and soccer with no pads. Fucking nuts.

Soccer you have no pads to protect from getting knocked over while running full speed. You have no helmet to protect from getting head butted. You get stepped on by cleats. You get pushed and elbowed from behind. Soccer is a lot more tough then most Americans realize.

Anyway mad respect to all athletes who play for our entertainment while we critique their toughness. The top athletes in every sport or far more fit, strong and talented then I could dream of. But imo Americans should not judge the sport they don’t understand."

* I was horrified to learn that in the last 5 years we've introduced factory farms here in the UK. 20% of cows now live in intensive farms ☹️. Fuck that noise, something should be done.
* I learned that deforestation is the
* I also found out that these PR pricks are trying to say the lab grown meat might be vegan friendly, but they get the stem cells by taking them out of the spine of a living cow (probably a little calf ☹️). I think I liked it better when I thought it was foetuses.
* I still think these companies don't care about ethical meat, or honesty. Nobody mentions where the stem cells come from because their real product is *the idea of ethical meat*. I still don't trust them.

__Here's the original post in its full ignorant glory:__

They say lab grown meat uses 7% more energy but only produces 15% as much emissions, uses 0.2% as much space and 1% as much water. That sounds great. But I'm kinda skeptical about these claims, and the environmental benefits of lab grown meat compared to sustainable farming. 

The examples given always seem to compare the USA where things are egregiously wasteful; feeding corn grown with fertilizer to factory cows. 

Here in the UK we leave cows grazing on hillsides and marshland where we can't plant crops anyway. The space saving is nonsense because it isn't used anyway. I guess we could grow trees on it if you prefer woodland to hillside, but it's a natural habitat of the species that live there.

Building factories in cities is orders of magnitude more expensive than pasture. All money represents work done by someone and that work involves burning the planet. I would be surprised if factory space is less than 500% more expensive to develop and maintain than an empty field. So I'm pretty sure that the land use is misdirection.

Cows here mostly eat grass, or silage over the winter. This is raw material produced very locally using solar energy then harvested and processed by the cow itself. How much of that +7% energy cost have they compared to grain grown for cows to eat, the fertilizer, irrigation and so on? To compete surely they'd also have to produce sugars locally using solar power? 

The water largely falls out of the sky, I'd be interested to know if they've actually looked at what fraction of water is pumped from the domestic water supply in the summer heat or they've just looked at how much a cow drinks a day. Because when a factory drinks water, 100% comes from the supply, and pumping and purification etc has an energy cost. Rainwater in a trough doesn't.

So I seriously doubt there's a water, space or food saving. I strongly suspect that the energy cost is hugely understated, it's much more than 107% compared to free-roaming cattle because the baseline is inflated by water, food and fertilizer costs that only exist in factory farmed beef.

Now emissions. Half of the emissions of cattle comes from comparing methane to co2 over a 100 year period; it's 30 times more warming but only lasts a decade or two while co2 lasts much much longer. But surely 20 years down the line the amount of methane reaches equilibrium? As long as the number of cows is stable, it's a fixed overhead. So why do we even consider methane from livestock to be a greenhouse gas problem? There's no growth in the equation! Do these scientists not know basic mathematics, or is it their press management that makes them look incompetent?

It'll be tech companies that make this meat. They'll ship materials in from the cheapest supplier using transport subsidised by cheap fossil fuels. They'll refrigerate and ship their products around the world from hubs in a few locations, locations owned by the IP rightsholders and their shareholders. They are unlikely to grow their meat from local grass.

They'll use the usual set of powerful PR and marketing techniques to guilt the population into choosing their product even if it isn't ecologically friendly. They are amoral. It'll take money out of the hands of farmers who, at least here in the UK are custodians of the countryside and the ones who actually care about the natural world and know how it works, and put it into the pockets of shareholders.

And finally, the cows will be gone. The species that saved us from death by tough titty, that we symbiotically co-evolved with, that gave us adult lactose tolerance will first be raped for their stem cells in labs en masse, and then eventually be replaced by a vat of microbes. I'd prefer cows to chew their cud, enjoy the view and occasionally escape and trample someone's rose bushes. On the whole I think the big stupid oafs live a pretty good life in exchange for us eating their young, and (unlike the fate of chickens) their existence makes me happy. Extinguishing them for the glory of technology will be a sad event.

Have I got this completely wrong, or can I see through the deception?"

My parents seemed very in love when they were younger and over time they’ve reached a point where pretty much the only talking they do is to insult each other. Additionally, I’ve had close friendships that I thought would last a lifetime fade as we both changed as people. I haven’t had the most positive experiences but I know that they can exist. 

Still, fundamentally, I don’t understand why people get married. It seems like marriage is a promise to love and take care of someone for the rest of your life. But how can someone really promise that? Love is a feeling people experience, you can’t say you’ll feel the same way about someone/something forever. If I made that promise to someone, it would feel dishonest. You can’t really control your feelings either, you can choose how to react to them, but not how you overall feel towards someone. It’s entirely possible that you could stop loving your spouse several years into marriage.

Also, people definitely change overtime, to the point that they can seem like completely different people. What if you simply grow into people who are no longer compatible? What if the person you married changes into someone different? Can you really still say you love them? 

Again, I know that people can have positive lifelong relationships in marriage. And if any of these things did happen, they could get divorced. But getting divorced takes a lot of time and energy, and can be really difficult. With all these uncertainties, why take that chance in the first place?"

I didn't want Democrats to win everything, so It's not like I was blinded by false hope Democrats would hold both chambers. 

Now that the election has happened, it's clear that the polls failed to take into account young voters and the polls were off in Democrats' favor. It's also clear that Democrats were very enthusiastic in 2022. Yet, despite all that, Democrats *still* lost the house (currently Republicans have 121 seats and it's possible they'll get 122), barely won the Senate, and badly lost several key Governorships. 

Democrats celebrated because they only lost the House and barely kept the Senate. But this wasn't 2010. Democrats and young voters were extremely fired up this year and they turned out in massive numbers. Given the numbers advantage, it seems to me Democrats should have been competitive in Texas and Florida and should have performed much better in key House races. But they were destroyed in Florida and Texas. 

In the days leading up to the election, the big questions were: 1) are the polls accurate 2) how enthusiastic are Democrats and 3) how will independents and undecided voters vote. 

The polls were not accurate (underestimated Democrats), Democrats were very enthusiastic, and many independent voters voted for Democrats. Yet Democrats still suffered major losses. 

So I'm not sure how the 2022 midterms were a victory for Democrats given the circumstances. If anything, this election shows that Democrats can turn out in huge numbers, Democrat voters can be very enthusiastic, many Independent voters can vote Democrat, and the GOP- even a GOP that many feel is a threat to Democracy and fascistic- can still be competitive and win.

185,2022-11-27,CMV: Pet ownership should require a license,u/hellhellhellhell,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/z6hee7/cmv_pet_ownership_should_require_a_license/,changemyview,"Pet ownership should be seen as a privilege, not a right. In order to own a pet, a person should be required to undergo some level of pet owner education (akin to driver's ed) and pass a test to ensure they are familiar with things like leash laws and how to care for an animal. Just like drivers are taught to watch for children darting out into the street in school zones, pet owners should be taught to be especially cautious around children who may harm or be harmed by their pets. 

Pet breeders should be required to have an additional license with further education requirements (sort of like CDLs). 

Obviously, for people with service animals for disabilities who are incapable of taking a test, the requirements would be somewhat different though I haven't thought about specifically how it would be different. My initial thought is that service animals should be licensed on the provider's end and treated more like medical equipment--though I'm not totally decided on this aspect of the licensing scheme. 

If someone's pet dog (or boa constrictor or chimpanzee or minotaur) attacks someone and the owner runs away rather than help and exchange information with the victim, the owner should face similar penalties to hit-and-run drivers, including license suspension (and mandatory surrender of any pets), court-mandated pet owner training classes if they hope to ever earn a license to own pets again, and a hefty fine.

This more so applies to developed countries more so than developing countries sadly enough.

My biology teacher also mentioned this issue in 2010.  He said that since pandemics used to occur roughly every 20 years, anyone too weak would die early. Therefore they would rarely pass off weaker genes. Now he wasn't arguing to go back to those days, he was arguing we should not be shocked by these events.

My view currently is despite medical advancements, we are a weaker species than we were 100 years ago.

Edit: I am NOT arguing for people getting killed by the government, and not being allowed to reproduce.  I am NOT saying this should be official policy. As my biology teacher said, ""don't support eugenics,  or make these ideas policy, just don't be surprised by what I mean by ""weakening"".

Edit: Weaker does NOT  mean what the Third Reich was preaching. Neither does stronger in this case. It means biologically speaking. (If an alien species was to study humans this is what they would likely say about humans vs apes). Secondly, intelligence is why humans have spread around the world, but if we kept the intelligence of apes currently, I doubt we would have made it this far or would still be in Africa.   I was afraid this would be poorly translated into writing.

Edit: My view has been changed, but the point missed was that our intelligence is key to our survival. My original view was made by ignoring the intelligence of humans. Just looking at the biological view. Seen as if an alien species would not know about human intelligence, just looking at our biology. "

I tip wherever I go because I’m aware employees that make tips make less than minimum wage depending on location, but I believe consumers should not have to make up for the lack of pay workers get from their employers, big or small business.

 I believe if you are willing to hire someone under your business, you should also be willing to compensate them accordingly for the services they provide and not leave it up to the consumer. I hear the argument “if you don’t have enough to tip, you shouldn’t be eating out in the first place” a fair amount. 

Imagine if every service you required demanded tipping to compensate employees. Gas station workers, fast food workers, let’s get even more specific and say trade workers and essential service workers. It would be considered much more of a nuisance and a much bigger outrage would come from such a thing. To some around the world, dining out is a luxury rarely afforded and tipping the underpaid worker makes it that much harder for a family to enjoy a once in a quarter meal to enjoy because a company is being greedy with their money.

Perhaps I am missing the basic structure of the tipping economy or I have gotten the wrong memo, but I believe you should have enough finance to fully support your workers, small or big business."

Some of the headphones I've used (both over ear and in ear earbuds) get dangerously loud at max volume. It could cause serious hearing damage if you turned the volume up to maximum and were ""trolled"" so to speak, by a video with deliberately overly loud volume. I think there should be some warning or safety standards regulating the maximum volume of headphones. It's too easy to accidentally hold your volume up button and have it go to max. There should be a warning at, say, 70% volume that stops you and asks if you're sure you want to go higher. CMV"

I often feel very confused where to stand with certain political issues because every side tends to be so strongly opinionated and have their own studies and statistics that they use to support their views. Take the trans debate for example. (Note that I'm fully pro-trans) The pro-trans side have their own strong points, opinions and studies that validate their side and prove that the other side is the wrong and bigoted one, the side that I belong to. The anti-trans side also have their own points, opinions and studies that validate their side and say that the other side is the wrong and mentally ill one, the side that I strongly believe is wrong. 

Although, I'm all for trans people but recently, after ""What is a woman?"" and the amount of support it got really made me think. How do *I* know which side is spreading an agenda and which side isn't? How do *I* know which side is cherry picking scientific studies, using flawed data etcetera to pust an agenda and which side isn't. I feel the same way about abortion (I'm pro choice), race/gender issues or any political debate for that matter. How do I know which side is more right which side isn't? I don't know if that's even possible."

Whatever scanners/testers/etc. the big, totalitarian government (who is paranoid of information moving around) has, have to be fooled into finding no information there, and to detect it as the disability-helping device instead.  The people's ability to buy or create anything that carries GB of information could have been clamped down on by this government.  A downtrodden people might be stretching their limits to even have home computers that can hold GB, let alone a device as discussed.  Some governments now control the internet, search phones/devices, as is...and so on...
2. You can do a lot with the right few GB of information.
3. The human brain is NOT a great storage device to keep information perfectly.  Johnny's device couldn't hold all the data, and his brain had to be used.

It just feels like a good chunk of the population is so bent out of shape because of the Trump presidency. It’s like their just stuck in that mindset. I couldn’t understand it when he was president. I felt that it was a super extreme reaction. That said, it was more understandable than it is now that Biden is in office. Not to mention that all the controversial social/political topics we should be focusing our energy on, instead of just hating the orange man. I am aware that not everyone is like this, but it seems like it’s enough people to be a roadblock in our countries progress towards equality and freedom.

0,2022-11-29,CMV: Biden should resign his term early and allow Harris to become president.,u/onomatopoeiahadafarm,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/z87gj6/cmv_biden_should_resign_his_term_early_and_allow/,changemyview,"I think Biden should resign from the presidency before his term ends to allow Harris to become president. I think this would be politically savvy, and *potentially* good for policy regardless of politics.

(1) Biden already made history by paving the way for the first female Vice President and the first Asian American Vice President. Fulfilling his vision of being a “transitional President” and stepping aside to allow Harris to break the “final” glass ceiling would also be a significant legacy for Biden as well as Harris. I think the history-making nature of a Harris Presidency would afford Harris a significant amount of political capital in the short-term. I recognize that Harris’ approval ratings are currently underwater, just like Biden’s, but I think hers are much more elastic than Biden’s. I think that Harris could use that political capital to eek out at least one or two modest incremental legislative accomplishments in the next two years, which at the moment looks like one or two more than Biden could accomplish given the sentiment among Congressional Republicans.

(2) House Republicans have made it clear that they intend to investigate Biden’s family in the next session of Congress. I don’t doubt for one second that they would still pursue these investigations even if Biden resigned, but I think a Biden resignation would box them in and further highlight the absurdity of their investigations and their waste of taxpayer dollars, especially to investigate a family that would no longer hold political office.

(3) To me, it would make the most sense if Biden resigned in \~February 2023, to allow Harris significant time to serve as President while also giving her room to run for two full terms if she wanted to. But I think it would still be a meaningful symbolic gesture if he resigned later in his term. For example, if Biden ran for re-election and lost to a Republican in the general election, I still think it would be significant if he resigned \~December 2024 and allowed Harris to be President.

(4) If Biden resigned early, it would give Democrats time to hold a competitive primary election. Of course, this would also apply if Biden simply announced that he isn’t running for re-election, but a resignation would be a clean break that allows for Democrats to criticize Biden’s Presidency as needed.

The only weakness I see in this view at the moment is that I don’t doubt for one second that Congressional Republicans would try to obstruct anyone Harris nominated to be her Vice President, which would mean that Kevin McCarthy would be the de facto perpetual next-in-line for President, and which would mean that the Senate would be perpetually without a tie-breaking vote. Maybe House Democrats could successfully pick off some sane House Republicans to support a discharge petition (if that applies for a Vice President nominee confirmation vote?), but it would still be expensive in terms of political capital.

Thanks for reading. Please CMV.

Comments which demonstrate how Biden’s resignation would actually be damaging for Democrats politically, or damaging for policy purposes - as opposed to how this action would just be no better or worse than Biden serving out the remainder of his term (just “neutral” or a “wash”) - will be most likely to change my view.

Comments which debate the likelihood of this scenario will probably not change my view, because I already concede that it is unlikely.

Edit - Stepping away for a while, thanks for the discussion so far. The main response I'm seeing is from Redditors who insist that Harris becoming a ""backdoor President"" would somehow reduce the significance of the milestone. I'm still not convinced. She was elected on the same ticket as Biden, and it can't be a shocker that voters considered a scenario in which she might have to assume the Presidency if Biden wasn't in office, for whatever reason. To me, she would still be the first woman president, full stop. That's not to say it wouldn't be another accomplishment when the first woman is elected on a ticket where she is at the top of the ticket - to me, it's possible and good to recognize both (distinct) accomplishments at the same time."

In the United States, drunk drivers kill over 11,000 people each year, with roughly 17% of those accidents being caused by teens, and the majority coming from middle-aged men. The only other two countries in the world with this many alcohol-related traffic deaths are South Africa (drinking age is 21+) and Canada.

The country I would focus more on is Canada- where the government allows individual provinces to set their own drinking laws. Before the passage of National Minimum Legal Drinking Age in the United States in 1984, this is one of the major issues that lead to the formation of organizations like MADD (Mothers against drunk driving) that lobbied so heavily for the passage of NMLDA. Mismatched ages across state lines lead to ""booze runs,"" where teens would drive (often already intoxicated) to neighboring states with lower drinking ages. (e.g. The State of Arkansas has had a drinking age of 21 since the end of prohibition, but from 1971-1984, every single border state (MO, TX, LA, TN, MS, OK) had a minimum age of 18-19. You can see where this is going.

Drinking policy needs to be uniform across the country, and it needs to be lowered. The problem is not just that 18-20 year olds are incapable of making decisions, the problem is that we as a society have failed to teach them how to drink in a mature and responsible manner.

I'll give the example of Germany, a country where a 16 year old can drink weak alcoholic beverages and an 18 year old can drink harder beverages. Germany has a prolific drinking culture and understands the importance of teaching younger adults how to drink responsibly.

A study was done where a group of teens from both countries were asked two questions: had they consumed alcohol in the 30 days prior, and had they consumed enough alcohol to intoxication in the same time. In the United States, around 19% of teens admitted to drinking in the time frame, while 11% admitted to drinking to intoxication. In Germany, nearly 67% admitted to drinking in time period, while only 8% admitted to drinking to intoxication.

Another comparative statistic is the drunk driving accidents. Remember that 11,000 deaths from earlier? That's about 31% of all traffic-related deaths in the United States. In Germany, alcohol-related traffic deaths account for about 9%. (I will concede, Germany has a much better public transport system than the United States)

This brings up the point I am wanting to make: The solutions we have to prevent alcohol related deaths do little to solve the actual problem. We have a problem of culture, not a problem of ignorance. As a country, we need to do better with introducing and educating teens and young adults to alcohol and teaching them how to use it responsibly.

Anyone who has ever attended an American High School or University knows that underage students who want to drink are not going to be stopped by their age. Fake ID's, older friends, and lax (or unknowing) parents continue to supply minors with alcohol who with little to no experience with how to handle themselves. An introduction to alcohol at a younger age also means teens feel more comfortable talking about with adults about responsibility and proper care of friends and themselves.

This also does not account for the blatant National Security risk Fake ID's have in the United States. The more teens who order false identification (which often come from China), the more experience foreign countries have in producing authentic-looking US ID's.

According to the NIH, about 4% of all alcohol consumed in the United States is consumed by underage  youth, with about 90% of all alcohol consumed by youth being ""binge drank."" I understand the risks that come along with granting kids access to a substance they have little experience with, but nearly every risk factor used to back the claim the age should be 21 is backed by the statistic of binge drinkers. Why can't we as a society allow youth to drink at a younger age in more controlled environments and education our kids on more responsible use like the majority of the western world? It seems strange that in the land of free, we allow 18 year olds to vote, pay taxes, serve in the military, and own a gun, but in order to have a drink they have to commit a felony. My view is that we should have a tiered system, like Russia or Germany instead of a flat age, and that the MLDA needs to be uniform throughout the country to prevent the booze runs of the 1980's.

**EDIT**

A point I forgot add in the original post is that there are people far more intelligent than I that can far better sum up this issue: I introduce to you the Amethyst Initiative.

[https://www.theamethystinitiative.org/statement/](https://www.theamethystinitiative.org/statement/)

The Initiative has 136 signatories from University Presidents, Chancellors, etc who are calling on Congress to reevaluate the drinking age in the United States.

These are people leading some of the most prominent, largest, and prestigious schools in the country. From Duke to the University of Maryland, Ohio State to Dartmouth, these institutions agree something needs to be done. A full list of signatories is below:

5,2022-11-30,CMV: Mainstream environmentalism' refusal to acknowledge the utility of nuclear energy in fighting climate change is not a product of ignorance but rather an attempt to gain support for a cause that only makes sense to those who believe the environment should be protected outside of our own benefit.,u/Miguelinileugim,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/z8mxwm/cmv_mainstream_environmentalism_refusal_to/,changemyview,"Nuclear energy has one big upside, and that is, it reduces the consumption of fossil fuels which cause many environmental ills. The most relevant one being their contribution to climate change, which is harmful for humanity and planet alike.

However, it does have several downsides, namely:

\- The potential of an environmentally destructive disaster.

\- The production of hard to store nuclear waste (which may leak and pollute the environment under extreme neglect).

\- The pollution caused by the extraction and processing of uranium.

From a purely human standpoint, I believe these downsides are not really that impactful:

\- Modern nuclear security makes even large scale incidents like Fukushima take a very small toil in human terms, but not necessarily so for nature.

\- Nuclear waste can be stored very cheaply given that its volume is minuscule. Even if nuclear plants had to pay for centuries of storage in advance, they'd still the profitable. However that waste may be handled centuries down the line.

\- The contribution to climate change from the extraction and processing of uranium is minimal relative to using any fossil fuel as an alternative, this cannot be said of other forms of environmental impact caused by it.

It is very sensible to me that, should we argue purely on human terms, nuclear energy would be a very tempting tool to help resolve climate change with nearly no downsides for us. However, when accounting for the environment in itself, nuclear energy may be less than ideal when cleaner forms of energy exist. Even at the cost of making the fight against climate change harder, harming humanity for the benefit of the environment.

The vast majority of the public see the environment as shared property to handle responsibly at best, and as a resource to exploit to its fullest at worst. Mainstream environmentalists would likely be inclined to disagree, seeing the planet and all within it as worth defending even at our own expense.

I believe this fundamental disagreement has led to these activists to completely avoid the topic of nuclear energy or to frame it in an unfairly negative light. Manipulating the public as to get them to support a cause that largely only benefits the environment when a fully informed public would've taken a more pragmatic, human-serving and environment-neglecting pro-nuclear approach.

Most environmentalists, as happens with every political cause, tend to defer to the consensus rather than educate themselves fully. I believe this to be natural, acceptable and even relatable. It follows that most of them do buy into anti-nuclear half-truths and their take on the matter is likely one founded or at least informed by ignorance. This, however, cannot be said for those who are educated enough to know better, yet choose to perpetuate an intentionally distorted narrative for the political benefit of their movement.

I am extremely appalled by the cynicism in this behavior, and its willingness to mislead the public to support something they do not believe in. This has led me to develop a fanatical disdain for the environmentalist movement, which until very recently I thought was caused by my perception of their anti-nuclear gaslighting as a product of ignorance. It instead being a product of cynical political manipulation makes me even angrier. My thoughts will change if I'm proven wrong, but I can't guarantee my feelings will. CMV."

I know that this is generally considered as a very racist thing to ask but I just can't see it. This is why:

* The question is clearly intended to ask about someone's heritage. This is something that many people are proud of, to the extent that they will describe themselves as a hyphenated nationality - Italian-American and so on. Someone my age, in my country (the UK) who is an ethnic minority is demographically likely to be a first or second generation immigrant. I don't understand why effectively asking where someone's parents are from is racist. People ask me where I grew up all the time and I don't regard that as offensive. I enjoy telling people about my background. How could it be offensive? 

* I lived overseas for a number of years and was asked twenty times a day where I was from. I never once felt that was a racist act. It was a curious act.

* I can understand that some people will ask the question with a racist intent - as in, ""well, fuck off back there then"". But I think that's rare. In most cases, as with the Buckingham Palace incident, its just someone trying to make conversation with someone they don't know. That can be tough to do and so you pick on easy topics. What do you do for a living? How was your journey here? Isn't the weather terrible? Where are you from?

* I know that the obvious counterpoint is that it singles people out on their ethnicity and implies they're less British. But...isn't that true? Someone whose family came here thirty years ago is quite literally less British than someone whose family has lived here for hundreds of years. If I moved to Australia, I'd be less Australian than someone whose family came over on the First Fleet. I just don't understand why that's offensive. The only way I can see it being offensive is if the person takes that to mean they're somehow inferior for being less British. Which makes no sense to me at all. Being British or Ghanaian or Mongolian or whatever doesn't make you any better or worse than any other nationality. National heritage and your culture are part of who you are. Why is it racist to ask about that?

I genuinely don't get it."

0,2022-11-30,CMV: Saying that toxic masculinity exists and therefore hates men is a strange leap in logic,u/donotholdyourbreath,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/z8sz1u/cmv_saying_that_toxic_masculinity_exists_and/,changemyview,"Edit: my point is to challenge the people who cry about how everyone hates men now, how you can't be a man anymore etc. Few are actually saying this. 

My view isn't to agree with them but to understand the logic. The logic makes no sense. 

I want to make it clear, I also don't care if we do or don't use toxic masculinity. You can say its a flimsy phrase and useless. Sure. I can agree to that. Or I don't. I don't care. That distracts from the topic at hand. 

I've criticized trad wives plenty of times. Many people have criticized trad wives plenty of times and how these people need to stop being obsessed with their uterus or thinking that birth is the only thing that makes people feminine. This has been often said as toxic femininity. To tradwives, that is what they perceive as to be feminine. And its negative. So, toxic femininity. Yet no one claims this is a hate on all women. Yes there will always be sexists who go see women do this bad thing therefore I hare women. But you cannot conclude they hate women just from their criticism of tradwives. 

Similarly, when people talk about a lot of bad things men do in the name of what they think it means to be masculine, you can't draw conclusions on whether the person hates all men or not. we can even remove the word if people are so hung up on it but the part remains the same. Doing x because you think that's how men should behave is toxic.

For example, let me show you an extremist. ""As I man, I am allowed to fuck my wife whenever I want. Marital tape is a stupid thing"". Again whether you agree or disagree with the point is irrelevant. I criticized his attitude that is almost exclusive to men. How does that make me hate all men?
If I criticize womens behaviour exclusive to women. How does that make me hate women? That makes no sense. Does that mean all my criticisms means I hate everyone? 

For many others, the issue is that they say for all the claims of toxic masculinity there are no examples of positive masculinity. But, I see just as many positive ones. For example, Men admitting they were wrong. Men being doting father's. Just see all those wholesome YouTube videos titled usually under ""funny baby videos with dad"". Men going to the gym. Men being a loving husband. All these are examples of positive masculinity. 

If you are saying all you see is complaints of toxic masculinity and thats why you believe society hates men that's on you. I think these people wanna see the world like that to justify their hate for women. as mentioned I see plenty of cute and funny videos that is about mens ""role models""

when people finally complain about long attitudes about bad behaviours, that's not saying they hate all. 

If I said I didn't like one scene in a movie that doesn't mean I hated the movie. I could say overall, the movie is good, but the sex scene was awkward. 

My point is, the part does not make the whole."

26,2022-11-30,"CMV: For the kind of movie that The Super Mario Bros. Movie is, Chris Pratt is a decent choice.",u/ThatIowanGuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/z8vcgv/cmv_for_the_kind_of_movie_that_the_super_mario/,changemyview,"I want to start out saying that ideally, all major animated motion pictures should have a cast comprising of almost entirely voice actors. I think the practice of hiring “movie stars” or people known for on camera work for the principal cast of animated movies is bad and a harmful practice to the industry. That is not my argument here.

With The Super Mario Bros. Movie being one of the many examples that go against the ideal listed above, the choice of Chris Pratt for Mario is not a bad choice. Chris has had 3 animated movies prior to this, as well as a few smaller bits of voice work here and there for various shows and video games so this isn’t his first time in that role. Even on camera, Chris is a very animated person, the kind of energy needed for voice work.

Lastly, there is a certain charm that comes with hearing an actor you know voicing a character. I really enjoyed the second trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie hearing Jack Black’s and Charlie Day’s voices coming out of Bowser and Luigi respectively. What I have heard from Peach is fine. It feels like they purposefully reduced the speaking time for Mario in the trailer because of the public backlash, but out of what I heard, it was decent. Not the same kind of ear tickle that Black and Day are bringing to their characters, but definitely not bad in any sort of sense. I wish we could hear more than what we have from Pratt/Mario.

Anyway, maybe as an avid lover of movies, animated works, and Mario games, I could be wrong about the casting choice. It’s probably not the best, but the public focus on it like it’s the worst is very undeserved."

I use reddit, Twitter, discord, Pinterest and YouTube regularly. I used to have TikTok but deleted it. Even though I don't have that much, I still use them a good bit. (Phone screentime is anywhere from 6-9hrs daily) 

Use twitter as an example, I genuinely do not get the hate around it, for me it's an amazing tool to keep up with YouTubers I like, politicians, news, or just funny accounts. There's that bad experience every now and then but that's just the internet. 

Social Media has never gave me depression, or made me wanna commit suicide or anything. 90% of the time, Social media has just been a fun thing that i really genuinely enjoy. 

I wanna say none of this applies to TikTok, TikTok is the only social media I actively dislike. It shortens your attention span and is straight up Chinese malware, but that's not what this post is about.

Delta: I'm just lucky, my experiences don't correlate to everyones. Just because I don't have any bad experiences doesn't mean everyone does, and it can be seriously bad for the people who do have bad experiences."
0,2022-11-30,CMV: Breaking Bad is overrated (and not nearly as good as comparable shows like The Wire),u/chadtr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/z8wqjr/cmv_breaking_bad_is_overrated_and_not_nearly_as/,changemyview,"Warning: Breaking Bad and The Wire spoilers.

I just finished watching Breaking Bad for the first time (I know, late to the party).  And I have to say that I was unpleasantly surprised.  It didn't live up to the hype, and I feel like I must be missing something.  Here are my basic problems with the show:

1. Walt and Jesse both have incredibly thick and obvious plot armor, reducing the stakes of the show.  Time and time again, they escape from scenarios where they obviously should have been killed through implausible dumb luck.  Setting aside the last few episodes, the only major character killed on the show is Gus Fring.  Contrast this to, say, The Wire where every character is in peril and many are killed off.
2. The show is meant to be all about Walt's change/descent into evil.  But there's not really that much change -- by the end of the third episode, Walt is already a murderous drug lord.  Other than Walt, the other characters are all pretty static and uninteresting. 
3. Everyone describes the show as featuring a lot of moral ambiguity.  This isn't true.  Walt is an evil character from the very start.  His journey is predictable, and his motives (greed and ego) are not very interesting.  Compare this to the much richer moral world of The Wire where you witness the much more sophisticated and compelling moral evolution of characters like Frank Sobotka, Tommy Carcetti, or Michael Lee.  The murder of Wallace is ten times more emotionally gripping than anything in Breaking Bad.
4. The writing on Breaking Bad is incredibly sloppy and the writers rely constantly on implausible coincidences from the beginning to the end. For example (and I could give dozens more).
   1. Walt goes on a ride along to bust a meth lab coincidentally run by his former student, who coincidentally is out of the lab at the moment of the bus, and coincidentally is seen running *only* by Walt.  The last one is especially bad and fits into a theme where the DEA on the show is unreasonably incompetent.  No one is watching the outside?
   2. The fallout from Combo's murder is a huge part of Jesse's story, but it's also totally coincidental.  It's just random luck that Andrea's brother killed Combo (and also that Jesse meets Andrea when he does and so on).
   3. Hank's story is largely defined by shooting Tuco, which again is a random coincidence.  Jesse just happens to have lojack on his car -- which never comes up before or after -- leading Hank to Tuco's where he arrives at exactly the right moment.  And then the writers just ignore the LoJack forever after.  Hank was investigating Jesse.  Why doesn't he ever get a warrant for Jesse's LoJack location history? 
   4. Hank ends up discovering that Walt is Heisenberg because he coincidentally grabs a Walt Whitman book while on the toilet.  Walt is super careful, so why would he randomly leave something like that tying him to Gale around? It makes no sense.
5. The DEA is shockingly incompetent and for no good reason (at least on The Wire, incompetence always has a cause).   Perhaps the most egregious is in Season 2, when the DEA thinks they're about to take down Heisbenberg (but are actually arresting Jimmy, the fall guy paid by Saul).  Even though they're about to take down a major suspect, they only bring a single car and watch from a single spot, leading them to miss Jesse and Walt's intervention.  No one is that sloppy.
6. Different activities swing from very easy to very hard depending on nothing.  In Season 1, Walt and Jesse with zero experience as burglars are able to easily steal a barrel of methylamine without getting got.  By the end of the show, stealing methylamine is borderline impossible and requires Ocean's 11 level sophistication.  Similarly, Jesse (who has no relevant skills) is easily able to make meth as well as Walt does just from watching him.  But on one else (other than the skilled Gale) who watches Walt/Jesse can learn the trick.  It makes no sense.

Bottom line: The show is sloppily written and utterly unrealistic.  But people love it, so what am I missing? CMV."

Now, more seriously : I know that there are famines around the world that are happening because of natural disasters (like floods for example) or because of war, or because it was deliberately forced upon a population. But there is a kind of famine that we have been seeing in every international charity ads and school geography books for 50 years. Yes, I am talking about that decimated African kid with flies all over the face, and his 11 brothers and sisters. From all the documentaries and pictures on the subject, we can clearly see that nothing can grow where they live. The soil is dry and have been so for the last 500 years. Why do they keep living in deserts? In western civilisation, you can find inhabited deserts like Las Vegas, but those places were created knowing it was possible to bring food and water there. If, for some political reason, Las Vegas became a place where you can neither grow food/get water, nor have it brought there, I am certain the inhabitants would go live somewhere else.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I'd like to add the example of the homeless in western countries, who live in cities and not in deserts

Edit2: I  know it's complicated to relocate people even within their own country, but the way I see it is that it's either that or western countries have to send tons of food *forever* because the situation will obviously never get better, especially considering climate change"
0,2022-11-30,"CMV: From a purely religious perspective, there's nothing wrong with China's official churches",u/RandomTW5566,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/z91xjx/cmv_from_a_purely_religious_perspective_theres/,changemyview,"If you're not familiar with Christianity in China and the government's stance thereof, there are basically two kinds of churches.

The first kind consists of ""official churches"" where the government regulates all activity and controls who gets to serve as staff (as is the case for all religions in China). The officially sanctioned Chinese body for Protestantism is known as the Three-Self Church, or the Three-Self Patriotic Movement (三自爱国运动). The officially sanctioned Chinese body for Catholicism is known as the Catholic Patriotic Association (中国天主教爱国会). When you or people on the internet you follow are traveling through China and see a church building at a busy street corner, it's usually either one of these or a non-operational former church building.

The second kind of church, ""house churches"" or ""basement churches,"" take place secretly in people's apartments, etc. They are considered illegal in China, and over the years (but especially from around 2017 onwards), many of the larger ones have been shut down by the government, and many of their leaders have faced arrest.

Now, this system has seen extensive criticism and scrutiny over the years. I've heard many commenters address and question the state's right to control religion, and they seem to maintain this notion that the official church has somehow been ""brainwashed"" by communist doctrine, that they worship Mao and Xi instead of the Lord, and so on. Indeed, much of the aforementioned criticism seems to be of political rather than religious or theological in nature. I wonder how many of them have even been to China even once. If you actually go to one of the official Chinese churches, the experience is pretty much the same as just about any other church in the world: they play worship music, they give sermons, they join in prayer. And if we look at what the Bible says, I don't think there's any biblical basis to rejecting the official church. If you observe them rather than just hearing about them, it's pretty clear that they're worshipping the same God as churches in other countries do. One more thing, Denmark and Iceland also maintain government control of the church (and Norway did until fairly recently), yet I see far fewer people complain about those.

For reference, although I've never lived in China, I'm a Christian, and I have relatives who do live in China (including some official Christians), whom I've visited many times. Now, if I traveled to Hong Kong/Macau or a different country and learned about Christianity there, and if I wanted to join a church when I returned and knew about both the ""registered"" and ""unregistered"" options... I'd rather choose the registered option than risk putting my life, my career, and everything I own on the line for an offbrand church with only 20 people which might not even last a year. (Potentially helpful analogy: would you rather rent/buy/buy tickets to see a movie the legal way, or pirate that movie off of some shady ad-strewn illegal website that probably contains viruses and will just get DMCA'ed before long?)

(Please note that this post is about the official churches, not the Chinese government in general.)
