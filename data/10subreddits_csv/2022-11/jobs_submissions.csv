1,2022-10-31,What would you do with this offer?,u/burningshiiit,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yit90q/what_would_you_do_with_this_offer/,jobs,"Crossposted from /r/careerguidance

For context, I am in Manitoba, Canada. P. Eng. with 6 years experience.

Currently work as a Project Manager/Engineer making $88,000 + performance bonus (~7%). Unlimited over time (last year I got paid out 360 hours worth of OT), therefore lots of weekend work. 3 minute commute to work. I am on track on making $105,000 this year. In 2021, I took home $110,000. I like the work I do but it sometimes can get pretty hectic. Company had a downturn this year so we were weathering the storm (less OT, less projects).

I got an offer for $102,000 + performance bonus (~14%) + long term incentive (~7%) for a much bigger company. Same job function, but different industry (O&amp;G). My commute to work will be a lot more at 25 minutes one way (recently bought a house so relocation is unlikely). I don't know much on the overtime but I figure will be a lot less.

I am torn, is the additional commute worth the ~16% bump in base salary? Should I negotiate the offer for more money? During my virtual interview, I indicated a range of $125,000-135,000 so this low ball offer of $102,000 is quite discouraging. To be honest, I can probably settle at $115,000 so should I counter offer at $120,000?

Should I take this offer and ask a raise from my current employer (note: company is weathering the storm this year)?

Any advise would be helpful! And sorry if I have crossposted"

I am a recent graduate in mathematics from the best university in my country, with a high GPA. I am worried as I can't find a job, I have sent at least 15 job applications on LinkedIn since last week in positions where mathematicians in junior positions are requested and in most of them I have been rejected and in the rest I haven't heard back yet.

  
I feel this is mainly because I only know how to program in Python and have no work experience, therefore I don't know what I should do, I don't get a job and therefore I don't get work experience and I get rejected precisely because I have no work experience and the cycle repeats itself.

  
Lately I have seriously considered doing a couple of specializations on Coursera but I don't know if this will really give more value to my applications,

I’ve been trying to assist my dad with finding a different job for the last 3 years to no avail. He is a very hard worker but it seems he has gotten the short end of the stick and I don’t know how to help him. If I was to count how many jobs we’ve applied to, it would be over 50 applications. These include sites like SnagAJob, Indeed, and directly on the county websites. His main focus has been county jobs since that is where he has a Master’s Degree in - Criminal Justice Administration.

A little context to the situation:
My dad worked at a Juvenile Detention Center for 15 years before the family moved to TX for my moms job. He was hesitant to leave, but he felt that the family needed him so he moved. Now he is miserable. He is not making the same amount of money as he used to and any attempts to get promoted is shutdown by the county he works for.

I feel so bad because this is the man that brought us to America for a better life and has always been able to provide.

I’m not sure if he is getting denied because of age or what, but I’m feeling as frustrated as he is because I’m the one that helps him apply for these jobs.

My last resort is now Reddit. This community has helped me so much in the past that I’m just hoping it can help me help him. 

Does anyone know of any Criminal Justice jobs in Houston TX or something in the Criminal Justice field? 

At this point we are desperate. He called me today to try an apply for a mail carrier position at USPS and I just felt so sad. For a guy that worked hard to get a Master’s Degree just to get shit on…unbelievable.

Please, anyone out there?"

Hey everyone, I'm updating my resume because it hasn't been done in a while plus I need to find a job. I'm up to the last part which is updating the introduction. My current resume intro is very IT-focused which is ok but I feel it needs a little toning down. My aim now is to go for sales roles and to go for IT roles if anything good comes up. 

This is the current intro for the resume:    

**I am proactive and continuously strive for excellence and positive change to increase efficiency within the workplace.** 

**I am insightful, mission-oriented, and result-driven and have an exceptional knowledge of essential IT systems, functions, troubleshooting and hardware diagnostics. I am extremely versatile and tactful with exemplary interpersonal skills, technical abilities, and exemplary customer service skills.** 

This is the current intro for the LinkedIn Profile:    

**I am a recent IT Graduate currently seeking positions within IT, Sales or Customer Service, in order to apply the skills and knowledge I have attained, and further, develop these within a supportive team environment.**  


**I hold a Diploma of Information Technology which I attained in 2019, as well as a Certificate III in Business. In 2020, I completed a professional development course in the field of IT service management.**  


**ITIL certification. My educational qualifications have set me up well for entry-level roles within the IT industry whilst my 12 years of experience within customer service and retail sales has many transferrable skills to the field of information technology, such as organisational management, prioritisation, multi-tasking, customer service, teamwork and collaboration, conflict resolution, problem-solving, and adaptability.**  
   
**With over 12 years of experience in customer service and retail sales, coupled with an exceptional knowledge of essential IT systems, functions, troubleshooting and hardware diagnostics, my approach is solutions-focused, whilst ensuring versatility and tactfulness with exemplary interpersonal skills and technical abilities. I am confident that I can produce consistent high-quality outcomes and meet the needs of the business and its clients.**  


**I am motivated, enthusiastic and committed to working collaboratively and effectively in team environments.** 

I have already made some changes to the LinkedIn intro but nothing to drastic. I did make one change where I mention that I'm also going for sales roles. To be honest I'm not sure whether to change it or just leave it. 

The only part that I really think needs to be changed is the very start where it says ""I'm a recent It graduate"" given the fact I graduated **2 years ago now.**

Looking forward to your feedback on this.

Thanks, everyone."

Working as a medical scribe for ~8 months now (started 2/2022), requested to work remotely. They said it shouldn’t be a problem once trained 

I commute for 1hr each way and I asked my manager around ~March/April 2022 if I could start work remotely. The manager seemed ok with it but the providers that supervise/train me said it was “too early” and that I needed more time. Flash forward 6-7 months, I feel that enough time has passed and I asked if I can work remotely. Unfortunately, the manager at that time was placed on mandatory leave and I had no choice but to ask the acting manager. The acting manager said she would prefer to wait until the prior manager returns from leave to address my concerns. I asked when she will be back and the manager said she has no idea.

Should I wait until she returns to address this or quit my job entirely. Initially worked for a paycheck and clinical experience, but now just here because I don’t want to leave knowing that the providers are going to be overwhelmed with all this extra workload.

EDIT: worth noting, acting manager does NOT know when manager is coming back since the manager is being investigated."

I am one year out from my degree and doing research in academia. This means my current role would typically span 1-5 years. I planned to start applying for jobs after this current big project goes out but I am questioning if I need to hit the hard eject.   


Tl;dr: my boss told me that I am 'very technically strong' and so I am 'intimidating.'   
I had extremely positive feedback previously, but a recent technical project seems to have soured that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Extended version: I was tasked with a fairly difficult project that involved technical skills I didn't have at the time. I worked hard, learned, and made some research break throughs. But, this has caused progressive tension. I don't want to speculate on the reasons. But, my boss has repeatedly corrected me to explain the topics at a lower level--I have worked excessively to do this. To the point where it takes much longer to finish tasks because I have to explain mathematical concepts at a lower and lower level. Traditionally, these concepts would be standard knowledge for people in my field (and I am communicating to people in my field).   


He repeatedly said I ""made no sense."" It looked like it was at the point where my project had come to a total halt over the disconnect in our functional knowledge. So then after a few months of this I extremely gently provided him with a brief resource.  For added background, this was material I would have anticipated my boss to be very fluent in given our field. And this leads to what is next.   


He told me I am very technically skilled but need to work on being ""less intimidating."" His examples to work on are instead of asking ""Does anybody have any questions?"" I should say ""Is everybody comfortable with my explanation.""

1,2022-11-01,Applying for new jobs,u/Hairy_Transition_747,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yj3rqx/applying_for_new_jobs/,jobs,"Hello!! I’m just after some advice on what to do! I’ve currently been with my employer for 1 year 7ish months on a fixed term contract (NZ) which is due to come to a end soon. I applied for another job on a permanent contract within the company and got accepted for it. I don’t have a contract yet but have been offered the job. 

Now here’s where I’m a little stuck. There’s another position opened up within the company that really interests me and is something I’d been keen to do. I really want to apply for it but it’s closing date is after I’m meant to be starting this new position. Which means if I were to be successful and get an interview/the job, I’d only have been working in the new position for a few weeks. I feel bad applying for this job when I’ve just been accepted for another, but the one I’ve been offered was only going to be a temporary thing until something better came up as it’s not something I want to do long term. 

Would I be the AH accepting and signing a contract for the job but also applying for something else as a fail safe that I’ll definitely have a job, even if I was unsuccessful in this other role? It has better hours and benefits and is more suited to my life at the moment (recently had a baby so need to work around that) and the one I’ve been offered already will be on a rotating roster. What do I do in this situation?? I don’t want bad blood but I also need to look out for my future! Hope this isn’t all a blabble!"

I've had some people argue that I have no real experience, so I'm turning to Reddit...

I have my AA degree with honors. I graduate this spring with my bachelor's in marketing (also with honors). I have multiple certifications in Google and Hootsuite.

I worked for six years as a YouTube content creator, learning videography, video editing, keyword research, and social media management. My channels reached over 40K subscribers and 12 million views, and I worked with sponsorships. 

Afterword, I was a digital marketing intern for six months at a multi-million dollar company. I received ample experience in website design, SEO, social media management, and blogging. 

Then, I opened my own business. We've been open for two years. From the marketing side of things, I grew the business to over 300 clients in under two years. I improved our Instagram reach by over 30K% and followers by 164% in a quarter. I built our email marketing audience to over 350 accounts with a consistent open rate if over 60%. Most importantly, I manage a team of three employees and over twenty independent contractors.

I've been applying to job, but I'm having no luck. It's people telling me I have no experience that's throwing me off, like I need to start from square one. Any opinions or ideas on what experience level of jobs I should any for?"

My interview is on Thursday (two days!) and I have no idea what to do. I don’t know what to wear, to say, etc. It’s not like a fast food job or anything like that which is why I’m nervous. It’s honestly like my dream job (if I don’t go to college) to be working with animals. It’s at pet suites which is a boarding and daycare place for cars and dogs. The title is “Boarding Kennel Attendant”, which means I’d be cleaning, taking care of the dogs/cats, etc. It’s honestly the perfect fit for me, but I’m scared I’m gonna mess it up. What should I wear? Google says I should wear business casual but my dress clothes don’t fit me well anymore. Since it’s more of like a casual place would jeans and a flannel jacket okay? Or should I ask to go get a suit? I don’t wanna miss out on this opportunity so any advice would help, thanks.

EDIT: I GOT THE JOB!! I’m super happy with everything about it and all the people there are cool, including my manager, and I even have a friend who’s gonna do shadowing with me even though she wasn’t scheduled to work!"

I have a lot of emotional trauma from working at too young age that negatively affected my psychological and emotional development, and am finally learning to accept I need a job that is low stress (always pressured to succeed and have a flashy title). Something with a steady schedule, solid benefits, confidence that I can plan time off (meaning no chance my plans can get canceled for work demands), and provides just enough to live comfortably (for me about $50k a year).

I like to be the fun bright person at work and like to joke around if possible. At the same time, I can keep to myself. I don't want to manage anybody. I like being on my feet and would like to avoid a desk if possible. Some desk time is ok. I have a bachelor's in business and can learn quick, but I don't have any other certs. My background is in retail management.

I'm open to training programs or getting a cert if necessary, I like to learn.

Where should I look for a job like this? Non-profits? Government? Any niche job that isn't necessarily on indeed but that you know of that I can specifically search for and target?

Thanks for the help.

EDIT: Working in customer facing roles stresses me out"

When I was hired I told them that my biggest pet peeve is ""not having direction"" or a ""clear map for the year ahead."" I said if we come up with goals together, I'm totally fine carving the path there, I just need a destination.

However basically I've had 4 bosses in the last 10 months, and each one seems to also be figuring their own shit out and barely has time to help me with direction or a destination. I'll try to brainstorm with them but often the ball is in my court to pick a direction.

I'll suggest a direction, do research and present my findings, etc. and I always get a ""That's great! We'll revisit it later though as we don't have the bandwidth to build that right now"" and then nothing. I sit around a lot doing pointless busy work that ends up on the cutting room floor and by the time we DO revisit it, the scope has completely changed so most of my work is useless.

Every Monday morning I meet with my boss, they ask me ""What are you focusing on this week?"" and I say that the team has no clear direction on what to do but here are my thoughts, however we need a target to work towards and they always say ""What are you doing to solve the problem?"" and basically I've just learned to keep my mouth shut and look busy. If I make up some bullshit and fuck off for the week I'm better off than being honest about how little there is to do here. I'm tired of doing pointless busy work that ends up going nowhere while they figure their shit out.

The thing is, this is the 3rd job I've had that is like this. Is this just common in tech/corporate world? Or am I the problem?"

They offered me $41,600 for a Director level position and I can't afford it. How do I approach my boss to let them know that I want the role and would love to stay with the company but would need more money?**

I have been working at my current job for about 3 years now, one year as an event per diem employee, one during the pandemic where I hosted virtual events, and one post-pandemic in a part-time administrative role under a Senior Director. 

The Director position below my superior has been empty since the pandemic (I believe due to the lack of revenue) for the past 6-9 months my superior has been talking about moving me into the Director role. It was just talk for a LONG time but within the past 2 months, I’ve interviewed with my boss and her boss and recently had a “final” interview with the head of my department. It went well and they told me they want to move forward with promoting me to the position. Now the problem is that we never formally discussed salary..

When I asked about it, they'd say, “we’re not 100% sure yet but I think you're going to be really happy with it.""

 I currently make $20 an hour so I assumed that they'd, at the very least, offer me more than $41,600 because it's a huge jump in responsibilities and I've heard from other Directors that they expect a lot from you. Throughout the entire interview process, they kept saying that I'm currently responsible for approximately 1/3 of the tasks that they would expect of the Director so I thought for sure they'd offer me between $54k and $60k which is where I'm comfortable and can afford.

I went into a meeting with HR the other day and she casually dropped a $41,600 salary at the end of our conversation before rushing into another meeting. 

For context, I also work 3 other jobs that I would have to give up if I took this role and my total income from all of my current jobs is closer to $60k. I was happy to take a small pay cut if it meant more consistency in my schedule, the ability to focus on one job instead of 4, and a good role to add to my resume but a nearly $20k pay cut doesn't seem doable financially.

At this point, they are convinced that I'm taking the job and have essentially put all their eggs into my basket so to speak but I've told them multiple times that I can't give my two weeks elsewhere until I've signed a contract and I won't do so until I've seen a full list of my responsibilities and my salary. I feel like I have some negotiating power but I'm not sure..

I've spoken with another director-level employee in my department and they make $41,600 too. They said they tried to negotiate when they were first hired but they wouldn't budge. They said they'd be happy to give him a raise at one year but he's been there 18 months and was never offered a raise so now he's fighting tooth and nail for one.

I guess my question is, how do I approach this with my boss? I would love to stay at this job, but I can't afford to take that salary knowing I wouldn't be able to have another job/income..

ETA:

1. I’m not sure if this is relevant but I negotiated a higher rate for my admin work when I began my current job. They wanted to offer me $15 but I said I needed $20. So I think for someone jumping from admin to a director level role, this would be a big raise, but it’s just not in my case. 

2. Right now I am limited to working 28 hrs per week at this job which is why I hold other jobs to make up the difference.

3. I wouldn’t need the health insurance, my partner has great health insurance through their job."

Should I start looking for a new job?,u/Mammoth-Owl7821,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yjnmjq/toxic_boss_and_difficult_logistical_situation/,jobs,"I’ve been at my company for a year and a half now. My team has several corporate office locations and even though my contract has me working in one location (where I lived when I applied and resigned a lease for since signing the contract) -I was placed on a team at the opposite (the furthest away) corporate office. 

This was no problem at all whenever we were fully remote. But now we are starting to go back in a hybrid setting. It has been exhausting having to make a five hour commute multiple days of the week and it is not some thing I signed up for. I am the only one on my team commuting. I talked about it with my manager’s manager, after going to my manager resulted in no changes. And she told me that I could join from video call as long as I was in my “home base corporate office”. 

However, my direct boss is still expecting me to go in person at least once a week even though she was relayed this information. I don’t wanna go behind her back again or go to HR. The thing that would make the most sense to me is having me switch to a team in my home office so I could actually see them and it would be more fair to everyone, the office that I applied for that is stated in my contract and offer letter. 

It makes no sense to me why they put me on a team several hundred miles away from me. I’m not sure what to do at this point, my parents and my therapist and most of my friends are telling me to start looking for a new job. In addition to this, my boss calls me at all hours of the day, is passive aggressive whenever I leave the other office early, and it’s constantly putting me down telling me that she would expect more from me at this point with the company etc. She is constantly coming to me with problems but no solutions and it’s incredibly frustrating. 

But it all ties back to the fact that I shouldn’t even be on her team in the first place because it’s several hundred miles away from me and I feel like I was bait and switched into this position. Should I start looking for a new job? Or should I go to HR? Or should I be more firm about wanting to switch teams with my manager/district manager before I start my search? This is my first corporate career so I really need some guidance. I am feeling incredibly exhausted and stressed out."

I've had to turn down a lot of jobs from companies that I could actually qualify for but VERY few of these positions ever offers relocation. 

Or there are jobs I've qualified for are listed as ""remote until COVID"" - what happens if society goes back to normal 100% tomorrow and I can't get to their location? 

I've literally had to tell recruiters ""Would you be willing to be homeless to obtain employment?"" to get them to understand, that no, I CANNOT relocate. The employer would need to be willing to pay for it. 

Another issue complicating things is the fact that I don't drive - my vision wouldn't allow for it. 

Other than rejecting any jobs I can't hope to get to; how should I make employers consider offering relocation as part of their total compensation package"

Hi,
So, i am a graduate engineer in a department. I have a great rapport with my manager. We work very closely on a project. She is incredible and very supportive. I am kind of her right hand person (I have covered things when she is out etc) i had early on interviewed for a permanent role in my department, but did not get it. My interview definitely was not the good then( personal bad day), and I was up against a some experienced people, I also had a good amount of time left in my contract then. Since then she has also tried to push me voicing out more and being recognized in the group, which I suspect is to help me the next time an interview comes up 

I saw another opening in a different department, which is a permanent role. I am interested in it but not sure, I do like my current job as well.

I am unsure as to which would be better for my career staying here, where I have a great rapport with my boss (which i think would help my career) or try my luck in another department.


Anyone have any advice?"

An email came the following day and asked me for references etc. sent those, and waited.

3 days later I sent a follow up email asking if they needed anything else from me etc, they said no but the position was mine. They sent the offer letter 2 days later.

Fast forward to: me needing more clarity from the offer letter, sending an email Monday, not getting a response, sending follow up email Friday with all my questions, HR saying to call her with questions. Called on Monday, she texted me saying she was in a conference call and she’d call me back. 

She never did. 

I called her today, no answer. 

No response. 

My first day is suppose to be Monday. 

What do I do next?

I've read a lot about the ""contract-to-hire"" being shady and I don't want to jump into anything and regret it later, but it seems like it would be a good increase in pay from what I have now.

Recently left a job at a small business where I was an expert, had a leadership role, and got paid decent money to accept a higher salary and career advancement at a large corporate office. My experience so far has left me a bit overwhelmed— high learning curve, shaky onboarding process, bland corporate environment, even (surprisingly) outdated technology. The difference between the two environments has been jarring to say the least. Does the feeling of regret get any better, or is this going to be my reality for the foreseeable future?"

I just graduated with a B.sc degree in software engineering from a Nigerian university. I already have my US green card, i would be moving there soon. I am a pretty good javascript(MERN) programmer and have some projects , however i know how competitive the job market is. I have no prior industry experience as a software engineer. I am obviously open to gaining that first trash junior developer job just so that i could have something to potentially put on my resume and gain some experience, however my parents want me to pursue a masters degree because they feel i would have a better chance to get a good starting salary (they seem to think that i can just start making 3 figures). i’m not that naive to think that a company would pay someone with no experience very high just cause he has a masters degree, been trying to tell them for a long time that company’s prefer working experience to a masters degree. so i came here to get opinions.

1.)  As an international student with a degree from a nigerian school, would companies not take my B.sc seriously just because it’s not from an american school?

2.) would a master’s degree help me stand out to employers when i’m job searching? (even tho the recruiter required only a B.sc)

3.) would it be wise to start the masters programme while still job searching and then leave the programme if i find a reasonable job or would it be wiser to continue developing my programming skills till i find a reasonable job or a junior level position?

4.) if i don’t have industry experience but i’ve built many real-world based personal projects over the course of about two years. should i still be applying for junior positions due to my lack of industry experience or should i apply to mid level jobs?"

I don't think even he gets paid that much. 😆 Like honey I have my bachelor's, 5+ yrs of experience and multiple certifications. California is expensive af.

A lot of jobs I am unable to handle, as I am physically impaired in my knees due to surgery, meaning I am unable to handle physically demanding jobs that require the ability to squat and similar motions. I am sensitive to loud noise and can become overstimulated with too much going on without accommodation. In terms of education, I have a high school diploma and completed only my first year of college before withdrawing. Because of all of this, I’ve never been able to find a job and am limited in my search. I shouldn’t have to explain why this is so troubling, but it is.

I’m not asking for a lot of pay with whatever job I find, especially from the jump, but would prefer something liveable if that’s even possible so that I can start becoming independent for once. I’ve only ever considered working at Build-A-Bear, but heard the pay was awful there so I wish to explore other options before I make a decision on that. I don’t know what skills would be useful, but I am a creative person who has been a visual artist for over two decades (I was going to college for this), I am a good writer, and I am most knowledgeable about retro gaming tech and some popular culture. I also love all animals if that contributes anything. I’d say I’m a great communicator in writing, but verbally I struggle to communicate as well as most people because of my autism. 

This whole thing is hard for me because a lot of the kinds of jobs that’d work for me require higher education or some experience these days. I cannot go back to college, I have no previous experience working, and I feel stuck behind a brick wall. Any advice appreciated."

1,2022-11-02,Did I make the right choice?,u/PandaWithAName,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yk1mrn/did_i_make_the_right_choice/,jobs,"I'm in a unique position and I'm having doubt on whether I made the right move.

To give context, I was offered engineering grad roles at two places. One at a consultant with flexible part time arrangements and one full-time in government (both around 75k per year). I am also running a business as a side income, which earns me income greater than the salary I would make from those roles, therefore my goal was to focus on running my business while also have another income stream from an engineering job.

Initially, I wanted to accept the offer in public sector given it has better job security and the work-life balance, however, the problem is that it is full-time only and it would be hard to balance the time with my business. However, since I was offered the flexibility to work part time at the consultant, I thought this would give me a better balance when it comes to managing my business on the side. The only issue is, I'm having second thoughts as to whether I made the right choice, since I'm not sure how doable it would be to progress part time in consulting, and if its even possible once I start receiving more responsibility overtime?"

She sent me pictures a couple days ago of what the place looks like since I left and it's an absolute mess.  Reviews on Google and Facebook are terrible.  It's unorganized and dirty and there are food safety criticals I see in the pictures and it just has me circling on why this is acceptable.  It wasn't when I was there but it also felt like I was the only one who cared enough to keep things clean and organized.  I don't understand how they are functioning.  There are cases of food sitting directly on the floor, food under the shelves on the floor, nothing in its designated place, the outside of the building hasn't been cleaned.  I mean I wasn't perfect when I ran it but I'm at a loss on how whoever is there is able to find anything or why they think working in such a dirty environment is acceptable.


The pictures just bother me because I feel like I put so much time and effort into the place just for it to end up like this and it's depressing.  I didn't quit because I found a better job; i quit because of terrible upper management. The entire time I worked there, I hadn't had any kind of vacation or anything and after working 60+ hour weeks, I just needed a break.  Even though I was the boss at this location, my hands were tied when it came to getting equipment fixed and even getting new employees uniforms.  It just feels like all of the progress I tried making there for the last 8 years has been erased in 2 months and obviously I didn't have enough of a lasting effect on people for them to carry over any integrity without me.  In the back of my mind, I secretly wish that someone would reach out to me and ask me to come back soon so I can fix it again."

What is the best way to go about this and ask my manager? If I’m being honest I need this change more than they need it. Working remote has left me disengaged and so far removed from the team, work and company. I want to be in person with them and have no direct team members where I’m based."

I have been working for a company for the last 2 years. They gave me my first career opportunity and although things haven't always been stable with worker shortage and a lot of turnover, things have been good and I get along very well with everybody there.

Recently, I have been approached by a good friend who recommended me for a government role that would be a clear step up from where I currently am.

There is no question in my mind that the offer I am getting is better and I will try my best to get that job.

The issue is negociating my exit... I have a lot of responsabilities and ongoing things, and with the financial year nearly ending, I have a lot of catch up to do since I had to leave some stuff on hold because I was so busy.

How can I exit a place in good terms without leaving my current workplace in trouble, while also not delaying my starting date too much? Any tips you guys can give me?

Thank you so much!!"

This is the part that I hate. I recently have been getting job interviews from places a few states away but the email will read as follows ""Hi OP, Are you available for an interview Friday the 4th?"" The email was sent this morning on the 2nd. 

Like damn, how do they, one, expect me to make time in my work schedule so suddenly and two, drive hours away on such short notice. I would hope they understand I need some time to plan this out.

Yes, I realize that's a long time. I had a steady work history prior. However, I can't even get an interview. I get email after email saying sorry your resume/application was not selected. I do not hide that I've been a stay at home mom on my resume. 

While I realize I have not been employed for a long period, that doesn't mean I don't have skills and haven't grown over the years. To me it feels like all they see is a gap and don't appreciate the reasoning for it. I really thought our world was at a place where it was acceptable to be a sahm or to be working mom. But ultimately it should be your own personal choice to do either. 

I'd also like to point out that when I started my family maternity leave was still only 6-8 weeks. Nowadays, maternity leave is much longer and includes your spouse/partner with the option to take time as well. Don't get me wrong I'm not mad at this it's a great thing. However, it might have made returning to work not so emotionally taxing had I been given an option of four months off instead. 

It's maddening and I'd love to be able to express exactly this to potential employers, but I know the message would come across wrong. I guess this is more of a rant than anything."

I've probably applied to a couple hundred junior data analyst/ 'entry level' analyst roles that I've seen on LinkedIn but never heard back on any of them. I figure its because I don't have any job that has that title of analyst or any college degree. It's starting to get to me that I probably won't be able to after these back to back rejections.   


I recently have been trying to get away from my current company, so I set my LinkedIn to 'open to work' and I started getting a bunch of messages from recruiters on there almost immediately. Some of the positions that they messaged me about sounded decent enough to respond back to the recruiters.   


There were 3 big ones that were potential pay increase of 35-40k+/yr increase in pay. For all of them I got past the recruiter initial calls, the first interview with some version of the manager/director of the departments, and then the interview with members of the team that I would be working with. I personally felt like the interviews went either great or decent but never was bad enough that there was something I maybe wished I didn't do or say. Regardless I get shot down when I don't hear back from them after a week or two and I end up having to reach out to the recruiter asking for an update knowing that I didn't get it. I just need their response in writing saying what I don't have so I can potentially see what I could do about it. Most of the responses are we really liked you but we need somebody with more experience. I don't have a college degree but I have been working since I graduated high school. I've been with the same company for 7 years, moved from Quality Assurance to Tier 3 Support. These jobs being customer support related positions I feel like I have more than enough relational experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I'm answering their questions wrong when they ask if I have experience using something or doing something but the answer is no. 

If my answer to them is no I ask what exactly the specific item is so I can respond with 'no but I have used/done 'x' which is similar to (whatever)'. 

If I have no similar experience then I say 'no I haven't been exposed to (whatever) but I would love to be able to learn something new'  


Is there anything I can do after the rejection to help with like specific applications that they asked if I know of or have used? ex: one position asked about Datadog, some cloud monitoring service. There isn't any way for me to get experience using that tool unless my current company magically starts using it right? 

&amp;#x200B;

Hope I posted in the right space. Let me know if you need any more info.."

She gushed about how one of the candidates has a technical background, knows coding languages, and is a computer science major etc. She said she told the other manager they should hire him so they can mold him. 
 I am a finance major, I graduated last year. I have investment licenses through FINRA as I started my career at a brokerage firm. I did not like it, and transitioned to this role to gain technical skills. I met all qualifications for the role such as:
 -at least one year banking/investments 
-Bachelors degree in finance, accounting, communications or relevant major. Everyone I was hired on with have exact same background and qualifications. 

I responded how awesome and great it was b/c it really is and probably a step ahead in this industry if you are familiar. I didn’t want to show emotion like I felt weird. But, do you think she was bragging to me about this guys b/c I am lacking those skills? Honestly, she hasn’t really taught me anything. I spend a lot of time learning things from other people."

The two coworkers were written up. One quit, the one who yelled was offered a transfer to another store but is most likely not taking it so I expressed to the DM that I wanted the transfer if he didnt take it. This has been an on going thing for a month now. 

The one who yelled &amp; I have been scheduled so we dont overlap but he will stay late &amp; into my shift sometimes.

I have been working hard, on time and taking on coworkers shifts to get more hours. So long story short i was just threatened to be fired because I worked overtime more than 40 hours a week. I was told by the district and store manager that I worked over 14 hours over time and that's simply a lie. I worked 43 hours. I know this is a shitty retail job but can i really be fired for working over time? They also said they would take me off the schedule lol Which basically means they want to not give me hours with out firing me."

I'm writing today to get advice on what to do in my current job.  This was a super lucky opportunity I thought initially but I feel like it will be easier to lay this all out in bullet points because it doesn't seem as awesome as I thought and I've almost been here a year.

* I went to school and majored in things that weren't realistic for me but still have a bachelors and a masters degree
* jobs have been mostly in marketing and websites, tried teaching high school computer programming for a semester and found out real fast that it wasn't my jam
* programming in general has been my kryptonite in web development and I want to get away from it
* history of struggling with anxiety and depression - was a gifted kid growing up
* applied to this big medical organization that handles all the radiology in our area, maybe a group of like 40 or so doctors
* was just applying for a data entry type basic position just to do something simple for a while so I could figure out what career direction I might go next
* they get back to me and say I'm overqualified and want to offer me a spot in their IT department
* got to name my salary and then they just dropped me in an open office
* told them in the interview that I struggle with programming and want to get away from that but I enjoy other IT related work
* CTO is the boss and he seems like a world traveling playboy, always gone golfing or doing this and that but is a huge bottleneck for networking issues because he's the only one who knows stuff so he has made himself valuable and irreplaceable.  I think he is a big douche.
* he is not a manager at all and a bad communicator.  The culture here is strange because nobody has official titles or responsibilities.  It's a self run machine pretty much with no management but everyone respects the CTO's authority on everything even though he doesn't manage.
* the only stuff I was getting emails about to work on was grooming me into being a programmer again but with no real direction just copying me on emails sent to the other guy who does programming and server management.
* had a blow up moment where I asked not to be assigned anything involving programming, followed by a really uncomfortable meeting where I overshared personal feelings about myself and life in general.  I was super anxious and tend to overshare in those situations.  I am supposed to be reassigned responsibilities but it sounded like it was just for the paperwork and I haven't heard anything back in a week.
* They haven't hired anyone new in like 10 years, and I think those that they tried before either got fired or left
* I assume once the CTO is out of the picture, they will outsource the entire IT department.  He's pretty old as it is.
* I'm bored out of my mind, mental health really struggling most of the time because I am just faking it here.  I wear my IT outfit and I come and go out of my office but 90 percent of the time I'm just killing time on the internet
* Going to other coworkers for tasks or training is very uncomfortable, makes me not want to look for things to do because there isn't anyone willing to give up what they have found to do.  Like staking claims on work for self worth and to avoid boredom.
* hardly anybody really includes me in anything and I feel like an outcast.  Generationally I'm the youngest one here being 35 and it feels like I'm super out of touch with all small talk.
* best pay I've ever had though, and I can leave whenever, do whatever.  I go for a lot of walks but who would have thought this kind of purposelessness would be so crushing.

So with all this out on the floor, do I just stay here like a money mosquito and soak up the free living even though I'm miserable?  Or do I venture out into the wild unknown once again and see what fate might have in store for me next?"

Specifically, I was a contractor at a consulting company and I was under the impression that I was a contractor employee of the consultancy; however, I was informed yesterday that I was not a direct employee of the company because I was a contractor from a third-party vendor and the consultancy is unable to verify my employment record, which makes sense.

I did not indicate that I was a full-time permanent employee at the firm on my background check form nor did it ask if I was, and I was on the consultancy's project full time and reported to a project manager at the consulting firm so I am not lying about my involvement at the firm.

My resume also indicates that I worked at the consultancy, not the vendor, although I did not say I was an intern nor a permanent full time employee. I just did not specify the employment type.

In this case, would this discrepancy jeopardize my employment prosperity if I mistakenly put the consultancy as an employer instead of the contracting company?"

One of them in particular isn’t very competent, and I’ve noticed that myself and the other colleague have had to teach him along the way, despite his seniority (he first came in at senior level anyway).

It’s also been frustrating to work with him, because he’s been trying to stop me from taking exciting projects, and he’s been dumping very last minute projects on me which he’s no longer interested in which sets me up for failure, not only this, but he copies me and takes credit for it, and corrects my work with mistakes.

Anyway, he’s been promoted even further now, and it’s been mentioned today that the other colleague is going to be promoted. A few months ago I was told by my manager that two/three of us can be promoted which in itself is quite iffy, and I think in a nutshell my manager kind of knows that I’m aware I need one and will probably leave if I don’t get one, but there might be restrictions. It hasn’t been mentioned since.

I have a meeting with my manager tomorrow, I’m thinking it’s just worth saying that I know promotions are back open (there was a freeze) and if this was available for me too. Then at least I know? 

I’ve been there 8 months and to be honest, I know that’s not a long time. I don’t want to sound arrogant but since it’s quite obvious to me that I’m working above my level, I think I’d just leave if I was told no and see if I could grab a better opportunity elsewhere. 


Has anyone else ever been denied a promotion they felt they deserved? Did you get a more senior role anywhere else?


-edit- thanks everyone for the comments! When I said quit, sorry I didn’t word that properly, but I’m not quitting without another job secured, I just meant should I look for another job whilst I’m still working."

I did loved my retail job but I realize for the stuff associates get put up especially having a degree already, was really terrible to my mental health. When I finally got a job offer in the marketing field, I put in my two weeks but during that time I came to found it was a scam and wanted me to be a sales person as a marketing associate. Since then I have unemployed with little to no cash and additionally having my mental health worsen as well. 

I recently apply to a retail position that not only it’s my favorite store, it was also my dream job when I was a teenager. But my parents feel like I shouldn’t work right now and instead focus on applying for jobs. I have been doing interviews and applying to jobs but I realize I need money and sanity during this terrible time. Should I turn down the offer and look for an marketing job or just work retail in the mean time. Thank you."

On Saturday I started cramping so badly that I was screaming and I was bleeding a lot. I don't have periods anymore so this was alarming for me. All the doctors offices were closed and the ER is just not an option because it's too expensive and I can't afford it.
Anyways, I was scheduled to work on Monday but another girl wanted that shift for overtime. Well Monday comes around, l'm still cramping and bleeding like crazy to the point where I can't breathe. The girl who wanted my shift texted me saying she had a family emergency and that I needed to take the shift back. So I did, knowing I was more than likely going to have to call out because of my circumstance. I also took the shift because I did not want her to have to burden herself with trying to get the shift covered by anyone (I'm a big people pleaser unfortunately). That was my mistake. I own up to it. I go to the OBGYN and my IUD strings are missing. My cramping had stopped for a bit for the exam thankfully. But after the exam it started again. I asked my doctor to write me a note saying I would be missing work and I was stupid, didn't look at what the note said and it had said ""please excuse this individual for missing work to come to the appointment"". I work nightshift and my appointment was at 3pm. I called my boss and sent her the letter and was letting her know I was calling out of work for the night because I could not breathe without being in severe pain.
I now have a meeting tomorrow morning with her and administration. I don't call out ever, I did last year because my grandma was dying. I don't think they believe me that I was in so much pain because l'm 22, it was Halloween. I think they think I wanted to go out. Which I didn't. I sat in the tub, laid on heating pads, etc. so my question is, what did I do wrong or did I do something wrong? My boss treats me VERY differently than the other workers. They are all older women and call out for reasons like this all the time and don't get any consequences. I'm so sorry for the long post by the way."

Here’s my rant:",u/irlRacmate,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ykzf44/hey_rjobs_folk_anyone_really_sick_and_tired_of/,jobs,"Recently, after my old job burned me out so much I collapsed when I left (/hj), I’ve been avoiding hospitality and customer service work like the plague. My last job was nightmare. 

There was never enough people for work, so I did 35-44 hrs max instead of my contracted 20 hrs. People came and went quite quickly because they were: acting inappropriate for a work environment, inexperienced in ANY job/volunteer work so they complained a lot, caught up in drama that somehow affected coming into work, or the most common, 
they were fucking burned out.

Coworkers were a mess, customers treated up like robots and complained every extra minutes, bosses couldn’t hire more staff because they couldn’t lose more money; I’m surprised I lasted 7ish months.

I’m looking for summer work and job sites seem to be in need of customer service workers. No thanks. I made myself in-disposable and ended up with more anxiety then I had before. It’s so bad I can’t be in crowds for long without an anxiety or panic attack.

Hopefully it’ll be easier when I get to Uni."
1,2022-11-03,Need help in final interview for auditing firms (audit intern),u/-Revelation-,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ykzhoi/need_help_in_final_interview_for_auditing_firms/,jobs,"  I am a 29 years old who have just graduated college this summer. After graduation I tried to apply to some big auditing firms in my city.

Normally the hiring procedure is something like this:

1. CV/Resume round

2. Online Assessment

3. Group Interview

4. Individual Interview

So far I have always passed round 1,2,3 and got rejected at round 4. In round 4 they mostly asked about personal information. Sometimes they asked me about Accounting/Auditing questions but I always answered correctly.

The questions that I concern/suspect most are ""What do you feel when having to work with people much younger than you?, especially if they are in higher positions."" and ""Do you have any question for us?"".

Right now I'm quite confused because I'm not sure where I'm fall short at, so I don't know how to improve the situation."

Nearly two weeks ago. I applied for warehouse work through a recruitment company. the process was alright. no complaints. i listed the start date to be next Monday. (the day of the interview being a Tuesday, i had things i needed to do for the week.) they told me we will either text or call you if we have a job for you. alright. i went home and get an email telling me to sign up to this web app they use for inductions called work pro. do an induction on warehouse safety and after that.... nothing. granted for this week i have unfortunately been sick. but for the past two weeks i have heard nothing from them regarding work. i have zero warehouse/job experience and have told them such, they said that they had no issue with the lack of work experience. 

Just a bit peeved. should I call up and ask if there's work available. or should i be looking elsewhere....

I'm trying to decide the best way to negotiate this offer. I have been looking for positions as frontend developer for a while now, trying to switch careers to something remote. I have almost 3 years experience with web development, and over 7 years in construction (estimating and dir of ops). I was contacted by a recruiter I had worked with previously. He had the same job at the same company and they were still interested in me after 3 years. I did the interviews and got the offer. During interviews the company seemed good. Benefits sounded ok and I expected a good offer. They kept stressing the bonuses though. Then I got the offer.

So, the offer came in. This is a construction estimator role (pre-engineered buildings). $20hr...from what I know the industry is usually $27-40, I could be wrong. This seems very low to me. They are offering bonuses for profit sharing and performance. Performance bonus is 80/20 into 401k  though. They had a record year so profit share was 30% this year. I wouldn't get that since it's late in the year. PTO and sick time is standard. The team is currently working remotely, no plan to return to office in the near future but they are expecting maybe a hybrid schedule.

The industry I'm looking to switch to starts around $80-90k. I have had a few second round interviews but no offers yet. I wouldn't want to destroy my chance at getting into the job I want by taking this one.

Question is, how to negotiate higher pay and fully remote."

Got the fortunate news that I am being promoted from a specialist-type position to a Director-level position within my organization. Additionally, they are going to protect my hybrid work schedule. All very good news, as I enjoy my job and work.

My question is, does anyone have experience handling salary negotiations for an internal promotion? I'm guessing that there is very little leverage for the employee, and that they simply tell you your new salary and you say ""OK"". However, I want to be prepared in case the increase is only a token bump -- the salary increase between the two positions (at least looking at publicly-available data) is quite large. 

I don't want to be greedy, but I do want to be prepared."

About one year ago, I had an ugly DM exchange with someone and said something I should not have. He screenshotted it, Tweeted it, tagged me using my first/last name and tagged my employer.

1. Nothing happened w/ my employer (like literally no one noticed or cared), and I have since gone freelance and moved overseas (for personal, unrelated reasons!).
2. Unrelated to the incident, I deleted my Twitter account several months ago, but the photo still shows up when you Google my name and on his Tweets. The Tweeter has like 100 followers.
3. I have asked Google to remove the photo, and yesterday (11/1/2022) I submitted a request for Twitter to remove the Tweet.

*For the record- I did not threaten this individual or anyone else, did not make a racial or bigoted comment nor did I suggest any illegal activity or anything heinous. I was being an a$$hole. THis is the first and only time I have engaged in such an exchange.*

**Question:** Is there anything else I can do to bury the Tweet or have it removed? My career is taking off right now, and while I doubt anyone can really find the Tweet, I prefer it not be there. I am also not a big social media person.

Also, I know Twitter is a hot topic right now, but I prefer people please offer constructive next steps.

ETA: Thank you to those who offered good advice. For now, I will  (1.) continue reporting both his account and the Tweet. (2.) Adjust my personal social to make me less find-able (3.) ""Flood"" my social media and personal site with positive things (4.) Move on because I think any actions aside from what I described will draw attention to something that ought to die on the vine."

I've tried reaching out to several SWEs on LinkedIn along with recruiters only to get ignored or told that I am misisng ONE of the X many things their job posting requires so they can't vouch for me.

Just for context, I'm not employed (had to leave my last position due to abusive clients) and running out of savings facing homelessness by the end of the year. I'm getting desperate for anyone to give me a shot at this. I've re-written my resume more times than I can count but have gotten nowhere, had to use even more savings to have a professional create a cover letter which I hope is something. I've attached just a sample of the cover letter and the main bulk of the current resume for review/feedback. I keep getting told the resume is strong but if that were the case I wouldn't be in this situation so something is definitely wrong with either the wording or the outline etc. All I am asking for is help getting some kind of reference for an entry level position. That's all I got. If you think you can help, please DM me.

For those who have had virtual job interviews, I would like to hear your expertise on this matter. I have a remote interview scheduled and I'm trying to find a good place to conduct it. Obviously, I can't do it at my current place of employment. I don't have much privacy at home, so it won't be a good idea to do the job interview at home either. I tried to reserve a private room at my local library, but the librarian told me the rooms can't be reserved in advance. Should I try to have the interview in my car? Or what other options do you suggest?"

This job has treated me well, but it’s not where I want to spend my time and effort going further into my twenties, I want to leave, but I’m scared and unsure how because this is my first job ever, and it was kind of handed to me, how do I even leave? I feel like I was lucky to get this job and if I leave it I won’t be so lucky next time. My true passion is robotics, and I keep seeing all the robotics companies starting up all over the country, but from what I can tell I’m probably not qualified for the position yet, what do I do and how do I get over the fear of leaving?"
3,2022-11-03,Do employers appreciate &amp; consider functional resumes?,u/forthe_99and2000,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yl7plu/do_employers_appreciate_consider_functional/,jobs,"I work in tech, but not the good/successful area of it - I did not like programming in school so I took the database admin route, but I kinda got stuck in data analyst roles where I actually never used SQL. The jobs have bored me to no end. I am also an artist and even though I'm fine with working a 9-5, I'd really like to pivot to a job that is more social and people-oriented. I'd much rather have a job that suits my personality a bit better. I wanna connect with people rather than sit behind a screen all day. 

 I've had no luck in trying to pivot to totally different industries because I imagine they look at my experience and say ""this is not related at all to what we need"". So if I apply to be something like a nanny or writer or something in a nonprofit, they see all this data work and toss my resume out because its not relevant to what they're looking for. 

My old lead told me I should make a functional resume, which highlights your soft/transferrable skills moreso than your job duties at your past positions. But I don't hear much about these. Are they a real thing that employers would consider if you're coming from a totally different industry? Or is it maybe better to explain this kind of shift in a cover letter? I feel like if I can just get a phone call or get into the room, I could sell myself better. But I know my resume is what gets the door slammed in my face."

I don’t have any experience as a supervisor but I’m organized, finish my tasks in a timely fashion, and always ask for more work and try to help out my team mates.

I’ve applied and my interview is set for some time next week.

My thinking is I have transferable skills from other jobs(not supervisor related or even the same industry) where I’ve handled groups and coordinated activities to be done during a certain timeframe.

My question is: What should I highlight during the interview process that might make me stand out? Are there any tips for interviewing for a leadership position?

I found a Senior Recruiter at the company on LinkedIn and I’m thinking about messaging them to let them know I’ve applied and that I think I’d be a good fit for the role. The problem is, while the company has many open positions, the ones this recruiter has listed on their page doesn’t include the role I applied for. I have to assume another recruiter is in charge of recruiting for this department. However, I cannot find any other recruiters for the company on LinkedIn. 

A friend advised that I message anyway as it’s likely that talent acquisition is all one department and it’s possible this recruiter could at least forward my message to the right person. 

(It’s worth mentioning I have an IRL third degree connection who said she would push my application to the hiring manager, but as I don’t personally know her I have no idea whether she will actually come through)

So—should I message this recruiter or is it more likely to hurt my chances? The other option was messaging the head of the department on LinkedIn, but this I feel is might not be the best idea."

I have seen on Reddit that overqualification is a thing and that dumbing down one's resume by omitting the degrees is a valid strategy for ""simple"" jobs. However, what do you do if you have a LinkedIn account where everything is shown?  On the one hand I know that you can hide your Linkedin profile, but on the other hand I would like other people to be able to see my profile (recruiters, potential new people for networking, etc.). I am also not keen on dumbing down my Linkedin profile while mass applying for retail, because I am also applying for my field of interest (Economics, Data Analysis, Audit jobs). 

Is there a solution for this, or am I too restrictive ? I couldn't find any other people in a similar situation, unless my searching skills are bad haha."

I feel like I may be acting a little hard on myself but basically I had an interview with a company I’ve been really excited about. The salary is great, I’ve done deep research into this company, and have really put my all into this. Things have moved very quickly with this company. 

Last Friday I had a phone interview with the recruiter which went amazing, Monday I met with my potential boss and she expressed how excited she was for me to meet the team, and yesterday I had 3 back to back interviews with my potential peers. The first two went amazing, answered every question thoroughly, I even went over time with both of them. We also built great rapport, and they both expressed how they hoped to have me on the team. 

The last interviewer then asked me a question about what I knew about each specific product and I started babbling for a bit and gave a bit of a blanket answer because I struggled to find specific info online about each specific product since the company is mid-sized and the product is a programmatic advertising platform so a lot of their suite isn’t available online. I guess I was afraid of looking ignorant so I might’ve made myself look worse. 

The rest of the interview went great. I had thorough answers for the rest of her questions and I even had my recruiter forward the team a thank you email afterwards for me since I didn’t have their email addresses.

But now I cant stop thinking about the fact that I fucked up on that one question. Now I’m nervous and sad af bc I haven’t heard back from the recruiter yet. However, he did let me know that even if I didn’t move forward he would email me and set aside a call to give feedback.

I know it’s only been one day since I heard from the team but I’m feeling so upset and don’t know how to stop feeling this way. I am interviewing with 5-6 other l companies but it’s still early stages with them and this is my top choice and I’m just so scared I really fudged up.

It’s so hard even getting an interview these days. So to get this far in the process just to be told no after the time and investment I put into researching is what’s upsetting me Any words of encouragement would be helpful."

My 2nd, current, job I really do enjoy working there, but it isn't enough for me, it is a means to earn a car. I saw that a friend is doing trade school and they told me it is worth it in the long run because of the guarantee of work after studying. I want to know if going to a trade school then getting the job is worth it? If so yes, which trade jobs is good in my area(I live in South Florida and would like to potentially move out up north in the US)? If not, why? I would like to know."

Please help.",u/Old-Tell6711,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ylhxaj/placed_on_a_pip_manager_is_trying_to_get_me_to/,jobs,"I’ve been thinking about leaving my company for a long time now, because I’m doing an unnecessary commute that wasn’t outlined in my offer letter. In addition to that, my manager for whatever reason does not like me. I have known this since the beginning and I can’t quite figure out why because I have put in 100% effort to this job since I started. I love the company, but she is the only roadblock holding me back which is really disappointing.

But aside that fact, this past week, I was blindsided by being placed on a PIP initiated by her after having received no write ups for coaching’s at all whatsoever since I started at the company. The only other thing she outlined during my last review was to improve accuracy. I even got a raise! This just seems completely unwarranted and I know that her sector of the company is struggling financially and that I am being used as a scapegoat. I acknowledged the PIP, and had a Meeting with her yesterday to talk about next steps. I came fully prepared with a detailed outline on how I can improve. She did not even want to hear my next steps and told me she doesn’t have the time. I asked her who I can go to to receive additional coaching and advice/learning and she said that I shouldn’t need that at this point and that is the whole point of this 30 day review. She told me that I need to work on the PIP independently and at this point I either know it or I don’t and that we will meet multiple times a week so I can prove my skill set is improving. She put the meetings back to back so I literally have no time to prep. And in addition to that, I have to maintain my original workload and meet all of those metrics as well which was already causing me a lot of stress because her department is failing, at no fault of my own. She also has called me over 10 times in the past 24 hours nitpicking every single thing that I’m doing. It almost feels like retaliation. I held back tears so many times today because it is literally causing me chest pain, I don’t know how long I can handle this. I can’t quit because I’m not in the financial position to do so. My parents want me to do the best I can so I can keep this job and not have to move back home, but I think at this point I should just start looking for another one correct? 

Obviously, I will not quit until I have a back up plan. I’m really trying my best but I’m having some really dark thoughts lately. I don’t know why she hates me so much and she doesn’t seem willing to help me get through the plan at all. I documented my goals today and our touch base so I at least have proof that I did the best I could whenever they fire me so I can collect unemployment. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? I am under so much stress I don’t know how I’m going to be able to get through the next 30 days. I just really hope I can find something in the meantime so I can leave. Any advice is appreciated"

* Please tell us about secrets you keep from the boss. 
* Let's say a parent calls to complain that her son comes home from school dirty every day. What do you do next? (this was for an interview as an admin at a school) I found this question hilarious for some reason and I don't know why.

It's the only place in the building I can make coffee, and to do that I need to grab a mug, fill it with water in the bathroom, then pour it into the 1 cup Keurig, and THEN I can make coffee.

Only me and my boss drink coffee. But I'm still fairly new here.

Once of the CSRs is a woman in her 60s, who likes to take her lunch in the breakroom with the door closed, while she reads. No one's lunch is at a set time, so people take their lunch when it fits in with their work load.

We all have our own offices, and in fact hers is actually more than twice the size of our boss's office. Though, it is also the first thing you see when you walk in, so I can understand not wanting to be visible during your lunch.

The thing is, I got up to make some coffee this afternoon. She was blocking the mug I needed to get the water, and I said ""excuse me"" and told her I would be using it to get the water to make coffee, so she knew I would be right back with it. Well, I went and got the water, but when I came back and poured the water in the machine, she got up and left- but not quietly. She was slamming things around, and really yanked the minifridge door open *hard*. She then stormed outside (I think to her car) to continue reading. She was very clearly pissed off at me for making coffee- and sure, it's a small room, but she also doesn't have to occupy it for her entire lunch.

But maybe I'm in the wrong? I'm not used to offices. Is this a workplace faux-pas? Did I do something wrong, here? Aside from telling her I'd be using the mug to make coffee, I didn't say anything, because she was reading.

Someone help me out here? It makes no sense."

1,2022-11-04,Employment Contract Question(s),u/saaapling,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ylohuz/employment_contract_questions/,jobs,"Hi, I'm pretty new to the job search process, this is my second job out of college, and I'm currently reviewing an offer I received while waiting on a few pending interviews. I found this clause in my employment agreement, and alongside some other factors, I'm worried whether there will be any repercussions if I sign this and accept this job offer, but want to leave if I get a better offer.

The reasons I'm worried at all is because there are several things about this offer that confuse/concern me. I learned that this position is not with the company I will be working for, but under a recruitment/talent organization for the first year of my employment, after which I will be transferred to the company that I actually do the work for, but they can't promise this transition will happen (?), but they say that it is highly likely. In addition, there was a clause in the employment agreement that I could be terminated at any time without any notice. Also, the holiday/PTO/Sick time are also much less than my previous position - I don't think there's anything wrong with this, but it doesn't make me view this contract more favorably either. Are these normal parts of an employment contract and I'm just getting worried over nothing, or should I go over the fine print very carefully for this position?

The timeline looks like I will likely receive other offers (if my interviews go well) the week before I start this position, or within a month of my official start date.

Sorry if I've tagged this wrong or I'm posting in the wrong place, or if my question is super naïve. I've never used this subreddit, but I've always trusted reddit's general opinion as a whole :)

My mental health is beaten and tattered and everyday I wake up and have to face another 1 and a half hour commute then a 10 hour day at Amazon makes me think that I am the biggest fucking failure in this country. Everyone around me in my social circle is going in cruises and vacations and is getting 25-30 an hour and here I am stagnant at 18 an hour because bezos won't give out a living raise. My electric bill is $600 behind and I fear that every day will finally be the day I will be unable to eat. Corporate greed sucks.

The HQ is in my home country but I was an unpaid intern at their New York branch office (it's a government org). I heard that some companies use a third party agency to verify employment history without asking me for ref. They have to call the New York office to be able to verify my employment but I'm afraid they will call the HQ (I even doubt that the HQ will pick up the call since, you know, government orgs). How would they verify it? Will they just call me? Can I just tell them to google the New York office's number and call???? This is my first time applying for jobs in America so I'm not sure how it works."

In my search for a job when I graduate, I think I have come to realize that I am underqualified for the positions I am applying for. Mostly, I want to move into marketing analytics and simply general marketing roles (could include social media, branding, segmentation, etc.) but since I haven't done an internship during college I believe that my resume looks pretty bare. Instead of getting an internship (though I tried) I instead worked summers as a salesman and driver for an ice company which I believe had greatly benefitted me in communication skills, but that is a far cry from the analytical or marketing background that entry level jobs are asking for. Are there any ways to make my resume stand out despite missing glaring facets of the application's ""required qualifications""? Or, do you suppose there is a way to begin a career directly into the workforce without that internship experience? Thank you for any insight you can give me and I will try my best to answer questions in the comments."

Shortly after graduating, I spent a lot of time making a feature film, -- which eventually became and is still available on Amazon Prime, -- editing spec trailers, editing some professional work as a freelance video editor, and have applied to many video editing internships and assistant video editor positions at production companies but have not gotten any job offers. I've applied to around 4,000 video editing jobs, just about, since I've started. I've gotten very few interviews and no job offers at all, for a video editor position.

After two years of soley focusing on my video editing pursuits, because video editing is what I am most passionate about and what I believe to be most talented at, I also began to devote time to applying to government jobs. I had no success with that either. Then I applied on and off for the past year to fast food jobs and grocery store jobs, and I've gotten some interviews at nearby places but haven't gotten hired.

I've decided to return to college and am currently taking prerequisite classes at a local community college to hopefully get into a nursing progam in order to become a registered nurse. But I'm very worried about what might happen to me if I don't get accepted into the nursing program. I have lived with my dad all my life. I've also never been in a romantic relationship, although that's beside the point.

I feel like I've screwed my life up, even though I've done a lot to be productive. On top of this struggle of attempting to get a job, I've also been questioning myself, wondering how I come across -- obsessing about whether I'm even that intelligent. I might be autistic, which might be the cause for that obsessive tendency.

I didn't expect to have a history of no emplyment. By this age, 28, I expected to be living on my own or at least sharing a place with someone else. Having a good enough paying job as a video editor. I feel like a failure. And I have this feeling that I'll keep failing. And I'm a little scared. My dad's already 70 years old.

I'm starting to think that a registered nursing license is the only hope that I have now of having a sustainable, reliable career. I wanted to be this highly regarded, inspirational video editor working for a big-name company.  I feel as though I'm a huge dissapointment to my dad and myself.

I'd like advice. I'd like various perspectives about my situation and what I might do to improve on it.

I am a former premed who longer wants to go to medical school. As of late, I have been applying to jobs in pharma and life science consulting . It’s been really rough but I am finally getting interviews. 

I’ve noticed that my resume is good enough to get an interview, but I haven’t gotten any job offers. I have a big intro interview with a consulting firm next week. I’ve been listening to podcasts and watching youtube videos.

Does anyone have any advice ? 

Thanks for reading!

Some context
- Undergrad was a small state school (3.6 GPA)
-Masters of Science in Medical Science (3.9 GPA) 
-I have some work experience in a pharmacy and working with special needs children.

Edit:
The behavioral interview went well (i think at least lmao). If anyone stumbles across this here is my advice. 
Learn about the company like your life depended on it. Or at least know enough to “sound” passionate about the company. 
If possible look up your interviewer(s) online. Make small talk about the things you find (school, state, etc) 
Learn how to answer “tell me about yourself” as it pertains to the job. 
Be likable ! Everyone said that the first interview is basically a “fit” interview. They’re trying to see how well you’d fit in the company. 
Send a follow up “thank you” email to your interviewer. 
PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE your answer before hand. Thanks to the age of tech, you can most likely find the interview questions online (glassdoor, etc). 

goodluck xxx"

They have another location closer to me hiring that I’d prefer to be at, but now I’m concerned it’s too late. 

I don’t want to offend the manager since I already accepted the interview, and she seemed very kind. 

If it paid a little more, and gas prices weren’t so high right now, then I may have still wanted it.

Wfh data entry and tech support. 18.00 hourly
The position filled, but the same company was looking for someone with the same skills but also had stellar CSR background  and the temp agency said that if I wanted the job it would be mine and they'd be willing to pay me th 18 an hour because that's what I originally signed on for.
It's wfh I talk to marketing/brand ambassadors all day and assist them no   customers/consumers.
The job is easy for me and beyond fri and sat pretty slow paced.
I Excell at the job they rave about me. I'm optimistic friendly and take insanity level great notes for the calls.
I'm also very efficient with call times without loosing the friendly attitude.
They contacted me and they want me to go from temp to perm 2 months prior to when my temp contract end so I know they will have a penalty fee.
The problem is they pay 16 hourly with a 25cent raise every year +quarterly bonuses.
The boss came to me and told me this and I said no but I got them to 16.50 $
I know that I won't get 18 because that's what my AM is making and she's been there for 2 years.
I like the job. I can travel with it no problem which is a big deal to me the hours are ok and I like the team and managers.

Everywhere I have worked, I have been yelled at or seen someone else get yelled at, but only by people in leadership roles (execs, managers, etc). 

I feel like I can properly communicate without yelling, and I'm about as low ranking as it gets. If you're a leader and the only way you can communicate to make something happen is by yelling, you aren't an effective leader in my opinion.

Not once has someone yelled at me and I then felt genuinely motivated to do something to make them happy. I felt scared or guilty or anxious, but not motivated. Good leaders should be uplifting their employees, not screaming at them. 

Is it because they know they can get away with it, or are people who yell seen as good leaders? I'm honestly taken aback by how often I hear yelling in meetings."

I been wanting to move out of the company for various personal reasons and I was fortunate enough to get 2 job offers.

1. Preferred Company: I got the job offer later (Nov 4th 2022) for this company, as a data analyst but involves less of my Accounting background. There is a lot more opportunities for training and developing within the company  
2. Preferred Position: This is preferred as it does related to my education; Accounting Clerk. It leads to more of my field and could lead to more growth outside the company. 

In terms of Work-Life Balance, the preferred company has a hybrid model where I WFH with 2 days in the office (roughly 1 hour commute outside the city via public transit) and the preferred position is monday - friday in person (1 hr 20 commute to the financial area in the city via public transit). When in comes to ""what looks good"" on my resume, both are fairly even. However, lastly the preferred company has better benefits overall and the salaries are roughly even.  


I am just debating on whether I want a preferred company vs a preferred job. I am more interested in the preferred company's product and branding whereas the preferred job, i'm interested in the accounting but that's basically it. I'm truly on fence and I'm unsure what to do, I'm open to opinions and advice. If there's anything I need to clarify please don't hesitate to post

I need advice!",u/smiling_fusion,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ym120l/i_have_a_job_interview_this_week_at_a_hospital_i/,jobs,"I had to take a day off work for this interview. The hospital system in my area only does interviews from 8am-3pm, Monday-Thursday. I work those hours.

My top choice job at a childrens hospital called me today for an interview. Even though I have an interview at a another hospital this week. I’m unable to take another day off of work. 

I’m at that point in my current job, where I need to be done. I’ve been there for years, and quite simply can’t take it anymore. I need to put in my 2 weeks this upcoming week, but can’t until I get a job. I can’t afford to live without pay.

My current interview is a 2nd interview at the hospital, where training starts immediately that day. I would have to accept the offer, that day. 

But the children’s hospital is where I really want to work. I put in my application months ago, and never thought they’d call. 

Do I see if the children’s hospital can interview me the same day that I’m off, and cancel my interview at the other hospital? I don’t feel right cancelling an interview…

But again, I only want to work at the children’s hospital. Anyone have any advice?"

I’m wondering if there are any short courses I could take to learn a skill that would allow me to do some part time work from home in my free time. It could be anything really. But I am not super tech savvy. Hence why I am open to a course or class to learn a skill! Preferably low investment. Since it’s  not my main source of income it doesn’t have to be amazing pay and the work can be transient/when I feel like it. Maybe some sort of design so I can be creative. Maybe something on Fiverr?? But any ideas would be great!

I work with him everyday, he’s significantly older than me. He’s been in this industry for longer than I’ve been alive. I truly enjoy this job, at least for the time being, but the guy I work side by side with everyday is the one thing that takes the joy of going to work. 

For more context he’s the lead on my team, I bust my ass with any task I’ve been given and I’m willing to try new processes of completing task at hand. He’s old school and likes to stick with the comfortable ways he’s been taught but those are beginning to be outdated and take twice as long to finish and there’s more problems that can arise from his processes. He also constantly will take over what I’m doing if I’m struggling in the slightest way rather than offering advice or just letting me struggle and figure it out. 

The few opportunities I’ve been given to work with other teams I have excelled and they’ve talked to our boss about my performance and they’ve praised me for how well I perform and my knowledge. 

I guess what I’m trying to ask is how to do I go about talking to my boss about being switched to a different team because I can’t take much longer of him being so condescending and having to work 2 hours later than everyone else everyday. I don’t want to cause problems throughout the company but I’m almost to the point where I want to resign and find a new career."

But detailed story here: 

I applied for a job on Indeed through a staffing agency, they asked me to go to their office for an in person interview. Upon arrival, they handed me a pile of paperwork to fill out and asked for my passport so they can make a copy. I kind of get the passport part, they wanted to make sure I can legally work here which is fine. But the paperwork asked for all the sensitive personal information such as drivers license number, full SSN number, date of birth, consent for criminal background check and drug test, emergency contact person… Not to mention stuff like where and when I went to high school, 3 references from previous jobs, etc. 

I told them that before signing the paper I wanted to ask some questions about the hiring company and the position to see if that actually matches my experience and interests. They refused to answer any question unless I sign all of the paperwork, not even telling me the company's name, said that the company has signed agreement with them to keep it as confidential information until I sign the paperwork. 

I said I don't want to send out application then, I've worked with staffing agencies before but none of them asked me anything beyond what's listed on my resume, before discussing the position with me first. They seemed shocked, said what they do is completely normal and it's just how staffing agencies work, all of the agencies they know of operate this way. And they said they didn't expect someone to be this skeptical about giving out personal information. 

Anyway, it didn't feel right so I left. But I kinda wanted to know whether their ""all of the agencies do this"" statement is true. Should I expect things like this to happen when finding jobs with staffing agencies? I'm in the US if it helps."

It has more to it than that but those who things are what I am struggling with. Personally I have problems with depression and some days are harder than others.
I recently was taken aside by my manager with him citing that I had a negative attitude dispite getting all the work done with the team that day. He said my job across all levels demands i maintain composure at all times and i can be sulking. 
Personally I felt like i had a good busy day and we got a lot of freight moved that day and i was rather confused. I got upset a vouple of times through the freight process bit it wasnt anything more than a wow this thing upset me, moving on, moment. It wasnt like i was throwing boxes or cussing up a storm. 
The proverbial mask slipped momentarily and i was discouraged by my manager in the middle of the busiest day of the week when i was just trying to work hard and do thw right thing.
I guess what i am getting at is this.
What is acceptable composure at the workplace and is demanding perfect composure all the time appropriate behavior from my manager? 
What about that bit about energy levels? I am by no means dragging my feet and I've been told many times other coworkers consider me a hard worker. 
What is a realistic expectation of composure and energy at work while maintaining a hard worker status?"

I've recently come across working-student/internship opportunities on BeamNG, a soft-body physics vehicle simulator. 
I play the game myself and I love it. I know it's a game to most people, but I feel like it can be so much more than just a game. I want to be able to contribute something to their projects.

These are their possible areas of employment:
- Art

-Engineering/Development

-Management

-Marketing and communications

-Production

-Tech

-HR/recruiting

Problem is, with my major, I have no idea how I will be able to contribute. My major mostly deals with industries and management, but BeamNG seems to be mostly program based. 

Would it be smart to submit them my resume and see what possible roles they have for me? (Assuming I'll even be considered, of course)"

I worked full time at first, and am now part time while I do my Masters. My absolute best friend in the world was hired and my boss’ assistant and also is doing some of my job while I’m part time. I’ve sensed some tension from her but I remember when I started and it was stressful because the place is really hard to get used to. This week she lost it and was kind of a bitch to me, and was professionally inappropriate with her rude conduct towards me. She even got snippy in front of my boss. I know she is bipolar, so I kind of let her have a pass. However, I realized since she’s been hired (about 5 weeks) she’s been acting like my boss and she’s actually I not. I went to HR to confirm this. However, I feel like going to HR was a crappy thing (it was less than a  30 second convo, and I would never say anything  bad about anyone, especially not my best friend). Should I have handled this differently?"

When I first started I was in a support role and even though it wasn’t perfect, I did enjoy it and did well in the role. In April, I was referred for a higher position at another company (same industry), interviewed, and was offered the job. When I told my current employer, they counter offered with the same position and I accepted (I know…I know..But my current employer is much larger and there were perks the other place didn’t have). The pay increase was significant and I felt as though I had to accept it. They asked me to stay in my support role (at my increased pay) until they found my replacement. I took on my new role back in July. 

- Our sales team overpromises on what I can deliver to our clients. So I either have to say no and deal with the repercussions of that or just do it and stress myself out. 
- I’ve expressed multiple times that I don’t want to take on new clients until I’ve gotten more comfortable with my current set of clients, yet I’m still being given more clients.
- The clients I was given were use to their old representative doing things that they apparently “weren’t suppose to do”. (See point 1) I was tasked with putting boundaries in place so now I have clients who dislike me and are essentially bullying me. 
- I’ve told my manager how I feel and in that moment she seems to be understanding but nothing is ever done about it. 

Although there are more, those are my biggest issues. I want to be good at my job, so I know some of this stress is being put on by myself. This is our busy season. EVERYONE is stressed. But I have never cried more over a job. I know that I can’t do this long term. When I talk to other people at my job, they tell me that the first year is the hardest and I just have to get through that. I feel like I can hardly make it through the week let alone a full year. My coworkers make it feel like this is all normal, but my friends and family can see that something isn’t right with me. 

I’m finally making somewhat of a living wage and I’m scared that I’m stuck. Part of me would rather take less pay for a less stressful job. I just don’t want to regret making that decision. 

I guess I’m just hoping to see if other people have been in a similar situation and can shed some light how they handled it or if it got better."

How much of this is going to show up on my background check and how will it be reported?  


Speeding ticket?

Failing to appear in court?

Arrest?

I don't know how these things are charged or reported. 

&amp;#x200B;

FYI - this is the only thing that should be on my file other than a speeding ticket here and there prior to that.

Update: thanks for all of the replies. For everyone telling me to disclose, I agree and have no issue disclosing it, I just wasn’t sure what to disclose exactly. I’ve gathered a few responses and will disclose before the report comes back.

UPDATE II:
Well.... I sent an email to HR ""disclosing"". THEN, I found out that I could request a copy of my record online via my state's website. The results..... nothing. Nothing is reported there. My record is clean. I suppose I can check the DMV and request that record. Either way, looks like I'm in the clear except that I just disclosed something unnecessarily to my new company.

Also, just to be very clear. I've received the offer and signed an acceptance letter. I'm fairly confident now that the background check won't change anything. *Fingers crossed*. Thanks for all of the advice!"

297,2022-11-05,Feeling worthless in the job market - with a Master's degree,u/dangolheckman,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yn32za/feeling_worthless_in_the_job_market_with_a/,jobs,"I (28M) have been on the hunt for a ""good"" job for about 3 months now, to no avail.

For some context, I have been working since I was 16. My first job was for PacSun, the clothing store, where I worked for two years until moving to a bigger city to go to university. I got my bachelor's degree in Sociology because the material heavily interested me, and I was passionate about affecting societal/environmental change. Through undergrad, I worked for various restaurants as a server, bartender, etc. After graduating, I immediately went back to school for my Master's in Educational Leadership because, again, the material interested me the most out of any other degree. I did a program that was mostly focused on environmental sustainability education.

Well, I graduated in June, and now I can't find a job to save my life, and I also feel like I wasted so much studying what I am passionate about instead of studying something that would get me a high-paying job, or any job at all. I can't be a teacher because I don't have a teaching license, I can't be an administrator because I don't have much education experience.

I see all my friends and colleagues who majored in tech degrees having high-paying jobs, whereas I'm one step closer to going to back to the restaurant industry where I can at least have a stable and somewhat high-paying income.

I just don't really know what to do, y'all. I met a lovely girl and I want to get married and buy a home soon. I feel like I really messed up. Sorry that this is a rant post, but I just need some advice on whether or not I should go BACK to school or keep on looking for something. Any advice is appreciated."

I have my bachelors degree and I even have a job lined up at a company that I wanted to be with. The issue is that I don't start working at this company until the middle of next year, it was one of those campus programs where they go for recent graduate, given the timing it would make more sense for 2023 grads but I was eligible. Now I am in a situation where I have to wait but I am beginning to feel bored waiting. Also I need to get some money in order to prepare for my move to the location of my new job. The only thing that currently makes sense to me at the moment is doing some retail work temporarily but one thing I am afraid of is that they would be able to tell that I'm not going to be there for long and just deny me immediately (I am assuming this is what happened already tbh because I filled out an application for a part time position at my mall and got denied the next day). I wanted to know if this is what I should be doing, if there were any other options, and if this is a correct course of action, how should I generally change my resume in order to land some type of temporary position.

But it makes me anxious to leave a short stint on my resume. I feel I am really on the edge but do not know what to do

A few things about my boss:

\- boss is a workaholic with no kids and expects everyone on the team to work just as hard. We constantly work over 12 hours a day and sometimes 18-20 hours

\- My work never meets his standards. I just don't get it and maybe we are not just the right match. He would say it takes him 7 hours to redo my delivery. But he expects 3-4 similar deliveries that day If redoing one thing takes 7 hours, what would it mean to do the original work, 4 times?

\- I follow his previous work but he would completely redo it and tell me it is not the correct way.

\- He would use some grammatically incorrect way to write things and say my writing is so redundant with useless words. Yes...useless and meaningless are frequently used words.

\- always want work done ASAP

\- he asks you to redo things without giving instructions and then questions why you do not do as he says.

What would you do in my shoes?"

No one trusts me. they think I'm really grandiose never ask questions. I learned to search on Internet not ask other people and be independent. my boss is sad why I'm not asking other people question. When I told designers it's not possible to implement this design they don't believe what i'm saying even though I'm familiar with the project. they micro managing what I'm doing and they critisize me so much for the problems that I didnt cuase like a bug on the server that takes too much. I feel so much weak and stupid. My boss thinks I'm so much slow but they gave three projects and that made me slow that's true. They told me you are not head chapter to have technical opinions. why do you think you are very good.

I also have a Google Drive folder with a handful of .pdfs of ghostwriting pieces that I did for clients on Upwork and Fiverr, along with the press release and copy that I wrote for a Kickstarter campaign that raised $5000 earlier this year.

On top of that, I post short-form educational content about marketing on LinkedIn daily (where I’ve boosted my following by over 70% in two months).

As far as social proof, I have a handful of 5-star reviews on Fiverr and Upwork, along with some recommendations on LinkedIn.

My coworker is leaving to go work for the same company that I'm wanting to go work for. Problem is, I've been there 3 years and he's been there 3 weeks. The new job is for the government and had much better pay and benefits. I don't want to completely screw him and leave him with no employees, especially since he just bought another company truck for me. I've got 2 options. 

1) tell him I've applied at another job and that he should start looking for a replacement for me and that I'm willing to help train

2) put in 2 weeks and let that be his problem. I really don't want to do this as he's become a friend and I don't want to burn that bridge, but on the other hand, I don't want to miss out on other opportunities just to help someone else out."

Workex at some of the industry giants and then couple of years at my own start-up as founder and CEO. Raised funds, reached breakeven, filed patents, won national level accolades, and somewhat value additional experience. But couldn't find ways to grow further. So decided to explore.

One of the days when you feel very low, Day1: Applied at couple of job opportunities

Day5: Shortlisted at one

Day6: first discussion with junior HR. Likes me, move ahead.

Day 10: second discussion with VP Finance (to be reporting manager). Likes me. Wants me to speak with more VPs (internal customers). 

Day 12: third discussion with VP Growth

Day 14: fourth discussion with VP Delivery

Day 20: fifth discussion with VP HR

Day 21: sixth discussion again with VP Finance. Says likes me and wants to offer me role of Associate Director. Mentions ball park figure. Says HR will call me for details.

Day 23 morning: seventh discussion with VP HR. Mentions same figure as VP Finance but no details. Says they want me to wind up my start up and join ASAP. I say, let me review the detailed offer letter and decide. Winding up the company is not the only option since it is breakeven and I can appoint a business manager to run the show or sell my company to one of the competitors. I will however require liberal timeline from them to decide. VP HR says ok. Will roll out offer letter by EOD.

Day 23 evening: I reach out to couple of people that previously worked with this company to gauge their perspective and experience. Reviews, extremely positive and extremely negative, as expected.

Day 24: nothing

Day 25: I follow up with junior HR. She says VP HR is working on the role definition and details of the offer. Will roll out by EOD

Day26: nothing

Day 27: nothing

Day 28: I am disappointed by lack of communication. I want to check with VP Finance. I dropped him message to check where we are stuck. No reply.

Day 29: I see that employer has put the job on hold and unpublished the job advertisement

Day30:  I receive messages from one of the people that I had approached for review saying VP Finance has asked current Director to leave and I better be prepared with detailed plan of action.

Day 35: Day of this post and still no communication

I have been in their position once and do understand if a position goes on hold. What I don't understand is why they took 5-7 discussions and told me twice that they want to offer me the role and then go completely silent.

Where did things go wrong? What's your opinion?"

The fact that I have money coming in and no sense of urgency causes me to procrastinate.

But when I become unemployed? 15 applications a day! 1 to 2 interviews a week!

The thing is, I don't like to call off to go to job interviews. I take long commutes to and from work (driving 35 miles out of the city to go to work and back) and I value my leisure time to fix my house and make projects. Maybe Indeed is not posting jobs that pay 1000 dollars a week (possibly to hide it which is quite understandable).

I started working Since I was 17, and I have just a little bit of regrets about it:

When you are 17 and in high school, you should not start working in a minimum wage job. You will get hooked on your sense of having your own money. You'll become attached to your co-workers (such as potential girlfriends), Finally, you'll develop a fear of losing that job even though you know that there are better ones out there. Needless to say it's a waste of time and before you know it, you'll end up in poverty and underachievement.

Instead, Do some volunteer work. Learn a trade skill, such as mechanic and Volunteer so you can gain experience to put on your resume. It may not even cost you a penny and you are already off to a good start.

Growing up, I thought that having any job is better than no job. But as I described, some jobs are WORSE than having no job at all.

Do you guys continue looking for a job even when you already have a job?"

Although I truly do think I am a good employee. I think my bosses think less of me, and might give me a low score. My reasons being is because I keep to myself and have asked questions and still ask questions regarding procedures I am not familiar with. Especially ones that I don’t do so often.

If this isn't the right board or anyone has any recommendations for a better subreddit please let me know

Hi, I applied for a job as an assistant to an investment advisor about 3 weeks ago. I haven't heard back and I have gone in person to drop off my resume and have messaged them on indeed twice. I was getting frustrated and thought that maybe it was because I am a man and the person it was for may want a woman to work for them instead. So I had my GF apply as well, and within 2 days they looked at her application while they haven't even looked at mine yet. Neither of us has any assistant/relevant experience so I don't think it is that. While I understand that this is speculation, I am pretty sure I'm right about this and want to do something about it. Is there anything I can do to use this against them and at least have a fair chance at the job, or should I just report them to indeed and EEOC and move on?"

I do want to explain this to the company, but I can't think of the best way to do so and I am also wondering how bad it looks if I do this?

So last year I graduated with a Bachelor's in Psych despite everyone warning me not too. Plus covid royally screwing over my entire senior year plan. Now I'm in the exact spot I was warned of- without a masters degree or higher I cannot find any jobs.

I'm currently working as a behavior tech in ABA for kids with autism, and while I love working with kids, emotionally and physically I am absolutely drained. I cannot bare working this job anymore. Especially given the recent severe injury I've endured.

But I don't know where to go. I don't know what job will pay me as well as this one. I could grit my teeth and take a pay cut to be a receptionist but I'm so overqualified for a role that would rather hire a teenager for cheaper. And even if hired I'd then be losing so much money from a pay cut when I JUST managed to start living on my own at 24 years old. I could train to be a CNA, but I'm often warned not to do that either.

I'm crying constantly, I'm so stressed I can't eat. I'm so genuinely depressed and losing hope. I plan to go to graduate school but I can't afford the applications right now. I'm willing to do anything, any job at this point, just to get out of the one I'm in. Please help me. I feel like I'm at my wits end with absolutely no resources to help me. I don't know what to do. I have a second job but they've cut my hours. I just want a main job that will pay my bills."

To be honest, the one I work at is not that bad, and with three pay increase, it's okay. But I need to move out of my parents house and Barista pay won't let me do that. I've tried applying for other jobs, but they either never get back to me or outright deny me.
I need a work from home job because the cost of getting an Uber or public transportation takes out the majority of my paycheck.
I would do insurance, but the cost of getting the license makes the effort of getting the job meaningless since it takes so much of my income.

Edit: I should explain some things. I can't get a second job at the moment. Technically I'm already working 2 jobs, but the second is being a nurse for my dad. He had a stroke a few years ago and has gotten worse as time went on. And I'm also currently in college. So anytime not at Starbucks is used to taking care of my dad and doing school work. The money made from taking care of my dad immediately goes to my parents for ""rent"". I'm the only person in the household with a steady income because my dad can't work and my mom doesn't want to.
She says the reason is because she's worked for years, and I understand, but this is the only income helping them pay their bills besides my dad's social security (which isn't a lot)."

My supervisor is unlike any I've ever had she/he is frequently in a grumpy mood and repeatedly gets upset. I once clocked in at 8:00am instead of 8:14 am while I was driving and for 3 days straight I was interviewed and mentored on how falsifying timecard information could lead to termination and how using your phone while driving gives the company a bad look since I drive the company vehicle which I agree. I shouldn't be using my phone while driving but I feel pressured to do since my supervisor enforces such a strict attendance policy. As of now I am on my final termination notice because 2 weeks ago I got sick and missed a week of work which lead them to giving me a final notice which I was told will get dropped to corrective action in 6 months. My commute to and from work takes at least a hour and I am really considering leave this job however I feel like I have to stay because am 27 now and i need a job lol don't know of anywhere else to apply since finding a job is a struggle for me.

I'm a bit indecisive right now because this is my first job and I have a 1 year gap after graduation due to depression. Another thing is that.....the company decided to force everyone back to the office a minimum of 5 days per month. Quite difficult to abide this changes as I live quite far away and the area the company is located in are quite expensive to rent...... I originally accepted this offer because I'm promised that this will be a permanent remote job (my bad actually, should have insist them to have this promises written on the actual offer). My parents are really worry about me because of how this shift hours are terribly affecting me.

Appreciate any advice."

I’ve been in the same company for 9 years now having worked my way from seasonal temp up to “manager” (quotation because there is no store manager role, which is why I’m job hunting currently) and have only done 2 interviews since starting at my current company (one I got offered the job but so turned it down as it wasn’t a right fit, and the second I mainly used as a refresher for this upcoming interview) so I am feeling a bit unsure of how to approach Thursday.

Some points I plan to discuss so far are:  -Building rapport with the staff, and management above me. Get an understanding of their needs and expectations.
-Learn the companies communication channels and internal operation processes
-Review and compare store performances between first 30 and 60 days to understand trends, opportunities and areas for improvement

I’ve never done a 90 day plan presentation before, so alongside research im doing up until Thursday, I wanted to reach out for advice on what to do if anyone is willing to help, any information/tips/comments are greatly appreciated."

I have spent a few hours on Google but have not found the magic words to return what I'm looking for.  


Basic requirements:

\- Ability to load records to be worked in a .csv or .xlsx file

\- Ability to load records into different projects 

\- Ability to assign agents to projects they are trained in

\- Ability to pull reports showing record details and agent details

I can't make the declination that much better, but I do remember thinking that the process would've been kinder had I been somewhat compensated for my time spent in the application process.

That leads me to my question: Do all of you think that providing a small gift card ($10-$20 Amazon) would be a compassionate offering to these declined applicants, or would it be seen as insulting?

Edit: Please note that the ""assessment activity"" was a mock job function that the hired applicant would be expected to complete daily while working in this position. That said, I do hear what you are all saying about it being too long, and I will discuss that with management. "

1,2022-11-07,Job Interview Process- additional interview requested,u/Dangerous-Look-4296,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yosrjo/job_interview_process_additional_interview/,jobs,"I applied for a job at a phlebotomy clinic about a month ago and went in for an interview. The chief of staff and office manager conducted my interview. They basically told me during the interview that I would be a good fit for the role. The chief of staff called my references (one of which is my current employer) and I know they all gave me amazing reviews. I went in for an afternoon to shadow which is customary in the medical field. The chief of staff then called me and told me they liked me so much that they would even like to slate me for a more managerial role and she requested my schedule. Providing her my schedule required me to let my current employer know that she we likely have to find a replacement for me. I sent over my schedule and the chief of staff said “thanks.” Then I am patient and wait and on Friday she informs me that the doctors would like me to come in to meet me and I would do an additional shadowing day for 3 hours. 

While I am honored to meet the doctors whose time is valuable, and I am happy to be moving to the next round of interviews because I want the job, I’m a bit annoyed that I was asked to give my schedule and references before they were certain if I would be a good fit for the role. 

I’m just not sure how to feel because I really want this job. It is a convenient distance to my home, good pay and benefits, and in the field I want. My heart has just been through the ringer with this interview process. 

Any insight, positive words, or shared experiences would be appreciated. Thanks

Side note- in a crazy turn of events, my best friend is also being interviewed by this company. She is a nurse and i am applying for a backend role, so I don’t think we are going for the same role. But I think this increased my anxiety and made me question the process.

***update- i agreed to the second shadow session and was offered the job the next day!"

Throwaway account because my coworker regularly uses reddit and knows my main username.

I am 31 with 12 years of experience doing what I do. I have been an employee at a small family owned shop for 3 years, and am the sole person working the digital equipment, as well as handling a majority of computer assets. My boss is planning to retire and has sold the business to my older coworker which they have a working relationship with. The only other person currently working in the building is my trainee that handles some things on the back end that I don't have time to do. After next month, they plan to leave me, the trainee, and one more new person in the building most of the time. First of all, I'm not thrilled about this. Second, I'm realistically not making as much money as I could at this point in my career. And third, rent has also increased almost 40% since I moved nearby, my wages did not follow that trend. I didn't really anticipate moving though, until very recently.

An elderly family member has been sick and I wish I was closer to help them out more. I also have a friend who recently bought a house and as offered me a RENT FREE stay for several months in exchange for paying some utilities and helping them out with renovations. This would put me only a couple hours away from the sick family member instead of a whole days drive which I can rarely afford to do, as well as allow me to work and save up to pay off some student debt faster instead of rent taking my *entirety* of my paychecks. Not to mention the starting rates for similar jobs in that area are significantly higher than where I am now.

But boy do I feel guilty about the timing.

I don't think I can give only two weeks here. There is entirely too much that I know to keep the place running but it doesnt feel like they have any intentions of having someone else learn what I do. I never signed up to be a manager, but I also did not negotiate a higher rate or let on that I was unhappy with the upcoming changes. I have a tendency to overexplain myself and make things complicated when I am nervous, so I've been thinking nonstop about how to proceed, thoughts?"

My job title is a scribe so I basically go into classroom lectures and take notes for disabled students (or anyone with a disability that gets in the way of their school work) I also audibly explain lecture material to hearing or visually impaired/blind students. Along with proctoring and reading for disabled students for important exams and stuff. The thing is I’m about to graduate and transfer to a university which would make my job at the community college a lot harder since their is a limited amount of hours and there isn’t any work when school isn’t in session. I was thinking about applying for one of the office jobs in the disability service center (where my managers work)I have all the requirements for one of their jobs and my overall experience in this environment has been positive (especially when I consider how fast I’ve quit other jobs because of the bad environment). It’s a nice job environment and I don’t want to let it go but unfortunately I might have to. Would it be inappropriate to ask if they have any other positions open once I turn in my two week notice in December?

I will be taking a vacation November 23-28. My supervisor is highly emotional and I strongly dislike confrontation. I want to give my notice as respectfully as possible but I am afraid she will retaliate. She has made several aggressive comments in the past about how I’m “not allowed to leave”. I had previously agreed to cover her vacation on November 21-22 and I would like to honor that. I see a few potential options.

1. Give her a three weeks (+1 day) notice today, in person, and end on November 29
2. Send her an email tomorrow (working remote for the rest of the week) and cc HR and end on November 29
3. Give a two weeks notice today and end on November 18 (will alleviate stress but I will be unpaid for two weeks, less than ideal)
4. Wait until next week and give a two weeks notice so I don’t have to deal with her negative reaction for quite as long

This is my first job after college and it has been somewhat nightmarish. I am quite stressed about the best course of action and would appreciate input from an outside party. Thanks in advance!"

I work on a resourcing team that proactively and reactively resources candidates and assists the marketing functions. 

I joined back in early 2021 just after graduating University and finding my first full time role through the pandemic. The role advertised amazing training, development and progression opportunities and I was successful for the role. The 360 recruiter role wasn't for me, so I was given an opportunity to work in more of a resourcing role which I enjoyed and do well in.

In December, my old team told me that they were combining members of different teams to create a brand new resourcing team. This sounded great! I was working with recruiters and felt a little on my own, and now I could work within in a team where we all did the same thing (pretty much).

We started in January of this year and have been working together well. Ever since the start, we have communicated that it would be great to have a career pathway to work to just like every other function in the business. Not only to earn a better salary, but more so a better job title to show our progression on CVs etc. My manager said that it was in progress and just needed to be approved by seniors. Fair enough. It kept being pushed back over and over and over again because of different excuses and reasons. I have even spoken to the ops director of the business because I am so determined for the development and they gave me a very nonchalant response along the lines of ""we're working on it"".

Because of the success of my team, the team is now being replicated in sister brands across the group. We have been asking about the career pathway a lot as we have not had any insight into it at all. To this day, we still have nothing, and my manager has achieved a very large promotion because, verbatim, ""because of the success of ____'s team"". We have all generated a 6 figure amount to the company and don't have anything in place to strive toward. Every single other function on the floor and in the business has celebrated promotions, whilst we do the donkey work and don't have anything to work towards. This is not a small start-up company, this is a global business. 

I am so, so, so angry. I feel I am wasting my time in a dead-end job. Will this career pathway be put in place whilst I've been here 3 years, and I start all the way at the bottom with nothing to show from 3 years' hard work? What a waste of time. I am so driven and determined to achieve and to have a meaningful, fulfilling career. I feel so stuck and angry. It seems like nobody cares what we say, this just won't happen for a long time. I just feel defeated. Nobody will listen. 

tldr; worked for company for 2 years, been in a new team for 1, manager gets massive promotion and bonus due to team's strong contribution of GM but we get nothing and still no career pathway."

2,2022-11-07,Need some advice on how to continue with my dream of filmmaking,u/NennexGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yp0sxw/need_some_advice_on_how_to_continue_with_my_dream/,jobs,"TLDR: Even though I’m just out of college, and just landed a good job, I want to continue with my dream asap

You ever see photos of directors and they’re totally excited and geeky about being on the set of *insert movie*? That’s my dream: to direct movies that I’m personally thrilled to be creating and/or filming in immersive environments. (Of course, for the sake of time, we’re gonna shorten that down to having a dream of filmmaking). 

Last May, I graduated from a small college with a BA in Media Arts (basically covers topics from graphic design and social media to video production and editing, and my emphasis was on the latter). While I was there, I made a few short films for the school’s citywide film festival and even helped with a music video for a bluegrass singer. These films were written by me, location-planned by me, directed/shot/edited by me. Everything but acted by me. The films, music video, and a trailer mashup to show storytelling through editing are all on my online portfolio. 

I spent the whole summer applying to everything and anything that was degree/career-related, even if it was above my experience level. I applied to Disney (both the college program and regular positions), Bungie (even through game development wasn’t something I knew, I had art experience), and everything else I could find on Indeed or LinkedIn. Fortunately, after hundreds of applications, I managed to get a fast food job at the end of august, and on October 3rd I started another pt job as a Live Video Operator for a company called Edgio. Now, besides not being the biggest fan of working live production ( it was perfectly fine as a workstudy job in college), I want to continue on the path to filmmaking. 

The question is: where do I go from here? I have a YouTube channel consisting of gaming, commentary, and the short films. Im considering taking what I learned about 3D animation and making animation, as a way to add to my filmmaking abilities. I could also start making shorts that are just of me (I dont have friends or a film community) and mess with vfx on Apple Motion. After all, quite a bit of the skills and knowledge I used to make my capstone film were obtained through youtube videos, experiments, and other non-classroom means (remote learning’s a b**ch). Of course, there’s only so much one can do alone with a m50 camera and a gimbal. Not to mention, what do I do with anything I make? 

Then I also wonder if I lack the experience expected from people my age, and looking at the descriptions of related entry-level jobs at Disney/Lucasfilms certainly didn’t help. Do I need to take out more loans, go to Full Sail, or is it actually all about location? Do I need to take out loans and move to the cities? (God forbid anywhere even close to Los Angels). 

Is the problem that I’m still too broad with what I want in filmmaking? I can do the editing, screenwriting, simple vfx (at least for now), but I prefer and more enjoy the production side: the camera work, the directing, the DP. Honestly, doing the camerawork for something I’m directing sounds cool (and I sure loved doing that in college). 

So, in the words of Foo Fighters, “Where do we go now?”"

Initially, I was pretty open to moving anywhere, but now, especially after I have passed my second exam, I realize there are many places I don't particularly want to move to. I'm from the northwest, and I have some family in the northeast, so i'd rather work either here or there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Theres nothing wrong with wanting to work a specific place, but in my case, where I don't have anything under my belt experience wise, it's just shutting me out of a lot of potential opportunities if that makes sense. Like I really don't want to live in Iowa, Illinois, California etc, but there are so many application opportunities I am missing out on by not applying to those places, and when I do apply for these places, theres a sense of dread like 'what if i have to move to des moines, oh no, OHHH NOOO'. Has anyone been able to over come this feeling, like logically I know beggars can't be choosers but still emotionally it just feels like it would hurt if I were to move to one of these places you know."

&amp;#x200B;

They require training from their Pleasanton, California location for a  few weeks, before you do interviews. It seems the training curriculum starts with the basics of Java and goes into more complex concepts a Java developer might encounter. The training is free of cost.

&amp;#x200B;

They ask that I sign a contract on the 3rd day of training, which boils down to if I am hired after the training, I need to stay employed through Flexon for at least 12 months, and would pay a fee of $5000 for leaving this contract. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also believe they represent you, and I think you receive 60% of your actual salary for going through them. I'm not clear on the mechanics of this part, but you are techincally a Flexon employee working for a different company.

Does anyone have any recent experience with them? All of the posts I see are from 3 years ago. Thanks!"

Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but here is what three weeks of job hunting has offered:

Background info is I'm 25/F, I have a degree and BA, and I'm currently completing a certificate required to work as a legal assistant before applying for law school (I don't want to spend 200k without knowing for sure that I'll like the field, but figured a nice salary career working for a lawyer would be a great second choice). I've worked various jobs ranging from care aid, server, and cook, all the way to being a cashier.   


I already have a part-time job as a server and make amazing money the one day a week I work. However, since it's the slow season, I've been looking to pick up an extra day or two at a different establishment to supplement my income.   


Y'all, some of these people don't deserve to have employees. Let me explain.  


I went to one place, did the interview, and got hired as a part-time server. They knew my availability was two days a week, and I was never available on Saturdays. I was also unavailable the upcoming Friday after being hired, as I'd already picked up a shift at my primary job. The manager scheduled me for Friday, was upset I couldn't make it, and then asked me to come Saturday night, another day I'm unavailable. She called me to tell me that ""they're looking for someone more flexible,"" even though they knew my schedule was rigid when they hired me. Not only that, but the trial shift I did was unimpressive, as the serving staff was cold, and only two of the five servers there ran ANY food.  


I get another offer from a different restaurant looking for part-time servers. I did the interview, got hired, and came for a trial shift. The two managers/owners were so cold and rude to me and the other staff and customers. I was genuinely surprised at how much a hospitality establishment could have no hospitality. After an hour and a half of listening to the managers talk to the other employees and me rudely, I politely excused myself and told them I wasn't interested in the position. These two grown men asked to talk to me in the back and were SO defensive. I told them it just wasn't what I thought it would be, but thanks for the opportunity, and they literally said back to back, ""well how could  you know after only 2 hours"" AND ""you could've told us sooner."" Which is it? Could've told you sooner or should've waited longer? I didn't even bother to tell them I didn't want the job because they have bad attitudes, because I didn't want to fuel the flames and leave the rest of the poor staff to deal with them having an even worse attitude because they heard the hard truth.  


THEN, I got an email from a clothing store saying they want someone part-time on weekdays 7am-12pm Monday-Friday, and I told them I would only be available two days a week, all evenings. The manager said, ""okay, I've scheduled you for an interview at 1pm on Wednesday."" LOL. I politely told her I was no longer interested in the position. Why assume when I'm available? Especially after I said in my email I can only work nights? Also, where did she get 1pm from??? Why even offer me an interview knowing I will never be available for the time slots you're asking for? Who knows! To be clear, their listing didn't mention they want someone on weekdays, this info was emailed to me with the interview offer. Had I known earlier, I wouldn't have even applied.   


I have another interview lined up as a cashier, and I hope they're just a fraction more competent than the other people I've dealt with in the past few weeks. But honestly, I think I'm gonna just bail and live frugally until the program is done in three months and find a job as a legal assistant (high demand in my area). My primary job is fabulous, and LGLA work is at least packed with benefits and a salary.   


These minimum-wage employers really think they can say and do whatever they want and then wonder why no one wants to work for them. They lack interpersonal skills, especially listening and then expect their workers to bend and fold for them/the business.   


I know I'm in a fortunate position where I can be this picky, but some of these places are a mess. No thanks. Buh-bye now. See you never."

Need money fast.,u/h0megrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yp3g7b/newly_unemployed_and_hate_working_need_money_fast/,jobs,"Im posting on here because Im finally at a loss for what to do. I (20 F) have had off and on jobs for the past 2 years after quitting school. I did one year of University and dropped out because I had no motivation to do school online during covid. I am now experiencing the same issues but much worse in my work life. last year I worked full time, but I got bored of working 8 hour cashier shifts where I would practically just stand there and do nothing. I worked another job after that which was 6hr shifts each day and I still could barely get myself out of bed to go into work. I started working a part time job because I thought it would give me more variety and more motivation to go into work knowing I wouldn't be doing it every day. This was going ok, and I wasn't absolutely miserable, but still had some trouble going in for my shifts, and got fired after less than 2 months because of ""absences"" (i had 4 total, 2 were because I got covid so in my opinion my termination was unfair but whatever). I was starting another part time job as a cashier at a grocery store just before I got fired from the other one, but it was just awful. Customers were so rude, staff expected me to know everything with little training (I missed 2 training shifts because I had covid), and aside from this they kept it so cold in there and I have an allergy to the cold so I get hives when my skin is exposed. 

I basically had a mental breakdown about everything today and no call no showed to my shift at the grocery store. I am at a loss for what to do. It seems I cannot keep a job for the life of me. I have only been fired this once but after a few months I end up quitting and trying to find something new in hopes that the next job I get will be bearable enough for me to stand. I had so many different jobs of different varieties and none of them made me want to go into work more than the other. I hated them all. I feel like I have tried everything. I also have no car so this means I have to take the bus or walk to every job i've had which I hate. I have such bad mental health issues that it drags me down, but part of me also thinks I am just not cut out for a regular normal person job. I dread every second of working, to before I have to leave, to when i'm there, to when i'm on my way home. And now that i'm practically unemployed I am so stressed. My main issue right now is how i am going to make rent this month without having any savings and no job. I would say I really enjoy flipping and reselling clothing, i've done it for a few years but even if i work really hard at it I wont be able to make $600 by the end of the month for rent. If anyone has anything that would be helpful to me, tips, suggestions, ways to make money, anything, please share!!!"

There is not a whole lot of discipline. My boss doesn’t hold people accountable. For instance, he allows employees to harass one another without intervening. My bosses boss brought my current boss with him from a previous company they worked for. HR would have little to no power to do anything about it except talk to him. This would likely lead to me being retaliated against.

The thing is, there is no structure. I am not sure how I am supposed to be performing job duties or tasks. There is no consensus between first and second and we are often left unaware of procedures and processes. 

I have addressed the lack of communication, and for six months they have “been working on it”. I have seen little to no change. This has made me unhappy due to the fact that I have no clear expectations or goals. I often get told we do things wrong, and while no one cares, it would be nice to do it right. 

How do I answer, why am I leaving my current role. If I had been with the company for longer than six months I would state that it is due to seeking better career opportunities. Six months isn’t long enough to use this reason. My previous two roles it was fine for but not this. Suggestions?"

I (27M) am about a year and a half away from getting my PhD. Along with this I have an MBA and a bachelors in Actuarial Science with a minor in Econ. Once I got out of undergrad I applied to probably a couple hundred places to no avail. As in zero call backs. Except for one interview for a great job (an energy analyst with great pay) where a person who had been an mechanical engineer for 20 years got it over me (it ended up being between me and him I was told)…an entry level job. Anyway I believe this is mostly due to having no job experience other than a small part time horse training business I run, which I didn’t put in resume at time. I didn’t want to be an actuary and honestly barely even graduated (hated school at that point in my life). Couldn’t get a job so I started doing home improvement (such as windows and siding). 

After about a year and deciding I hated that I started working at ups as a package handler during night shift. What a shit job lol. After 9 months of that I decided fuck this I’m going to get my MBA from the local state/city university. I got in from a good GMAT score and having my horse training business to make me look like a business person LOL. Started that. Built in was an internship. Could not have got a shittier one. HR Block. Worked as an associate team leader for the year (well tax season) while I completed my MBA. Got out and guess what. Couldn’t get a job. Became a substitute teacher which I actually didn’t mind but couldn’t live forever on that. Decided to go ahead and get my PhD. I have been working on that since.

 After a year of substitute teaching I got a job working for the state as a license admin for horse racing. Of course it’s pay is crap, there’s no room for  advancement, and I work like 10 hours of overtime a week. But I just wanted something extra on my resume that a company may see as good experience. Not that it’s extremely related to much. 

Here I am now. A weird background of job experience, all which being short lived, and a bunch of education and debt. Should I leave some stuff off resume, have it all on it, any specific job that may be interest you all can think of, etc?  

And before anyone speaks on my fuck-ups in life career related, I know or else I wouldn’t be asking for help and opinions. 

TL;DR: BS: actuarial science. MBA. Year and half from PhD. 1 year home improvement. 1 year at UPS as a package handler. 1 year as Associate Team Leader for HRBLOCK. 1 Year substitute teacher, 1 and half years License Administrator. 6 years part time business owner.  I need Job search advice."

I graduated college in May and have struggled to find the right full-time job for me. I found a temporary clerical position at a university and started that last week which will hopefully give me some more work experience. 

However, I am still applying to full-time jobs and was wondering how I should indicate this in my applications without seeming like a job hopper. On applications where it asks if they can contact this employer what should I do? Because I dont want to put ""dont contact"" because that could seem like a red flag but also I dont want to ask my current supervisors to be my references right after starting. Any insight would help! Thank you very much"

I work a major annual event in California that takes four months of planning, and I have worked it for the last 11 years. It is a fulfilling passion project, and I worked closely with my best friend. She is my direct superior, I beneath her with both similar levels of responsibility and workloads. For example, I began working in July, her in September for a three week October event. She was also planning on quitting, and shit talking the event in public settings leading up to start of conference.

This year I returned to the event to do my job as I have for the past 11 years. My superior had declared “things have changed” cryptically, but nothing more. Schedules were always flexible in past years, so I attended to work when I could, stayed on the job for 12-16 hours and went home, this year vastly ahead of schedule, and I was proud.

Three days later, my superior cornered me in an office within earshot of the majority of my coworkers to scream at me that I wasn’t on time three days in a row, when no start time had ever been set or communicated. When I asked her why she just didn’t tell me the first time she told me “I thought you were a fucking adult” and accused me of attempting to “upstage and big-dick her”.  She reiterated that she is my superior and “she is doing leadership” I disclosed to her I might be off because something terrible happened to my romantic partner recently and she told me “why does that bother you? Stop making other peoples problems your own”

After this any time there was an error, I was blamed whether it was mine or not. I was singled out and ostracized, no one would sit near me, talk to me, as I could hear them talk about me every day. Every error I felt her building wrath until she’d have a massive blow up at me, sometimes in public. Any attempt at helping solve or mitigate the error in the long run was characterized as attempting to “override her authority” and when I kept quiet and worked I was “being lazy, sneaky, or hiding”. I spent the entirety of the event feeling terrorized and frozen in an inability to trust any of my work, because the pressure pushing down on me was unbearable. I was on the verge of tears from her constant hairtrigger fuse, but around everyone else in the department, and other departments she was just a fun lady having a fun time, And I was a moody mess.

By the end of the final week, the event came to pass with about 2 major errors, and about 5 minor ones out of 400+ modules where errors could potentially happen, a typical year would see about 10. I worked 18 hour days every day. I told her I was deeply hurt by the way she has spoken to me as a person and a friend. She simply re-iterated she was making “a fucking leadership call” because I was acting “as a perpetual victim” I was fired from half of my job because of my boss’s bizarre power trip. 

The other half includes highly specialized technical knowledge that I would have to train a replacement for months to do. I am not emotionally prepared to do that, but I care deeply about the success of the conference that I built for 11 years, however I cannot work in her department anymore.

My direct superior wants to deal with this “in-house” meaning no one speaks to the higher ranking superiors except for her so she can frame it to save face, but this is a departmental problem and if it can happen to me, her closest friend, it absolutely could happen to anyone else. The executive has an excellent open door policy and I have a good long term working relationship with them.

TLDR: best friend who I built a conference with goes on power trip, singles me out, yells at me in public, should I tell her superiors about the toxicity I experienced?"

At this point a temporary job would be worth getting myself in a better mental place. I’ve looked around at places like target and other retail, but I can’t find anything that’s at my current pay level. Which I can’t afford a pay cut at this time. 

Any advice on finding a temporary fix to get me by?

I often get very upset when I have to go to bed knowing I have to go to work in the morning. Sometimes I start crying or screaming uncontrollably in the morning and have tried to rip my uniform in half out of anger.

This takes into account additional retirement and insurance spending. I will be going from a job where I currently have a 100% employer-funded pension the I can roll over if I leave, $0 health insurance premiums, and $0 health insurance deductible, to a job with an 8% 401k match, $420/month insurance premiums, and a $1,500 deductible. They initially offered me $11,500 as a sign-on bonus to “help out” with relocation. Further discussion with the hiring manager revealed that the company’s relocation contractor isn’t typically capped at my grade, but since I live in AK they’re worried that it will be astronomical. I’ve countered their offer asking for relocation to be handled by their contractor but capped at a certain value. They said they would get back to me tomorrow. I feel like I’m being discriminated for the state I live in. My question is, should I even consider moving right now with rates and the housing market how it is? Am I stupid to walk away from my benefits?"

I had a really good interview yesterday for a sales role.   
 I do currently work in sales and view job hunting as a form of sales. 

Usually, after a pitch, I would email or message the client the next day. 

I want to do the same but I am worried would come off needy for an interview. 

Just want to send saying, “Thanks a lot for the interview and time yesterday. Looking forward to hearing back from you.”

Is this too much after one interview or is it best – especially if I am still trying to show off my own sales technique? 

Thanks"

I sent an email both days after calling (they didn't pick up). Today's email included information about any upcoming actions/emergencies that I have taken care of and made them aware of anything that needs to happen (from their side as I did my part). 

There is nothing I can do besides rest and hope to be better for tomorrow.

I made sure to check my emails before calling off sick and had urgent actions taken care of yesterday morning before I ended up calling off sick. So there was nothing of emergency and everything else could be left even until next week if needed (I plan to return tomorrow in decent health hopefully). 

Despite this, the manager calls and doesn't sound 'convinced' of my sickness and even though I clearly have a sore throat and can barely speak, they were still on the phone asking about multiple tasks THAT I REFERRED TO IN THE EMAIL I SENT!!!! I'm just so annoyed and upset at the lack of empathy I received.  Bearing in mind, I haven't called off sick in 6 months before this. 

Is this how a manager should act? Am I overreacting?"

Is this normal?,u/NegotiationFit2939,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ypu6vp/i_was_used_a_teaching_example_during_a/,jobs,"My firm has weekly meetings with all teams to go over where we are with projects/jobs. This week I was used as a teaching lesson and it made me very uncomfortable. The founder of the company and my boss pulled up my reach out  history for the week (basically a time stamped list of every email, text, and call I made) then went through what else I could have or should have done. For example, they pointed out I should have followed up my call with a text to the client, or I should have set a reminder to reach out to the client at a later time. When my boss goes over these types of things with me in private I’m totally fine with it, but to have my work picked apart in front of everyone was mortifying. Am I being too sensitive or is this extremely embarrassing for employees?"

Does the company laptop come pre-installed with all the software that you need to do your work? 

Will your employer allow you to install other software if it's not already installed when you receive your laptop?

Is it normal that, after (but not before) getting your equipment delivered to you by postal mail, you are required to send it out to a technician for configuration and installation of software, including software to track your time spent working on the laptop?

And is it the norm for a company to require remote employees get a new phone number and/or a new phone, but not supply them with a company phone?"
5,2022-11-08,Question for Hiring Managers,u/panda_inthewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ypuo0t/question_for_hiring_managers/,jobs,"I am in the 3rd stage of the interviewing process at a huge company, and this job will be life changing for me. The 1st round was a one way video interview where I answered questions like “Why do you want to work for our company, and describe your responsibilities in your last position” and “Describe a time you went above and beyond with customer service” and “Tell us about a time you were working on a professional project and things didn’t go as planned”. I nailed that, so they had me do 2 performance tasks, which I also nailed. Now I have scheduled a final interview which is a 1 hour zoom call with the hiring team. I was able to prepare for the first interview because I typed up my answers beforehand so I wouldn’t leave anything out. I can’t get away with that during the zoom call. 1 hour is a long time and I get easily flustered, so I have to prepare for this somehow.

My questions are what can I expect during this call? What difficult questions might I be asked? And what should I NOT talk about when giving my answers?

I am so nervous. Thank you for reading and your advice!"

Would it be weird for me to send a message to the manager on LinkedIn, maybe just to say that I've applied to it, I'm extremely excited about the position, and if there were any questions they wanted to ask me about my application, I'd be delighted to expand further on it, or should I say something else?

However, I am such an awful interviewer. I get so nervous, start talking way too fast, and start rambling. My voice naturally goes much higher when I'm nervous, I get too loud, I ramble, and I talk so fast it's hard to understand me (I naturally speak way too fast. Attended speech therapy for years as a kid before my parents gave up, lol. I have to be actively aware of my pace in normal conversations, but in interviews when I'm nervous, my natural pace pours out and I start speaking way way too fast). I also talk with my hands a lot and can't stop myself from peppering my sentences with shit like ""you know what I mean?"" or ""and yeah, so basically just \_\_\_\_\_"". I am ruining my chances because of how anxious I get. I prepare and feel ready, then get to the interview and just start rambling. idk how to fix this. I already struggle to be seen as an adult as a petite young woman who looks closer to 15/16 than I do as an adult. I'm not just saying this. My nervous-tick speech patterns just make me get viewed as even more young and inexperienced than I already get viewed as.

How can I employ tactics to make me seem as intelligent as I am, and calm my nerves before interviews? I know that seems like a weird thing to say, but it doesn't matter how prepared I can mentally be, I physically ruin it for myself by interviewing poorly. No matter how many interviews I go on, no matter how badly I want the job, I get anxious, shaky, and terrified every time."

Aside from nerdy figurines based on his movie interests etc., are there any really useful gifts anyone can recommend?

I’ve been under this naïve belief that working hard equals reward and it simply doesn’t. I’m finding myself in a job where I’m right at the bottom with a low wage and yet I’m having to tell everyone else what to do because they don’t know, and when it’s not that, other people are copying my ideas, asking for help from me and trying to stop me from working on anything exciting as they deem me as a threat. I’m not making this up, a fellow person on my team tried to stop me doing my job and actually underwent training to improve his graphic design skills once I started doing it because he felt threatened…he also just got promoted. Lastly, if anything ever goes wrong, the blame always appears to fall at my door, as though I’m the easiest one to blame it on.


I’m finding myself working beyond the scope of my role, I don’t seem to be eligible for promotion (my manager basically said 2-3 people can be promoted and mentioned me as number 3, 2 have and I haven’t heard any news about me). The thing is, working in this role is beginning to dig at my morale because I feel completely undervalued and to be honest, I don’t dislike authority when it’s well earned but I don’t like being told what to do and advised by people who simply don’t know anything!

My plan is to work about 12-14 months since I will be traveling after I save up the money and I am not planning to stay in either of these jobs long term. 

&amp;#x200B;

Company A is offering: 

&amp;#x200B;

base: 100k

Bonus: 10%

&amp;#x200B;

Company B: 

&amp;#x200B;

base: 101k 

no bonus

20k/year worth of RSU that vest quarterly 

&amp;#x200B;

If I am just interested in simply getting the most amount of money what would be the one to accept the offer of? Like I said, I’m not in for the long term. Just trying to get the most money out of and after one year or so of service I will leave to travel abroad. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I accept the one that offers the RSU does it mean that I get $5k every 3 months? 

Dumb question but is it guaranteed that I can sell the stock for sure? Does it ever occur that nobody wants to buy the stock of company B? And then in terms of fees what would roughly  be my net gain from the sell of the quarterly stock? I’ve never had a job that offered stock options so I don’t know much about them… 

&amp;#x200B;

What questions should I ask the recruiter of company B ? They made it clear that the stock vests quarterly and I can do whatever I please with it… sell it, keep it, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

What is making me kinda hesitant about company B is that: it has a small market cap, even though it’s a public traded company… and the stock has performed OK-ish in the last 5/10 years so I don’t know if I would be able to sell that stock if there is no demand for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for your thoughts and input in advance."

I thought of another plan which is a B.S. in Chemistry and an M.S. in Materials Science (my school has a program that lets you complete both of those in 5 years total). What should I do? What will I be more successful with? I want to be rich and have a good work life balance?

P.S. I regret all of this and wish I was a computer science major to begin with but it’s too late for this although I might do a Boot Camp sometime."

Good news or bad?,u/chet-sliceberg,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yq1ccs/hr_emailed_me_a_day_after_i_finished_my_final/,jobs,"On Monday I finished my final interview with this company and the next day, today, the recruiter in HR asked if I was available tomorrow for a call regarding the position. One of my two interviews with this company felt really great and the other was just ok in my opinion so I am not too sure how to gauge it.  I have never gotten a response after only a day for a position, earliest was 5 business days and it was a rejection.

The email seemed pretty positive since she used an exclamation point in sentence making it seem positive but I might just be reading too deep in it.

Does anyone know based on this quick response if it is a good sign or bad?

\[UPDATE\]:

I got an offer from this bank in the asset management division which was better than what I was expecting so I was definitely just in my own head. Thanks for all the support and feedback everyone!"

\-applied for job A and B a month ago. Both job A and B I'm very interested in doing it.

\-interviewed for job A a few weeks ago, but got rejected eventually.

\-After another few weeks leading up to present, just got an interview request for job B by a different recruiter. Not sure if he/she knows that I got rejected for job A already.

**Having a screening call for job B this week but the question is, should I tell the recruiter I actually interviewed for job A and got rejected as a conversation starter or just pretend as if A never happened unless they mention it first?** basically worried if I pass screening call, if they put me with the same hiring manager interview who rejected me for job A or something.

That is definitely the case right now in my job. I work in insurance claims and they won't allow us to make calls on our workload until mid way through the week, meaning that by Wednesday, I could still be working stuff from Friday night that came in after I got off. They feel like having us spend all of Monday/Tuesday and part of Wednesday doing nothing but answer calls is the better way to go. Everyone below upper management knows this is a bad idea, but it still keeps happening. The excuse is ""unprecedented volume."" By not being allowed to call anyone, that creates more irritable customers for us to deal with. They even offer OT, but much of the time the requirement for working that is answer the phone, not catch up on your work list. I get solid benefits and pay, but I think their business model is too extreme."

14,2022-11-08,Should I have been offered severance in this situation?,u/MelodicDetective,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yq3e3f/should_i_have_been_offered_severance_in_this/,jobs,"I'm looking for some general advice. My company just laid off a lot of employees this week. It was sudden and shocking. One upside is that the company is being pretty generous with the severance for those let go. 10 weeks pay plus they keep their health benefits for 4 months. Hopefully enough time to find new jobs.

 I was told yesterday that my role was eliminated but the company was not letting me go. I was being moved to another department and taking on a different role. At first, I was relieved to still be employed but I'm starting to rethink the situation because I was never given a choice plus I do not want this new position.

I'm basically taking over the job of someone who was let go. My best guess is that I was kept around because I'm less expensive. The other employee had been with the company longer and has an advanced degree while I didn't go to college. So I'm pretty sure they were being paid more and I'm the cheaper alternative. I understand the business decision but it does make me feel like I took someone's job from them.

My boyfriend's job also recently did a restructuring and his role was eliminated as well. He was offered the choice of taking a different job at the company or being let go and taking severance. While I'm in a similar situation, I was not given a choice. I was simply told that this was my new job. I didn't even sign anything or say ""yes, I want this job"".

Now, I know the company doesn't owe me severance pay or even a job but I am a little annoyed that my agency was ignored in this situation. I'm thinking of asking the talent team if severance is on the table for me if I also leave this week. They don't seem like the type to retaliate but I don't want to be fired with no severance for just asking.

In conclusion, my questions are:

**Should I even bother asking about the possibility of severance?**

**Should I ask someone in talent/hiring or my manager first?**

Thank you for any advice you might have. It would be truly appreciated!"
1,2022-11-08,How to followup after six rounds of interviews for director level position?,u/philly_golf,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yq3sa2/how_to_followup_after_six_rounds_of_interviews/,jobs,"I made it through six rounds of interviews. A few panel interviews, VPs, and EVPs. During the sixth interview we both agreed that the initial position had evolved into a larger role throughout the interviews. I was even told “we are trying to decide who needs you more on their team.” 

It has been seven days since the last interview. I have followed up with all necessary parties including the HR director who had been handling the interview process (post introduction). I missed an opportunity after the last interview to ask about timing, rather I just offered my availability for outstanding questions. 

I want to follow up with the HR/Talent Acquisition team tomorrow. What should I say, if anything? Is this common to wait for a week without an update? I realize this might be a red flag for some reading this. This is a publicly traded startup in an exciting emerging market. All executives were open about the disorganized nature of the business right now and part of my role would be to add order to the chaos.

I got my dream job working at a company I’ve been hoping to end up at but I think this company is burning me out. I haven’t been here for a full year yet. I work long hours… and I don’t get overtime. I’d say my average work day is around 10-12 hours.

A few reasons why I’m contemplating on quitting:

1. I didn’t really get properly trained on the processes of my team. There is no process doc or roles &amp; responsibilities doc to reference. I wish I had a mentor figure that could guide me.

2. My work was used as a teaching example in front of everyone with no anonymity and without my permission. 

3. It’s hard for me to relate to my team due to the nature of my identity described above. My coworkers also talk a lot of crap about other people so no doubt they’ve talked about me.

4. The workload is brutal. We are understaffed and forced to heavy up. As a result, we have no work life balance.

5. My previous employer reached out to me asking for me to come back.

6. The health insurance sucks.

Why I don’t want to quit:

1. This was my dream company and I’m worried what others would think if I leave so soon.

2. I’m thinking of waiting it out and seeing what happens. If they criticize in front of others, I’m curious if they’ll praise in front of others.

3. I don’t want to feel like a failure. I’m not performing at my best right now and I’ve always been known as a good worker. I have too much pride and want to show everyone that I’m capable of the job.

Does anyone even enjoy work? Should I give myself a time limit for when I’ll leave? Or should I just leave now…in this economy??"

Was there actually a time where things were stable and prices were not too high? Was there ever actually a time with less problems than in the last 10 years or so? Or are the news just an illusion and most of the times things are difficult for people?"

Tuesday morning I emailed 27 of the 60 something same-company agents in my state. 

7 responded within the first 2 hours. 3 more after that. 6 called me. 4 wanted to set up a meet sometime this week. 

No applications, no HR/middlemen, no interview. Just two people having a phone conversation, expressing expectations, and closing the deal. 

Had a job offer by lunch. 

I’ve spent my morning responding to 5 agents letting them know that I’ve had another offer. The fucking HIGH that comes with that is unreal. I only spent 24 hours unemployed. This must be what high level execs and in-demand roles feel like when they’re job hunting."

709,2022-11-09,Remote Work Job with Nothing to Do,u/Unusual-Tank-8919,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yqk6gr/remote_work_job_with_nothing_to_do/,jobs,"I have been at a remote job for a few months now. I maybe work 2 hrs a day, sometimes 3 hrs a day, sometimes I just don't have anything to do for days. But I have to log into the PC for at least 8 hrs a day. I am so ungodly bored in this job I feel like I'm becoming lazier. There is literally nothing more to do, I have asked for more work repeatedly out of pure boredom. It pays decently enough to cover housing, loan debt, food, savings, gifts for friends and families and even a vacation once a year. I just feel so bored. 

Would y'all prefer this type of job or a job that genuinely works you all the time and is in a fast paced environment? I'm early in my career and don't know if I just coast in a cozy job or look for more, I just feel unfulfilled. Thoughts?

Edit: I know how good of a job for some this would be and maybe it feels like I'm taking for granted this job. But I know what I'm capable of contributing and do not feel like I have the opportunity to contribute to society as a whole as much as I can. I feel obligated to use my talents and knowledge and degree from a morale perspective. I feel like this job is just cheating I guess. All the effort and energy and support my peers and family have put into me over the years just for me to sit here feels wrong. That is why I feel unfulfilled.

Edit2: I also wanted to add more about my background. In college I worked in academia research and development with the DoD which constantly challenged me where I learned several coding languages in addition to mechanical engineering, high level mathematics, and the processes involved in developing new technologies. Nothing that'd be used in combat and basically no security clearances required. Although I could have done more if I did apply for a security clearance. Before this job I was a very driven individual with high expectations for myself. Now I feel like a potatoe going bad in ur pantry cause some sunlight gets in. Very wasteful of resources and time.

Edit3: did not expect this post to blow up like this. I am not pming anyone anymore due to inbox having 500+ messages. Too much.  I wanted to thank you all for your suggestions. My plan of action as of right now is to sign up for courses online in areas that will help build up my career and if I still don't feel busy enough get a second job.

Edit4: I should add cause people are still commenting, I am severely overqualified for this position. Usually my job does take an entry level person all day to do the job, I just have a degree related to the field and worked in the industry the entire time I was getting the degree (5 years). This job doesnt even require a degree, but it is very good for me in terms of remote work. Someone close to me explained it that I have a lot of experience that allows me to do my job accurately that normally wouldn't be present for this job until 1-2years of doing it. The experience I already had is what makes the job not take me very long. But the pay is decent and I have time off.

Another reason I wasn't too happy with the job though, is that they have sm1 actively monitoring people's PCs, so I have to sit in front of the PC for the 6 hrs I do nothing just switching between email and other software. It's not the time off I don't like, it's the staring endlessly at a blank screen with nothing to do but being trapped into looking like I'm busy."

I basically accept EVERY opportunity I can get to work on one of my off days because I live across town and I'm reliable, I feel like my hard work is what keeps the restaurant running because I'm basically a workhorse and I believe I turn out AMAZING work in such a short amount of time because I listen to my own music while I work (Stuff like ""Shape of You"" and ""Love Yourself"" are OK, but it's NOT OK to have the same songs randomly playing on a loop punctuated by the same ads: it gets a bit maddening and I work better and faster if I don't have to listen to silence or ambient noises).

However, I feel like I could do more, but I'm scared that if I stop doing the work I would normally do, it's going to be tough to find someone else to take care of the work I would normally do.
When I came back after a month-long recovery from kidney surgery, I was essentially told by the store manager that they were basically counting the days until I came back because I was so fast, efficient, and work like a machine.

My current store manager is leaving next month to relocate her family up north and managing a different Sonic. Her brother will become the new store manager instead of the ASM: he's also a bit more relaxed than her and not such a stick in the mud about things. I also feel like she's BASICALLY cowed me into doing whatever's needed to be done, knowing that I won't say no, and I feel trapped because I took this job as a way to earn money as an in-between.

I want to be promoted, though, so I can call the shots, but yet alsohave a relaxed management style, but I'm not sure how to go about it!
Any advice?"

I work at a automotive group with 4 dealerships. For the past year and a half I have been running the multimedia department. Late last year after the IT guy left they put that responsibility on me as well. Early this year they added even more responsibility to me. I was struggling to keep up so I asked if could get an extra person to help me on the photo side of things which they agreed to. I hired a guy who was doing great. Well last month I was written up for missing two IT emails when I was super busy preparing for an installation of a new phone system. Someone got to them before for I could. Well the day I was written up my girlfriend stopped by to bring me lunch and hanged out in my private office for about 15 minutes while I was on lunch, waiting for her sister to drop off her car for service.  They added that to the write up. Ever since then they have been breathing down my neck. They said I was on my phone too much as I use it to reply to IT emails as fast as I can so I don’t miss anything. Well fast forward to yesterday they fired the guy that was helping me, with out telling me before hand, saying it was a management decision and then saying it was because of the economy. But this morning they had me set up about 15 new hires in a different department. I don’t know what they trying to do. My girlfriend thinks they are trying to make me quit or something. Any ideas?"

Update: it went well! I wasn't flustered at all, I answered the questions easily enough and I felt good. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll get the job. They're trying to fill this role quickly and I'm out of the country for the foreseeable future. I wish it wasn't the case because I think I'd excel at this job now that my jitters are gone.

I was hired for a Case Coordinator position, but my supervisor said they don't have enough new hires for a training class for that position, and in the meantime I should take the training for the position directly below the case coordinator. 
I've done the training, it ends on Friday, and I talked to my boss and she said to do the position below me until they get training classes up and running. They didn't have a time frame or more information.

I was not hired for the other position (customer service), and am confused on what to do. 
What should my next steps be? My husband thinks I should wait till November ends to see if there's any updates. 
I want to quit since I just found this out today."

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Comp**

* Base: $61.09/hr (that's after two 2% raises this year)
* Benefits decent, company also pays 100% of medical insurance premium
* Rotating schedule, pharmacy is open like 12 hrs a day
* Coworkers are cool, but new soon-to-be lead rph is kinda meh. dont really want this person as my supervisor.
* Pros: close-ish to home, my boss is cool, work is easy.

P**roposed Comp**

* Base: $66.25/hr + shift diff (TBD) (this is a 10%+ increase)
* Overnight schedule 7-on-7-off
* Benefits not amazing, retirement match kicks in after 2 YEARS but then company gives 2% of salary + 2% match
* Small community hospital, \~100 beds, I've done this exact job at a slightly larger hospital, so I know what I'm getting into
* Only apprehension for me is that they still have to hire 1 Rph and 1 tech for the other overnight week and I don't want to get in a situation where I'm training but then they cant hire anyone for X months and I'm stuck working a day shift. The whole appeal to me is the schedule of course.

At my current job there's a couple openings and I'm pretty sure if i end up leaving, they'll take one of these positions away from the department for budget reasons. 

I wouldn't mind staying if I got paid a bit more, so any way to leverage this and try to get my current employer to match?

&amp;#x200B;

Other factor is new job they are union employees - i've never been one so idk what this entials. But salary doesnt sound like it can be negotiated, is there anything else that could be? Maybe the shift diff or benefits? Any tips?

I’ve never struggled so much with a job. My last one, I had glowing reviews and received severance despite being a temp (laid off). Prior to that, I was personally recommended for larger projects and always got along well with my coworkers. 

I’ve been in my current role less than a year, and the feedback I receive is typically vague and doesn’t specify an incident (more of “it seems you… and I’ve gotten feedback from X that…”). If I try to gently broach for more, he’ll concede that I wasn’t given what I need to do the thing in question and will chastise me for not asking enough questions. From constantly moving targets to using outdated training materials I was given in onboarding, the issue comes down to me not communicating or asking enough questions, in his eyes. I am happy to receive constructive feedback and want to excel in this job, but the feedback completely catches me off guard. Usually, I know when I screw up, but here it’s completely unpredictable what I’ll be called out for. 

Has anyone else dealt with something like this? How did you navigate it?"

Out of the blue my manager called me yelling at me that “I’m putting her job at risk, she should be going to legal” &amp; “Im building a case against my company” &amp; “because of “teams messages” I’ve sent?? I grilled her on what the hell she was talking about but said I need to cool down let’s talk about it tomorrow.. 
it was incredibly inappropriate, caught me off guard, and made serious accusations with no explanations 

(The only teams messages I had sent were to a different colleague saying I was curious about said “KPIs” she (my friend who was fired) wasn’t hitting and I that I would be curious if they were ever tracked WHICH I KNOW THEY WERE NOT) this was weeks ago 

She calls me today and says “I cannot speak to you on the subject anymore but we have heard from areas in the company you’re giving (fired friend) private info about the company” which to me they’re trying to build a case against me.. this is also false I haven’t spoken to my friend who was fired about any details. 

1.  Can they use these teams messages to “try to build a case” that I’m working with my friend to go against my company? Ps The person who was fired is asking for severance and May press charges

2. We haven’t spoken outside of work about work related things so it sounds like they’re grasping at straws here 

3.  They have never once told anyone we can’t speak to the person who was fired 

4. Exactly one week ago I went to HR stating my concerns of these KPIs and said I would like to see what/where mine are so I’m not out in the same position. I was hoping it would have been confidential but.. 

5. To add one more layer of the mess I was sent a one drive folder in error of all my colleagues salaries (additional Al reason why I went to HR last week)

I applied for a retail job in fragrances, which is what I am passionate about outside of music, and got the job last Friday.

I negotiated for $19/hr plus 2% commission, which is pretty high hourly for retail as far as my experience goes. I thought maybe I scared them off since it had been about 5 days since I was told to expect an email to fill out information. 

I am not in a good financial spot at the moment &amp; only have enough to pay for next month’s bills so I have been using credit cards and staying home. With that being said, I assumed I wouldn’t be qualified and applied for an “Account Manager” position at this local company (salary listing was 40k-63k). They reached out to me today for an interview tomorrow &amp; 20 minutes after setting up the interview I received the forms from the retail job.

I can always move up to management at the retail job if I work hard enough &amp; I need money now, but the AM position would help me build a career in business faster if I were to get the job.

What might be the best course of action in this situation?

TDLR: Guaranteed $19/hr+ retail job or interview process with a job directly related to my major that is not guaranteed."

I *was* working where I listed but there's a several month gap on the background check because I started there as a temp.

I'm really freaking out and worried the job offer will be rescinded. I found some tax info to send over, but feel like an idiot for forgetting about this. It was from nearly 10 years ago when this happened. Has anyone had experience with this situation? Am I screwed?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:

Thanks everyone - I don't know if I'm overthinking things or not. This is the largest company I've gotten an offer with and I've heard some places can be oddly finicky with info. 

I did reach out to my HR contact at the company and let them know and sent them some info. They said they would reach out to the background check company so hopefully they will just verify. I've gotten federal clearance with the same info but you never know. Obviously I need to work on keeping better records. 

Update: I cleared the background check and start Monday so everything is fine! I was just being paranoid."

I’ve been moved around laterally because I can do/learn whatever is needed at the time for the company. I’ve had my current manager for ~7/8 months, and he said he doesn’t think I’m “ready” for a promotion to a more senior position, but said I’m doing a fantastic job and has no major feedback on doing anything different - he said this about 2 months ago. He spoke to my previous manager who also said I was so great and he was sad to see me go from his team. 

I’ve had an increase in responsibilities between these role changes as well. Now I don’t know if it’s just because I haven’t worked with him long enough, they don’t want to pay me more, etc. 

I saw a job posting from my job on their website for the senior position I would like to go for. I went through every bullet point in the “responsibilities” section and listed examples of times I have fulfilled those responsibilities, and went through the “skills” section and made note that I fulfill the required skills. 

I set up a meeting with my manager to show him this and just ask if there are any other concrete reasons why I am not eligible for a promotion. I would like a firm answer as to why, I do not think a vague statement that I am not “ready”, followed up by I’m doing a fantastic job is sufficient. 

Just wanted some insight if anyone thinks this is a good idea or has alternate advice."

Don't want to keep it without an explanation because I love everyone I work with including my boss...but don't want them to feel like they're shorting me because it is government and leaves no room to negotiate a higher salary. I also want them to give letters of recs and references in the future. We're also extremely short-staffed and only will be busier as holiday approaches..how can I find a safe ""cop-out"" reasoning that won't damage relationships?  


  
\----

I've been at my current job for just shy of 2 years, I work as an IT engineer in government and absolutely love the workplace. My boss is literally one of the best I've ever had in terms of being understanding, mostly lax, and never one to raise his voice (testimony from myself and others who have been here for 5+ years).

While the pay is below average for industry standards, it's in a LCOL area and amazing health benefits costing me essentially nothing. Inflations has made affordability a little harder, but rent housing was still cheap. However, I've come to realize that while I've never had the ""Sunday scaries"", I was not going to grow from this position. I am babied and not given opportunities to take on projects that my previous job had. I can't even recall anything significant in the past 6 months, it feels like mush and I found out recently that while the govt budget has more than enough to promote me, I was ""possibly offered"" the promotion pending my interview a month from now. I felt a little offended that I was not immediately worth the promotion given my ""time served"" experience, not to mention my job duties already fits the higher level and requirements.

This wake up call prompted me to re-apply elsewhere just to test the waters, and I was miraculously offered the first job I interviewed. This job was literally **double** my current salary and **2 levels** higher than my current position that I was ""possibly offered"" a promotion. Downsides to this offer was that it is in one of the highest HCOL areas in my state. Rent alone for a studio would essentially pull me back down to what I'm currently making, but I plan on finding roommates eventually (given short timeframe) and it'll pull me back to making more than my current job. This job not only offer new challenges, but I'll exercise supervision which is daunting but I know will be good for my career.

I've signed the conditional offer letter for now since they still have to do a background check, and I don't plan on telling my employer and putting in my notice until I sign the final offer.

This is a job with people I've loved working with, and I'm having a hard time just telling the truth. I know people say I'm not obligated to give an explanation, but I am still relatively new to the industry and would like for these people (like my boss) to give letters of recommendation and serve as references if I were to need them in the future. I'm afraid that he wouldn't want to if I were to tell him I found a better opportunity elsewhere since we're extremely short-staffed and approaching the holidays.

I wanted to cop out and just say there was some personal emergencies that requires me to step away from the job, but it's also likely they will be contacted by my current soon-to-be employer about my employment status so it probably would be dumb to not say I haven't found a replacement. I'm so scared to tell the truth I may actually have a nervous breakdown in the room. Is there a way I can keep it vague without telling him I have a job lined up already?"
3,2022-11-10,Why is so hard in the job market right now? Anybody else struggling?,u/Federal_Fondant_1985,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yr6tg6/why_is_so_hard_in_the_job_market_right_now/,jobs,"So most recently I had a really nice job lined up. Monday to Friday… 9-5 hours. No holidays. Great. Worked there about 5 months, broke my knee, wasn’t eligible for FMLA, and my disability insurance ended yesterday. So I’ve just sitting around for months applying to jobs. I think I’ve applied to over 500, maybe even 1,000 jobs at this point. How many have a actually gotten responses from? Maybe 25% &amp; most were automated rejection letters. 

I graduated college July 2021, with an associate’s in hospitality management. And I worked as a server for two &amp; half years. My resume honestly looks like I’m a big quitter. Sever for two and half years, then I did a college internship. Obviously internship was temporary, then I worked in a toxic hotel for 8 months, and left for the 9-5 i mentioned previously. I had no intention of leaving ny old job. But it was out of my control. So now I have short stints at jobs on my resume, and it looks like I just haven’t worked since July. 

I’m basically unemployable at this point it seems. Can’t even get a call from a minimum wage position. When I finally do get a response, they ask “so what have you been doing since July?” Recovering from injury, but then they get scared that I’m not physically capable. Job hunting SUCKS. Nobody responds, interviewers themselves are unprofessional, and everything is so low pay. I truly won’t work for less than $20/hr. And now my biggest gripe is that every job posted is SEASONAL 😂😂 I think I’m going to sign up for unemployment. Job hunting is stressful, and with every interview I get less and less interested. I’ve lost hope in the process"

My salary is decent in a field with many *many* candidates and few opportunities.

Despite this, every day is a struggle to motivate myself. It's like pulling my own teeth to get anything done, including things I enjoy. Since I'm quite good at working smart, not hard, I'm getting by and receiving positive feedback, but I know I'm wasting so much time every day.

6,2022-11-10,I (25f) feel like I'm being phased out of my company,u/lost_wastoid,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yrakcy/i_25f_feel_like_im_being_phased_out_of_my_company/,jobs,"I started my first graduate job in May this year. The job is in PR and I had no experience, but the company offered me a ""communications assistant"" role because they were impressed by my personality, drive and writing skills. The contract is one year. They gave the job I interviewed for to a girl my age - we'll call her Betty - who had a bit more experience in PR. We are the first juniors the company hired, so it's still a start-up really. The job is completely remote and I am the most junior person on the team. I've noticed that no one at the company really knows my job title, and I've been called various different things during my time here. 

When I first started I really enjoyed the job - aside from remote working which I hate. I felt included, I felt like I could speak out in meetings and I was close to my boss and Betty. Everyone on the team was really welcoming. My boss caught up with me weekly just to chat and I felt like he was really invested in my career. I did lots of filling in spreadsheets, but I also wrote press releases which my boss told me was impressive for someone with virtually no experience in the industry. I felt like a valued member of the team. I sometimes had quiet days but someone was always coming to me with something to help with. My boss was constantly raving about how amazing Betty and I were.

A couple of months ago the company decided to hire some new juniors. The juniors would be hired in the same position as Betty, Junior Publicist. Having been there 6 months I was a little surprised at this as I felt like I'd learnt a lot about PR and had loads to offer. I felt I could easily do the job Betty was doing, but I decided not to say anything as I'm still so new to the corporate world and didn't want to rock the boat. I trusted my bosses.

As soon as the two new juniors started, my life at work changed completely. Betty and I are no longer friendly, in fact, her interactions with me are sometimes openly hostile. She's been told by our bosses to take a leadership role over the junior staff and does this by constantly micro-managing me to a ridiculous degree and calling other juniors out in the group chat with all 9 members of staff in it if they've missed something minor off a spreadsheet. I've been bumped down the ranks to the point that I barely have any communication with anyone anymore apart from the other juniors sometimes and one of the PR managers. My boss no longer catches up with me or speaks to me at all, I feel uncomfortable speaking up in internal meetings and I've been completely dumped from any external meetings.

The new staff are working across lots of clients and involved day-to-day in the running of things, and all 3 of the juniors are in external meetings all week. My main job is to update an internal contacts list which is basically one big spreadsheet where I sometimes have to update email addresses and UMVs. I'm utterly miserable and completely demoralised. Betty talks to me about how she's getting promoted and has been chatting to our boss and I feel like a complete idiot. My boss spoke to me briefly last time I saw him and he seemed pleased with how I was doing but that's the last time we talked.

I don't expect to be centre of attention by any means but it seems like I'm not needed at all now. I'm grateful to have a job of course and I'm lucky, I know that, but it's making me feel really down. I don't want to log on to start work because I feel invisible to these people. Some days I barely do anything because my mental health is not the best due to this situation, and no one notices me doing nothing. I have a lot to offer and I'm a good team member and I just don't know what to do. I worked in hospitality from when I saw 17 to 24 so that's the kind of environment I'm used to. Any thoughts?

TL;DR my life at work has changed completely since 2 new juniors were hired above me"

I've been unhappy with my work situation for some time - so much so that I haven't been in for a week. 

During that time I've been searching for new jobs and got an offer which I am prepared to take.

I don't know how to carve out a resignation letter due to multiple stresses - distance, bad working conditions, mental health - that's all added up to my choice to leave. 

I'm also afraid that if I state I left due to mental health reasons (my new employer does not know about), if my new employer calls my old boss and finds out I've been skipping work then I'm toast (I told new employee I was quitting due to distance which is kinda true but not the whole story).

1,2022-11-10,How to prove that I have SEO experience? 🧐,u/cookiesandcream99,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yrbywn/how_to_prove_that_i_have_seo_experience/,jobs,"I work as an editorial manager. I have been affected by mass layoffs at my company.  I searched for jobs and all similar roles  require my type of skills and experience (handling publications) plus SEO skills. The exception: jobs that involve editing and not online publications, but in the city I live in, these editing jobs are very rare. Relocating isn’t an option due to my family commitments, neither is starting from scratch and going for an entry-level job. 

My full-time job doesn’t involve SEO but my side hustle does. For the past 3 years, I ran a website and did comprehensive SEO keyword research and wrote articles. This led to articles ranking on page 1 of Google and the website reaching 30k organic visitors a month (ie. successful SEO). 

However, currently due to an issue with ads, since last month my website traffic has been negatively affected and any SEO expert who searches my website using tools will see a 90% decline in traffic. Some background on the issues with the ads: my website’s ad network suggested adding more ads and I agreed, this led to technical problems and even after we have removed the excess ads it would take some months to regain the huge loss in traffic. 

So I can’t use my side hustle to prove I have SEO experience for now. Though some of the articles I wrote following SEO strategies are still ranking on page 1 of Google, which shows that I have the skill, the ones which had many ads have lost their rankings. It just doesn’t look like a good example to show on my resume.  

How else can I prove I have this skill/experience? 

I can do some freelance work but SEO is an area where you won’t see results until several months later, so I’d only be able to write on my resume something like “wrote SEO articles” instead of giving concrete examples like “wrote SEO articles, leading to x% increase in organic traffic” which is the recommended format for resumes. 

Any thoughts?"

I’m currently looking for a remote job, based in the UK but can be anywhere.

I have had lots of luck landing interviews and jobs for in person jobs so I know I am well qualified but for remote jobs obviously a lot more people apply. I am wondering if I need an outstanding CV to stand out from the rest or if it’s just a numbers game where I need to just apply for as many as I can.

The second offer is from a tech startup. They sell a very stable product, they are in a growth phase, and senior leaders (and my own research) have confirmed they have raised money to be funded for 3 years at least. This is the counter I have received after declining the first offer:

**Offer Two (Counter after decline):**

* 95K base salary
* 50% of salary in stock options (so 47.5K in addition to base salary)
* Fully remote
* 2 bonuses a year
* 4 weeks vacation
* I'll be a manager in this role

Both jobs are interesting. The hybrid offer is appealing because I'm an outlier. I love people, feed off their energy, and being in the office would allow me to be motivated and brainstorm. However, the work I'll be doing wouldn't be as high-level as the second opportunity. The tech company I'll be working with other leaders and have some space to grow a lot faster, since it's a startup for sure.

I’m looking for some information and help with this decision. I appreciate any feedback or advice."

353,2022-11-10,Job is making payroll change. Told all employees first paycheck in January will be half. We're all still working.,u/Dick__Dollars,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yrfu8n/job_is_making_payroll_change_told_all_employees/,jobs,"My job currently pays us 24 times a year. The 15th and the 30th of every month. They have announced that in 2023 they are switching to Bi-weekly paychecks. So 26 slightly smaller paychecks a year but same salary, fine. 

According to them, the way they pay us today is just-in-time. Meaning our paycheck on the 15th is compensation for work in that month up to the 15th. Paycheck on the 30th is payment for work from the 16th-30th/31st, and so on... There's no buffer. 

With the switch, they will be paying us in arrears, meaning the paycheck I get today is payment for two weeks of work but starting 3 weeks ago, with a week period of their payroll process... And so on, paid every 2 weeks. 

All that is fine and I can agree operationally why they're doing this, but in order for them to make that switch, **they announced that our first check next year will be half**. They are having us work our salary jobs full time, but our first paycheck will be half because they're building in that one-week buffer. Their justification is that when we quit, we will get that one week back. I've experienced this when starting a new job that pays this way, but in the middle of employment? 

This doesn't sound right. Is this legal? We're not hourly. If we start out this way, everyone at the company is getting docked half a paycheck for 2023. They're not closing the business for a week to do this. We're all still working full time. They say in 2024 our first paycheck will be back to normal so it will all be fine, but not only is every paycheck smaller now, but our first paycheck is cut in half so 2023 we all take an income loss.

Can someone explain why this is legal or an experience with this? This is a well known private company, so I'd imagine they found some kind of legal justification."

I (27m) have been feeling confused about some things happening at work. My job is working for a director in an office and helping coordinate different safety issues, and anything else that comes up. I have been working at this job for over a year, and recently noticed a lot of people in the building know who I am, but I don’t know anyone.

My boss is on the road most of the time so I work independently and really only talk to our other locations. This combined with me being an introvert I don’t really meet a lot of the people in the building. 

Some things happened recently and it was recognized by upper management that I wasn’t getting proper training/ being utilized. After this happened I’ve noticed a lot of people I’ve never me talk to me like they know me. Also in passing I said hi to someone and kept walking with my headphones in. The person was walking with someone and I overheard them say “thats Mr. Invisible he’s been here over a year and…”. Didn’t catch the rest, but that one made me really want to self analyze.

My question is does this all sound like I’m being perceived as rude, or weird? I try to talk whenever the chance arises I’m just a very quiet person until I get to know people. This whole situation has me concerned my introverted ways have hurt my career."

Hindsight is 20/20, and the store has basically been pawned off to me full-time, leaving me time for nothing, while she's able to live her life. I've pretty much neglected all my responsibilities and my well-being for this place. I asked for a reduction in hours and she freaked out on me saying I'd ""fuck her over"" because of this. She reached out over text a bit later saying that she's stressed because of personal things in her life. Apart from my responsibilities at home, I'm a college student who's been offered an opportunity to jump-start my career, and was basically told to choose between my current job and that. The decision was not a hard one to make, so I decided that I'd get paid one last time and ghost the place, but I've never been paid on time once. Apart from that, she winds up sending me the money through Venmo. None of this bodes well and the atmosphere gets heavy when she comes through the door.

I had 3 wonderful interviews, including one intensive collaborative exercise. All went great and then I had a reference check. My references reported they were pleased to provide glowing recs, and I have every reason to believe that's what happened.

Now, 3 days with radio silence. I had sent along (with my 2 references) a letter of rec that my ex boss had given me. It didn't have his contact info on it but there was a line at the bottom that said ""If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.""

I'm paranoid that the hiring manager secretly would've called him as an additional reference and if she did, that'd be **BAD**. Reason being — the guy is a totally vindictive creep. Not only did he try to illegally convert me from a FT employee to a 1099 freelancer when I came back from Maternity Leave but he also (after I moved on to another company) made threats to another employee that was leaving that if he found out a past employee had poached her, there would be serious consequences (she DID leave to come to my agency but she'd seen the job posting independently and applied without my knowledge).

QUESTIONS:

1) I'm in CA, does a prospective employer need to get permission before doing an employment history check or contacting past employers?

2) If my new prospective employer called my old boss, what is he legally allowed to say and is there any recourse if he ruins this for me? 

3) What is the likelihood she randomly called him? Feeling really down, I have been SO invested in this opportunity / interview process..."

I know this varies from company to company and affects the tech giants and newer startups more, but its still a concern. I spoke with the recruiter who told me they have never done layoffs and that their own niche/structure is highly competitive.

I got a job offer out of state, and my current job countered with a slightly higher salary ($1K-$6K).

I want the new job, but how can I best ask for a slight bump? I know they are open to negotiation. Problem is that I don't really have time for a phone call with my hours.

Should I email saying I'm interested in the offer but wondering if they can match my counter?

Thank you for the help!"

Their website link is (https://www.evolutioninternationalco.com/contact-us) they have multiple job posts under linkedln etc! They are a multi level marketing scheme. The Address its under is ( 690 8th Ave, New York, NY 10036) has been proven by other Reddit posts that it’s a scam company. 
I’ve gone to their zoom job “interview” to clarify my suspicions, and it’s a joke lol they are looking for vulnerable people mostly recent college graduates such as myself to join their scheme. I didn’t realize they were a scam when I initially applied through LinkedIn, they sent a text massage and then emailed me a zoom link, which was odd. So when I looked up the address that location is closed. During the interview, they didn’t even answer basic questions, just talked about how they have so many applicants and clients, to seem important. The director is this women named Sydney, And the person who sent me a text massage is under the name Mandi (the HR Director)

I’m Muslim-American, and work in tech.

I work as an Implementation Specialist for a tech company in San Francisco, CA. 

My whole career has been in tech, and I’ve worked at a number of tech companies where I feel totally out of place.

I have a small beard, and I can feel that colleagues are not as comfortable with me as other employees, even though I try to be as social as possible. 

I also have to work with customers a lot, and because I’m not as technical as the customers want me to be, they are often really rude with me during Zoom calls, etc. 

Sales reps at my company are also not very friendly with me because they feel I’m not a typical tech employee that should be working with their customers (due to technical skills, and appearance/very long foreign sounding name)

At first, I thought it was just the company, but I have worked at three different SaaS companies and the culture is very similar. 

I feel high stress during Zoom calls with customers because of my lack of technical skills.  

You may be wondering how I keep getting hired. I am very well spoken and have a really strong Linkedin profile and resume which I think oversells me more than the way I actually work.

I think I’m also just concerned with the stress of doing many customer calls during the week, being talked to rudely, and also the general culture of San Francisco tech companies that ask you to add pronouns, promote LGBT, etc. 

When I previously worked at Google as a contractor, I felt this way less. 

What I have considered:

- Leaving tech entirely and working as a trucker (concerned with this option because I don’t know where I can make the same money as tech) 

- Moving to a conservative state in the US and working for a non-California company where family values are more accepted

- Staying in California, but working at a large company where practicing Muslims are more
accepted (Facebook, Google, Microsoft, etc.)"

Did it for 3 years but left becuase I was burnt out and wanted to try a new field of work which was warehousing. From 2018-2022 I've hopped around multiple warehouse jobs and I've had only one that was competent for nearly 3 years. My last warehouse job I just quit after 3 days today becuase of bad experience and a wake up point for myself from another employee there, and at this point in my life I need a job that is secure in benefits. PTO/ Health insurance, etc. And this job didn't have it at all, but the pay was the highest I got in warehousing so far. The precious warehouse job I had for almost 3 years was going in the right direction with adding benefits but the president tore it under the ground to the point they let everyone go despite efforts to keep everyones jobs.

Now I'm seriously considering going back to being a food Runner. I found a country club close by with a good starting pay and benefits. I contacted one of the managers and was told if they still need someone they'd give a call. However I can always go back to my first job too. I Left on good terms and also found out a person that was being pretty much a snake behind my back before I left, left the company and I always told myself that if there ever was a time I'd go back there is if he wasn't there and it happened. I'm thinking about contacting HR and letting her know I want to come back and see the offer they can give me, but I also feel like waiting out and seeing if the other country club is still hiring. What do you guys think I should do? Wait for the new country club to get back to me on their availability or return to my old one with quickness?"

He then called and told me I was getting a “break from being scheduled” because my coworkers said I had “bad vibes” LMAO? What? I was expecting a “you’re not performing well” or “you just aren’t a good fit” but letting me go because my coworkers decided they don’t like me? Three of which won’t even be working at the store by January (there’s only 6 employees total). Am I an ass for being offended? He never mentioned my productivity so I know I’m doing well at my job. He said he would call and reconvene with me in about a week (he put all of my shifts next week in a “shift pool” that no one is taking) and I’m hoping by then I can tell him I’ve accepted a full-time position elsewhere.

Yesterday Offer A said they'd reach out to schedule an interview ""soon"", they're urgently hiring, and I'd start within 1-2 weeks of the interview if it goes well. Offer B is more preferable to me for various reasons, but today the hiring agent said the company might take 1-5 weeks to respond about scheduling an interview.

I see a lot of people saying to never stop applying until the job is secured, and I can do that. But what I'm concerned about is whether it's a bad idea to turn down Offer A (assuming they get back to me first) in hopes that Offer B will hire me. Neither is really *bad*, per se, but B just sounds like such a sweet gig... 50% higher pay/hr, 10 month contract so I can have an easy juncture to change course without it looking bad, and part-time so I can scope out similar opportunities instead of committing permanently to something I've never really done before (I have some experience, but it's all small volunteer stuff).

Is it too much of a gamble to hope for Offer B to hire me? Is it acceptable to start at Offer A, then dip in my first couple weeks if Offer B hires me? I *think* I have a decent chance at finding something even if both fall through; Offer B came to me, Offer A called back 10 minutes after I sent an app, and I'm submitting 10+ apps per day (starting two days ago).

**TL;DR:** (Assuming both want to hire me) Less favorable job will likely want to get me started in 1-3 weeks, but more favorable job says it'll take 1-5 weeks just to interview and then who knows. Is it smart to turn down less favorable job or no?"

I haven't been contacted by very many employers, been ghosted by a few for interviews as well. Today I finally had a phone interview with a company I'd be very pleased to work for, and they asked why I was no longer with my last company... I was already nervous, forgetting to breathe and so I probably bombed this one but for next time I'd like some advice how to answer. 
I told the truth, which is that I don't really know what happened. One day I had a mid-probation interview and they said everything's going really well, then 2 days later I'm tossed out the door. The reason they gave was that I asked too many questions, which oddly is something the manager had previously commended me on. I'm the kind of person who likes to understand the what and why behind things, and never received a handbook on what the policies were so I had to constantly inquire so I could know I was doing things right. 
I hear typically you can just say ""it didn't work out/ not good fit"" but I feel like that makes them wonder more about the Why. And imagination can be worse at filling in the gaps than the truth. Considering I didn't get fired for any extreme breach or valid reason I thought it might be better to elaborate on it as much as I know, which really isn't much. 
Was that a bad idea? Should I stick to the vague answer in the future? Thanks for any advice."

I don’t think she’s going to fire me until my full 90 days are up but I cannot last that long. I’ve been applying to jobs like crazy but with all the recent layoffs in addition to numerous companies being on a hiring freeze I haven’t heard back from very many. I’m considering just quitting as I have about two months rent saved up and just paid my November rent. My next paycheck will cover December. I feel like I’ve reached my breaking point. I don’t want to have to move back in with my parents who are 2000 miles away but I don’t think that will happen if I truly work hard to get another job. I feel like if I can’t even put my full focus into finding another job because I don’t even have time to schedule interviews or prepare due to my current role. I’m going absolutely insane I started crying today in the office and had to go to the bathroom just because my manager was being so verbally abusive to me. Nobody says anything or cares. HR didn’t care. Any advice would be appreciated. My parents will be furious at me but I’m starting to feel like I just need to leave. I know I can make the money through nannying jobs and bartending in the meantime. Is this career suicide? Just seeing if anybody can relate or has experienced this in the past."

My work-life balance is excellent, and my starting salary is good. But I still have one huge problem with work: I'm bored most days. 

I have probably 2-4 hours of actual ""work"" to do every day. If I actually concentrate and get into a flow state, I can get all my work done in under 2 hours. Then i'm left with the rest of the day to do nothing. I've been teaching myself how to use our companies SPICE simulation software, but i'm starting to run opuit of things to do.

1,2022-11-10,Do background checks involve verifying all titles/roles within a company?,u/thirddegreebirds,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yrztai/do_background_checks_involve_verifying_all/,jobs,"I know it's common knowledge that when a prospective employer is doing a background check and calls your present/past employer, they verify your title and years worked. But how specific do they get (or are allowed to get), exactly? Do they verify *all* titles you've held and the start/end dates for each title? 

I ask because at my current job (my only job in the industry so far), I've worked in 3 different roles with 3 different titles. However, the lengths of time I've been in these roles do not at all match the lengths of time I've had the actual titles. For example, I was working in one of these roles for over 6 months before I got a title change to reflect it. I also continued working in the capacity of the previous role, despite my title changing. There has been so much uneven overlap that it probably makes my resume extremely confusing to look at from an employer's POV. 

Ideally, on my resume, I'd like to just disregard the dates I had the official titles and instead go by the dates I actually worked in those roles – otherwise I'm either just selling myself short in the experience department, or making my resume unnecessarily complicated to look at. Can I do this, or is this something a background check can investigate?"

Yesterday, the office manager tells me that she and owner want me to take on a new project— to design the front of our office building. 

Think landscaping, brick color, awnings, etc.

It sounded like something I could do! 
Make a floorplan drawing of the front of the building and another drawing to show a front-facing view of the building.

Then today, the fucking owner comes in and demands the world. 

She wants me to not only do hyper-realistic versions of those drawings, but also a another one. The way that it was described to me yesterday was that it was purely for visual purposes AKA draw up some lines and colors I think would look nice. But, the way my boss came in today and described it was more like a full-blown project with much more technical details to create realistic renderings. 

Do I think I can do it? Yes— even though I know it will be tricky, since this will be my first time doing a rendering of this scale and complexity and with the software they want me to use.

Was I trained or hired to do this at all? No.

She just started being rude as fuck after that. She was all like ""we hired you because you’ve done these types of drawings before (no, not really)."" I apologized, but said that I thought she wanted me to do a floorplan and a regular drawing. She replies snarkily, ""no, we want you to do architecture."" I wasn’t hired to be an architect!

And now her entire demeanor and the questions she’s asking me gives off vibes that she’s like questioning like my abilities and experience over this. Wtf.

Just feels unfair since this is a project outside of the scope of my job.

Any advice?🙂"

If I find something better I won't hesitate to jump ship because as I said their staffing issues aren't my problem, however I really don't like the idea of using him as a reference.

Im 27 years old. This is my first workplace where I have been a salesman for 3 years and now a manager of the electronics department for also 3 years.

I love being a salesman, but having this much responsibility at this age is getting on my nerves. I feel like my mental health and my freedom is suffering and taking hits each day.
 I need something where my personal life isn't destroyed (I read emails and think about my job while on a holiday) and I can do something in the afternoon after work.

Is it okay to step down,take a break, find some other salesman job while I learn a new skill( like programming) and then after years maybe return as a manager?

I would take a smaller paycut ofc, but tbh I would feel happier. 

Thanks for the answers!"

I wanted opinions on what you all think about new employees using their accrued PTO within a few weeks of starting their job? Especially if hired around this time during the holidays?

Is it seen as unprofessional to request days off when you have just started? I was having a discussion with a younger family member and they said they wouldn’t use their PTO until after 6 months of working on the job even if they were hired during this time; but the way I see it is if you have the PTO and your manager approves of it’s use, then why couldn’t you use it within a month or so of starting the job?

What do you all think?


EDIT: Thanks for the responses everyone! I see it seems to be 50-50, but most people are on the 'Use the PTO if you have PTO end'. Thanks again!"

I was doing GREAT (challenged yet accomplished) and felt very supported by leadership. We then merged into a larger org and new exec leadership was brought in. 

The head exec had somehow heard of me and tried to poach me into a different org. I ultimately declined — I didn’t say this to them, but there was no clarity in the job description and I wasn’t willing to abandon what I built. 

A few months later I am the only person from my small org on a call with this head exec, and they start berating me about something they consider a mistake. Now, I completely agree with their position (and had done EXACTLY what they said I should have done), but I was so thrown by the time I couldn’t stand up for myself. Finally someone else got on the call and the tone changed, but since then I have been terrified to speak up in their presence.  

We are all pretty much remote, and I have to go to their city office for a workshop with them and a couple colleagues in January. 

I wonder if it’s worth getting coffee with them and trying to crack this nut? Do I share that frankly they intimidate me? I’m really tired of second guessing myself and pivoting to get their approval. They’re known around the org as a bully, it’s not just me. 

Has anyone else experienced this and tried to change the dynamic? 

TL;DR I’m scared of a bully exec, is it worth trying to be very real with them and repair this dynamic?"

Ive been applying to jobs and nanny agencies, I had an interview on Tuesday with an agency and found a job that I really wanted and got excited about.

The recruiter for the company said she thought id be a great match and would ""present"" me to the family early on that same day because Im looking to start ASAP. We had a nice email exchange and at 5pm Tuesday she let me know she presented me and would let me know As soon as she heard anything.. I thought it would soon because that family needs a nanny ASAP.

Anyways, I followed up on wendsay evening asking if she had any updates and hadn't heard back.. So I followed up again on Thursday to see if she heard anything, maybe she didn't get my previous email? And still haven't heard anything. Now its Friday and I haven't heard anything yet. Im wondering if she Ghosted me? If its just taking extra long for the family to respond? Or what I should do ? Im worried because I really want this job or at least to get a 2nd interview for it. What should I do?

The work itself is not quite what I was expecting. It is mind numbing and so boring and I don’t think I can make it much longer doing the tasks. Would it be too soon to talk to my boss about what the future of my job duties will include? If I knew there was hope for better tasks I think I could manage to stay a bit longer until it got better. But if there’s no hope for change I feel like I want to just leave as soon as possible. I don’t want to make myself look bad by bringing this up so soon since starting but the work is brutal on me.

I answered and the guy knew my name and previous employers which obviously you can get from my resume. He asked if I was a US Citizen and what positions I was looking for...But honestly not sure why he started with asking what I was looking for instead of telling me what position he was trying to fill. He said he had a Drupal position available but my experience didn't match what he needed. He was hard to hear as well. I had to ask him to repeat himself a few times. 

He then said that his company does work with my previous employer and was able to name the guy who replaced me at my position. That was a bit weird to me because he then asked about who else worked at my previous employer...I gave him the first name of the CEO and IT guy I worked with. He asked for last names and I said I didn't know. Obviously I knew, but that's when it felt fishy. He then said ""is her last name (insert name here)"". I said no, that doesn't sound right. It wasn't right actually. 

He asked me what my salary was and I told him that I don't give out that information. He knew what area I lived in or at least the city that I work near. Which is odd because I don't have that information on my resume. Unless they researched my current job. He asked me why I wanted to leave my current position as well. He said he would put my name in for other positions if we had them available...I said okay and then he said I wouldn't fit the current position he was offering. All of the questions he asked were of a personal nature and didn't mention anything regarding the actual job description.

The weird thing is I remember a couple months ago I received a call and the guy I spoke to then said the exact same thing...That he had a Drupal position to fill, worked with my previous employer, etc...

So i'm wondering if this person is just trying to get information for another purpose? It's especially weird that they were asking about my previous employers first and last names."

7,2022-11-11,Got ghosted after being hired?,u/candyalpacas2,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ysosa5/got_ghosted_after_being_hired/,jobs,"So I spent about 4 months at an office job that was ruining my mental health, so a few weeks ago I started my search for a new job because I couldn’t take it anymore. I interviewed for a warehouse position at Chewy nine days ago, and they hired me on the spot- did a background check, drug test, and took a photo for my badge. They said assuming the background check and drug test came back clean, I would get a text within a few days with shift options and a start date. I passed the background check and got my copy via email the same day. I was planning to stay at my office job until I got a confirmed start date at the warehouse, but the next day something happened at work and I quit on the spot, knowing that it was highly unlikely anything would come up on my background check or drug test. I usually would have given two weeks notice, but several people who had resigned with two weeks notice prior to me had been told to leave at the end of their shift, so I didn’t see the point. 

Now, however, it’s been a week and a half since my interview, and at about the week mark I started to sweat it. Yesterday I got an email with the subject line “You’re invited to interview at Chewy!” Of course, I was very confused, and upon opening the email it was almost the same as my first invitation to interview, but it now basically said “due to a large amount of applicants, we currently do not have any open positions, but keep an eye on your email in the coming weeks for when positions do become available.” Is that a rejection? I haven’t got results of my drug test back yet, but I don’t see any reason I should’ve failed, unless my prescription ADHD meds set it off. I tried calling the recruiting number for this location, and all times I’ve been sent to voicemail after two rings. I left a voicemail this morning, and emailed them yesterday, but have gotten no response. Is this their way of telling me they no longer want to offer me the position? Or has anyone else had this experience with Chewy?"

I really dont wanna go back at this point but im not too sure how to go about quitting because I can’t stand the thought of being there for two more weeks- it’s so toxic.

Kind of a long lost so apologies in advance. So was just terminated for my job a couple days due to poor performance. Kind of a bummer since my last performance review wasn’t the best but I’d definitely been putting more of an effort in my job since then. Somewhat of a blessing too I guess since I was basically told my team had zero room for growth. 
But, I wanted some advice on what to do next. 

They offered me severance + medical stipend but cobra is too expensive so you guys think doing it through covered CA is my best option? My cheapest option is $188/month through blue shield.

Unemployment - am I eligible for this? I know I got terminated but it wasn’t for misconduct. They just told me my work didn’t meet the teams expectations on what was required. 

Future jobs - I’m not overly stressed on my financial situation since I got a decent Severance plus my savings are really good but I’d like a new job pretty soon. If I do receive an offer can they ask my old company about my termination? I was under the assumption that CA has anti blacklist laws so my old company can’t disclose the fact I was terminated or why, but rather they can only confirm that I worked there and which dates. 

Thanks for reading this/any advice given!"

TL;DR: I need help choosing a new career- mostly because I don't know what all my options are!

I need a change. I can't imagine doing my job for another year but I also can't imagine doing anything else- I've always wanted to do what I do and have stacked my skills that way my entire life. I guess what I'm asking is for ideas- I know there's thousands of jobs/careers out there that I've never even heard of. I'm looking into trades but I'm having a hard time picturing myself doing any of the options. I'm in crisis, and I could really use some advice. 

I am currently an aquarist in a public aquarium. I take care of the animals. I have a BS in Marine Biology. My whole life I wanted a degree in Marine Bio and to work with animals. My job is super cool and I'm grateful for the opportunities I've had to be here, but now I'm a couple years into the job and I just can't handle the constant pressure, responsibility, and being on-call 24/7. Not to mention the increasing reality of a career full of over-worked, under-paid positions. I'm young and dumb and have some savings. I'm prepared to do something real stupid and/or life changing. 

I can't imagine working at a desk- I once told my mom that if I ever accepted a job working in a cubicle that she needed to commit me because something was seriously wrong. But I'm craving stability.

I can't imagine working a field position, but I'm craving the intellectual stimulation and outdoors time.

I feel like my brain is going to explode.. help!"

""Apologies for the delay. We're working through available openings right now as we've started filling up. I'm working with managers to see what other teams are available. Did you have any deadlines that came up?""

I have two questions:

1. What does the HR mean? Does he imply that I have successfully passed the interviews, and am being considered for other teams but there isn't any headcount yet?
2. When do companies do their headcount planning? When will they have new positions?

For some background, I had made a joke with a few colleagues about us all leaving for another company which was on brand for our conversations, none of us were happy with the company culture and management. One of the colleagues in the call who was a close friend to management told them about it and I was fired the next day, lesson learned there.

During this new job's interview process, I let them know vaguely that the company was going through a tough time when on the topic of no longer being at the company (not untrue, they let go of half the North American team a couple weeks after they fired me so it seems they were already planning on letting me go and found a way to do it without paying severance).

They asked me to clarify when my old employer marked me as ineligible for rehire, and I just shared the truth about the situation. They followed up revoking the offer. What I'm hoping to get some advice on is 1) is there anything I can/should be doing other than moving on and trying to find another opportunity? 2) How can I handle this in the future? I've already removed the job from my resume (only a 6 month timeframe) but it still shows on my record of employment and marks me as fired with cause. Any advice is definitely appreciated."

I am extremely nervous as I have some issues:

 - I am still a Master's student that is finishing up a degree (job only required bachelor's though)
- I do not exactly have 5 years of work experience in my field unless you count internships/thesis work I have done as part of my studies with organizations and companies outside of university. If that does not count, I have maybe 2 years of work experience. The 5 years is required for the application.
- I do not have the recommended certifications they listed. I have done a lot of thesis-oriented and internship-oriented work for topics regarding these certification, but I just do not have the certifications (at least yet). The certifications are not required though

So, I am thinking of sending an email out to the OSCE branch/field where the position is. I was thinking of maybe asking them for advice regarding my application or even a potential mentorship. I was thinking this could also potentially put me on there radar at the least.

With all this said, is it even a good idea to send an email like this, or would it more so annoy them? What are your thoughts on my applying? Would I even have a chance?

I will apply for the position no matter what, as it is kind of a dream job for me, and this would be something I am very very interested in.

Coming off of 3 months break from my previous job due to a surgery, I am going back to the job market. I’ve had audit jobs in my life mainly. During the break, I did help my friends’ accounting business (tax/bookkeeping) on a contract basis since I am a CPA. My question is if having that experience on my resume will help me land a job better. What I am worrying is if a potential employer will have an issue with me having the contract job. Help me plz!"

Just reaching out because I started a job recently and get the feeling it is not a good fit. It was a role I took out of desperation after working for 7 years with one firm and leaving for a better paying opportunity that fell through. I was recruited out of the blue for the role I’m in now, and being employed is a blessing in these difficult times. At the same time, as training and immersion into the role have occurred, my displeasure and sadness have grown, mostly due to the work being in the vein of the company I left after seven years, which I knew was a dead end and unfulfilling.

I wondered if any of you have been or are in a situation like this right now, and what you feel is the best way to handle things?"

That’s it.",u/mikedob18,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ytaqfk/i_cant_take_it_anymore_im_handing_in_my/,jobs,"I’ve been working at a fashion store (in London) for the past two months as a keyholder, and recently our supervisor quit. So there is just 3 of us key holders and one sale assistant. There’s no other manager. 

However, our area manager (from the head office) clearly has something against me since some time now. One day, he’ll be randomly stopping me and saying things like “I’m sure you’ll hire me one day”, and the next day he’ll criticises me for minimal things. At the start he would compliment me but now he’ll just be looking at any chance to put me down. 

However recently, a Spanish-speaking keyholder joined us, and it has got worse ever since. Apparently he got hired thanks to a contact. The area manager also speaks Spanish. Our own supervisor actually quit because the area manager told the Spanish keyholder to “tell off the supervisor”. 

And I have been getting the same treatment lately. The area manager no longer communicates with me any more, and only talks to the Spanish guy. I just feel left out and disappointed, because technically me and the Spanish guy are both on the same management level. In fact, my salary is higher and I’m the one who actually provided the full training to the Spanish guy. I’m no longer given tasks by the area manager as I used to. If the area manager comes to the shop, he’ll ask me where the other guy is, and will not give me any updates on the business. 

And now, it has come to the point where the Spanish guy is trying to “manage” me, even though he is no way higher up than I am. I can’t tell whether it is some sort of favouritism from the area manager towards the other guy, but man I never felt such pessimism about a job now. 

What do I do? Do I confront this? Or do I just quit?"

Just have a question regarding a background check. On 11.9.22 Sterling asked for W-2 information, gave me 48 hrs to upload, and I uploaded them. Got them from IRS website.

Today I go back to check w-2's(since background check taking a while) and I noticed the w-2s were the same ones for same year (I saved them with different year but it turns out its the same w-2 file). Will sterling give me a chance to fix this or am I screwed? I have no idea how I didn't catch this. I feel like an idiot.

I have already sent out 6 thank you letters to the first company I interviewed with, however, even though I made an effort to personalize each one I still feel it came across as generic and feel that it may have actually hurt my chances.

It turns out that I really like the second company I interviewed with and I would rather not mess up my chances after what I feel was a pretty solid round of interviews. 

The problem is that writing is not one of my strengths, I am already exhausted from the preparation (which included putting together a 30-minute presentation within 6 days), and I’ve already spent hours putting together the thank you notes that I wrote to the first company. 

My mind is drained and the lack of sleep combined with a ton of coffee is causing me a great deal of anxiety.

Is writing these thank you notes as important as I’ve heard it to be? Currently I’ve spent four hours writing two and a half letters and still have four more to go. I just want to quit and hope for the best. Any thoughts or ideas?"

Whenever I bring up a safety or any other kind of concern he immediately gets extremely defensive and blames me for not trusting him. To the point where it is a thinly veiled threat of firing me. “If you don’t trust me, that’s a big problem.” Not even “This is going to have to be one of those things you trust me on.” It is him getting very mad at how dare I not trust him as a way for me to feel intimidated and stop bringing things up.   

The other problem is my old boss there were the exact same type of problems and I was blamed for not bringing it up as a “see something say something” type mentality. 

He said this in front of HR and they didn’t care. 

Any advice?

Edit to add: We have had other people report to OSHA or other agencies in the past. The problem with that is A. It is specific enough that they will know it was me and I will be fired. B. It made it way worse for the people that got left behind. Instead of just fixing the issue internally we now have to send huge detailed reports to this agency. 

I can anonymously report us but it would literally be my last resort. I am mostly looking for a way to counter his tactic of him trying to avoid the concern by playing this I just don’t trust him card."

13,2022-11-12,Why employers don’t give feedback and tips for getting it anyway,u/cookie3557,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ytk9rk/why_employers_dont_give_feedback_and_tips_for/,jobs,"I often see people here wondering why they rarely receive usable feedback after a rejection. Some people take it personally, especially if they put hours of prep work into a resume or interview. Maybe I’ll get blasted for this, but I wanted to share the interviewer’s perspective because so many here are hurt by it. 

The main reason is for protection against discrimination lawsuits. Our employment lawyer has advised us to say ‘another candidate has more experience in the area we need’ regardless of reason. We can’t know who is litigious or how additional details will be interpreted. For example, if we say ‘you’d have been selected if you had more experience in X’, and you see the new hire has only 2 years on LinkedIn when you have 5, conclusions are jumped to and we’re in hot water. In truth, that person was a better overall fit, and 5 years’ of X experience was the point at which we would have hired you in spite of that.

Second to lawsuits is a bad review on Glassdoor or Indeed.  People can be incredibly protective of their accomplishments and not open to receive feedback in some areas. Even if 1% of candidates lash out, it can be damaging to have a bad review on one of these websites. This is especially true for small companies with few employees, where a candidate’s phone screen is weighted the same as a longtime employee’s review. 

**How to get useful feedback:**

I always give feedback when a candidate asks specifically whether a skill or certification held them back. These should be goals that you can work towards actively, not just more years of general experience in your field. To figure out what to ask, go back to the job post and see if you fell short on qualifications. You can also check out LinkedIn to see if others with your title have something you don’t. When you respond to the rejection, first thank the interviewer for their consideration. Then say, ‘I noticed that a Z Certification was one of the preferred qualifications. In your experience, would having that certification make a difference in my job search?’ Hopefully this approach will make the interviewer feel more comfortable pointing out what you can work on, whether or not it’s what you asked about, because they know you’re not sensitive to feedback on skills. If you firmly met all required and preferred qualifications (no need to mention this), try asking for feedback on your interview skills, salary expectations, resume, or whatever else you have a haunch about. Choose one thing. 

I sincerely wish I could be more helpful to people who ask. It’s one of those situations where a few bad actors spoil it for everyone.  Please don’t take it personally because chances are, there were many factors weighing in the balance that are specific to that one job at that exact time."

1,2022-11-12,Is it ok that I (23m) have no career goals/plans or am I screwing my future,u/castellanosleftfield,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ytmiam/is_it_ok_that_i_23m_have_no_career_goalsplans_or/,jobs,"Hope this is the right subreddit for this. I went through high school and college never really knowing what to be when I grew up. Throughout college, I changed my major multiple times and ended up majoring history as I love learning it, but never had any concrete  plans with what to do with it. I applied to different internships here and there during college but nothing ever really stuck, so during college i just worked at a grocery store and for my schools athletic department. Both jobs i enjoyed.

Fast forward to graduation, I took off the summer to recharge and once August hit I started applying to various positions (recruiting, event planning, admin assistant), still not having a plan but just wanting to work make some sort of money again. Surprisingly quickly, I was able to land a front desk for a gym at a state university. Not the most glamorous or high-paying job, but I don't mind it and am learning a lot and becoming more and more comfortable in a professional environment and working with people. I’ve made sure to be reliable and a good worker, and I like my supervisors and coworkers and have established pretty good relationships with them so far. 

Aside from focusing on my job now, I  have zero plans or goals for what my next step will be or what sort of career I see myself in. Right now I'm just taking it day by day. I do have personal long-term goals like getting married, kids, etc...and I'm also making sure to be smart financially and living at home to save money. But no long-term career goals, I just don't see myself in a big, management/senior role with lots of responsibilities, and I just have never found that exact thing i want to be.

I see my friends on social media get these jobs and show off their money and everything, and also the (sometimes annoying) Linkedin hustle culture, but for me, I just don't have that same passion career-wise. At the end of the day, I just want to live a simple, comfortable life and focus on things outside work.

I'm in my early 20s and wondering if a) anyone else feels the same and b) if this is this okay for now or if am I screwing myself for the future and setting myself up for dead end jobs"

1,2022-11-12,Looking for advice as a supervisor,u/unknownhag,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ytni8w/looking_for_advice_as_a_supervisor/,jobs,"My boss has just given me the role as the office supervisor. It was sort of unofficial, so I never really cared wtf my coworkers did before. But now my boss upped my pay and has told my coworkers of my position. I'm having trouble being someone with authority. I'm very lenient and am someone who is basically antiwork but you know... we all gotta make a living. 

The thing is my boss is very chill but because she's everyone's boss, she has the respect from everyone. I don't. When the boss is away, my coworkers take 2 hour lunch breaks and are on their phones quite a bit. They get pretty rowdy too. I try to be someone who is ok with whatever people do, as long as work is completed in a timely fashion. They do finish their work, but that's cus I'm whizzing through my own assignments and staying back to help them. (They come in later than me so I should be leaving an hour earlier than them, but I dont.) 

I do work extra hard and more than most, because I have the luxury of being a single, child free person and am not pressed to be home. I understand that my coworkers are not in this situation so I try to be understanding about them coming in late or leaving early. (They're childfree but have S/Os if that makes a difference)

Like I mentioned earlier, I've been promoted and now I feel like I have to care what my coworkers do. My boss has started to ask me about their performance but I don't want to be a snitch. I occasionally feel like my coworkers think they can take advantage of my leniency and understanding, but maybe I'm just over thinking?

I don't want to be one of those ass kissing middle management. So how do I establish my new role and earn their respect  and not become someone who is feared and disliked?"

However, I think it is important to note that people have a general idea of how other people in a certain industry usually act. Those who don't really know you will create a perception of you and tend to generalize you based on what you do and where you work. Add the fact that after working for some time in a particular place, you tend to absorb and imitate the ways the people around you think, act, and talk. So, I suppose, that's how people perceive your job to define you."

I left the military after a 4 year enlistment (earned my bachelors beforehand) and then immediately got recruited by a defense contractor for a major ERP implementation in 2008. It was a global SAP implementation for a global DOD client. I worked as a government equivalent for the first two years and then got in-sourced and became a DOD employee.

At the same time, I was serving in the Army National Guard.

I had my first traumatic brain injury on deployment in Iraq in 2006 on active duty. But I had a second traumatic brain injury in 2011. Neither were correctly diagnosed. I began behaving erratically and eventually voluntarily left my ""unfireable"" DOD job because I knew I was more of a burden than an asset and I still believed (as I do today, down to my very bones) in the mission.

My health declined further and further until in 2013 I received the right treatment and rehab and my whole life came back together.

Since then, I've completed almost 70% of a Masters Degree, but I can't get so much as a call-back from recruiters in the PM space.

Is there any way that I can appropriately explain my unique circumstances?

I feel like I can do more and I feel like my wife deserves a better standard of living than what I get in a VA pension.

So... recruiters... how do I explain that in an application?"

I work at Company A where I currently make $X.  I wasn't looking for another job, but after I rejected Company B for paying too low in an associate role, they offered me another role a few months later.  Company B offered me a Supervisor job for $X+14%.  When I gave my notice, Company A counter offered for $X+22% along with a retention bonus ($6K).   However, they can't start paying me the $X+22% until 2023 Q2, which is why they offered me the retention bonus to hold me over until then.  

Company A:  
-Remote  
-16 weeks parental leave at 100% pay  
-start up that's been around since 2016  
-flexible schedule to an extent  

Company B:  
-prestigious university system that will look awesome on my resume that's been around since 1965  
-24 mile commute one way (around 35-45 minutes)  
-parking costs $39/ month  
-Supervisor position with set 8 hour schedule  
-12 weeks of parental leave at 0% pay (only protecting my job)   
  
Important information:  I may become a parent in late 2023/ early 2024 through surrogacy and will need to attend many appointments that are 6 hours away.  When/ if a baby is born, I will have to either take up to 1 month off or work remote (Company B won't allow remote work) in order to be there for their birth.  If I take the counter offer, Company B will most likely blacklist me from joining since it would be the second time I rejected them.

Again, this location has TONS of customers each day with a line basically in the road.

I worked from 4pm-9pm and when it was time to leave, the manager didn’t even show me how to clock in/out and just told me she didn’t have a schedule for me yet. I never returned.

She doesn't get the hint when I keep backing away, she will NOT accept gum I offer and I'm afraid to say something about her breath and have her retaliate or worse her mom come in and yell at us. She kind of has an attitude and is lazy and asks the same questions like 500 times a week as well so I don't think if I sat her down and tried to do the ""hey let's have a personal space / hygene / let's get the job done"" talk will work. I have a strong sense of smell and gagging in front of the customers is bad but it's that weeks old plaque smell and I want to absolutely puke when I have to smell it. It's getting to the point I hold my breath if she comes near. The customers notice and give strange looks as I try to divert their attention when I can breathe again.

I was laid off in 2020 due to lack of organizational funding. Up until this point, I had been working in the nonprofit sector for 13 years—my last position being a director with a hefty amount of responsibility. 


Four months before I was let go I was in the icu. Then, 3 months after, I was in the icu again with covid. 


I was already burnt out at work from traveling, lack of staff, intense hours, and mental exhaustion from the population I worked with. So, getting laid off was almost welcomed at first, but falling ill *again* pretty much put the nail in the coffin of my desire to continue to work in nonprofit and especially in a leadership role.


I almost feel traumatized by the amount of pressure I was under. Though my field once felt like a rewarding space, I cannot imagine going back into a position with that much responsibility at this time and I have not found a way to express this in an honest and direct, yet professional manner during interviews. 


I have been applying for jobs that make sometimes $40/hr less than what I previously made. This does not bother me, but it seems to pose a problem for interviewers. They express great interest in my skills and experience, but some have been direct in asserting they think I will be “bored” or “intimidating to current leadership”. Even Starbucks won’t respond to my application. 


How can I express that I just want to make enough to pay my bills and I am no longer actively “climbing the ladder”?"

I'm a 2nd year college student doing computer science in Singapore, I was a waiter/bartender at restaurant for nine months before I was informed today I got the sack. I've had a part-time job in the past, however I never got fired, just resigned from the previous job.

My managers sat with me and told me that effective immediately my time as waiter/bartender is terminated. When I heard this I was in denial and couldn't believe it. In summary, I was told I was not commited to the job and arguing with my superiors. To be fair, I said that I was never perfect yet of all the part timers I worked since the beginning with I can wholly say that I was one of the most hardworking part timers. The hours I put in per month speaks for themselves. Apparently they told me they wanted someone who can listen to orders, obey and follow.

Once again to be fair, of course they are the superiors so they have to authority to instruct the juniors to do it. But there is a difference between a good instruction and a bad instruction. In my case, majority of them were dumb instructions. It's plain logic, if you ask me a dumb question, you'll get a dumb answer. Simple as that. I did try to ask for a transfer to a different outlet however the request was declined and my job at that restaurant will be terminated.

I requested a moment to process all this as it was a heavy blow and it's the first time I got fired. I felt so stressed and depressed. It's like getting stabbed in the gut, but the blade is twisted to make it hurt even more. I knew I had to do something to accept my termination gracefully. I gathered the last remaining bit of strength in me to thank my superiors for holding on to me for nine months and it was a privilege working with them and my close part-timer friends for sticking with me in both good and bad times.

Now I am unemployed and depressed as hell and need guidance to get myself out of this bottomless p pit. What would you do in a situation like this???"

We just found out my wife is pregnant again. We can't afford for me to stay at my current position, (there's really no prospect of promotion or pay raise or anything right now either, so *shrug*) and I'm kinda burned out of accounting anyway. I hate the bureaucracy of it. I just got a new boss and she micromanages quite a bit.
So, we are looking at relocating somewhere cheaper and switching jobs. I need ideas for what to pivot into from people that have done it. I am really interested in business consulting or business analysis, but I really need some good work/life balance. I'm about to have two kids and a wife that I like a lot, so I can't do 60 hour work weeks if possible.
Here's what I value in a job:
1. Pay above 70k in the Midwest/East Coast
2. Good benefits. Full Insurance/PTO
3. Autonomy in my work. I do NOT want a job where I have to change my status in teams every time I step away from my desk. Just trust me to do the job, okay?
And 4. Work/life balance. I don't work Sundays. I'm willing to work extra on weekdays to not work on Sundays.

Edit: I have a BS in Business Management as well as an MBA from a not very prestigious online school. About 3 years of accounting experience, but I am thinking about moving out of that if possible. I am interested in broader, general business processes and strategy. I have solid tech skills, basic web design, but not a developer by any means, and I actually enjoy sales as long as it's not call center or door to door. Marketing also interests me.

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. All suggestions are welcome."

46,2022-11-13,Can I ask my supervisor to place me into a different team because my direct manger is belittling?,u/Siexo14,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yu1p94/can_i_ask_my_supervisor_to_place_me_into_a/,jobs,"Not sure if this is the right sub. I (23 f) have my first corporate job (remote), our entire floor is split into different teams with a team lead who report to the main supervisor. 

I’ve been at this job for 3 months, when I ask questions to my team lead, let’s call her Julie. She often tells me to refer to the procedure manual. The thing is I do read the manual and after that I have questions that I don’t feel are unreasonable to ask. When I don’t get the help I need from her I ask other team leaders who have no problem answering my questions, some even get on a call to make sure I understand. 

Apart of my job is to have all my work go through a process of QA. This is when a random team lead picks your project goes over it and marks what is right and wrong then gives you a grade. 

Since I’ve been working here, all my jobs have been QA by other team leads. The worst grade I had received was a 74. When Julie did my QA she gave me a 54 and asked to join a call. We hopped on the call and she proceeded to repeat the question “what were you thinking?”  I would try to answer her question by going back to my work and seeing the part she is referring too, her response is “I deleted it and fixed it, but I still want to know what you were thinking”. Because I couldn’t go back to see what I had done it was impossible to answer her questions, plus I am starting to believe that she never actually wanted an answer she just wanted someone to scold. 

When I’ve had calls with other team leads they were able to show me what I did and explain how they fixed it and so on. It seems like they wanted me to grow and learn on the job. 

Because Julie is my direct manger who doesn’t really offer much help to my growth. Is it unreasonable to ask my supervisor via email to be switch to a new team because I feel it will help my growth? 

TL,DR: My direct manger scolds me during reviews, tells me to read the manual when I ask questions, and fails all my work. Should I ask my supervisor to be moved to a new team?"

I know immediately the answer is “don’t be a baker in a supermarket” but that’s besides the point. Anyways, I’ve been here for three years, and have two vacations this year (2022). The first one in March worked well and I was paid.

The second one though, was different. Last week of October, all planned, when suddenly I was told to cancel. A worker left the bakery suddenly and we are severely understaffed, so they told me that my vacation will now work this way: that week I was supposed to be off, three days will be vacation days, and same for the next week. I didn’t like it, but if it meant more money for the holidays that’s fine.

Well, the weeks have passed, and I got little money. They counted my vacation days as mere days off, meaning no pay. I asked my boss, hr, and the top brass of the place. I got two answers.

1. They’ll look into it. When I asked if it’s possible just to get the check now, they laugh it off.

2. My boss made a really bizarre mention that when I was off, a person filled in for me those days, and the head of the establishment wanted to give her my “unused vacation” pay. 

I’m really stressed for cash, and even this meager vacation pay would help, but all they say is “yeah, we all got bills.” 

Also: I was injured in April and resumed work last week in May. Applied for fmla. Handed it in to my boss, never received anything on it. My vacation was NOT used here"

They're waiting for me to really mess up so they can give me the boot, that cameras are specifically pointed at me. I heard my rep talking about it. Literally right next to me. Something I've heard since day 1 of working there only being a few months in. 

So now my question here is, what do I do now?
Take my 100+ hour of pto and quit? Or ride it out until the day I get fired comes?

The job pays extremely well, so im a bit disappointed, but I also don't really enjoy the work so its not a total loss. But I am lost on what to do. 

Suggestions/ recommendations/ any one gone through this?


EDIT: I guess I should also mention i did talk to the rep I heard it from and they played stupid. If anything I'd like to just know straight from the horses mouth so I can find a new job and move on in peace, not have everything sugar coated and then get hit by a bus come firing. Should I go to HR and discuss this concern? Maybe HR could tell me just how horrible things are and maybe a next step process? If they do t sugar coat themselves, anyway. 
This is a union so there is supposed to be steps to firing with multiple union meetings/ supervisor meetings but from what Ive heard is going straight to waiting for a major mess up on my behalf and watching me like a hawk."

I had no idea about it until I told HR about a mental health issue I was having and they recommended it to me. So for details I struggle with an anxiety disorder and so I requested remote work to help with it and basically a more flexible schedule. Mind you management has already expressed to me they want me working in office and i only get to work remotely one day out of the week. My family told me it was a bad idea because I don’t really need accommodations for my mental and that I’m capable of doing the job without the accommodations and that it will make management want to get rid of me. Basically telling me it was a bad decision and im too new to ask for accommodations. So I think part of what they were saying was true. Management has been more harsh to me. Always reviewing my work , questioning my hours, and always trying to see how I’m doing or what I’m doing. I temporarily worked 100% from home and management checked in with me constantly to see what I was doing and keeping track of when I logged on etc. the response ive been getting was surprising and sad. I was hoping to do longterm accommodations but it may just have to be short term"

I had my final interviews for a new graduate software engineer position 3 weeks ago. Recruiter told me on a post-interview call that a final decision would ""definitely"" be made the next day (Tuesday Nov. 1st), but then the hiring manager was out so they were scheduled to make it on Wed Nov 2nd. Yet the day after that she said they're ""wrapping up interviews,"" and I didn't hear from them at all last week despite a follow-up. On that call I was also told I basically did super well on the interviews, that I was a ""perfect fit,"" and I would be rejected only if someone had more ""domain experience"" (for new graduate?).

The only update I got last week was a template email rejection on Thursday from a different team (I applied to two), which was weird because the recruiter told me during the phone screen over a month ago that I wasn't moving on with that team anyway. Don't know why it took so long to reject me from that one. 

We'll see what this week brings, but do you guys think they just gave the offer to the real top candidate and I'm being strung along?

Also, I am indeed interviewing with other places and even currently have an offer. I'm just particularly interested in this company because the pay is significantly higher, it's remote, and the team I interviewed with seems pretty great."

I really love my job, my boss is great, so understanding and flexible. We have a hybrid work culture and its a good environment to be in. I get challenged every day and I love it.

I wasn't considering leaving for a while, but I got contacted on LinkedIn by an MD of another agency. He wanted to chat so I met him to see what he had to say and offer. Basically he is looking to hire someone to be a web lead and be the main decision maker for all web associated decisions.

All websites built in his agency are using Divi which is like Elementor, it's not proper web dev whereas my current job is custom theme dev using software enginereer processes. But I'm being offered at least £6k more than I am at the min (I might be able go negotiate more) and he says the job is mine if I want it.

The job isn't hybrid and I would have to go into the office every day, which is a big swinging point for me I think. Going back to 5 days in the office would be hard to acclimatise too 

I feel like if I accept this job it might leave me open to better jobs in the future as I'd essentially be a manager, and I could potentially earn big money in the future.

Has anyone got any advice? Do I think about my job satisfaction and happiness currently or do I consider my future earnings from taking this job?"

Please share your story",u/GliGli991,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yuf51r/have_you_guys_ever_referred_a_wrong_person_to/,jobs,"I know some companies offer a referral bonus. Recently, I just referred a position to a stranger from Reddit. We knew each other from Reddit and just talked. We were kinda vibe at the beg, and I thought he was a nice person. At that time, my team was looking for a role, which I offered to him. He said he was underpaid, and I wanted to help him with that role.

Short story, he got a job, which 50% boost from his previous salary. Then, I can see his ""true"" character. We used to chat a lot. Now, he did not even reply any my message. If we chat, we always get into an argument. The vibe that I felt did not as used to be. Cold, dry, and boring. Sh\*t, I really wish I had known his personality before.

I really regret referring him to a job even though I got a referral bonus. I know I lost nothing from this, but I felt uncomfortable working with him. Every day, I wake up with a heartbeat, ""meet this annoying guy again"". Ugh. Besides, I admit he had more experience than mine. So, I will have to compete with him to get that promotion.

I won't ever refer any job to someone else from this situation. Does anyone have a similar situation?

any constructive advice?"

Question #4:
Now, a hypothetical scenario: Six months from now, the Water Bureau will announce a series of significant rate increases. This will impact all our customers, especially those with limited incomes, and we anticipate negative publicity around it. Please develop the outline of a multi-part campaign that will address the situation directly and help mitigate the public blowback, while also directing customers toward available financial assistance. (12 mins)

For your outline, please think about what overall story you would tell and discuss the following:
the key messaging and themes you would use,
the type of content you would create 
how you would approach tailoring content to different communities.
Please provide specifics about the content, i.e. if you suggest making a video, what would it consist of? For this exercise, assume all digital and analog platforms are available. 

*Note that we are not asking you create any of these materials, but we are asking you to share the details of your plan with us."

It asks questions like, ""Describe specialized training, apprenticeships, skills or research"", along with a few others including my employment history.

The job posting states, ""A resume may also be included but is not required.""

Is this a way to set apart the higher achievers? I really want this position and I want to show my enthusiasm. Thanks!"

Recently, I noticed that my boss, his boss (our team lead), and another manager level individual (who works closely with our team) have many ""private"" blocks on their calendars all within the same 1-2 weeks. I haven't seen so many private labelled holds for either of them past few months. All of them on different days and times. (We can see other employees' calendar at my company)

Could it be that they are doing interviews for my position and don't want me to see them? I checked online on the company website and job boards and don't see any postings for my position. 

The team leader is also not as friendly towards me as he was initially when I started. He isn't mean or anything, but just doesn't talk as much as he did my first month. 

In all honesty, I think I am doing a decent job at work. I do everything that is assigned to me on time and well. I don't go above and beyond at my job but I do the things assigned to me just fine. 

I am getting anxious and maybe overthinking this.  Any thoughts??"

It’s contingent on me passing this test. My spouse (heavy weed smoker) took the test and was able to use synthetic pee, but when I got there I had to empty my pockets and lock up my bag, so I couldn’t do the same. 

I rarely ever smoke but like a dumbass, I smoked a little Saturday evening. Took the test at like 7:45 AM today. 

Is there a slim chance I’ll pass? If I don’t, I’m scared I’ll be humiliated by coming into work for two days then being fired for a positive test, esp since my husband works there and was the one to recommend me for the job. 

The job is a desk job and the company is small. 

Basically, how screwed am I? If it comes back positive can I ask to retest? I also take amphetamines that I’ve been prescribed so that might pop up too. Thanks.

EDIT: I looked at the employee handbook and it says that those who test positive ""may be immediately removed from duty"". The ""may be"" seems like there could be a shot, especially if I have inside references?"

Lo and behold it was over something so miniscule, yet they wanted to talk about it.  It was my day off, I had things to do, yet I had to stop and address it.  It wouldn't be such an inconvenience had they not have a habitual pattern of constantly calling me, but today I didn't want to deal, ESPECIALLY after all of the nonsense they adressed.

I am holding on and patiently waiting for this background check to come through.  I know it takes a while but every second is one second closer to resigning from my current job.

For this little pay and aggravation, NO ONE should have to tolerate this nonsense.  It is mind boggling sometimes how people are married to their job and eat and breathe it.  I cannot wait until the day I get to resign.  I will be free from the aggravation!!!! I'm counting every second...."

I switched from non-profit to management consulting. At the time of the job offer, the salary seemed very good, in part because I made a very low salary at my previous job and the recruiter made it sound like an exceptionally high salary. I now have learned that a new employee coming in at the same position that I will be supervising on a project will be making at least $30,000 more. I would like to ask my boss for a raise and show what I have accomplished but am unsure if it is wise or how to initially frame the discussion. What advice can you give me?"

My professional history would make me a great candidate and I still maintain my physicality. But in college I experimented with mushrooms and had a joint and now I’m wondering if I shot myself in the foot. 
I’ve heard differing opinions of people saying that so long as I’m not a current user, they won’t care to “Nope, they will never consider you.”
For background, I miss working with a group of people towards a common goal and helping the community. The tech world honestly only cares about money and not really helping anyone.

I want to shop around for new jobs, however, I want to do so without my current employer knowing. I'm just a contractor at the moment so am fairly disposable, and if they caught wind I was looking for other work I'm sure they would end my contract and choose to go with someone more committed to the company and longer term.

Thing is – this company would be an important reference piece for me to use to demonstrate my work in the jobs that I'm applying for.

For one job in particular (not sure if they are using recruiters) it specifically states 'three references' to be submitted alongside cover letter and CV. Previously, if the application didn't ask for references up front I'd just always write ""references upon request"", which is usually after an interview or two."

8,2022-11-14,WWYD? Post-Interview stress about some of the answers I provided.,u/tetontorrance,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yv9sth/wwyd_postinterview_stress_about_some_of_the/,jobs,"  

Hey All. After an arduous interview process for my dream job (zoom w/ recruiter, zoom with team, personality tests, et cetera), I was asked to meet the team for a “final” in-person interview. We spent 2.5 hours together, and my initial impression upon leaving the interview was, “Wow, I killed it! They are going to call my references and then offer me the job.” However, in the following days, I started thinking more carefully about the questions they asked and realized that I did a poor job answering their questions. For example, they asked me about how I’d handle a situation where I disagreed with the opinion of a team member. Instead of answering the question, I was so excited and full of energy that I told them about a book I read, which had very little to do with conflict resolution (granted, they did seem to like my quick book summary). 

In sum, I think my initial positive post-interview impressions were formed because: 

1) I was really nervous ahead of the interview, and afterwards, I was extremely relieved that I didn’t completely flop (freezing, or vomiting)

2) I am good at socializing, and I was able to hold fun and engaging conversations with all the team members. I’m worried that I conflated my entertaining them, with their collective agreement that I’m the right one for the job

So, I think they like me, but I don’t think they liked my answers. To make matters worse, one team member took copious notes about my answers. Now I am considering whether I should email the team and address what’s on my mind; namely, stating that I was so excited to meet them, that I might not have provided clear answers to their questions, and therefore, I am following up with better answers.

What are your thoughts? Worth it to send them answers to some of the questions?  Does sending a follow-up email hurt my credibility or perceived level of confidence by showing that “I’m in my head”?

(other details: my qualifications are exactly what they are looking for, and I already sent a nice follow up email 24 hours after the interview, but did not address what I outlined above)

Expressing my gratitude for all of your thoughts and advice!"

|\- vacation time was 2 weeks, but when I put in my notice they bumped it to 3 weeks|\- 4 weeks vacation|
|\- there isn't enough work to do, and often the work is quite boring|\- the work would be doing research on niche policy interest of mine. kind of a job i'd always dreamt of|
|\- i'm required to be in the office 2 days per week, and it's annoyingly long commute|\- 401K w/ 4% match and an HSA plan|

|\- I like my boss and leadership||

Thank you for all the helpful feedback! I am going to go with the new offer based on a lot of what you all said. It's definitely hard to walk away from that money, but I don't know if I'd ever have another experience doing this work again. I know eventually I will make more money but I'm still young (27) and have no children to support, so now feels like the time to not give as much weight to money."

Does this mean; literally, 1.85 days off or in other words 2 shifts. Or does it mean I have 44 hours worth to spend which equates to around 6 shifts. Or is it even something else entirely?"

My employer decided to change our holiday gifts this year. Normally (for the past 3 years out of the 5 years I have worked here) we get a choice between a turkey, ham, or 2 pies (apple, pumpkin, or both). I generally choose pie, because myself and my family doesn't really like turkey. Then I am very particular when it comes to ham with how I will eat it, and I also don't want to prepare it.

This year my employer changed to a $30 gift check from butterball. Apparently I can use this to buy other groceries besides a turkey, which I don't want. Which I am kind of upset about. (Upset because I would rather just have $30 extra dollars in my paycheck, than this. I feel like Clark Griswold when he expected to get a bonus, but got signed up for the jelly of the month club instead.)

But then I wondered, do other people even get a gift from their employer at all? What gifts do you get, if any at all?"

Basically, I was offered a new position at a company and instead of an hourly pay they offered me an annual salary. Initially I thought I would be working 40 hours a week but when looking at my new hire paperwork it says 35 hours weekly. That was fine until one of my friends brought up that the paperwork says I'm being offered a FTE Salary and since I'm working only 35 hrs instead of 40 hrs that my total compensation won't actually be the salary they initially mentioned but the full time equivalent of the hourly rate x 35hrs. 

So, for examples sake, lets say they offered me an annual salary of 100K and my paperwork says FTE Salary $100K, 35 Standard hours, paid biweekly. Does this mean that I can expect a check of about $4K (gross) or should I expect around $3.5K? That would obviously mean my annual compensation would be much less than the $100K. 

I've never had a salaried position before and I thought it meant you just get paid a set amount every check regardless of how many hours you work in a week. But after speaking with my friend I'm so confused. 

Again, sorry if this is stupid, but I genuinely cant find a straightforward answer online - probably because this shouldn't be that hard to figure out but I tend to overthink everything lol.

Thanks in advance!"

44,2022-11-14,Company asking for a cover letter,u/Magicalbeans_,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yvksht/company_asking_for_a_cover_letter/,jobs,"So I’m applying for a job that asks for a cover letter in addition to my resume. I’ve read that a lot of people don’t submit cover letters and do just fine in the hiring process. 

If this is an unnecessary step then I’d like to skip it if possible. I feel that by making a cover letter, I’ll screw up by writing too much or writing unnecessary things so I’d like to avoid that. 

Any advice on how I should proceed?

Edit: alright, so people are assuming that the job I’m applying for ONLY requires a resume and cover letter. I get that this is how it is for most jobs so I don’t blame anyone for making this assumption, but the job I’m applying to is a video editing position. This particular employer assigns candidates tasks to complete to show off their editing skills and so I worked on my tasks for several hours only to realize that they also wanted a cover letter. At this point, I’ve made work that I was happy with and felt that the work I made should speak for itself, after all, the company did say that this was the main thing that they were looking at. I just wanted to see what the general opinion on cover letters was before I decided if it was worth my time. After reading some of the initial replies, I decided that it was probably in my own best interest to just do it.

I didn’t think adding extra context was necessary"

My  job laid off half of the employees and although I still have my job, everyone is telling me that I should look for another job just in case. So far, I've only been getting reply back from positions that only pay minimum wage. I do have a bachelor's degree in History and it has been one of the biggest regrets in my life. I got my current job after graduating because I didn't get any reply back that paid more than minimum wage so I just accepted this one. Three years later, and I'm in the same place. This time I'm working on getting a Master's degree in Information Science, and from this program I discovered how much I enjoy programming and started learning web development on my own, just more in depth than what I was learning from my program. Kind of wish I would have majored in CS or any tech degree. I at least would've graduated with some useful skills that are worth more than minimum wage. 

This issue is that I don't have a portfolio of projects to showcase what I've learned so far, and I still feel like in the beginning stages. I was not prepared to start looking for a new job right now. What positions do you recommend to apply to besides customer service? Preferably something that pays more than $15 an hour, which is what I currently make? Thank you."

It just feels like this job is coming home with me heavily every single night. 

My dilemma is if I walk away they are screwed as the ski season is set to open in a few weeks with still loads of tasks to be done so for that I feel bad, but is that even my problem? I was thinking about maybe Friday just sending an email explaining my decision then going dark after that because I could care less to hear their pity party that I know will happen.

However, once the interview was done they sent me two assessments to take. One asks about your personality traits, and then one that has you answer different math or puzzle questions (you get 50 questions in 12 minutes).

I decided to take the puzzle related one this evening which was a dumb decision. I zipped through and answered all of the questions that I could and then accidentally submitted the test even though I had two minutes left. I thought that there were more questions, which means I didn't get to look back and review any of my answers. I wanted to at least get through all of the questions because otherwise I'll pause and get stuck on one question. But it cost me, because there's no way I got more than half of them correct (at least, I doubt it). 🙃

I'm feeling stupid because there's no way I answered enough questions to get a call back for the interview. I've always had a lot of anxiety with those specific quizzes and tests because I never know what score they're looking for or what the right answer is. I feel dumb not even getting to use the rest of my time and answer a few more questions. 

Do jobs really look at these tests? What are they usually looking for? I feel like this is normally the point in my interviewing process where I do not hear back from the employer. I try to answer the questions to the best of my ability but I don't exactly think that they're easy (I always misinterpret questions when I get nervous). I'm really trying to leave my current job but things like this make me feel discouraged."

We've been hit hard by the job market where the company, for love nor money, can't find any more employees but keeps taking on more clients, thus our capacity goes up every month. 

I was told that I was being promoted last month and got my offer letter today. I've been told by everyone who has been promoted, as well as my manager that it is a 20% salary increase. Which is fantastic.  I got my offer letter and it is 17.5%, which while absolutely amazing, is just shy of what I thought I was getting. I didn't want to be ungrateful but asked why it was lower than expected, they said that I the pay scale and can't be moved. I tried talking to my manager and asked him why he thought it was lower than 20% and he said, that is 20%, you're not allowed to negotiate. I was confused by this and asked my colleagues and all of them said that no, you can't negotiate your pay because it is a big company and they want everyone on the same level on the same pay. 

Unsure whether this is an actual thing that I am unable to negotiate or that my peers just haven't negotiated because they thought what they got was fair. I think I'm after advice on what to do, whether to push on and still try to negotiate as I have the upper hand with the market or just accept it as it is a very good salary still but lower than the market?"

First job is with TSA as a TSO sounds good because of the pay ($6 more an hour than the mechanic job) but heard it can get really stressful and take a toll on mental health in some cases.

Automotive mechanic job is something i’ve always wanted to do. I like working on my own vehicles and always found working on cars to be fun, however i heard making it a career can kill the love for the hobby. It is a entry level position so pay isn’t too great but I can get raises depending on how many certifications I get ($1 for each certification). Also the position is for a rental car company so I’m assuming they operate a little differently from a dealership/local shop? Not too sure

Would like to hear others opinions and if they were in/have the same career path in either job then your experience.

TIA!

TL;DR: Stuck between going with TSA for TSO position or going with an automotive mechanic job."

I went through some traumatic personal things, and everyone here knows what happened. I sought mental health treatment and one of my bosses told me that they considered firing me, but deemed me too valuable. This caused me so much stress that it is part of the reason I need up inpatient at a mental hospital. Flash forward, I’m working part time while getting back to working 40 hours. They’re been pretty decent overall. However, I do the same thing every day. I have asked to learn new skills, and they say they don’t have time to teach me and instead hired someone for a position I’ve been asking to learn the skills for. 

Another company reached out to me and wants me bad after I interviewed with them. They are offering a salary that is $11.5k more annually and are willing to train me on the things my current employer won’t. The catch is that I would be traveling about half the year. It would be a fresh start where no one would know what happened to me.

We work hand in hand with employees who are employed by the company that actually own the data center. The goal is to eventually join that team. However, to join that team, you have to have quite a bit of trade experience or a degree, which I do not have at this time. 

The job I left to come to the DC offered hands on experience in all of the fields that I would need to learn to eventually join the DC team. But that would mean returning to an old job, which can be iffy. On the other hand, as a contractor that already works at the DC and has a good reputation with all of the personnel on site, I would be unsure of leaving since I’m already so close. I have connections that would gladly refer me for a job at the DC, but would be nervous about bombing the interview, especially the technical questions. 

I’m currently trying to figure out what would be better to improve my chances of moving up in my field. Should I leave and gain more hands on experience? Or is being in close proximity to the job I want and the people I want to work with good enough for now? 

I feel like I’m my heart I know the answer, but I’m curious if others have even been in a similar situation."

I used all of my references from my previous job to get this one hoping this job will be my home. Unfortunately, now that I quit it feels awkward calling my references again, and I really don't know them THAT well. Also I'm not sure if I should include this experience on my resume. My manager and coworkers are pissed now that my pending workload has to be distributed, so I can't even ask them for references.

As for future job oppertunities, I'm looking in data entry, call centre, and customer service rep roles ranging from 40k-50k salary. Any other suggestions? 

I have basically 0 employment gaps since I was 18. Only problem is that I job hop quite a bit. Each role 8-12 months for better paying roles/roles with more responsibilities. I usually tell employers: I want to be challenged, so if I get too comfortable in a role with no upward mobility, I will explore other oppertunities. 

Any advice/suggestions are welcome!"

So in short I am repeating my last year of journalism (I failed to submit 2 assignments (out of like 20) and discovered I had ADHD halfway through) and now I don’t know how to approach that during interviews. 

Any thoughts? 

Secondly, I would like to specialise in energy/climate change/environmental journalism/comms. I used to study agronomy for 2 years and I spent a lot of time learning about those subjects.  The problem is that during my studies, I could not write about those subjects because I was restricted to certain subjects by my teachers. 

Hence, I was thinking of  doing so freelancing to build a portfolio through articles/podcasts (more on that below) that is more authentic and reflective of me before applying to jobs. 

Is that a sound decision? 

At the same time as freelancing I was thinking of getting a more stable job part time to insure a regular source of income, but I don’t know if this can be journalism/comms related since my degree is not finished and I feel like my CV gives red flag at the moment.

I know I have good strength like my creativity, critical thinking and good knowledge of energy/climate change but I still get the imposter syndrom.

Alternatively I was thinking of getting a random job and do my freelancing journalism/comms related stuff on the side. 

Thank you all! :)"

Has anyone ever done this, a sort of “take a leap of faith” kinda thing? After being at my job for close to 6 years,  I recently put in my two weeks (grocery/retail) due to fact that I was just so unhappy and felt like I was stuck in a never-ending rut, not to mention the burnout from being overworked non stop since Covid. It probably wasn’t the best decision for me to impulsively do, but I felt as if I didn’t do it then I’d look down the road in 5 years and still be stuck there. My last day is the day before Thanksgiving, and it’s creeping up. My anxiety is just shooting through the roof at the thought that I still haven’t found another job. I’ve tried job hunting, but everything I find is customer service related, and I just would really want to take a break from that altogether and possibly find something where I don’t have to interact with people as much. Have any of you guys gone through this before or something similar ? If you have then what advice, if any, would you have for me?"

The severance package included a $4,000 budget to spend before the end of January, specifically for career development &amp; job placement. They are being pretty loose with the budget and allowing us to spend it on anything we can justify will help us. But I need to spend it all or else I lose it.

I'm looking for tips on how to best spend the allocation of this money. Some things I'm considering:

* Laptop (i confirmed this is allowed. I currently only have a chromebook). Should I spend a significant chunk of the money on this? or save on something else?
* LinkedIn premium
* Personal Headhunter (not clear on the actual cost of this or if i can afford it)
* Classes / Certifications (considering six sigma course if i want to move into more of a management or PM role)

After looking into entry level jobs in the marketing/advertising field, i’ve quickly discovered that these jobs pay very close to, if not, minimum wage, and many of them are not even hiring because of the recession. I’m kind of freaking out because I’m close to being let go due to not hitting quota. On top of that, I went to school for something related to marketing/advertising, which would not pay the bills in the expensive city I live in.

1,2022-11-15,Do I speak up about the day before Thanksgiving?,u/redapple912,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yw68b9/do_i_speak_up_about_the_day_before_thanksgiving/,jobs,"My job is customer service. Because of this everyone who does customer service has to do a split shift. Half the people work the morning and off afternoon other half do morning off and work afternoon.(8-12 or 12-4:00)

My team consisted of 4 people. We agreed we'd switch off the day before holidays so you'd work morning one holiday and the next you'd have morning off. I kind of assumed we were continuing that even though we lost 1 person and gained 2.

My boss sends out a mass email to everyone in my department and said we needed to figure out what we were working. One of my co-workers always wants either a day off or to work the morning. Last holiday she worked the morning and I worked late. She also requested the week of Christmas off in July.  She sent around an email asking everyone's preferences. Within 15 minutes the table was totally filled out. She and 2 others on my team are working the morning(she put ""if possible"" next to her afternoon off) and me and my co-worker J are working the afternoon. J immediately responds saying he's sorry but he actually has that Tuesday and Wednesday off. She sends a revised table out and put him as off and removes the ""if possible"" that was beside afternoon off. Meaning I'm covering 4 people's desk not including my own for the afternoon. Granted it'll probably be pretty slow, but it's still a lot for just me to cover.

When someone is off your covering your part of their desk(ie, emails, orders, order software ect.) which we preassigned. When it's split shift you cover everything your supposed to and if the person is working afternoon you just assign their stuff. So I'll be covering 100% of 4 peoples stuff.

On top of it, my fiancé asked about Thanksgiving and I told him I thought I had afternoon off since last holiday I worked the afternoon(thinking we were still doing the every other holiday) and he was going to leave work early(something he never does) so we could make the 3 hour trek home at a reasonable time. Do I say something or just suck it up? If I speak up who do I talk to?"

I sent him an agenda today and he corrected it and told me he prefers that the hours are in 24-hour clock format. 

Last week, an intern wrote the minutes for an internal meeting. I will admit, I quickly reviewed the minutes she sent before sending them out to the group and I own up that perhaps I should have been a bit more thorough in reading her minutes, but I failed to see that she made  two typos. Just two in the entire document and he hasn’t let it go!
 He has brought it up to me three times now that it was “sloppy” and has insisted he review all minutes first before they get shared with the group. Despite my apologizing, redoing the minutes myself, and addressing it with the intern as well. 

I am allowed one day WFH. I don’t tend to do the same day every week because it depends on what meetings I have etc. He insisted on me picking a specific day to WFH despite it having no affect on my colleagues or anyone else on the team. 

It’s just making me feel insecure now. I feel like I can’t be trusted to do anything without potential criticism. Am I overthinking this?"

- Speaks in a condescending and belittling tone eg that makes zero sense, you don’t even think

Usually on my lunch breaks I will play piano and post a short 5 minute video. Recently we got a new boss up top. My supervisor immediately above me knows what I do and doesn't mind at all. She caught wind of my videos and asked that I stopped posting videos. My social media account is public I make like $1 off each video I post very little I have a very small following. It's just something I do for my own therapy and if somebody else gets some enjoyment out of it great. Just curious what your thoughts are on this. On one hand she said she doesn't mind if I practice the piano on break but doesn't want me posting the video. She says she doesn't want to give the impression that that is what I'm doing at night. But then on the other hand she said do I have permission to be on the piano. So I don't know if I get permission if then I would be allowed to post videos. If this should be in another forum ready just let me know thanks.

As much as i'm an open book, I'm feeling very uncomfortable with the entire situation (i've also never been fired before and taking it pretty hard)

I don't want to put that i'm still working at the previous employer due to employment verification and wouldnt know how to navigate communicating a 3 month gap while not having to include that recent position.

2,2022-11-15,Should I take this job offer?,u/YesSmoking,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ywc9wo/should_i_take_this_job_offer/,jobs,"I’m a data analyst / business consultant out of Denver. A recruiter from a boutique consulting firm reached out, and I proceeded with the interview process which led to a job offer. I’m weighing the pros and cons of the offer and would like to source outside input.

My current job is full time remote. Pays $127,000 salary with $17,000 bonus and has RSUs (currently have 55 RSUs vested out of 220 worth supposedly $370 per share). The company culture is pretty relaxed with interesting and diverse people. I sometimes work 10-12 hours a day but for the most part work about 40-50 hours a week. There is no career mobility at this company. Been here for 15 months, not getting promoted this year and expecting a 4% raise. The next level for my role has the exact same responsibilities with a title change. Moving laterally is difficult as well since it seems like other teams over hired and one team as had layoffs (I’m not worried about being laid off as my team is profitable and necessary).

The job offer requires weekly travel - can be Sunday to Friday or Monday to Thursday or perhaps no travel. Travel depends on the specific client and the director leading the project. The company itself has no offices, and you can live anywhere. The base salary is $175,000 with a 2% profit sharing bonus for each project. I’ve heard this range from $2,000 for a project to $15,000 for a single project to 50% of base salary for a year’s worth of bonuses. I heard the culture described as “old school” as in face-to-face interaction, traveling, and having some stubborn people you have to work with. Also heard the work can be a grind like 12 hour days. In one of my interviews, the director interviewing me said he was up until 2am working and had a 7am call later that morning. There seems to be a lot of career advancement opportunity.

Some relevant, personal information. I’m 30 and live with my girlfriend who also works remotely. We really enjoy taking short breaks through the day, going for walks, grabbing lunch, hanging with friends after work, etc. We also like to cook our meals. I workout at a martial arts gym 3-4 times a week, which I would have to cancel if I take this job. The GF proposed if I take the job she would be up to travel for a week or two per month to be with me.

While the job offer would be a big shift in my routine, I’m sure I can acclimate. The money is life changing (30k - 100k increase) but I’m not sure if it is worth the added stress - less time with the GF, traveling, no longer remote, no cooking, perhaps I could find a comparable gym in the client city I travel to for the duration of a project. 

What are your thoughts?"

I was given a completely Yoruba name that's hard for a lot of people to pronounce. As I apply and get rejected from supposedly desperate companies, I notice that my peers with far less job experience (aka none) are getting the same jobs just merely weeks after I get rejected without an interview. I've also noticed that they claim to be desperate, but when I apply with the perfect skills and experience for the position (literally had the exact same job but with a different company), I get rejected and the position is reposted. I feel very annoyed, and people around me have begun suggesting that it is my name and maybe I should change it. Could this really be the case? I live in a very small, white town."

Should I mad study and research to prep myself or enjoy freedom while i can and take it like a holiday as i say goodbye to freelance life? 

Should I get myself used to waking up dead early or enjoy those last sweet lie ins? 

I am looking forward to starting but I have a feeling the first month will wipe me out as I havent worked a 9-5/5 days a week in years. 

I also want to do a really good job and impress as I get imposter syndrome and it will be a big learning curve and lots to get trained on.

And I'm starting to feel confortable here. A recruiter called me last week to do an interview with a BIG company B. Both jobs matched what the other was offering. 

However company B is ""temporary"" (as owner's construction project manager). Meaning I would work there more like an independent contractor rather than an actual employee(no benefits, PTO, etc) until a position open up (meaning they want me permanently) . 

But because company B is a BIG company that anyone would know. It would open up doors for other big companies to look at me in the future. Looking on glassdoor. Its nothing but positive at company B.

IDK if I should leave my current comfortable job or should I risk it working at a big company hoping they put me on permanently and in the future, move on to bigger same size companies. Pay would be the same since company A matched company B for me to stay."

Something great happened and a recruiter reached out to me for a great opportunity that I ended up accepting for nearly 50% more pay! I immediately put my two weeks in and while my boss was very supportive and understanding, she then had me go to the office president to let him know. He is a 50+ year old man with no control of his emotions. I am 24F. The first thing he said to me was “sit down before I spank you” and I think he meant this in a way of me being a child, but either way was obviously super inappropriate. Then proceeded to be extremely rude to me saying “well we had bigger plans for you and were going to promote you but NOW you don’t get that chance” 

I said “that’s fine, I already signed the offer letter for much more than I could make even with a promotion here”
Then he says “well you better make sure you’re still working while you’re here since we’re paying you.” 

I’m on day 2 and I have half a mind to just walk out because it feels like he’s punishing me for leaving. This is putting the whole office in a terrible situation because someone else recently resigned as well. I feel bad but… don’t be a dick to your employees I guess?"

I’m going into the second round of interviews for an up and coming medical marijuana dispensary and brand. The position is for  Social Media Management &amp; Marketing for their store and brand. They have bought a domain that is the dispensary’s brand name plus the state abbreviation at the end, when for future expansion &amp; just general marketing purposes, it should just be dispensarynamehere.com - which is still available for purchase. Would it be an epic move or an asshole move to purchase the domain myself and creating a quick landing page with some variation of “How is the interview going, guys? Gave me a thumbs up if it’s going well!” - the 3 guys spent the entire last interview clicking around on their laptops while I answered questions, so it stands to reason they will again (probably communicating together about me covertly). They asked if I had any idea how I would proceed and I gave them a bullets point run through of my plan- I did not mention #1 would be to secure the better domain. Could I suggest this and ask if they’ve checked for availability, politely ask someone to type it in and see what pops up? I am on the fence whether this is I’ll impress or piss them off. Be gentle with feedback- I mean no harm I just want to work with something I’m passionate about and show them I’m on top of this for them if they’ll let me be.

I have a new job that I've had for 6 months with a great company, and on paper it sounds perfect but I suck at it. 

I left my old job which I was thriving in but not what I wanted to do. I was there for 5 years, and did very very well.

This new job is up my alley and what I want but I'm terrible at it. I forget everything, I miss small details, I overlook issues. My performance sucks. I work in clinical trials so it's really important not to do that :( 

My boss is nice,  and he's trying to help me and I'm really his only hope since it's just us and no one else on the team.

I want to do better, but I feel because I suck at this job, I hate it. I've never been in a situation where I've tried my hardest and failed. I always did really well in school, and if I failed it's because I didn't put in effort, not because I couldn't do the work. 

I just dont know whats wrong with me. My anxiety is getting so bad now it's almost making me freeze and my mind goes blank but when I make a mistake I go into complete overdrive to fix it. 

Can someone give me advice please?"

The text claimed they saw my Indeed profile and reached out because I was a good fit. I went along with the text to see where it went and it got to the point where they had me create an account on a messenger service called Signal, which I looked into and seemed fairly reputable, in order to talk to the interviewer. Once I contacted the interview they asked if I was ready to interview right then, which I couldn't because I was at work. They did agreed to wait until I got off work to do the interview and figured I would keep going with this until they asked for any personal information.

While I has some time at work I looked into the company, add it does exist and seems like a real business. The few things that are triggered red flags for me at this point are: the pay seems a bit too high for what I would expect and the ""interviewer"" seemed to be a bot or just copy/pasting a script.

Fast forwarding to after work and time for the interview; I messaged the interviewer and they let me know the full interview would take place through the messenger. They then had me do a 16 question interview with a 10 minute time limit per 5 questions, in the messenger through text. They would give me 5-6 questions to answer, and once I submitted them I had to wait 5-10 minutes for the next set. The questions were pretty standard and the only one that stood out to me as strange was ""what bank do you use? (for payroll purposes)"" which didn't seem like too much information. 

That leads to the last part, which is where I am now. The interviewer told me to message him back at 8am (which is less than 12 hours after the interview) for an update.

Has anyone had a similar experience or any advice on what to do with this situation?"

2,2022-11-15,Should I decline a promotion in hopes that the grass is greener in the long run?,u/HaywoodJablomi313,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ywhn8i/should_i_decline_a_promotion_in_hopes_that_the/,jobs,"Context— I work 2 jobs. Job #1 is Monday-Friday 4am-2pm. $60k after taxes. About $24/hr

Job #2 is Friday-Sunday evenings. ~25 hrs/weekend
$50/hr + tips. Very seasonal and part time though. About $30k each summer (June-October)

I was just offered a promotion in job #1 that would allow me to work 4 days a week. I was told in the beginning that if I get this promotion, I could have Mondays or Fridays off to work job #2 because my supervisors know how important and critical the 2nd job is to me. Anyway, I was just offered this big promotion which is slightly more pay, and a 4-day-workweek instead of 5. This was my whole goal going into this job so that I could still prioritize my weekend gig. Turns out, I won’t be able to get Mondays or Fridays off. It would be a Thursday instead. I only have 3 days to accept or decline this offer. If I decline, I may be eligible again in the future and can try to get the day off that I require. 

Or, they may not offer me this promotion again and I’ll be stuck working 5 days a week for X amount of time until I eventually quit. I cannot decide if I should take the 4 day workweek while it’s offered, or try to hold off for the future in hopes that it pays off. Asking for advice, all of my friends and family seem to have mixed opinions. The question my supervisors keep asking me is; at the end of the day would you rather work 4 days or 5? The answer is obviously 4…. But if I could get a better day off…. That would be great. As of right now, my decision is to tell my supervisors that if they cannot meet my 1 contingency to have a Monday or Friday day off, then I must decline. I am the #1 pick for this position and I am very well liked in the company, which makes me feel like I have a bit of leverage in this. 

To sum it all up, I work significantly less and make significantly more money during the seasonal job than I do at my full time job. Should that be my priority? Should I sacrifice a big promotion for that? Thank you for any advice and sorry for the length/confusion"

I was still curious on this whole thing and wanted to keep him on the hook so I replied, “I’m interested however I really don’t have the extra time to meet up.” 

He replied , “I totally get you bro, let’s be honest, if you’re not ready today, you most likely won’t be ready in the future, how I know? That’s used be me. Think about this for a second, how much value are you getting from the job that you’re currently doing? When I say value, it could be compensation  or skill set which could help you continuously grow in the future. If you don’t have a satisfactory answer for that, you gotta start taking some actions man, whether you choose to join or not, always know you deserve better my friend!”

I try freelancing for a bit but isn't going well and i miss having a formal job, the security of getting a paycheck every week(my last customer was mid October). Unconventional because is a bit difficult for me to get hired. I didn't finish uni(two years in art school), i been dealing with depression, stress(specifically IBS trigger by stress), and anxiety. I had previously worked as a barista(love making coffee, hate dealing with customers), cctv analyst(liked the job, hated the company, not many offers, this job make my IBS worst tho) and tech support(hated this job, everything went wrong), which technically in neither of them i last a year. Although i do control my issues, i get burned out and start to fall apart. Every time i go into a job, i try to make my goal have enough money save up for doctors appointments and medicine, previously most of my income has been use for that, but im unable to reach the point of paying therapy.

I wanted to be a photographer at some point but i have issues with my social anxiety. I know how to edit pictures but not too skilled in graphic design. Im honestly so tire of interviews, last time i got insulted many times because i was young and living alone or shooting for high paying corporate jobs. I cant get hired as a cashier on little market cause i ""don't fit"" but lack work experience for better jobs(?), or that's the type of comments i had received previously before going the freelance way. Also, the fact that i have IBS, issues with depression, stress, etc makes formal companies not want to hire me too.

Any chance anyone can give an advice about what to do in my situation? What type of unconventional and full time jobs exist that pay 500-1000. Btw im from Mexico, near the frontier."
1,2022-11-16,Is it worth applying for jobs if i'm unavailable for almost 3 months of the year?,u/stjm2012,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ywkz36/is_it_worth_applying_for_jobs_if_im_unavailable/,jobs,"I'm currently a full-time university student studying remotely but a condition of remote study in some classes is that I must travel to the physical campus for 2weeks per semester to complete labs etc. I'm also committed to a scholarship program which includes a mandatory 3month internship over summer break (I live in the southern hemisphere so that's often November - February). I'm planning to start applying for casual positions in early 2023.

I quit my casual retail job earlier this year due to a change in ownership of the store. The new owner had no prior experience owning a retail business and as a result, I was often forced to complete management duties and additional duties outside my job position, such as training juniors and completing tasks I wasn't legally qualified to do so, out of necessity so the store could run. Almost all the original employees quit due how we were treated by the new owner so we were often severely understaffed too. The new owner often scheduled me on as if I was a full-time employee despite making it clear that I was only hired to work certain days and still a full-time student. They also refused to accomodate my request for the 3months off for the internship (understandable as this is the busiest time of year for retail but they had previously promised they would honour the arrangement I had with the previous owner) and scheduled me on the weekends which perhaps I wouldn't have minded if it wasn't for the fact that my internship was 3 hours away and I was forced to commute this every weekend. This was made worse by the fact that they started paying me significantly below minimum wage. So far below minimum wage that I at 22 (who had worked at this store since I was 14) was making less than our 14 year old junior that I was training. I know I was crazy to stay as long as I did but I was loyal to the previous owners who were so accomodating to me throughout high school and uni and financially, couldn't afford to quit my job. I obviously left on bad terms and definitely won't be using them as a reference but I feel this will make my job search difficult. 

I've managed to survive the past few months on what little money my scholarship program gives without using up too much of whatever I had managed to save over the years i've been working. Both my parents come from extreme poverty and we weren't well off growing up either so it makes me very stressed to not have the security of a job. The dilemma now is finding a casual position that will hire me with the knowledge I won't be available during the busiest part of the year. I can't afford to not have a job and I can't really afford to quit the scholarship program either.

Do I bother applying at all? If so, should I refrain from mentioning the time i'll need off or be upfront? Should I take the risk and drop out of the scholarship program?

tldr: Committed to a scholarship program that takes up a lot of time but doesn't give enough funds to live. Need a job but not sure how to convince one to hire me with such limited availability."

What constitutes a quality job? If you were to ask family and friends, they would probably say good pay, benefits, and stable working conditions, but for many workers, workplace technologies, especially AI, are affecting job quality.

That’s important because the U.S. has a serious job quality problem. The number one ESG challenge companies are grappling with is the treatment of workers."

My evaluations are always excellent, finding new ways to do things, pushing myself harder in areas to receive success, and more. However a new job came on the horizon.

In my current role for 2.5 years out in the field. I really do enjoy my team and my job. I have a lot of flexibility, create my own schedule etc. I got an offer from another builder to do a similar position with a smaller home builder. It would be the first time they had this role so the day to day is still unclear but the offer is a good amount more than what I’m making now. I was offered $90k/year with $500 a month towards my truck for mileage/maintenance as I do have to drive to multiple communities. I am currently making $70k/year with around $900/month towards my car. 

I am stuck on what I should do. I really do have it nice here at my job with the flexibility and schedule that I have. I usually work about 4-5 hours in the field and finish the rest of the day at home. I’m not sure if I’ll have that flexibility at the other company but it would also take me a good amount of time to get to that $90k that the offer company is offering. We get yearly raises but is usually not more than 5% increase. 

I think the unknown is what scares me because I’m at a bigger and established company that’s pretty secure with great benefits where this other company has been around since the 70s but isn’t as big.

My contract just recently ended, and while I'm looking for some positions I am looking to expand a bit of my skills.

I have a english certificate (I'm in a non-english speaking european country), I have some experience with Excel (although I think would be an interesting idea to get one of those LinkedIn certificates) and with SolidWorks, although I'm a chemical engineer.

I would like to go to the industry and work in factories, but if that is not possible I would be open to anything.

Should I invest in data science and coding, should I focus more on quality management (this is more of a requisit in some job descriptions), and if so, any tip where to start to get it?

I really move out of manufacturing because outside of work I am constantly working as well on my crafts and these jobs do not offer part time positions, so I was wondering. Does anyone know any good part time job suggestions? I've been looking into banking teller jobs but that's kinda where my mind ends, or even a remote job?"

1,2022-11-16,Have you ever stayed in a toxic job for experience? A poem dedicated to my toxic job,u/ReadySetHellNo,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ywz7j5/have_you_ever_stayed_in_a_toxic_job_for/,jobs,"I am a fresh graduate and it's been around 6 months since I started this job. I have absolutely no job experience and the marketplace is so shitty plus the pay is so bad it doesn't even cover basic human needs, unlike this job I landed it pays more compared to the other places. Honestly this job/place was never my dream place to work at, never saw it as some place I would enjoy working at someday because I already knew about the bad reputation my current job has. It's beyond stressful to say the least and just extremely toxic... 

**Anti Workaholic;**  you keep working and getting phone calls/messages even after your shift is over and on your weekend as well. One time a manager called me at 1 fucking am for a stupid fucking reason that could've waited until the next day. There are different shifts (morning, evening, night etc) you never have a full week with the same shift timing, each day you start your shift at a different time like you have no fucking thing to do but them. 

 ***""And the fog comes up from the sewers""*** **-Radiohead;** the fog = unclear boundaries. A coworker with the same position as you would start bossing you around and giving you orders, even to the point of micromanaging you. The management praises them for such behavior. I confronted a coworker (same position) who kept bossing me around, even threatening to tell the manager that I don't follow her orders. Anyways I dragged her ass so that problem was dealt with. My manager took that coworker side and scolded me for not following her orders (reminder: that coworker ISNT my boss or manager or supervisor)

 **Track and field;** let me elaborate, the company has many branches yet they choose to always place employees as far away as possible from their house... there are MANY branches available around your house/close to the area yet they choose to make you commute over an hour to a far away branch. This is something that 95% of the employees struggle with, yet the management doesn't give 2 flying fucks about us.

**Mirror mirror on the wall who's the worthiest of them all;** *""prove your worth""* this is a phrase you will hear since day 1 of joining. Whenever you ask for anything aka basic human rights or you can call it the bare fucking minimum, they tell you that you need to prove you're ""worthy"" to get that thing. You want to go to a closer branch to your house? PROVE YOUR WORTH! You want to go on annual leave? PROVE YOUR WORTH! You want to breathe? PROVE YOUR WORTH! You want to see? PROVE YOUR WORTH! Everyone chants the same phrase you start questioning if you accidentally joined a cult instead. 

You get the point. They always make you feel like you are lacking and whatever it is you do is NEVER EVER enough in their eyes... They grant other employees things they ask for and say it's because they have ""proved their worth"" when in reality what they are doing is plain ***manipulation.*** They make you believe that they didn't grant your request because you lack in some way or the other but the truth is they just use it to grant their favorites whatever they want :) sneaky way I know! jokes on them they think people are too stupid to understand mind fucking games ha ha!

**Slavery;** they expect you work overtime for them but here's the catch.. they refuse to pay overtime! coworkers act like stupidity is a badge of honor *""One day I worked 12 hours"" ""I came to work on my weekend!""* I am telling you that the more I spend time with my coworkers the more they sound like cult members. Oh and you get resented if you leave when your shift ends! They expect you to drop everything you have if they're understaffed (which they are all the time and will be for the next 20 years) and come to work but hey who cares about the 13th Amendment

**Violence is never the answer, it's the SOLUTION;** wait until you meet the managers with their fragile egos! Managers in our company are very competitive! They compete with each other to see how many can yell and humiliate employees, the more the better! Degradation? YES! Destroying employees confidence and motivation? YES! YES! Making sure employees know that they're worthless trash and that they should be grateful to even be hired at the company? HELL TO THE FUCKING YES! My manager has such a fragile ego that if you don't agree with his often stupid illogical opinions, he will keep forcing it down your throat the more you say no he then proceeds to write your name in his deathnote oh no! 

*~~Don't worry dear manager, no employee has the desire to live in this hell, you are doing us a favor xx~~*

**Inferno**

Think I'm getting butterflies, but it's really  
Something telling me to run away 

*-A song dedicated to my toxic job*

**The end.**

I hope this was as enjoyable to whoever reads it as it was writing it :) 

TDLR; Should I stay at my toxic job and gain experience for future better jobs? Or should I quit this job cause it's costing me both my mental and physical health and throw experience out of the window?"

I've read that a way to counteract feeling lonely is going to lunch with colleagues and they indeed have invited me several times to go to lunch with them. However, up until now I've skipped more invitations than I have accepted and have got the feeling that my colleagues are growing impatient with me for that. I feel lonely, but I'm also pretty anxious about meeting new people and decide to eat lunch on my own a lot. I don't know if I should tell my colleagues about my anxieties or if that is oversharing at work. I'm on good terms with my colleagues and I'm sure they'll understand, however, I don't know if I should share something like this at work. What do you guys think? Any advice is greatly appreciated.

No PTO - any time off is unpaid

I work from home in PR. I’m the most junior person on the team. I started with a girl who was one step above me in the hierarchy. Since then my company hired two more people in her position and I have remained the most junior person. 

The girl I started with has been told to take leadership of the rest of the juniors. This has looked like her micromanaging to the point where it’s ridiculous and calling out the other juniors in the group chat that everyone in the company can see when they have missed a link off a spreadsheet.

The day before I left for annual leave she asked me to send out some emails to journalists. I realised once I got halfway down the list that I wouldn’t be around to respond as I’d be away. I told her I would check now and then for emails whilst on holiday. 

I didn’t receive anything from anyone the couple of times I checked. I received a text from this girl the penultimate day of my holiday informing me that I’d missed an email from a journalist but that she had sorted it. I was very upset as I don’t expect to receive texts telling me I’ve done something wrong whilst off on annual leave. Turned out I hadn’t actually received an email. 
 
My question is, is this sort of thing professional? Texting me on my personal phone to let me know in a passive aggressive manner that I have done something wrong? I’m upset and angry to be treated like this but don’t know if I’m overreacting. 

TL;DR colleague texted me outside of work to tell me I’d done something wrong"

Job X has already reached out to Anthem providing them with documentation that I am terminated. My coverage ends on 12-1-22. 

An insurance broker from a firm told me that Anthem is the one that must send me the paperwork via mail after receiving notice of my termination from Job X. Well, I went around in circles today on the phone with different reps from Anthem, and they are telling me the EMPLOYER at Job X is the one who must call COBRA to apply for me on my behalf.

I am on the job hunt right now. I found a job that I could potentially be a good fit for, but the job listing mentions getting 10 hrs of PTO per month and 9.5 holidays. My current job offers 15 hrs of PTO per month and 11 holidays (if only I liked my current job). PTO/work-life balance is extremely important to me and would make or break my decision to take on a new job. Would it be appropriate to reach out to their HR department (they posted hr's email for any questions about the posting) to ask if PTO is negotiable for the right candidate? Or, should I apply for the job and then just intend to negotiate (and assume PTO is always negotiable)? The issue is I'd MUCH rather not go through with the application process if the time off isn't negotiable.

 I would love any input on this subject! Thank you!"

I'm not sure how that works because I have never received any recommendations and my connection is a grand total of 4 people.

I googled the company and the person exists and I was given a word document consisting of behavioral questions that I answered then a few days later, they offered me a position.

My concern is that this must be some kind of scam because no video interview happened nor have I spoken to this guy over the phone but they offered me a position? Is this normal? 

Are getting job offers via LinkedIn recommendations a legitimate thing or is he lying?

On one hand I know that days of corporations feeling loyalty to employees is kind of over. On the other, I am a hiring manager and hate having that happen to me—a great candidate accepts my offer and then later says thanks but no thanks.

When I asked the boss for an explanation I was dumbfounded by his reasoning.

""I have an IT report that you had YouTube open all day on your browser for the past week and you were listening to an audiobook. Who knows how much your efficiency was reduced because of that. If you had used that time on your projects you could have done more work.""

I watch YouTube videos during breaks. When working I either play music or an audiobook in the background.

Used to do this on my previous job too and they didnt care about what I did as long as my work was good and on time.

The point that surprised me the most was that I wasn't even given a warning and fired straight.

I’m being bold and applying for them anyway, because I sincerely believe I could do them well with the experience I already have. For example, I’m applying to an Assistant Director of Alumni Affairs role, but I’ve never worked for a university and my last role was only loosely a teaching job where I didn’t work with students, I worked with the public. 

I even landed an interview recently with an org where I would’ve had “manager” in my title and it’d have been remote, both things you won’t find on my resume (I don’t lie). Sadly I didn’t get it though"

The company I work for went through a conversion that was not handled well at all, and my lacking experience on top of dealing with angry/rude customers took a toll on me. (Not to mention we are very short staffed, like everywhere else right now.) My manager also doesn’t help my coworkers and I when we ask for help, even though none of us have experience in this field and she’s got 10+ years under her belt. On top of that, she throws her work that’s out of our pay grade on us because “she’s too stressed” or “she has too much work to catch up on.” There was one day she moved all her work to a hidden office, so that it would look like her actual office was empty and she wasn’t there, since her office has clear windows where customers can see her and what she’s doing. She made herself completely unavailable to help, which meant everyone else had to work more than usual, and there were some issues we just weren’t trained to help customers with. That same day, she got into an argument with one of the employees who’s been with the company for 40+ years, over which one of them had to help a customer with an issue he was having, ultimately leaving me to to tell him to come back the following day. My manager also doesn’t communicate to this employee about things that happen; for example, she won’t tell her if someone calls out sick until she asks. With my manager not being supportive and having so many responsibilities that are not in my job description on my plate, this job has burnt me out more the last three months than four years of college did. I requested to have this week off just to take a break from it all and work on some personal stuff (like applying to other jobs) and the longer I’m home, the less I wanna go back. I have very supportive parents who are actually encouraging me to find a new job, and have said they’d help me find one if I decided to quit without having a job lined up. (And yes, i do have money saved.) Now I’m wondering if it’s even worth going back. I wake up every morning and dread going into a toxic work environment. This field isn’t even what I went to college for. Professionally I wouldn’t want to use my manager as a reference just because of how awful she’s been, so I feel like I don’t have much to lose if I just didn’t go back on Monday. I’d feel bad because I’d be screwing over the coworkers I like, but this job has put me through hell over the last few months, and this is the most unhappy I’ve been in years. I’ve never worked in such an unprofessional environment in my life. So do I suck it up and go until I find another job or do I just text my boss I’m not coming back?"

Well I just started my second job a day ago and I received a email with a job offer for a way better paying job but it's temporary lile 6 month to a year.

Nothing, the calls always like “Please wait for a response” or emails like “Position already taken” or just no replies at all. He gets mad and goes in person instead and ask to speak to a manager and ask them in person “hey are you hiring?” And they always say “We look at applications online only now” “Try applying online!”.

I’m 30 years old and am currently a pharmacy technician. My profession is not my favorite choice and have been considering going to school for nursing or for being a therapist. I know my passion is helping others. So just trying to figure out which job is more suitable for my personality. I am incredibly empathetic but I also don’t really tolerate mistreatment well. 

FOR ALL MY NURSES:

Would you recommend this job? If yes, why. If no, why. 

Pros and cons?

Do you deal with abuse from patients often? If yes, does upper management care about their employees enough to ban abusive patients?

Is this profession good for mothers to be able to balance while raising children/kid?

Do you make a comfortable living to support yourself financially independently? What route what I need to take to make a more lucrative amount? 

What is the best part of your job? What is the worst? 


FOR ALL MY THERAPISTS:

Are you at risk of being in danger? If yes, what is the safety plan?

Would you recommend this job? If yes, why. If no, why. 

What is the best part of your job? What is the worst?

Is this profession good for mothers to be able to balance while raising children/kid?

Do you make a comfortable living to support yourself financially independently? What route what I need to take to make a more lucrative amount? 

If you’ve been both, I’m super interested in your answers! 

If you took the time to reply to these questions, I appreciate you! I hope this post helps other people like me trying to find the right career path for themselves as well!"

I’m a licensed nail tech. I feel like I have to also mention this is not an average nail salon. It’s white owned, holistic blah blah blah…..Instead of the traditional commission based. I have a set hourly wage. I get the same pay regardless of how many clients I take. The prices have increased to $75 for a regular pedicure and $90 for an upgraded longer lasting pedicure. With this price increase I feel as though my salary should also increase. The clients are told the price includes tip and is based on 20% gratuity. So I’m thinking that if the prices increase so should our salary or am I wrong? The owner says she “takes care of us on the back end so the clients can come and relax” which is why we don’t accept tips. Well, while I make over 20 an hour, I have no benefits. No health insurance, 40k nothing. I definitely am not taken care of. I still live below the poverty line. With my one year review coming up I’m thinking to ask for a raise because I now do so many jobs I was never even hired to do and the stress of this job has actually caused me to go to the hospital one one occasion. I was told when I was hired that in a year I would be moving to lead nail tech. I assumed this would be accompanied by a raise. I had to ask for my own one year review however. How do I ask for a raise and the promotion I was promised?"

I (26/F) need some advice. I'm US based and have had the same job since December 2020. I don't hate the job, it's my first job post-college. As of right now I'm WFH since I am located in a different state. When I started the job, they told me that I'd eventually have to move to where the company is located (so in another state, a neighboring state but on the opposite side) and even give me a stipend. I was ok with that at the time. I'm now hearing rumors that they might ask everyone to go back in-office.

I'm not sure if I can do that anymore. At the time I took the job, my mother had been diagnosed with lung cancer (in the later stages) but was responding well to treatment. It's now taken a turn for the worst and she's not responding to treatment/it's starting to spread. I'm not the primary caretaker (that would be my father) but sometimes I'll assist when I can (which isn't TOO often considering I work a 40 hour job). Nobody at my job knows this, I've never felt the need to disclose it.

I don't know if I should just quit my job, if they tell me I have to go back in-person. I always said that I wasn't going to stay at this job forever (""I'll probably change jobs in 2-3 years"" is what I always said) and I'm hitting that 2 year mark next month. In previous discussions, my manager said they'd want me to move within 60 days after the going back in-office announcement. I'm also really starting to make strides in my personal life to better myself (i.e. currently signing paperwork to start therapy, putting myself out there and getting back into the dating world) and haven't felt this happy since ... a really, really long time. If I have to move, I'd have to start all over again.

I guess I'm not really sure what to do. I'm in a different place, where I'm not really sure if I want to move anymore. Even though I haven't had the greatest relationship with my mother, I'm not sure if moving to a different state now that she's badly in stage 5 is a good idea. I haven't been applying to jobs so if I quit, I'd probably be unemployed for a while. The last time I was unemployed (after I graduated college and it was in the COVID pandemic), I was unemployed for 6 months and it was mentally hard to be like that for 6 months (granted now I have more work experience so maybe that wouldn't take that long? I've been working as a writer in the IT space). There's also some family things too that I'm thinking about. I wouldn't be the first person in my family to quit a job, but sometimes my family will make comments about how I'm a good, hardworking person. They were never really thrilled with the idea of me moving either so I think they'd be ok with me quitting and they wouldn't have any issues supporting me financially again (even though I can support myself as well with my savings)."

Before accepting the offer I asked what the preemployment physical entailed and they did not mention a drug test. With this being a government job I somewhat expected one anyway.
I decided to accept the job and stop consuming THC just in case (casual user). I live in a state where recreational marijuana is legal (MI). There were also jokes about marijuana use during my interview (made by the interviewer). 
After the background check came back my HR rep said it was safe to put in my notice at my current job. And then 2 weeks later I went in for my physical and was given a drug test.
Is this a normal practice to keep drug tests a secret? I’m disappointed because I asked and this was not disclosed and I was still encouraged to leave my current job. 
My results have not come back yet, but it is too late to get my current job back if they happen to come back positive. I feel like I was mislead."

It’s frustrating how disposable people are to these companies and the economy doesn’t seem to be getting better. 

Recently, I’ve been thinking of starting a side hustle after my 9-5 but I’m not sure what I would do, or how to seek out those opportunities. A lot of my friends side hustle in the wedding industry (decor, MC, DJ, coordination) but none of those spark my interest other then a day of coordinate. I like travel, video games, fitness, active wear fashion. I used to like makeup but not as much anymore.  I also used to like education, and feel like there a gap in teaching regular people genetics and bioinformatics, but I also don’t feel qualified to do so with only a BSc. 

My background is in data analysis, bioinformatics and recently product/project management. It’s not even for the money, but tbh I would like more security and a fall back to when there’s another lay off.

I am a bit overwhelmed because not only did I tank the initial interview, but also the second round (technical). The position I applied for was an ""Investment risk Analyst"" requiring solid experience in python. Though I worked with python on a very basic level and know other programming languages, I applied nevertheless and got the initial interview. This initial interview was a mess, I entered the call with maximum confidence, but not be able to answer any questions fully accurate, interview ended by them answering their own questions and explaining everything to me. After that, I had 0 expectation to further progress in the process. 2 weeks later, got a reply for a technical interview (today), the task was to solve few risk problems on jupyter notebook in 20 min time. Given that I was well prepared for python but not the theories behind risk methods, additionally, my laptop was lagging during the whole period of working our the problems, audio problems occurring for \~10min, ended up tanking the 2nd interview as well. I greatly apologized for not meeting their expectations and listened carefully to their explanations and answers to the questions, at the end, the interviewer sent me some links related to risk management and told me to check it out.   


Do I still have a chance? I know I am not fully qualified for this position (technical wise nor theory), but I am willing to learn and improve to not be this stupid again, should I send them an email asking for another chance and express my commitment ? Or is it out of my control at this point?.

Please help me :(,u/lillylovesreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yxu383/terrified_of_quitting_my_job_please_help_me/,jobs,"It has been haunting me all week. The background check completed and now I’m 100% on-board with no contingencies. I’m set to start on Dec. 5, so I need to tell them basically today (especially with thanksgiving being next week). I’ve been there 5 years: the first 3 in-person and the last 2 have been remote (I moved across the country). 

I’m still remote, so it’s going to have to be over video chat. This new position is a position title upgrade and a huge salary increase (they also have way better technology and annual reviews for promotions). Two weeks ago, my boss mentioned the possibility of a promotion in my near future (timing, right? After 5 years lol). My direct manager left 2 years ago and I took on the entire department and have been responsible for it since (I’m not a manager, just a plain ole’ accountant).

I have begun drawing up a ton of documentation, as well as a “transitional” plan to finalize documentation, train my successor, and save any important info/dates. My boss takes it very personally when people leave and he really takes it to heart (he sees the company as his baby). I struggle with social anxiety already, and my fear of being called a “traitor” is taking over.

I’ve been stressing all week and I feel like I can’t breathe. My plan is to message him on Teams later today and ask if he has time for a quick call. I feel like I should say something in that initial text chat message to indicate it.. so I don’t have to see the initial look on his face :O How could I word it?

For the call— I want to script what I’m going to say, but I already can’t find the words. Something along the lines of finding a new opportunity I couldn’t say no to? 

I really need help :( I need to get this over with. I’m also not looking forward to telling my “successor” - she relies on me to fix all problems and messages me everyday asking what’s on the agenda (I did make a yearly calendar with all tasks before)"

I’ve been working at my current employer for about a year when I got my opticians license. 

I tried to schedule a time to talk about pay increase and opportunities for advancement. First it seemed like I was getting ignored. Then I got a meeting with my district manager where I felt disrespected. I had been making $19.95 and got a one dollar raise to $20.95. I got told that was the market rate Licensed opticians in my area but that they would look in other departments to see if there was an opportunity for more pay. 

At the same Time they posted my position at my location on indeed but assured me that it wasn’t for my job. I started job hunting then, assuming that I was going to be pushed out the door. 

Then I had a sit down meeting where HR and my district manager tried to come to an understanding for me to stay. They said soon there would be changes in there would be some increase in pay and I really didn’t know how hard it was going to be working for this not for profit.  We closed it off with the HR manager saying think about it and give me till Monday. Wednesday gets here and no update no phone call no email. So I put in my notice.

I  am taking a position paying $32 an hour with better benefits. I start Monday. 

I would have taken less to stay if he and my district manager had acted like I was a priority from the beginning and acted with some urgency. This whole fiasco has been going on for two months. 

So I feel bad for my practice manager and receptionist that I’m leaving behind. They’re gonna have more work with less help but I had to get out.

And I keep expecting the rug to get pulled out from under me with the new awesome job. There is no way a person like me gets an opportunity like this."

Like a lot of redditors on here the job hunt has been an absolute mess. I'm not getting any offers except for the current industry I work in for the exact same title with less pay. I have a bio degree with a fair amount of lab and research experience, but I don't want to work in either of those settings. I have almost a year of customer service experience and plenty of leadership experience from college, but I doubt companies care about those activities unless it was over the top.

Am I being too picky? Is my only option going back to school or taking some sort of course?"

The downsides of this new job is that there is MUCH less flexibility, it’s larger so the potential to move up could be difficult. 

At my current job there is a potential for growth and in turn higher pay, but it’s not guaranteed and I may have to wait another 2 years before anything like that happens. 

Benefits/pension would be the same for both jobs. 

What should I do? Should I stick it out or leave.

I didn't get a raise (no COL, merit, etc.) earlier this year... so I'm guessing my company is going to try and weasel their way out of giving me a raise this year as well."

Today I made a mistake by letting the older lady pack a huge product and I moved the cage towards me ready to take out before the delivery driver drives off,forgetting about her lifting it onto the cage. The new apprentice (newer than

5,2022-11-17,Laid Off Months Ago - Will New Waves of Layoffs Hurting Job Chances?,u/TA-774337-626,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yxxe4o/laid_off_months_ago_will_new_waves_of_layoffs/,jobs,"Hi all, wondering if anyone else is experiencing this issue. I was laid off at the end of the summer, and have been applying to jobs since. I worked on the operational side of my previous organization, and was applying to similar roles. At the beginning, I was getting some interest and interviews, but the interest has suddenly dried up, mostly since the tech layoffs began.

I didn't start putting this together until last week; a job I'd applied to listed Salesforce as one of its primary responsibilities. I have years of experience with Salesforce, applied, and had finished two interviews, with a third and final scheduled. Abruptly, I was emailed and told my interview was cancelled as they'd be going in a different direction. The next day, the original job posting was re-listed. I hadn't had any contact with them since confirming my interview time, but because this happened a few days after Salesforce announced a batch of layoffs, I'm concerned the main impetus is that the job market was flooded with several people more qualified to work on Salesforce than I am. Maybe its a coincidence, but I'm still nervous.

Particularly with many of the roles being cut in the thousands from tech being my field, I'm afraid that the sudden saturation of those candidates in the job market will influence me. I have decent experience, but even just from LinkedIn connections I'm seeing far more qualified people starting to seek jobs in the same space. Wondering if anyone else who may have been laid off not-so-recently is experiencing this, has any advice, or even just words of encouragement?

I should also be clear, I have nothing but sympathy for those who have been part of this wave of tech layoffs, or who may soon be. Being laid off, simply put, sucks, and I feel awful that those being let go are entering an already mediocre job market, from my experience."

1,2022-11-17,"Job posting on HireArt but not on company website, is that normal?",u/jumpgirl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yxyk47/job_posting_on_hireart_but_not_on_company_website/,jobs,"Hi everyone, I found a job listing on Craigslist, which links to an application page on HireArt. Cursory googling searching of HireArt seems to indicate it's a recruiter company of some sort. Both the CL post and the HireArt page list the name of the company, so I took a look at their website. The site has a careers page listing a number of jobs but not the one I found on CL.

Does this mean the company has filled the position, that HireArt is just a little slow on taking the listing down, and that applying would be a waste of time? Or is it normal for companies to contract with recruiters for some jobs in a way that requires only the recruiter gets to advertise for the job opening so people can't sidestep the recruiter and lose them their fees?

I'm not super knowledgeable on how recruiter companies work, so I would greatly appreciate anyone with more experience than me who's able to share some information. Thanks!"

Almost two years ago my company was founded and they hired me as a front office manager. I did everyting: stocks, recruiting, product manager, etc. Many types of jobs as someone that is front office manager usually does. 

So here's the thing, about one year ago my boss asked me if I wanted to be director of companies that would eventually work with us. I told him yes, I had my fair amount of unemployed in the past and I didn't wanted to be fired.

But...one year later, I regreted, and most of all, I don't feel good neither I'm good at. 

Since 5 months that this position is giving me anxiety, problems at home ( I come stress almost of the times), the people who work with me think I'm not proactive, when I'm not motivated at all, etc. I already cried a lot of times, because it's really been awful working with colleagues that think shit about you when you actually are not motivated neither know what to do as a director.

I thinking about to have a private meeting with him and telling that I'm not happy as a Director, I'm not motivated, and I don't think I'm suit for Director since I don't have the knowledge for that. 

Should I go talk to him? I don't if I'm going to be fired or not, I know he will be disappointing, but my mental health hasn't be good lately and I think there are more skilled people that can be director and can help the company."

However I finally heard back and it sounds like she wants to start training on Monday. 

Now I'm torn. Do I hop from one job to the next or do I just stick to my pizza delivery job since I'm already settled there? I've been making decent money so far but I'm guessing I'd make more as a bus driver. Plus I wouldn't have to work late hours or weekends, and wouldn't have to drive my own car around. However another thing that makes me hesitant is that my mother has not been happy with my work situation, saying I might not be cut out for living on my own. If she hears I left a job again I know she'd blow a fuse. Should I try to have both jobs? Like maybe just work at the pizza restaurant 1-2 times a week just to stay on the schedule?

I would be their first fully remote employee, I’m based on the east coast.

The recruiter called me today to tell me they were going to make me an offer, then asked if I was willing to file as a 1099 instead of a W2. I don’t remember her exact explanation but she said it was beneficial for the company in some way but they would still consider me a full employee and grant equity and would adjust my compensation upwards to account for the insurance or any additional costs. 

Not knowing much about 1099 status, I assumed they were trying to avoiding making major changes to their insurance coverage or something just to cover one remote out-of-state employee which seems reasonable. I told her I was open to it as long as my compensation was fully adjusted to cover additional costs, and that I might need to talk to an accountant or lawyer to make sure evaluating the situation correctly. She said that was fine, and she would send an offer in a few days. 

Reading more about 1099 status, I’m starting to have second thoughts. Is this a common situation? Are they trying to screw me?"

1,2022-11-17,Advice needed for resume,u/LyraTheArtist,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yy5o45/advice_needed_for_resume/,jobs,"Hello everyone. I had a career coach review my two-page resume. Her feedback to me was that it would be too confusing for recruiters to understand and that I needed to work on my key words for ATS. She also said I shouldn't be describing all of my job duties on the resume, but to only write about my work accomplishments. 

Using a sample resume provided to me by the career coach, I got my resume condensed to one page to focus on my career accomplishments and to also include more key action words. 

I understand that length is not the most important factor in a resume, and a lengthy resume may even be detrimental when a recruiter doesn't have the time to read everything, but now that I've trimmed down my resume to one page it seems like a large part of my work history is missing. Has anyone else experienced this when being advised to trim down their resume? And what did you do with some of the things you took out from your original resume? Did you summarize them in your cover letter instead?"

Should I try calling again?,u/LavendurrHoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yy5uwn/playing_phone_tag_with_a_potential_employer/,jobs,"Hi everyone, so I applied for a marketing position that I’m REALLY interested in. I was lucky enough to be one of the first 15 applicants according to LinkedIn.

Thursday: I sent my resume and cover letter to the email address provided in the LinkedIn listing AND used the LinkedIn Easy Apply just in case. The email address belonged to a specific person at the company.

Friday: Next day I get a phone call while I’m driving. It was the employee I sent the email to. All she says is her name, her phone number and to give her a call back (nothing about an interview). I called her back 25 minutes after her initial call, no answer, I left a message.

Tuesday: She still hasn’t called back and I’m afraid of putting her off by calling again. So, first thing in the morning I sent an email apologizing for missing her first call, let her know I tried to call back and left a message, and stated that I don’t want to interrupt her day so she’s free to call back any time.

Thursday (Today): She still hasn’t called me back or responded to my emails, and I’m afraid I’ve missed the opportunity, especially because now LinkedIn says there’s 90+ applicants.

Should I call her again? Send another email? I really don’t want to be rude since I think it’s her personal phone number and other applicants could be blowing up her phone. The company and position seem so well suited for me, and I’m afraid I messed up my chance by missing her first call.

Thanks in advance!"

I don’t focus on generating my own business like a lot of people with my licensing, I instead focus on helping other loan officers with the business that they bring in and getting their files closed - I was hired into this position where I specifically would not need to worry about building my own book of business.

Today, I arrived to work (my first day back after having approved PTO for my wedding) and my boss pulled me into a meeting and I was told that after tomorrow (the end of the pay period), my salary is being cut entirely and I am being switched over to 100% commission. I currently have a small compensation plan that accounts for $8,000-$10,000 a year. A compensation plan was discussed verbally but one was never given in writing nor did I sign anything confirming I approved of the switch.

This effectively means that until I build my own book of business I have zero income and my household just lost over half our total income due to this, it could easily be 60 days or longer before I’m looking at a commission check. 

I wasn’t terminated, but I am now going to be making no money for the foreseeable future because of a change in pay structure that I did not want or request. How difficult will it be to successfully file for unemployment?"

However, my current job also has a 6 month probation period so idk what to expect with that. 

I'm also worried it will look bad on my resume if I leave this job so quick. I also have a 15 month lease, but can cancel it with 2 months payout, but it still is a lot of money and work to make the move with the employer. The other job is only around 2 and 1/2 hours away though, it's just the costs of moving and resigning a lease, changing address, etc that's the hardest."

While trying to fit some more tape in the drawer i removed the wallet and placed on the counter so i could find it a better spot, while trying to do two things at the same time I accidentally threw the wallet away in the trash with the damages. The wallet hadnt been claimed for 30 days, but there was about 400 dollars in cash. My manager later asked if i had seen it and i said no cause actually did not even remember seeing the wallet that day. They looked but obviously didnt find it. I later remembered i was messing with stuff around that area and i assumed i could’ve thrown it away. I obviously told my manager and the trash hadnt been taken out yet so we found it luckily. But i cant help to think that it looks bad! My manager made no fuss about it other than asking “how did you throw it away” and was happy we found it but i cant help but to feel bad, not for the mistake for it was an honest mistake, but because they might think I did it maliciously to retrieve it later somehow idk, am i being too hard on myself?

So I had a second interview today for a role I’m really interested in, the interview was scheduled for an hour but it ended up being 35 mins instead.

The interviewer stated that this interview was just to answer questions I may have had about the role and kinda run through everything. From the sounds of it, it sounded like they really liked me and there was a lot of “when” Instead of “if”. I’m stressing myself out because I wish I had asked more questions to make myself sound more eager. The first interview ended 20 mins early and they liked me enough to give me a second interview so I’m not sure. A lot of people are saying it’s a bad sign. Could this be a bad thing? HELP!

My husband said, ""You can do whatever you want,"" which, A, I was fully aware of, and, B, was not really what I was asking about. So seeking some advice from strangers.

July of 2021 my career began to fall apart. I had been highly effective and successful in my management role, team leadership, development, principles, all of that, I played it to a T. They actually put me on a brochure advertising management roles at this company, that's how perfectly I was executing my job and career. It was like being a Kardashian but the world was the size of my company (and still very big, just not compared to the whole world).

I knew clearly what my trajectory was and where it would lead me, and I had solid plans for my future. Then suddenly my leadership team essentially refreshed, it was either brand new people or existing people in new roles, and I'm not going to bore you with details but some were in and some were out, and I was out. None of it made sense so eventually I opened an HR investigation which produced some indication I was discriminated against due to family status. I should probably be talking to an attorney right now but I want to get away from this company, not own more pieces of it, so I'm talking to reddit.

My plan was to take a long leave to figure things out, and I have, then quit and never go back at all. Haha, byeee, freedom to me. I'm starting my own business and couldn't be more grateful I'm not still on that life plan I was. But I'm also walking away from from stock, pay, etc, that I could easily snag by going back in and quitting the HR way. I have no interest in doing these people any favors, so I thought it might be fun to go in and turn in my notice and then let them figure out what to do with me, pay me, and not fire me, all at the same time,  as well as giving that leadership team some Office Space level feedback, just to enjoy watching them hear it. 

I'm rarely this evil, these ideas don't come to me often, the business I'm starting is peaceful and contributes to the betterment of the planet and people. Should I do this for fun and money? The company will suffer zero, the people who made me suffer for a year will at least be inconvenienced, and it will be pretty entertaining for me."

I started working my first job on Oct 31st 2022 in small company far from my house as Accounting staff. The salary is minimum salary (per month), I’m not in the US btw, and I work 9-6 but since the CEO is never in the office, me and my coworker (there are only 2 of us now) come in around 9.30-10am and leave around 5-6pm (we have no HR). And I get paid leave 14 days annually.

Recently ppl here has been telling me about the downside of this company such as late salary payment (I haven’t experienced it but it seems pretty normal thing for them), the CEO makes them as his ‘shield’, and stuff like that. I mean for now I don’t relate to those but I work here as accounting staff but I have the job desc as administration staff, which really underusing my skill and my degree.

Recently I have applied to some companies and I just got off from a phone interview and she seems interested in me and asked how is the notice period in my current company.
This company I interviewed is a specific accounting position, and they probably will offer same salary with insurance, but I don’t get paid leave before one year of working there, so if I want to, it’ll be unpaid leave. the work hours are 9-6 (exactly that because there’ll be records for that), and the company will be much much closer.

My question is should I do it? and if I should, then how do I quit? like how do I make notice period or stuff like that? do you think it’s a good change?

People with experiences like this, please help me🥺"

I'll hopefully be obtaining a Bachelors of Science in Business Technoloy and Analytics in about a year and then it'll be about 2025 (early to mid) when I get my Bachelors of Business Administration in Management and Leadership. As of right now I am using loans to pay for my school but I am fortunate enough that my parents are taking on the loans for now and I will pay what's left over once I start making decent money. As of today I have about 8 terms left.  My goal is to go into Construction Management however I have no experience in the field. As of right now, I'm working in data entry at a pharmacy that pays an okay wage but does have a tuition assistance program that is helping with the cost. Becoming a senior means that I'm now available to apply for more mentorships/internships as most offered through school services were mostly looking for seniors (applied to some as a junior and never got any calls back). My question is, should I stick to my job right now and get some school paid off but make a decent wage ($20.50) or try and look for internships/mentorships to try and get some experience? Some nternships/mentorships I've seen pay about $1-$3 less than what I'm making now, which is fine but still rough. Would love to hear some thoughts and thanks to anyone who reads all of this, lol"

I work in a union for a utility company(field service) and the pay is fair (manager always tells me you will never be rich, or poor) plus the benefits are amazing.  My coworkers are great too and if you meet union guys they are hard working, hard nosed people that will never leave the company they are at.

Ever since I turned 30 though I have looked around at the so called “lifers” and lately I have begun feeling that I do not want to ever be that person.  HOWEVER, I feel like any career change at this point would be a significant step back monetarily and it just scares the living hell out of me to leave such a great company with such good benefits.  I want to work outside because office life makes me depressed.  I do have a college degree but I feel like that’s irrelevant at this point.  Any ideas on what paths I can take?"

So they probably know he’s nowhere near manager material. While I worked here, I kept it very professional-always used office speak to describe my issues with him and flat out refused to elaborate on it after I moved groups for fear it would reflect badly on me. My question is, now that they can’t affect me anymore, should I be honest about him? Do I keep it professional and not say anything negative about him or should I let them know exactly what he’s been doing on their dime?"

For the future, I have a large interest, as do many others, in working for the FBI or other federal agency. Particularly my interest lies in working with or helping children in some way. Originally I wanted to become a Pediatric ER Doctor, but I think med school is out of the cards for me. Now, I am interested in pursuing perhaps something in the field of criminal justice in regards to protecting or finding justice for cases regarding child safety. I am also interested in counterterrorism. 

  
Let's say hypothetically this was my experience:  


* Bachelor of Science in *Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security &amp; Cybersecurity, Concentration in Emergency Preparedness*
* Bachelor of Science in *Atmospheric Science*
* 2-3 Years of Experience working professionally within my states homeland security division.
* A masters degree.

I guess my question lies with, if I were to apply with the above education and experience. Is there any particular masters degree you could recommend? Currently I am considering a masters in Emergency Management &amp; Homeland Security with a concentration in Security Risk Analysis. However, I have also considered receiving a graduate degree in Psychology or Criminal Justice as well.

I have even considered a master's in child psychology given my interest in child safety, but my guess is that since you would be looking at the adults committing the crime, you would want a more general degree in psychology instead.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much for your time an help! Thanks!"

Interview process was great. I went to the restaurant to do my trial and I had a blast. Really got along with everyone: manager said he had a good feeling. I even saw someone I knew from another  restaurant. A day later I texted him to say how good it was to see him and I hope it works out. He replied with: “such a good surprise to see you! Glad you enjoyed your experience, hope to see you soon!” I said “I’m confident you will” and he left me on read. A thing to note here is he’s not a manager or anything. So there are three possibilities going through my head. Does he know something I don’t? Or am I overthinking this massively. This is a restaurant I’ve dreamed of working at for years and after a year at a job that makes me cry just thinking about it was really thinking I had something."

Edit: I should be clear that I have no issues with jobs drug testing and have done drug tests for work in the past. I suppose I’m a bit confused about what they’re testing for since recreational weed is legal and use is common (especially in this industry). I know that I’ll pass the test regardless, just a bit confused it guess.

Edit 2: I’ve been informed about the insurance reasons for a drug test that doesn’t necessarily focus on marijuana. I barely drink myself, let alone smoke, so I’m not worried about passing it, like I said I was just a bit thrown by the request and wanted feedback."

In the job search process I interviewed at about 7 places while working long days. Still, got the dream job.
I started onboarding this week and met my team. So far so good. Then another definitely-2nd-runner up company reached out and made a verbal offer well over my current accepted salary rate. Like well over. 
However I didn't spend a lot of time researching them, I feel like I've already learned the money-doesn't-buy-happiness rule and like I said, I really wanted to get to the company I'm now out.
Enter doubt - am I stupid, should I use this to negotiate something? I don't want to start off on the wrong foot or muscle my new boss but I know this is a rare opportunity. One thing I may use to negotiate is title (I'm senior to my role which apparently does not appear in HR paperwork...)
Any guidance? I'll even take ""let it go,"" I'm just incredibly indecisive about reaching out to my boss, probably because I'm plain exhausted from what it took to get here."

I've heard similarly from a lot of people online, but I've applied to at least 100 jobs in the last couple months, and I've only gotten one interview (I couldn't accept the job, the benefits are atrocious and it sounds like something is off with the company). It was never like this for me in the past.

I have a fantastic resume and experience and I don't know how it's possible that there's *this* much competition. Are most jobs not actually hiring, but putting feelers out on job boards anyway?  


Edit: My resume has been peer-reviewed by qualified people multiple times, and it both stands out and is very professional, so that isn't the issue. If anything it's my lifeline right now. I have a mid-career level job and I don't actually have a degree in anything related to my field which hasn't been an issue for me after I landed my first job in this field, but I think it may be working against me now. I do have a degree, but I wasn't formally educated in most of what I'm currently doing."

Due to the living situation and my back, there is no space to clean the pants/shirt/whatever else is needed (I can't bend down either). Even if it was clean and every piece of clothing was perfect, I have no space to properly hang/store them. Random boxes are everywhere taking up the floor space and tables/drawers are filled up completely. I have to leave this place ASAP but of course, I don't have a job or money to leave.

I sent a thank you that evening and Friday I received an email from the hiring manager in response saying that things were moving slow on their end and they would reach out by the end of the following week. 

My husband thought that keeping me in the loop sounded positive. I think they have made someone else an offer and they asked for time to consider it and that they won't outright reject me until there's a signed agreement. 

Please let me know what you all think.

Update: got the call yesterday and accepted their offer today. Things just ran behind especially with the holiday 🙂"

Basically, he will not accept me saying no to going to a party. He's logic is that both of us have been promoted at the same time, and therefore it's ""obvious"" that I must show us to the party at his house because it's a party for me as well. I have been at this company for a short amount of time and I take a long time to feel comfortable with people.

I recently started a job working as data entry for company X. When applying for this position, I was promised unlimited item overtime, and a handful of benefits, which are actually really good. I had no experience specific to this, and it is the field that I enjoy a lot. 

 I should also note that the department I am in for this company was nearly 9 months behind on its data entry. Anyways, once I learn most of the basic programs and how to maneuver the system, I am told to have a field day. I manage to get most of the stray data and mostly catch up while keeping up with my daily tasks after about 4 months. I also find a lot of discrepancies between certain reports and let my manager know, which initially inadvertently brought my co workers work into light. Needless to say this doesn’t fare well with them, but I am there to learn, do my best, and take home a paycheck. Word gets out and a manager from a different department comes up to me and wants to poach me. It is being advertised that I am being desired for a position in a different department which would come with a 25% raise plus bonuses and stock options, but I would have to apply through the internal portal, which would alert my manager. This concerns me because he has already set in motion a 1 year “progression plan” that covers a lot of really interesting topics and necessary skills for advancement in this career, but does not come with a promotion or a raise.

The new department is seemingly completely different and the manager said that she was ok with growing pains. I will say that she is more of a leader than a manager and is known within the company to be an excellent person to work with.

Do I take the risk and apply and possibly slap my manager in the face for taking a chance on me?"

Its contingent on my passing of the Sterling Background check and drug test. I'm not at all worried about the drug test, but as far as the background check goes, I'm a little stressed.

I'm newly 21 and I've never done this before. For the employment history, I did the dates to the best of my knowledge, but I've only worked small odd and end college jobs off and on for 4 years. I'm worried that I could be off by a a few weeks or maybe a month on a few of the start/end dates. The same worry goes for my past addresses as I just went off what my parents told me. Also, one of my job titles was Sales and Marketing Campus Ambassador. It limited me to 30 characters so I wrote Sales Ambassador, but I probably should have put Campus Ambassador. Is this going to be a problem? 

Additionally, I got a minor in consumption when I was 17 and it was dismissed but not expunged. I obviously didn't bring this up because I never thought I'd have to and they never asked about crimes. Do you think I will fail the background check because of this?

Thank you so so much"

The problem is they told me the salary is $40-$43k in Austin TX.

I’m willing to make the move but oh my fucking god i couldn’t even live off of that in my dreams. My current job that I hate I make more there.

Should I stick through in hopes I can negotiate a higher salary (they said the salary isn’t negotiable due to budgets) or just send a nice thank you but no thank you.

My last real job I made $57k and it was remote as well.

Thanks!"

19,2022-11-18,Applying for jobs is a cruel process. I finally advanced my career after almost a year of rejection as a new Post-Grad.,u/cybernetics_cat,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yyv2h2/applying_for_jobs_is_a_cruel_process_i_finally/,jobs,"This is something for those who feel hopeless or like there is no light at the end of the tunnel. I was straight up depressed this entire year while applying for jobs and getting nonstop rejections. 

Background:

I had 8+ years corporate experience working with mid size IT Projects with a B.A. in Economics. I hit a wall in my career without having some sort of masters degree. After finishing my masters, I was looking to leave my miserable job for something better.

Experience:

I started applying for jobs December 16th, 2021. I didn't start hearing back until about early February for job interviews. During this time I applied for roughly 5-10 jobs a day every day for almost a year specifically in regards to IT Business Analyst/Data Analyst roles. I found my jobs on linkedin, then would apply through their company website. I would say the ratio was roughly for every 100 job applications, I would hear back from 1 for an interview.  When I felt burnt off I would take a week off then go back to applying for jobs. I had about every single miserable experience possible. Most of the times the interview process would be 3-5 interviews stretching on weeks/months before a rejection or being ghosted. The irony throughout this whole thing, is the job that ended up hiring me did so on the spot and only made me wait over a weekend. Meanwhile, another job that gave me an informal offer left me on the hook for a months and only gave me the paperwork after I told them I had accepted another offer. In total I had probably 20+ job interviews and rejections. I realized that despite being extremely qualified for most roles, most of the process relies on luck. 

Experiences I had: 

* I went through 5 rounds of interviewing only to be ghosted by the company.  
* I went through 5 rounds of interviewing to be told I was asking for too much money ( I wasn't)
* I was told a job was remote work, only to later be told it wasn't remote work mid interview series. 
* I had an interview where the second round was a technical interview. Nobody told me it was going to be a technical coding test and they wanted me to code in a Microsoft teams window on the spot. I outright bombed and failed. 
* I interviewed for a role where the director of the department told me their ideal candidate had 10+ years with a specific software that had not even existed for 10 years. I asked them for their ideal vision/goals for the department and they told me they didn't know and they weren't an empire builder. 
* I was passed upon internal jobs for coworkers far less qualified because the coworker guilted the hiring manager about having a newborn baby and needing the money
* I was passed upon an internal job by someone who also wasn't qualified but because they were older (50+) it was presumed they would just be a better fit. 
* I had a recruiter not show up to their own interview that they set up with me. 

Conclusion:

You can only be so competent of a person. Most of the job application process is luck. It's so hard to escape the misery of job interviewing, all you can do is just keep on trying and grinding."

I graduated in May and finally landed a career-related job in early October. Well, not completely “career-related” I guess. It’s a remote job that includes operating the live streaming of various sporting events, and my career focus has been filmmaking. Still it’s a good paying job and something I think is still more professional than fast-food. 

It’s also a contract job via another company that looks to go until 2024. And  just like it’d be a bad idea to move somewhere without getting a job first, I’m not planning on leaving this job without reason. But should I keep looking for a better, career-related job now and not pay attention to how long I stay at this job, or do I just keep doing the grind for the next couple years and then start to job hunt? Personally, I’d prefer and probably do the former, as I don’t think anyone should be forced to stay at a job longer than they want."

For the entire 5 years I've been saying I'm going to quit and find something else, but having been out of the workforce for so long, I had zero confidence in myself. We're in a team of 3, and I absolutely despise my boss - everyone does, and that is proven by the constant turnover of the third admin staff member. We've had 7 in 3 years... 7! Anyway, I could go on about what i hate, but I'm already rambling, and it's not really relevant.

So, last week I decided to have a browse on a jobseeker website, and saw a job doing pretty much what I do now for $35k/year more. I applied, not expecting to get anywhere, but got a call for an interview the next day. Again, I went along not expecting anything to come of it, but they called me 4 hours later offering me the position.
In my excitement (someone actually wants me to work for them, and give me lots of money to do it!), I accepted immediately, but now it's sunk in, I'm feeling all kinds of ways. I'm writing up my resignation as we speak to hand in on Monday and am feeling incredibly ill. I'm surprisingly actually scared. What if taking this job was a mistake? ""Better the devil you know"", right? It's all happened so quickly, and I was never mentally prepared for this. My boss is going to flip her lid. I feel guilty enough already, I don't need her losing the plot.
I guess I just need support that I'm doing the right thing and everything is going to be ok..."
2,2022-11-19,Exit interview: how honest should I be?,u/FemmeFeather,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yz47du/exit_interview_how_honest_should_i_be/,jobs,"So I’m quitting a job at a large(ish) nonprofit and I’ve only worked there for half a year. Anyways, it was a very miserable experience for me. My coworkers were so incredibly cold towards me from the start (I learnt I was only one excluded from the Halloween party and they ‘forgot’ to tell me), my boss would punish me for no reason or make up a reason I could easily disprove, no one gave me direction, no one helped me, etc etc. Basically, after tons and tons of incidents, my physical and mental health started to go down hill really fast, I decided that nothing is worth being this miserable. The pay wasn’t even that good and I moved for this job to a tiny town where I constantly heard racist and homophobic remarks towards me. I decided I needed to be back with my family before the snow comes in and traps me in a even worse situation. 

Anyways, on Monday the HR guy (literally the only one who was nice to me) told me he’d invite me for lunch for an exit interview. 

So how honest should I be about my experience? I don’t want to come off as whiny and bitter, but I also want them to know how badly the stress affected me. Should I go all in? Sprinkle in some white lies? I want to be as professional as possible but also let them know that it was a complete shitshow, so I’m feeling stuck on how I should approach this…"

I hope that’s okay. Not looking to farm or anything, genuinely just want to hear from as many people as I can. 

I work in pharmaceutical research. I am employed by a well-known CRO who staffs me directly for a very respected pharma company. For all intents and purposes, I work directly for that pharmaceutical company as a contractor through the CRO. I like the pharmaceutical company I work for a lot and they are very well established. The work is challenging but the work life balance is significantly better than a majority of the industry. 

I’m 29 years old, looking to retire early (late 40s/early 50s). I invest roughly 45k a year between maxing 401k and a traditional brokerage account.

The pharmaceutical company I am working for wants me to work for them as a direct FTE (lateral move, i.e., ‘contractor to FTE conversion’). I’ve more or less capped the career ladder in my current capacity through the CRO, but if I go to the pharmaceutical company, there is a lot of opportunity for growth. The issue is that the base pay they are offering is about 25k-30k lower than my current salary and I’m scared to death. I could jump ship right now and take a job for 200k+ and benefits at some other company but I risk terrible worklife balance. That being said, the offer does include some other noteworthy benefits. I’ll compare and contrast below:

My current company (as a contractor):
168k salary, health insurance (HDHP/HSA, about $50/mo. cheaper), 21 vacation days, 10 holiday days, 401k match 4.5%, no annual bonus, no stock awards, no pension, more or less capped job growth wise. 

The pharmaceutical company:
140k salary, health insurance (PPO, a bit more expensive but better coverage…however I’m healthy and barely ever go to the doctor so it kind of feels like forced overkill), 24 vacation days, 1 flex day, 15 holidays, 401k match 4.5%, annual bonus (target of 13%, though what I have heard from what I believe to be reliable sources is that worst case scenario is generally of 13% base pay, best case of 26%, so I can generally expect to fall somewhere in the middle on average), stock option rewards based on merit (and automatically awarded at higher level roles), pension plan with 4.5-10% of base pay (based on age) + 3.3% + CPI adjustment, and of course opportunity for growth. 

I understand that with bonus, pension, and 401k match I could likely come close to my current base (perhaps even slightly higher if it’s a good bonus year), but I’ve also gotten used to a certain standard of living with my current biweekly income and I’m really scared of how the change is going to feel. Me and my wife like to go out to dinner a lot and take a lot of impromptu trips and splurge every once in a while. What would you do if you were me?

2,2022-11-19,Advice needed. Got a job offer but struggle with anxiety.,u/AccordingToNothing,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yz6ol3/advice_needed_got_a_job_offer_but_struggle_with/,jobs,"So, I haven't had a job in 3 years because of anxiety and depression, but now I have no choice but to return to the workforce. I started looking for something and finally got an offer. The pay is ok, it's close to home, the work culture seems fine, and the job itself is more or less in line with what I want to try.

The problem is, it's an analytical position (which is good) that requires proactivity and ability to work without instructions (which is bad). I was told specifically that they look for a person who is able to create new methods without much direction. It's a small company, so they mostly work for results without excessive paperwork.

I think I'm a different kind of guy though - I get anxious when I have to do things without clear instructions. I'd prefer boredom of unexciting work rather than the dread of not knowing how to deal with stuff. I constantly overthink everything, and the more freedom I have, the more overthinking happens. I was always like this, and I don't think I can or want to fight it.

That said, I'm not sure if I'll be able to find another job that fits my criteria, unless it's a very basic position. I'm getting cold feet, I feel unqualified, and I *am* rather stupid, but realistically speaking I don't know what to do if I refuse this offer, especially considering my 3 years gap. 

Still, maybe I should try looking for more options, something more relaxed and systematic? The problem is, it's really hard to judge what is what before you actually start working, so it's still a shot in the dark. I have to give a final answer in a few days, and I'm thinking to ditch the offer, but..."

What can I do in this situation?,u/PlzDontFindWhoIAm,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yz7pb4/manager_wants_to_promote_me_but_tech_lead_is_not/,jobs,"I've been at the company for over 2 years now (this is my first job, I am junior software developer status).  Here are the 2 parts to the situation:

1.  My manager is trying to get me promoted and hes been pushing the narrative that I am an expert in the specific area I'm doing work in at my company.  He knows that I am not there yet but we agreed that I would make a plan to get there (its sort of a tall order but I might be able to pull it off).

2.  The flip side of #1 is that it seems that my immediate project lead (amongst a few other coworkers) does not trust me enough to give me bigger tasks.   It seems that hes always asking for undeniable proof (aka a separate unbiased source) that any issues I find are real issues.  And it almost seems like hes putting me on a tight leash, not able to make my own creative decisions.  I've been working under this lead for 9 months now.  When he gives me work, he has almost always tells me to do it a certain way, to the point of giving me the exact solution (feels like hes not giving me any room to think up or try my own solutions, its like I'm his lap dog to mindlessly do tasks for him).  

I have made honest mistakes that, maybe have caused him to lose trust in me.  But I don’t know what to do in this situation cause it feels like I am expending a lot of extra energy to talk and present information a certain way to him instead of just being myself.  Like, I feel that I'm not allowed to make mistakes.  That I always have to consult with him about any work I'm doing and I have to run by him if the work is correct.  This is so suffocating.  I feel like I'm not learning anything.  Any time I try to do something on my own without making sure that it aligns with his way of doing things, he gets pissed off at me.  Just today, he gave me so many additional tasks at the end of the work day.  I'm really pissed off at him but i'm try to hold off those feelings because I obviously don't want to go off on this guy and if I try to argue with what hes saying or be confrontation about my issues working with this guy, I don't know the true repercussions.  Hes very smart and is extremely well-respected and many people depend on him since he manages a lot of work streams.  On the flip side, I'm not really respected at my company and many people don't trust my work.  I was trying to do things on my own accord because I thought that he was really busy and I could practice being autonomous, especially on minor decisions.  

What can I do in this situation?  I need opportunities to grow and make mistakes so I can become my own person in the professional field.  I can't just blindly follow someone else's orders all the time without exerting my own critical thinking."

I started my job about 7 months ago, and had an amazing boss up until 2 months ago until she left for a new job. Ever since she left, I was promised that there would be a replacement over and over again. For context around my job, I work at an agency (5 people) and had done a lot of outreach for our company to acquire new clients. 

Without going into too much detail, the replacement never happened over these last 3 months and upon taking my first PTO ever, I was terminated the day I got back (right before the holiday season). I have a lot of thoughts on how unprofessional everything was handled and was even told that I had been doing a great job with one of our most difficult clients. I had never received any indication of poor performance and the lack of transparency I received from our co-founder was honestly mind-boggling. His reasoning was that they were looking for someone more senior although I was constantly told that they were looking for a replacement for my old boss.

Upon termination, I received a request from one of my coworkers the next day if I could go back into my email and connect them to all my open conversations. I was a little turned off by this as they're basically asking me to do more work for them after getting fired with 0 notice. I'm wondering what you guys think about this request and if it's something I should feel obligated to do. I'm heads down in the process of applying to new jobs and just can't get myself in the right frame of mind to go back into my old work email and write a dozen or two emails for them while I'm struggling to find a new opportunity in this terrible job market.

Appreciate you all for taking the time to read this.

His shift starts at 5AM and the registers are not open, so it is common practice (that many of the employees partake in) for him to grab a redbull and pay for it when the registers do open. Yesterday, he was called in by loss prevention and told that he had failed to pay for three Red Bulls over the course of three months, constituting stealing. He immediately paid for them, was very remorseful, but still, this was sent to corporate who has a no tolerance policy for “theft.” This was truly an honest mistake, but he was terminated. He has appealed it with corporate HR and we should hear back in a couple of days. However, he is obviously looking ahead for other positions. How does he move forward and explain this? Does he leave it off his resume (leaving a year gap)? Can he even get unemployment? Any advice appreciated."

These will be their very first jobs, so entry level (supermarket, fast food, summer camp, lifeguard, etc). My main question is this: **Would it be better to plan our vacation for the beginning of summer or the end?**

I can think of pros and cons to both:

* Vacation at beginning of summer:
   * Pros: Can possibly continue working into the next school year.
   * Cons: Might not be able to get a job in the first place if the expectation is to start at the beginning of summer.
* Vacation at end of summer :
   * Pros: Nice break before school starts. No risk of starting too late.
   * Cons: Employer might be upset at the vacation and not allow work to continue into the school year or might possibly not provide a positive reference.

In addition to my main question, I have some extra questions:

1. When do summer jobs typically start? If there's a buffer after school starts then ""starting late"" might become a non-issue.
2. Will employers be upset at ending early for a family vacation? And if an employer is told up front, will they likely not offer the job?"

I have a lot of freedom, no overtime hours, good pay. I have a BFA and many of my classmates work at Starbucks or are otherwise struggling to have a relevant career.

But some things in my personal life are contributing to me feeling drained and depressed. I developed a life altering medical condition shortly after getting this job which doesn’t prevent me from working but makes my personal life suck. My job is also 700 miles from my family and I didn’t realize how much that would affect me. I moved alone and remain alone. Not to mention the pandemic destroyed my mental health.

The solution here seems simple—get another job. But I’ve been applying for almost a year and nothing. 1 interview that went nowhere and that’s it. After 100 applications. I’m more or less not good at anything but design. 

So I have to remain at my job. But I’m so burnt out I feel like a zombie many days. Losing the will the even get up for work."

11,2022-11-19,New manager is constantly micromanaging me and I think he can also possibly be racist ..? Rant,u/aquarius01gurl,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yzlhby/new_manager_is_constantly_micromanaging_me_and_i/,jobs,"First let me start off my saying, I have been working for this job for not very long. I have been there for about 6 months now. I started back in May to be exact. Well anyway, when I first started, we have 2 managers that manage my work department because we have 2 teams and each manager has different people on their teams. One was a female manager, Sandra, then there’s my actual manager Carlos. I won’t use any of their real names for privacy purposes but the female manager, we will call her Sandra, well Sandra decided to move on to be a manager for a different department so hence that happening, our lead named Phil took over Sandra’s position.

Well, when Phil took over Sandra’s role as manager, is when the harassment, racial and ignorant comments and micromanaging started happening. The first time I interacted with Phil, he told me to come into his office to speak to me about something. I was quite confused by this because Phil is technically not my manager and I literally never get called into the office. Anyway, the reason why Phil pulled me into his office is because he wanted to confront me about something that I didn’t even do… For one, the way he addressed me was very aggressively. He kept showing me another coworker’s of mine time sheet (which he is not supposed to do at all) and he said that I can’t call In anymore for a while because I don’t have anymore PTO to call off.

I told him immediately that I am not the person that he is confusing me with. Well for retrospect, I’m 21 years old,a black female, I’m about 5’2 and I have kind of a dark complexion. The person Phil confused me for is 21 years old also, except she has a kid and we are also around the same height except she is a little bit lighter than me and skinnier than I am. Facial feature wise, me and this other chick look nothing alike as far as facial feature goes well anyways, I told Phil that I am not her and he continued to threaten to write me up for something that this other girl was doing. A few days after, I had a meeting with Phil and my 2 black coworkers he was constantly confusing me with and for a little while, phil stopped bothering me but this constant micromanagement started back up a couple of weeks ago once he got my friend fired…

I thought that would be the end of that so I went out in the hallway to do my job. 5 minutes later he called me into his office again and he started accusing me of being this other female and this time I start to get agitated because I already told him multiple times that I am not her yet he kept sayin he was going to write me up for doing no call no show and some other stuff that she was doin.  The my coworker told Phil “she is not the person you’re confusing her for!” He said “oh well I’m sorry it’s just you and her look so much alike that I thought you were the same person.” He never even asked me what my name was. He just assumed that I was her because according to his eyes, we look alike ?

Not only has he mixed me up for her, he’s mixed all of the black girls in our department up all the time before he took the time to learn our names and NONE of us look alike at all. There was 5 of us but 2 of them he fired &amp; one of them that he fired was actually a great worker, a sweet person and he fired both of those girls after they reported his behavior to his manager. We are different body types, skin complexes and different hairstyles as well.

Another incident was a few days ago, I was sitting at my computer with my lead and she was explaining to me how to enroll in health insurance, the different types I can chose from because I have never had my own health insurance before and Phil comes over to my desk in an aggressive way and asked “what is 
It that the both of you are doing?” I explained to him that the lead is helping me enroll for my health insurance and he said “well is there anyway that I can help you?” I tell him “no I’m almost done.” So then he proceeds to say “well y’all need to go out in the hallway and do your work.” 

And as he’s saying this, there’s other people around us having full blown conversations, doing unnecessary stuff like talking very loudly across the room to other people and while everyone else is doing work on their computers, he’s telling me and my lead we should go do something else when I’m clearly trying to enroll for health insurance. I don’t understand what I was doing wrong by doing that. I don’t like to throw the race card around but from what I can understand he’s constantly targeting me, and other young black females around me or getting us mixed up. He didn’t address the 3 females behind me about what they were on their computers doing.

Sorry this is really long but it’s also a also a lot of favoritism as well. There these group of 3 girls who always take long breaks and nobody say or does anything about it but if I or my friend take a break, Phil comes to wherever we are at to bother us about duties when we come back from break. These other girls also always come into work late and a lot of other stuff Phil does and say that I find annoying/unnecessary. He’s only been a manager for 2 months and he’s fired 2 people back to back for the same shit that other people are also doing and I really like my job but this constant micromanaging behaving and showing favoritism is making me consider if maybe I should move on to something else.. I’ve only been here for 6 months and I don’t want to give up so easily.."

I'm currently in the middle of interviewing with two companies right now. Let's call them Company A and Company B. 

So with Company A, I have my last interview with them in a few days, so I could receive an offer from them soon. For Company B, my last interview with them was a week ago and I am going to send a follow-up soon. With this company, I have two more interviews that need to be scheduled before they can give me an offer. 

I really like both of these opportunities and can't decide between the two, so I want to receive both offers from the companies around the same time. 

In my follow-up email with Company B, should I notify them of my progress with Company A and ask if they can speed up the interviewing process? How can I respectfully ask them to consider scheduling the remaining two interviews in the next week? Would this make me sound too pushy?

I'm willing to go down there after I got an offer but I think spending a whole day on this for a chance of getting a job is a bit crazy. They haven't mentioned covering expenses or anything either.

The coworker I work most closely with has been incredibly unprofessional from day one. Literally, the first day I worked with them they claimed the male coworkers would sexually harrass me (this did not happen), that certain coworkers had mental issues, that they had a crush on our boss, that their marriage was failing, etc.  

They've proved themselves to be a horrible person, and beyond that, incredibly difficult to work with. I've witnessed them arguing with coworkers in front of customers, slapping a coworkers hand.  They think of themselves as a manager even though they are not and act like they have authority over everyone except for our manager, including myself.  They act as if they're incapable of making a mistake, and act like anyone else who has made a mistake is a personal affront to them.  They've told me I don't need to do something and then sent an email to my boss saying that I'm not doing that thing. Other coworkers have similar issues with them.

I've had enough.  I'm looking for other jobs, but I reached my breaking point and spontaneously told my manager I need to file a complaint about them because they're making my job intolerable.  All the managers have told me directly that they think I'm doing a fantastic job and they consider me the go to person for the position I hold - in specific the regional manager has expressed to me multiple times how much they want to keep me, so I do think I'm going into this with them at least not jumping at the chance to fire me.

 My question - how much do I say?  I've been reluctant to say anything so far because a lot of things I don't have cold hard proof of.  I just can't stand that this person has problems with every single person and yet everybody seems too scared to say anything.  I've done some documenting but honestly there's so much to document that I've not kept on top of it completely.  Am I just opening myself up to trouble if I speak about the things they said without solid proof?"

The last two years I stepped away from marketing for a change of pace/mental health break and went full time serving and bartending.

I’m not sure if I’m interested in coming back into the marketing field but, I’d like to jump back a bit into a 9-5 office type work situation again and I’m not sure the best way to present a resume/explain the hiatus from the office world.

I’ve always kept separate resumes for each respective field but, I think it would look bad to have a “last worked” job from 2 years prior and I don’t want to get thrown in a rejection bin when they see bartender as the most recent.

Any advice for the resume/what to say during the interviews when they inevitably bring up the weird work history?"

Hi All

I’m in a bit of a situation where I could do with some input from your good selves.

I basically have got a new job where a former colleague is also now working. We started near enough at the same time in the same entry level position, we have the same experience as we were in the same position in our previous jobs. We basically are in role that is both new to us. Now (not me, but my colleague) stared blabbering they are earning such and such – which turns out that they significantly earn more than me. I can’t help but feel rather short changed, but nevertheless I’m happy in the job.

The big issue is, and which has begun to bother me to no end, that this colleague is always asking me for help. It’s not that I don’t want to help with work, but it is stuff that we should have known before we started the role. Stuff like how to do things such as simple Word formatting, how to read emails, work in Excel. Also, the colleague is always asking how I would do things, or if I have any ideas on such and such, or how I would answer a question or whether what the colleague is written is correct. Initially I did help, but I found that the colleague was passing all this off as their own to other people and basically getting appraisals on how good the colleague is.

It's really beginning to bug me. I’m not sure what I should do in this scenario as I have a natural inkling to help, but I find all this frustrating. Any thoughts appreciated."

I am still the youngest person at my office in my current state government job where I work as an Investigator 2 for my state Department of Labor (DOL). I used to work for the Division of Wage and Hour (WHD) as a field representative before I had accepted my new current job position. Back in WHD, I was the youngest person at 25 for about two years in my specific section before younger people started getting hired about two years later. Now, at 28, I am yet again the youngest worker in the HR Division within the office of Diversity and Compliance (this office has a small team, which is nice because it is easier to get closer to my colleagues). 

It is not that I have an issue with being the youngest one in my current office, but rather that I am worry that I may be overlooked for a promotion due to age, as well as because of only having a few years of work experience in the department. My team is great, and everyone is pretty nice. However, I just think that I may not be chosen for a supervisory position due to my age and lack of decades of work experience (even when a supervisory position only requires three years of relevant work, which I do have as an Investigator). I am actually the one who has been the longest at my state DOL than the rest of my team (one of them was at my previous Division for over two years, while the rest are from other state agencies/departments, and have been there for a year or less). 

How have some of you being treated in comparison to your older colleagues? Do you get overlooked for promotional opportunities due to your age and/or not ""enough"" work experience? Are you or were you also the youngest at your current office/job/department? I have a B.S. degree, started my MPA (master of public administration) degree, and obtained a few certificates related to investigative work too. If anyone does not mind sharing their experience, I would greatly appreciate your help, tips, and any suggestions to make myself more unique among my colleagues (especially if you work for a local, state, or federal government agency/department since I am planning to retire as a public servant)."

I’ve always been very introverted and unfortunately we all have to work and I’ve found a corporate job but I’m not sure if it’s good in the long run in terms of the anxiety it gives me because this type of job involves a lot of meetings, seeing people and that sort of stuff. But since I don’t like being in the spotlight and putting myself out there I get quite a bit of anxiety. 

In the long run I’m not sure if it’s good for my long term health if I’m always feeling stressed and anxious. 

Is anyone else similar and or have any advice?"

I’m in the process of getting a new job, and due to how I’m classified HR at this new job needs to ask to transfer me. I was asked by the new job’s HR person for me to send them my HR contact. Which I don’t really know as I’ve had minimal HR contact at my current position. The person who sent me onboarding info is no longer at my company. I guess I don’t feel like this should be on my list of things to do, and that they should be more than capable to find HR contact info for my current workplace (since they’re both involved in the state system). Also didn’t help that I sent the list of HR coordinators at my current job and this HR person replied in a bit of a snarky way about how they can’t send the request to all of them (I sent it figuring she would pick one but maybe I didn’t make that clear).

Basically is this a normal thing and I’m overreacting or should an HR person be able to contact my HR department on their own?"

I would like to apply for non-management (in scope) positions and remain with the organization. As it is unionized, I must bid on positions and see if I have enough seniority to get the position. This will alert all other management that I am trying to leave my current position.

Any suggestions and thoughts on how to handle this? There is a high probability that I will be fired if they are not in support of this plan. The job market for me is not great but I want out of my current position. I have been miserable for 1.5 years in this job."

I continue to volunteer at my remote social media marketing internship for a nonprofit foundation. I have more than enough samples, good resume, good cover letter, and have religiously been applying to jobs ever since. 6 months, literally WELL OVER 100 applications (I keep a list of all of my applications), and I apply throughout the week. I've been looking at any PR entry level, social media/social media marketing entry level: literally anything I qualify for. With all of that in mind, I applied to 150+, I've had 2 interviews. I have a 3rd on Tuesday of this week.

Keep in mind, I don't want to do remote - I have had plenty of remote working during the end of college and with my internship. It is destroying my mental health. I want to get out and meet new people, learn new skills. I want something hybrid, which is what I generally apply to, or entirely in-person jobs.So, Tuesday I have an interview for a part-time, remote Marketing Assistant position with a tech provider company. It seems like they do wiring for big companies, fiber optics, stuff like that. Not the most interesting to me, but I have stopped being picky a long time ago. This job includes social media marketing, and it says so in the job listing, BUT I can't find any social media pages online! I looked through their website, on social media platforms themselves, and I just can't find it. Also, their Glassdoor reviews are not so great, but I don't want that to scare me off.

**TLDR; I have an interview for a remote position (marketing assistant/social media marketing) and I am trying to prepare some notes beforehand, but can't find any social media accounts for them. is that weird?** also, not sure if it's telling that I applied on Indeed &amp; emailed them my resume as they requested on the Indeed listing, but the person who responded titled the email ""Marketing assistant position"", doesn't someone generally title an email in all caps? but it could be me overthinking it

edit: also I know that marketing is not ONLY social media, but just made me feel weird because they specified social media numerous times in the listing"

It is my first ""real job"". The work environment is not the best, we have no lunch breaks or any breaks for that matter, we cannot sit down even when there are no clients and we can't be on our phone for more than two minutes at a time, even if the store is empty and all tasks have been done. I want to give my two weeks notice but I'm scared to talk to my bosses, plus they're no here often or only for an hour or two. On top of that I live a 30 minutes walk away and it's getting really cold where I am, the long walk home at night scares me for more than one reason (me being young F). Could some of you show me example of how and what you said to your boss when you gave them your two weeks notice?"

I simply seek to move onto higher level positions and that is something that my small company is unable to offer. I have noticed that I am rooted into many important tasks in my current position, so I know that moving on is going to hurt my team and make my Project Manager's blood boil. I have tried asking for references from a couple coworkers that I felt comfortable with but they have expressed strong loyalty to the team and by extension distaste to my leaving. I am in the middle of interviewing with the new employer and they are wanting to call my current employers before I sign the offer but I feel like my current employers will try to do their best to prevent me from moving on. If you were in a similar situation, how did you manage to get off on the right foot with your current employers? Who do you even use as references? It seems like my desire to move on is against everyone's interests."

I'm just not sure who to trust with my personal information &amp; resume. How do others get help?

Backround:
I've been searching for a career that focuses on food waste prevention/diversion, specifically logistics &amp; data analysis. I've completed a Bachelor's degree in both Economics and Environmental Studies &amp; Sustainability at Northern Michigan University, where I gained a good deal of experience in both environmental education(interactive informational campaigns, sustainable practices) and hands on food diversion (waste audits, donations). I served as president for a student organization called ""Food Recovery Network"" while at NMU,  and designed+launched campaigns to fight food waste at our campus dining halls. Each year, I took courses that would help me prepare myself for a career in waste diversion, such as env. economics, env. campaigns, food systems, etc. 

It becomes increasingly difficult to write or promote myself after these past few years searching, so I'm trying to eat my pride and reach out."

                        NOVEMBER 1ST -

I went in for my first interview with Manager A (General manager) and another lady employee. It went well, I was shown around to everyone and it felt good. I later got a call and an email which I missed. 

I called back after an hour, then again after a couple of hours, manager A answered and said ""I'm just out of the office and it's raining, let me call you right back"". 

Never received a call. 

                              NOVEMBER 16th -

I received another call from the same organisation,  but this time it was Manager B (who is lower on the totem pole). 

Came in, Interview went well, and he said he's happy to start next Monday the 21st. 

                             NOVEMBER 21ST -


 Today I came in, manager B showed me around and introduced me to everyone (again, it was very awkward). I saw the lady employee that was with Manager A, she  gave me a really rude look and started muttering things under her breath which made a girl next to her gasp. 

I was then sent into a room to fill in paper work. 

Within the first half hour as I was filling the forms, the Manager B came in saying ""you had already done an interview and didn't call back. I replied"" I had called twice and emailed, but the general manager never called back. 

Manager B kept going in and out of the room I was in and out to the office. He was quite stressed and kept telling me to send over proof. 

Anyways, I plaimly said maybe I'll start another day after this is all done. In my head I said ""no way am I going back, this is the biggest red flag"" 


Now I've had a few missed calls and messages saying ""sorry for the confusion but it's all ready to go now for tomorrow"" 


I haven't found any work for the past 2 months, I'm 23, graduated with a Management degree and this is a claims /communications role for a solicitors office. 

I originally asked whether to contact them and start, or was this a red flag this was not a well managed firm."

10,2022-11-21,First day at job.,u/Sudden_Math_6953,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z15trt/first_day_at_job/,jobs,"It’s been 4 months since I graduated and I haven’t found a job which has gotten me extremely worried. I recently got a job offer that has a good pay (which I wasn’t getting since 4 months). Today was my first day and it was horrible. I don’t know what to do.

The first day itself they were very chaotic. I had asked them for the office address on Sunday afternoon because I had to start work from the next day. The offer letter was signed by Saturday (hence I had asked them the address on a Sunday). I received the address from my boss at midnight and he suddenly told me the office is under renovation so he would inform me when to come. 

The next morning I waited for him to text me for a while. He told me later to come to a cafe at 2:30 pm. This already sounded weird and shady to me. 2 hours before meeting at the cafe I get a text that he wants me to urgently work on something since one of their employees is sick. I say ok and tell him if I could discuss the work in the cafe since I anyways had to soon leave. He told me not to come because this was urgent and asked me to work from home. So to proceed working, I asked him for the software subscription he had promised before joining the company. This created some internal chaos. Later he told me his company doesn’t have any subscriptions but could help me with the cracks since that was cheap. I wanted to get done with this and so I somehow managed to download the cracks. 

While I’m setting up my system with all the softwares, he bombards me with work and unexpected unrealistic timelines along with another lady who works in the company who also bombards me with some other set of work. I have no idea what’s happening at this point. They send me a few documents and ask me to read up about the brand before a meeting. I read and join the meeting. At this point they are discussing about something that I have no idea about and suddenly ask me my input. I tell them something stupid and they agree(?). Then they ask me by when would I be able to give this said work. I tell them 2 days since today wass my first day (and it was almost over) and I’m still trying to sort of understand wtf is happening. They tell me no and ask me to submit it by tomorrow. 

Anyways, by then I come to know no one has any regard to the work timing as well. I was tagged on a message two hours post working time which I haven’t read or responded to. I wasn’t even properly introduced to the team and was added to the groups at the end ish of the day which was super weird for my first day. 

I felt so overwhelmed on the first day and had this urge of crying. I have never wanted to leave so immediately. A part of me feels like I won’t be able to do the job and that I’m under-qualified another part of me finds this place extremely toxic and another part of me feels like this is how work places are and I should just stick to it. It’s just been a day I don’t know what to do. I’m also worried I’ll never find a job and my cv is going to be empty if I leave this. 

Should I leave or should I stay? Some friends say stay for the money because it’s good while the others say it sounds like too much and if I don’t like it I should leave. My parents have told me to try it for a week, I’m anyways in probation. I am able to work while being overwhelmed at home. I’m scared I won’t be able to even do half of that when I start going to the office day after tomorrow after the renovation is done. Am I overreacting?"

Ridiculous hours or working expectations. I enjoy building things with my hands but in the trades I found 7am-10pm days were a dime a dozen and in software engineering I found a promise of work life balance and all sorts of benefits like unlimited pto and then found out I would be expected to pull whatever hours necessary to finish 3 week projects in under 5 days. Whatever hours are fine with me as long as it caps at 45ish under normal conditions (exceptions for holidays or covering for sick coworkers etc.) I actually enjoy night shift a lot of the time because of my weird circadian rhythm so any hours of the day is fine but I wont work 12,13,14 hours in a day without a very good cause.

The second issue I always run into is safety hazards and just generally gross work environment. I have worked in 130 degree attics and 7 degree rainy days and I have crawled through spider infested crawlspaces enough times. I understand that generally the jobs that pay the best are ones nobody else is willing to subject themselves to and the ones with a high barrier of entry usually skilled jobs with a big learning curve which is why I made good money doing those dirty jobs and made good money doing coding but I want something comfortable this time without all the above problems I found with coding.

I don't need to do something that changes the world or has a huge impact. I just want something that will pay the bills (20+/hour) and will give me time for my family and my hobbies. I want something where 5 o'clock rolls around and the day is over and I don't have to risk death every single day. Thanks for any suggestions or places I can look for ideas.

0,2022-11-21,Restrictive covenants,u/Jonataness,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z16n3f/restrictive_covenants/,jobs,"I am working for an office space rental agency. They rent office spaces out to different. companies. 

A company on site is offering me a better job but my contract has a restrictive covenant as follows:

“You shall not without the written permission of the Company, whether during or after the termination of your employment (however it shall be determined), for a period of 18 months work for or on behalf of, or make contact with our clients or competitors or suppliers for the financial benefit of your self or a Competitor company. During this time period you also cannot contact any
employee or former colleague with a view to persuading them to work for a Competitor company.”

The company on site is working in sales, nothing to do with renting out office spaces. 

Did some research online (Citizens advice, gov.uk) and found the following: 

“In order to enforce a restrictive covenant, an employer must demonstrate that the clause protects one of its legitimate business interests. Secondly, the employer must show that the clause is reasonable, and it only goes so far as is necessary protect a legitimate business interest of the employer.”

“Look at whether the restriction is reasonable

No matter what's in your contract, your old employer can't stop you taking a new job unless it could lose them money. For example if you might:
• take customers to your new employer when you
leave
• start a competing business in the same local area
If a restriction would stop you getting a job that
didn't affect your old employer, it might not be
reasonable. A restriction might also be unreasonable if:
lasts more than 6 months - unless longer is
normal for your job title or industry
• applies in places where your old employer doesn't do business - such as if it mentions a whole region but all their customers are from 1 town applies to jobs that don't compete with your old employer - for example if it says you can't take
any sales job, even selling different products
• means you wouldn't be able to find a job at all”

Do I have any chance of being able to get that job without going to court? Tried approaching my employer and didn’t manage to convinve him to put it in writing. He didn’t say no either so might need more convincing. 

Any advice would be appreciated. Sorry for the long post."

I recently applied to two positions with a software provider. Both positions are related to client onboarding and training, but one requires 80% travel, and the other is primarily virtual. I am very well-versed in this software from the client side and am qualified for both positions. 

I originally applied to the virtual position but immediately got an email from HR recommending the traveling position as I was a good fit. Since applying, there have been “life developments” that make traveling difficult in the future. Today, I got an email for a phone interview to discuss the traveling position. 

What is the best way to ask about my status for the virtual position? On the one hand, I want to go ahead and set up the phone interview, but I also don’t want to waste anyone’s time since traveling so extensively isn’t in the cards much anymore.  When applying to multiple jobs with the same company, do they pick one position for you, and if it doesn’t work out, then none of the positions will work?

I've been researching companies with inspiring missions. Found several of them already, but it's so hard to find!

Or simply creating something convenient, like intelligent house systems or self-driving cars.

I recently left my retail job of five years to completely switch job industries and now this new job isn't exactly working out to my liking. At my old job, I could have become an assistant manager and basically was at times. Still, district management failed to see my promotion three times under three different management leaders who all spoke very highly of me.

At my new job the money fluctuates, the people I work with are less professional and childish considering where I came from, and the training is barebones to the point where I consult YouTube (if you're curious I became a Lube Technician bc I wanted to be an apprentice Tech but that's not happening anymore).  However, I'm still able to pay my bills and can afford to do most things as before but I'm looking again for something better and more stable and professional.

Ideally, I'd like a job that allows me to work on schoolwork (or at least the slightest option), has guaranteed 40 hours a week, decent benefits (vision, dental, medical), and has a good vacation allowance/policy.

If you know of any jobs or companies that I should look into, please let me know."

There was a snag with the HireRight background check and they were unable to verify my education. So I ordered my high school transcripts myself online and they can't be located.  I contacted the school district myself and sent a copy of my diploma and they still can't find me in the system. They sent me to the state charter school board. They're telling me there's a very small chance they have my records because they only have records for charter schools that have closed and mine is still open. He's going to search anyway and offered to write me a notarized letter of graduation confirmation and explaining the records are lost but the hiring manager told me the company won't accept this. I am so frustrated and upset about losing this opportunity because of something completely out of my control. Anyone go through something similar?

I worked my way up in a restaurant to supervisor, 7 years (2-3 of those were lead/supervisory).

I worked for my father for 2 years while I finished my BA in Psychology (bookkeeping, helping wind down his small construction company for retirement, 'customer support' if he couldn't be reached. I'd worked for him all my life.)

I worked my way up in a mental health treatment center to supervisor (program coordinator) again (counselor -&gt; supervisor). I'm at around 2 years of this, 3 total. I have knowledge of insurance on this side of things, mental health, compliance, training and managing a team of counselors, admissions and discharges, staffing of patients, coordinating projects, keeping upper management in the loop.

I like people, and the people I've worked with like me. I work hard, I help my team members grow, I feel comfortable bringing up concerns and solutions, I have a steady personality. I do well under pressure. I do decently with Excel. I know Sharepoint, Google suite, Microsoft Teams. I don't have proven experience in research, but I know how to compile papers and journals and find pertinent and valid info from school and being a consumer for work.  I *love learning*. I seriously enjoy figuring stuff out.

I'm going back to work after maternity leave in January and they're restructuring the role I am being promoted into (program director) as working less with people and working in a support to the clinical director role. I don't really think there's enough work there and the role I'm in now is going to change to only managing the team and being on call if someone calls out.

I don't know if it's the sleep deprivation or what, but I have no fucking idea what I'm looking for. I've been researching for a month and cannot figure out what my next title is, what industries are compatible, what kind of company would want to hire me. I've talked myself into applying for 40k jobs because I feel like I don't have transferable experience. Can you give me suggestions? I can't do on call work with my baby/family setup. I would like to work remote as we're moving next year and that will make the relocation easier, I worked in a hybrid capacity and it's fine. The next job after this leap I get I'd like to go into the office, though. "

Saturday 8 hours a day  
Sunday 8 hours a day  
Monday 8 hours a day  
Tuesday through Friday 4 hours a day

This schedule would be until Mar 1st. 

They'd get their 40 hours; it just would be how I would need it in order to take the job. 

Would any potential employers accept this?

I'm looking for writing roles, things like technical writing, copywriting, creative writing, marketing, etc. Most of the roles I'm contacted for are contract roles, though I'd be willing to do temp work to be ended after the classes end, provided it's remote.  

Conversely, I could start part time M - F, and after my continuing education classes turn the position into a full-time role."

It was one of those filters alongside  ""salary estimate"" and ""job type"". This filter made it much easier for me to find potential jobs for me to apply to. For example, if I wanted to apply for Technical Writing jobs, I would type in ""entry level technical writing"" in the search bar and it would barely produce any results. On the other hand, if I just typed ""technical writing"" and then clicked on the ""entry level"" filter, I would be greeted with a much larger range of jobs. I think that typing ""entry level"" in the filter somehow messes up the system and does not include jobs that actually should be entry level.      

Now that its gone, I feel like I am at square one. Now, if I just search for a job title, I will get a bunch of jobs that I am not qualified for, but if I add ""entry level"" in the search bar, the number of jobs I get reduces dramatically, even though I have a feeling that it shouldn't be that low.     

Did something happen? Am I going crazy? What should I do to make this easier?"

One thing I’ve noticed and have begun to question regarding this is how much I’ve loathed the jobs I’ve been in.

For context, I’ve been in 3-4 previous jobs, three of which were in retail and one in construction. For some reason I’ve found every single one of them to be monotonous, unfulfilling and rather dreadful to be in. The workplace themselves weren’t bad I guess outside of the usual concerns with customers or micromanaging managers but going in to each job has been akin to pulling teeth for me.

I’ve honestly started to wonder if something’s wrong with me mentally. I see my parents and peers somehow able to either enjoy or at least tolerate their work but I can’t help but hate it for some reason. I’ve asked them about this and from what I’ve gathered, they barely think about their work in hindsight or the work they’re engaged in. As if they’re able to just switch their brain off and work.

Even when we factor money into the equation I don’t feel fulfilled. If anything the idea that I’m signing hours of my life away that I’ll never get back just for a paycheck that’s actively decreasing in value is quite depressing and I’m wondering why I shouldn’t just starve.

I’m in university rn and have clinical depression which may influence this thought process but I just wanna know how or where I can find a job that I’m not gonna actively despise.

What do I do?"

i was hoping someone could help me in what a yearly review is truly about and how i can help myself be an asset that is worth keeping around in a business that is constantly changing and not always for the better (i work in marketing for a mortgage loan company where we just let go 2 of the 5 people within our role so pockets are thin and we have already been told we cannot get a raise)

also, even though a raise is out of the question; is it inappropriate to ask my coworkers how much they make to see whether i am being underpaid or correctly paid for our role?

TIA"

A friend forwarded my resume to HR at their workplace (Company A) and at this point I have done a screening, test, and first interview and all has gone well. I am scheduled to do a second interview next week and if that goes well I believe I will receive an offer. They are looking to get someone started before the end of the year so with putting two weeks notice into my current position, let's assume the start date is December 16, 2022.

A position opened up at Company B and it would be my dream job. The job posting closes December 5, 2022. I know a few people working there that are going to put in a good word, so say hypothetically I passed all the tests and interviews and was offered a job started January 16, 2023 (because Company B is known to move slow in the hiring process).

What would you do regarding your friend's well-being? I wouldn't want them to look bad for recommending me then me quitting one month later for something better. But if I didn't get the Company B job I would be happy to work for Company A. If my friend wasn't involved I would have no problem jumping ship from Company A to Company B but I don't want them to look bad. I talked to them about this possibility and they said they wouldn't really care, but others have said they would be pissed if they were the friend. Curious to see opinions!"

1,2022-11-21,less than half,u/darneech,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z1j6ez/less_than_half/,jobs,"So I left teaching because i was  throwing up and having Panic attacks every day. I couldn't anymore. My school and some of the district expectations went completely haywire and we were starting from scratch with some programs and then they were throwing away anything from previous years for other programs and so we couldn't even use anything we already had created. The staff and admin at my school were mostly new and things went downhill and i couldn't even apply at a new school. 

I bailed and found a job at a non profit. It was all i could handle at the time. I had applied for other positions, but didn't get any, which at the time was fine. It's actually a contract position that is hourly, which I've heard is rare in this type of work. I'm missing the benefits and am making less than half than i had been making as a teacher. seems like there are zero days off. I've counted 5 holidays we get off in a whole year. I'm satisfied and am growing immensely. My skills are being utilized and I'm excited to be learning more and have found out a ton a out myself and that i have a LOT to offer, but the reality is i need something MUCH more sustainable and hopefully get a job with a 401k plan again. Sadly, after the new year, i am going to be on the search. I had wanted to make it a year, but i have nothing other than sometimes being able to work from home, and it's in a field that i love, and i guess the honeymoon phase is over.

Whenever i start applying, those questions come up... 
1. Reason for leaving....
2. References
3. May we contact this employer 

What do i put?

1. I need more stability and benefits and my current pay is an insult to my skills and experience? I need to find something sustainable. ... Or do i make it about applying my newly acquired skills and that's it? I guess this is where i highlight what i can offer them, right?
2. Do i even tell my job that I'm looking? I hate this part. Do i ask the boss to be a reference? Or the one or two friends i made? It's a verrrrrry small organization. I don't think they'll ever be petty and retaliate, they're all about image, but i hate this part about any job and sometimes wonder if I'm asking the wrong people to be my references... 
3. Of course they can contact them.... But why? Lol 

Any feedback or suggestions are much appreciated. I havent started looking intensively, but i notice some opportunities and think ""hmmm. . .  I could do that, and there are actual perks..."" And haven't been applying yet because i want to be loyal at least for now."

Not until two weeks ago they contacted me again saying they're doing a second round of hiring.we set up a time again, but actually get a call and interview me this time. It seemed like an average interview, the only experience needed was customer service which I have so they kind of hired me on the spot. He went over the duties of the job a couple times then said he'll send over two packets with material to help with training, setting up the dispatching program and tools. He said I basically can start when I receive it, which would arrive in 12 days. He never gave me a way I can track the package, and doesn't pick up when I call, which he said to once I receive it. He only confirmed an address with me, never asked for other info or money. I haven't received anything yet, and it's been 12 days. Imo it seemed a bit too good to be true, and him not answering is kind of a red flag. Im starting to have a feeling the packet might be some malware or I don't know. Anyone that has input on this?

It’s a small solo owned company and they give me my 5% bumps a year but it’s been very slow growth from starting much lower at 55k with some large increases here and there after I’ve saved their butts and my peers have quit. They obviously want to retain me but not too expensively. I basically get to do whatever I want, hit what needs to be done, and noting more.

I’m moving into a different direction within the company hopefully managing some things but I really can’t see anyone else meeting my level of interest in making it a better place. Additionally my more badass coworker has had issues getting the money he wants when the place basically runs because of him. “You don’t have a family to support, no need for that much money that you’re requesting” is something I’ve heard. Overall it’s a somewhat toxic leadership environment where employees aren’t valued as people who support them as much as they should be. But I literally do no work sometimes. Not a ton of mentorship or or growth opportunities in general.

Now comes along this potion I’m hopefully going to see how it moves forward that should be able to do at least 85k - 5k in bonus (I’ve heard maybe 10% in general)- 1k per year in fun money- and probably more than a 1% match. Potential for 100k if they are true to their range max. With my seniority I have a reason for it.

My issue I’ll probably have to work again. But some friends said they don’t use and abuse you if at all. Interview so far mentioned it being a lower level position (probably after seeing my experience) than what they’d expect me to apply for. So it’d be somewhat of a lateral move in title but a decent upgrade in pay.

I think they obvious choice is to not be lazy, go somewhere where I can get over 100k after a few years almost seemingly easily, and start working again. Opportunities for growth seems to outweigh the bridge id most likely completely burn at my current role (the owner is a horrible human and doesn’t really care about people… even pregnant women being one herself).

I’ve heard people say the worst thing you could do is work somewhere toxic; and I’m at one. But I truly get to do whatever I want… anyway just looking for options or people to say I’m dumb one way or another."

So I didnt proceed with a job application back in march due to personal reasons (interviewed, dept was keen to offer but salary package was not yet discussed when i decided to drop the application) and now circumstances changed so I emailed the same HR person about the position again like 2 weeks ago and tomorrow I'm having an interview with them. 

So my question is, what kind of questions/situations should I expect from the interviewers/during the interview? Other than questions like ""why did u choose us (again)"", ""why do u think we should hire u"". What else? Or is the interview gonna be similar to the one in march? This is my first time going through such thing so I have no idea what to expect during the interview. TIA!  


p.s the interviewer may or may not be the same one that I met previously as the dept is quite big and if it helps, its from the healthcare sector."

I’m inclined to stop and say ‘forget it’ and act my Supervisors pay grade but then do I harm my promotion chances?

I’m in line for my boss’ Departmental Manager role in 2-3 years and as he’s due to retire I suspect he’s given up and is just doing the minimum. I can see sooo many improvement projects and general day to day tasks daily that can be done to boost the company, so I’m doing them. My logic being if I act like a manager I line myself up perfectly to be chosen to be that manager. I’m not stepping on any toes per se I’m just ‘being the change I want to see’. It’s annoying certain people on my current ‘level’ which is causing friction and an unpleasant work environment - on one hand I’m thinking “just do your job and nothing more” where on the other I’m so passionate and it’s in my nature to constantly be growing and improving things. 

Any advice? I’ll finish by saying it’s an ok company with good pay so moving isn’t really a consideration at the moment."

Most junior person on the team and the company created a vague role for me. This is my first corporate job - before this I was working in pubs whilst I got my degree. I started with another girl (Betty) who was a step above me in the hierarchy but we did a lot of the same work. We were the first junior hires the company made. Up until a couple of months ago my boss would catch up with me very frequently and we would have long chats about personal and work stuff. Last time I spoke to him he said some vague stuff about me progressing but at my own pace.

A couple of months ago my company hired two other people in the same position as Betty. Since the new juniors started Betty has been asked to step up and manage the junior members of staff. Since this happened my responsibilities have decreased a lot, I'm left out of all the client meetings and my boss no longer catches up with me. Betty is constantly informing me of her catch ups with our boss and likes to confirm that I haven't spoken to him properly in a couple of months. Before the new hires I was writing sometimes 2 important documents a week, and I've now been relegated to sorting out company Christmas gifts.

I'm miserable at work now and feel completely left out and like I'm not going anywhere. I'm aware people might say I should just contact my boss for a chat myself, but that is not the usual protocol. I'm wondering what has changed so much in the last couple of months that my boss no longer thinks I'm worth catching up with.

TL;DR after two new hires above me my boss no longer catches up with me"

&amp;#x200B;

I asked my boss on august-septemeber if he could put me to a test and see if I was able to fit the shoes of the next ""position"" , he agreed to do so and Ive been put to a test ever since , the issue is I am barely getting any new customers or kinda , I just broke my sales record yesterday and I got payed ""decently"" so I think I am doing good in that regard , but the amount of work I placed to achieved said results havent been  that hard and it makes me feel guilty, the issue is that I feel that I've been procrastinating a lot and tbh I only work 4 hours out of the 8 that I am here at the office.

&amp;#x200B;

But now that holidays are basically next door and its about to be thanks giving and I feel like doing nothing , not only that but I struggle even more to get new customers, most of the customers I've encountered are either referrals from existing customers or ""friends"" that are in the field with different products but same target audience.

&amp;#x200B;

I think my question here is , how do you guys cope with this sort of feelings and to sales reps out there , how many hours a week do you actually work during holiday seasons?"

I feel like he’s going to view it as not being a team player, but it’s my work and not my new studio’s. I am concerned about attribution issues in future if I let him present under this studio’s name. Which makes me a bit uneasy because I’d be worried about them claiming credit for my work I did in the past. It would be different I think if they wanted to show my work under my own name saying I’m working with them now.
Is it ok for me to say I’m not comfortable with that?"
384,2022-11-22,Alert company ASAP of resignation immediately or wait until after Thanksgiving Holiday?,u/moodybrooder,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z20hrn/alert_company_asap_of_resignation_immediately_or/,jobs,"Hello!

I'm feeling pretty bad about leaving my current job in a serious lurch by leaving. We are a team of four (part of a larger organization), one of our team quit Nov 1, and the person they had lined up to fill the spot declined after weeks of interviewing, so we've been working one down since with no end in sight. 

I've received another formal offer that I just absolutely can't turn down - it's about 30k more a year, 1.5 hours taken off my daily commute, etc., so I'm leaving as well. Due to the holidays I am able to give them about 7 weeks notice.

I know that they will want to know ASAP - just wondering if it would be more above board/professional to do it before the Thanksgiving Holiday (we have Friday off as well) - or wait til Monday.

Any and all advice is appreciated!"

My (31F) partner (37M, USA) is disabled (severe skin and eye issues), and is currently stuck in a job that has great healthcare benefits but an absolutely terrible work environment. He has been there for seven years but doesn't really have any opportunities for advancement due to the fact that he hasn't completed a degree, and they don't offer any work from home opportunities for his current position. 

He works in family court as a parenting time and child support enforcement officer, and while he loves getting to help people, he can sense that he is being singled out and ""quiet fired"" because his employer doesn't want to deal with his disability. At this point, he's less concerned with the amount of money he can make in a new job, and more concerned with being able to survive and get his medications covered (one of which is a monthly injection that costs over $80,000 per year). 

So, it may be a longshot, but do you know of any disability-friendly employers who offer (preferably) WFH opportunities to people with a solid work history but no bachelor's degree? Or employers who offer really great health insurance? It's a longshot, but we're trying to be prepared for the possibility of him not being able to afford his medication if he ends up getting pushed out of this job. Thanks for any leads or advice!"

I left my previous job in May because I found there was a lack of growth. It would typically be one internal position with 30 of us applying :/. My bosses were extremely understanding and they let me know that I’d always be able to come back. I’ve been in communication with management pretty frequently and they always mention this. 

I started my new job in May in the hopes of it leading to a career but have found it was not what the recruiter/hiring manager made it out to be. It was promoted as an easy going role where we focus on troubleshooting for clients but over the last 2 months I’ve been noticing we’re required to do additional work that wasn’t discussed, take on additional projects, and complete requests from other departments that have nothing to do with our roles/responsibilities. I’ve been trying to stick it out as my last two roles I left after 9 months and 1 year. 

Every single day I dread signing on and feel extremely overwhelmed. When I do try to discuss this, I’m just usually told this is just how the role is and things will get a bit easier by the 2nd year of being there. Its ruined my eating to the point I won’t eat until 8pm and I find myself working through my break. I feel like I’ve completely lost any work life balance and it’s affecting my relationships. 

I also joined this company because they promoted growth within but from my research and speaking with people, everyone in my department ends up either moving to sales or a more tech backend department. The roles that interest me have been filled usually by one person for 5+ years. 

I recently decided to get a post graduate certificate in HR and would be starting in January. It’s a part time program since I currently work full time and have a part time job as well. 

I was wondering if it would make sense to quit my current role and go back to previous role as part time. It would be a significant pay cut but I would be able to pick and choose shifts as I please. The role is also more manageable with school and the responsibilities rarely change. 

The reason I was thinking of staying at my current role is the possibility of applying to their HR department after completing my program and possibly shadowing during the program to gain some experience. 

What would you do? Do you think it’s best to just stay with my current employer?"

I'm 22, graduated college with a BA in Communications in May of this year.  I got a job offer from my current company which I was extremely thrilled about the February before I graduated (or sometime around there, can't remember the exact day anymore)

Despite my major being in Communications, marketing is where my professional experiences (internships) and passion lies.  I found my passion for this field toward the end of my college journey, and knew that Communications is a broad enough degree that it helps with a lot of marketing type careers as well, so figured it wasn't worth going through the hassle of switching majors at that point.

Anyways, fast forward to now.  I've been at my current company for about 6 months and it has been the most toxic environment I have ever been a part of.  My boss sucks at communicating with me, nobody in my area makes any effort to interact with me and the times I have tried to interact with them have been completely unsuccessful.  On top of that, the only time anyone DOES communicate with me is when it's something negative or they want to call me out on something.  Additionally, I'm only actually ever busy most days at most 2 out of the 8 hours I'm required to be here a day.  This is just the start of the complaints I have about this position.  I'm not happy at all.

The problem with all this?  I've been constantly applying for positions to no avail.  Since I started actively applying at the start of my final semester of college (over a year ago now) my current position is the only job offer I have gotten.  I have probably filled out well over 200-300 applications in the past year and only gotten **ONE** job offer.  At this point, I'm struggling to even get interviews.  Whether it be an in person or remote position, that doesn't change anything.  I'm mentally drained and frustrated from the seemingly neverending grind with no light at the end of the tunnel.   It feels like I'm just going to be stuck at this incredibly toxic environment for much longer than I'd like.  It's better than nothing, but the salary isn't even the greatest ($20/hr) considering how much of a toll it's beginning to take on me mentally.  College was an absolute grind for me, containing 2 of the most miserable years of my life.  It's frustrating that this is the payoff I've gotten for the immense amount of time, money, and effort I sunk into those 4 years.

I know this is a long post, I'd greatly appreciate any direction as to what I might be doing wrong and am more than happy to clarify anything.  I wanted to make sure to explain my situation in as much detail as possible.  Thanks in advance."

Does this sound normal or weird to y’all? The website seems to have a good safety rating and doesn’t appear to be a scam, but I’ve applied to what turned out to be scam jobs before and I’m wanting to be more cautious. Any ideas?

2,2022-11-22,Should I take job offer in private sector over my current job?,u/ElectricOne55,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z27427/should_i_take_job_offer_in_private_sector_over_my/,jobs,"I currently work for a university making 55k. The role has good benefits, pension, and free schooling after 6 months, but they have a 6 month probation period where they can let me go for any reason. The way it was described though is that universities, rarely let people go, but I have had nothing to do at this job and they haven't really trained me on much which worries me. The office environment also seems cliquish and some teams are in silos that have hardly said anything to me since I've been there.

I had an offer from an oil company for an in person IT role that pays 90k. But, the oil industry worries me about layoffs in the private sector. My dad told me to focus more on government jobs amd that i should stay un my current role because they are less likely to lay people off, idk if this is true though especially with the 6 month probation period in my current role. 

I would also have to move, cancel my apartment lease, and get used to a whole new area and coworkers which may be good or bad. Since it's for an oil company there would be a lot of travelling if storms came to facilities or business meetings etc. The interviewer said since it's a terminal oil storage company they don't have any layoffs compared to big oil companies that take losses directly based on oil price. He also said 30 people interviewed for the role and they haven't hired anyone since the last person left a year ago, does that really sound believable though?

So, is it worth leaving my current role at the uni for 54k for the oil company for 90, but I will have to travel, the job will have more duties, smaller team, and some on call work/travelling? And the fact that I will have to change my lease due to only being in my current job 3 months, or should I stay more at my current role?

I'm also worried I won't have another opportunity like this. But, at the same time I don't want to take that other role, and get fired for a random reason.

I also could keep applying for other jobs as a third option. I also had a university that wants to interview me in San Francisco for 90 to 115k, but idk if that's even livable there?

The pay is the same and I'd have the same responsibilities, so it basically comes down to where I want to be for the summer.

Chicago:

Pros: No (or very cheap) rent b/c a family member (who I don't know well) would be able to host me. Also, Chicago seems like a more lively city. One of my good friends also lives in the area, but I'm not sure if they'll be in town for the summer.

Cons: Living with a family member, I'd feel somewhat limited in my freedom. I've talked to them and they seem very accommodating but at the end of the day, I'd be living in someone else's space. Also, I'd be further away from my workplace... maybe like 20-25-ish minutes by train.

&amp;#x200B;

Boston

\- Pros would be: I'd get to experience living in my own apartment, likely be closer to my workplace, and have basically unlimited freedom to do whatever I want.

\- Cons: I'd potentially be living with someone I meet online/some other intern working for the same company that I don't know. Also, I'd have to pay rent, and I haven't really lived on my own before (besides college ofc but that's a very different setting).

&amp;#x200B;

Any tips? Insights? Anyone who's interned/worked in either city? Am I crazy for even considering Boston b/c of the rent I'd have to pay?"

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you don’t mind if I ask my question here. Is it the right sub to address my question and ask for help?

&amp;#x200B;

I work in one pharmaceutical company as a sales rep. Due to my job duties, I have to travel a lot. I need to attend various conferences, meet new prospective clients, and visit other branches of our company. I have a lot of things on my plate, and my boss pays me a lot of money. They really appreciate everything I do for them.

&amp;#x200B;

My job allows me to rent a nice apartment with a lovely view. But I’m not bragging. I’ve gotten sick of my job and want to quit. I live in a nice apartment, but in reality, I spend there a couple of hours a week. I’m one of those idiots who pays rent for a place and doesn’t even live there.

&amp;#x200B;

I spend most of my time in the hotel rooms and on board the plane. The last one is particularly exhausting. I’ve just landed at the airport. The flight was awful, and I’m still waiting for my cab to arrive to drive me back home. The cab is on its way, but I must wait for a while. So, I’ve decided to kill time by writing this post here.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m so sick of those long-distance flights, you can’t even imagine. Some say that the best coffee is in the airport, but for me, it’s the only coffee I have. I tried to take some time off from work, but the more time I took off, the more I hated my job.

&amp;#x200B;

This last flight was awful. The thing is that I’ve recently bought this bag — [https://vonbaer.com/products/grand-leather-garment-bag](https://vonbaer.com/products/grand-leather-garment-bag). I really liked it and waited for a while to get it delivered. I took this bag with me on the board to avoid wasting time at the luggage collection point. And guess what? One bastard scratched this bag with the oversized luggage he took on board? I was dead tired of making a scene on the board. But I consider it a sign then I need to switch careers.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you can suggest a website where I can look for a job that pays me decent money and where I can work remotely?"

I advised I was not comfortable sharing this information as it had private company Information( I didn’t want anything or anyone to sabotage my offer). They then asked me for the company name . I again said no. They then asked for a copy of the letter but with company info redacted. 

With my new job I would be making 18k more than my last job as they pay for insurance and have profit sharing and other benefits plus it would be less work and opportunity for higher pay as I’m maxed out workload wise at my current company . I told my current company my offer was 20k more and just rounded up. If I send them my offer letter they will think I lied on the amount because my offer letter shows the base salary and doesn’t go into the math of the other benefits that would equal 18k raise. 

Also side story I had asked my current company for a 20k raise and my boss said she could not do that but would ask corporate for 10k. This was a month ago and they dragged their feet on an answer and I still have not heard back. A friend of mine had an opening at another company for the same position but less work. 

I want to again deny sending offer letter but also let them know I already accepted the position due to the better opportunities at the new company. It seems like they don’t believe I got offered so much more than I’m making now and don’t value me. I kind of want to make that point but in the most professional manner. Help Please!

Update : I emailed them the following morning a polite email stating I was officially moving forward with the new job. My supervisor  called me an hour later asking if there was anything I could do to stay and then offered her own position effective immediately  ( she’s retiring in a few months) and the salary I initially requested. Although this would look great on my resume down the line,  I declined it an hour later as this would be even more work than my current role and MUCH less of a work life balance. I would also have to go in to the office everyday instead of my hybrid schedule. I feel like that would of been a low ball offer if I would accepted it as it’s a corporate position. Plus after reading the comments I agree that you never know what they would do a few months later or if they would have some resentment towards me for attempting to leave. My new position is paying me the salary I initially requested at my current job with half the work I do now. 

Thanks everyone for the advice !"

I filed for EDD, *they recanted with a false statement* and eventually I got EDD, but I have been trying my hardest to find a new job and I luckily did find one earlier in the year and after 4 days of working there**(Job 2)**, they told me they didn't have the funds to keep me and since then, I have not had luck finding a new job until last month. (You will see why this part of the story is relevant, I have a question at the end)

I started working for a company as a receptionist**(Job 3)** in late October, everything was going well... or so I thought. I took in calls, did my daily tasks, if I made a small mistake I'd simply correct myself, apologize, take notes and do my BEST to not make a mistake twice. Ya know, who wouldn't make small mistakes as a new person on the job? Little things like opening certain mail, not taking my lunch exactly at expected time (give or take 5-10 mins late due to calls received). I believe none of the mistakes I made costed the company any money whatsoever at least. Before getting the news today, when I first started I did sign the handbook to the company and I remember them having a statement along the lines of termination under any circumstance and so fourth - when I asked a copy for the handbook I was simply ignored. A lot of the things in the handbook were pretty common things anyone gets in any handbook in regards to dress code, time in/out, etc. I followed everything to the T.  I thought everything was going well, did what I needed to do as usual as a receptionist, and today out of the blue my HR lady called me up and she told me to take a seat and let me know ""the boss"" said I was not a good fit. When I asked the reason why she said he was looking for someone with more experience and I was absolutely baffled, especially because when I applied I did list on my resume I was a project coordinator... When I asked her if I did anything wrong she reassured me that I did nothing wrong, only that ""the boss"" said he thought I was not a good fit. That is all. And now I have NO IDEA what to do. I wasn't given a valid reason as to why I was let go and it honestly hurt a lot especially firing me the week of Thanksgiving. Third job this year where I have been terminated and it's honestly exhausting. After getting the news today, I just started wondering and I am just hoping someone here can answer my question. ***Can new employers see what previous employers have recanted in an EDD claim?*** OR are the other two companies I applied for this year seriously just in need in someone else that can do the same job for a smaller pay? Or anything else? Because I honestly do not see why I would be terminated in a probation period unless I fucked something up heavily-- and if I have, was not notified/brought to my attention when getting let go of. I seriously do not know what to do or what legal action I can take if possible. What **Job 1** said in their EDD recant was absolute nonsense and I don't know if what they said could possibly affect me and my future job seeking when future employers run a background check on me but since being let go of that job I have not been able to get a stable job and I seriously don't know if it is because of that or if it is because I just have serious back luck in finding jobs. Any tips would be appreciated on how I can tackle down on what I can do in my current situation and moving on so fourth. Thank you all."

During this 20 years, I've worked a number of dead end jobs and my resume is terrible.  I'm 45 now and make $13/hr.  My mother gave me her condo and car and since I've been seizure free for going on 3 years I was able to get my driver's license back.  Now, my job cut my hours from 40 to 24hrs/week.  Either way, I can't continue this way financially.  My family has no practical advice to give me.  I'm overwhelmed and lost because I don't know what to do.  Getting back into a residency is difficult and may not happen at this point and I never enjoyed medicine anyway.  I can't afford to get a master's degree.  I don't want more loans as I'm already $200k in debt from med school.  Is there a professional service that can help me?  A huge part of the problem is me.  I don't know what I want to do and probably don't have the luxury to figure it out which is well, depressing to say the least.  Are there services I can pay for to give me career guidance and attempt to put together a decent resume?  I'm so lost I don't even know the right questions to ask for advice.  All I have to put on my resume for recent work is retail and food service.  I'm willing to learn a new trade.  I find carpentry and things like that far more interesting than the human body.  I don't care about a lot of money.  My home is paid off.  I just want a decent job with fair pay that I can feel good about at the end of the day.  Prospects for raises and professional growth would be great.  I don't want to work another dead end job for a company that could care less about me.  Any thoughts would be appreciated."

I'm intelligent but I think that that isn't recognized in certain jobs because I'm not super personable. For example I currently am basically a bus boy in a fine dining restaurant. So much of my job is super basic repetitive tasks like folding napkins, and that's the only work people wanna give me because they don't like me.

I'm writing on behalf of a friend (M30) who is job searchig (pretty unsuccesful) and we'd love to understand why he hasn't got any position so far.   
A little background about him:   
\- history and philosophy degree (with master's in history)  
\-Worked as security guard (4+ years)  
\-Currently working as secretary office + event manager (mostly historical and remembrance events) (3+ years)  
\- Currently gaining skills about event managing, marketing and communication  
\- GREAT communication skills and english knowledge   


Is there someone who works in the field, who can enlighten us about why is this a positions so difficult to obtain?  
Job recruiters always write as requirements:   
\-Experience in a similar role in order to be able to work independently;  
\-Propositive approach: proposing strategies, solutions and lead generation techniques;  
\-Excellent communication, persuasive and interpersonal skills.  
And I'm sorry but this doesn't mean anything... most of them also add a general ""marketing and economics skills"" which doesn't add much to the profile they're searching for.  
I can't disclose the country we're in, but it's european.   
We'd love to know more about the requirements on the event manager position, if someone knows more, or if there are any job recruiters in here, can you tell us some secrets or tips on how to improve our position?

I have not told my current employer that I am considering a new position and I would prefer to keep that private until I actually have a job offer.

How do I navigate this? The place that I currently work (a small non-profit) doesn’t even have an HR person that I could ask. I would likely have to ask my boss directly. Can I just provide my boss’ information like I would a reference and hope that they won’t call until I was successful in the interview? I wasn’t going to use my current boss as a reference. So that also presents an additional problem.

I’m not even sure I want this job so I don’t want to put my current one in jeopardy for something I’m not sure about. 

Any advice is appreciated.

Add to clarify: this is word for word how they ask for it in the email I got:

Please submit at least 2 days prior to interview (if we do not receive these items, we may not continue with interview)
- Confirmation of employment information (name, title, organization, phone number and email) from current employer

Context: I got my B.A. in business management this past May. I’ve been very intentional in my job search because I don’t want a job just to get paid, I want to do work that I can be proud of and feel fulfilled by. I’ve always been interested in hospitality, specifically event coordination; I have an older family member who’s been in the business for as long as I can remember and she’s amazing at what she does. Throughout high school and college, I worked off and on as a host for a local restaurant group. I recently found out that they had an opening for an events coordinator and I thought it could be a great opportunity—I’m already familiar with the company and the culture from having worked there so maybe it would be a smooth transition for me into beginning my career. 

My frustration: I reached out to my former manager and asked him for some additional information on the position and he gave me the contact info of the person hiring for the position and superivising the role, as well as a link to apply on Indeed. I submitted the application the same day. Two weeks went by and I hadn’t heard anything, so I reached out to the individual in charge of hiring via the number my former manager gave me. I introduced myself and asked if she needed any additional information from me. Three days went by with no reply. On the fourth day I received a message asking for my availability to come in for an interview and, eager to make a good impression and take initiative, I said that I was prepared to come in the very next day, which I did. I feel like my interview went great. They said they were impressed by my confidence and enthusiasm despite my lack of experience coming in right out of college. I was told that I’d be informed of a hiring decision by Monday at the latest. Monday came and went and I heard nothing. Tuesday came and I reached out to follow up, receiving no reply. It is now Wednesday and I’m having second thoughts. I’m not sure I want to work directly under someone who doesn’t follow through when they say they will AND fails to communicate when things don’t go to plan. I understand this is likely not indicative of the whole experience working with this person however, this is all the experience I have to go off of. After all of this, I’m feeling much less enthusiastic or confident about this opportunity and now I’m nervous that, if I get an offer and I accept the job, it may end up being more complicated than it needs to be and that I’ll be kicking myself in a few months for not trusting my intuition and walking away. 

What should I do if I get the job offer? Should I even continue waiting for an offer? Any insight is much appreciated! Thanks in advance."

I received a job offer on Friday and accepted it for $75k salary. (Company/Job A) Then out of the blue yesterday, I received a call from the Director of the department for another Job I want to work out a verbal job offer for $82K, which I accepted. (Company/Job B) I already accepted (and signed) the agreement for Company/Job A. However, I did review it and it said it's an At-Will employment agreement meaning I'm not legally bound to work for them and either parties can terminate the employment at any time. Company/Job B did tell me that I won't get an offer letter/email until after the holiday, so it will come to me sometime next week. I intend to wait for that in writing before going back to Company/Job A to decline, just to be safe and I know 100% for a fact that Company/Job B is going to happen for me. When it comes to receiving a job offer when a higher salary comes into play, what advice can you give me for declining Company/Job A? I don't want to burn any bridges and I feel guilty but I know this is business and I want to make as much money as I can so I can't pass it up as I know I would regret it later.

Oh and I was laid off in October and my salary is going from just under $59K to $82K in less than two months. I'm super excited but nervous as hell to go back to Company/Job A to politely and professionally decline their great offer."

I'm going to a job interview soon where I have to come up with a good answer to this question, do you have any tips on what to say?  


Imagine that the pizzeria in NYC has accepted your offer and is super happy. The pizzeria has received a standard deal (in terms of price and commission) but calls in about 3 months later when the customer found out that his friend who runs several pizzerias in US got a better price.   


The customer in NYC claims that he should have the same price as his friend, otherwise will he terminate his contract. The customer also informs that he knows meny restaurateurs in that part of the town and will urge them to end the collaboration with your company.   


How do you handle the situation/conversation? What problem areas do you see? What are you doing? What do you think the consequences of this will be?"

Update: To anyone wondering if I emailed to clarify if $16 was correct yes he meant $16.00 and no I am not going back to that job! I can do much easier jobs for more. Hope everyone had a nice Thanksgiving!"

I literally would still be there, but I live super far and the pay, unstable hours, and long commute was too much. This job was the first one I got related to my field out of college. I have been applying like crazy since leaving,to roles that are hybrid and are full time. Nothing I do seems to work. It has been super depressing seeing my old co-workers who were able to stay on and live closer land roles, though I am glad for them. 

 I am currently in the process of expanding my network on Linkedin and following more recruiters, liking posts, etc. A recruiter I followed has career coaching sessions for 15 mins at a cost of 25 dollars. Now, usually I would say I'm not paying for that, but at this point idk. Another reason I am even considering this is that this recruiter works at the same company as my prior role(It's a large media company). What do you all think? I know the chances of him just offering me a job are not likely, so I'm not expecting that. On another note I have also started applying to management retail/ roles. Would management retail/office roles help in landing future admin or coordinator roles in the film/tv industry.Thank you"

This has been a fully WFH position. The pay is not the greatest but it switched from a set payment to commission based % so that made my pay go up a little since then. 

But without giving away too much detail, I essentially manage things for my clients and handle them and if I can’t hit up one of my higher ups and get them to deal with it. I’m also constantly improving our day to day workflow as well I’m supposed to be available from 9-5 but my pay is based on “20-25hour work week” even though I’m supposed to be available for 35-40 hours I may not be working for that full time but my mindset is, if I’m supposed to be available during that full time, regardless if there’s work to do or not, I should be paid for being available for that time as I can’t get another job as I’m supposed to be available from 9-5, which is true as most jobs I’ve been given opportunities for (through friends and family) are within the 9-5 range of work.

When I first started this job I was pretty brainless and didn’t know much about anything but I’ve grown exceptionally well and have had clients say they’ve stuck around just because I’m always staying in touch with them business wise and non-business related. 

I’ve wanted to talk to my boss about a raise but was unsure how to approach it as I’m commission based and my pay varies on my clients (if they stay, and how much they’re paying us each month) and if a client leaves at the end of the month, I essentially don’t get paid even though I’ve done work for them for that current month. 

Would love some tips on how to approach a raise to my boss as it’s a relatively small company but I know we are making good enough money as we’ve implemented new and expensive workflows and hired 2-3 new people since I’ve started."

I recently left my job on good terms and am looking for other work. I asked my employer for a reference letter and they said it was against company policy to do so..... I was always able to get reference letters quite easily from past employers but not this one.

Just wondering if this is somewhat normal? I worked for a large firm for 4 years and as far as I know was a good employee. Had many performance reviews that were always positive. No complaints from other coworkers or managers.

I am able to get other references but would obviously like one from my most recent employer. For example if I worked there for a longer period with no other references, not having this reference could hurt my chances at landing another job... Who knows maybe it will hurt my chances.

I’m a 32F and I am looking to make a shift in my career, but I am having trouble figuring out what career path I should take next.

I have a Bachelor’s of Science degree in Psychology and I have been working as a mental health counsellor post graduation. I also have a children’s entertainment business where I perform on the weekends entertaining at Birthday parties, Festivals, and at Weddings. (I have a background in acting and I am a singer-songwriter.)

I plan to keep my children’s entertainment business on the weekends as I enjoy it a lot. I also plan to keep performing as a singer. But I am planning to switch my Monday-Friday mental health counselling job as I am burning out and I don’t see myself doing that in the long term.

I know no one can really tell me exactly what I should do, but I’m stuck in the how I should figure out what to do next. I’ve been reading job ads and lots of of jobs seem plausible for me but I just can’t decide which career would be good for me long term! I even took the Myers–Briggs personality test and I came out as an ENFP and ENFJ.

Any suggestions on what I can do to figure out which career path/job is best for me? Any thoughts or comments would help, thank you"

I work for a successful scientific regulatory consulting company with about 75 employees in the US.  The company is doing well based on numbers I have seen.  I am in charge of following up on US sales inquiries, marketing efforts in the US, and also the US recruiting and interview scheduling.  So basically a lot of different areas.  The company is global and is about 10x larger than the US alone.  I report to both the US COO and the Global Head of Sales and Marketing. 

For the sales work I basically follow up with inquiries that come in (usually perspective clients come to us from word of mouth or through various regulatory agencies).  I am in charge of ensuring NDAs are in place and client introduction meetings are set. I am also in charge of tracking all sales inquiries. 

For the marketing work, I am in charge of email campaigns, keeping marketing materials updated, shipping marketing materials for conferences, brainstorming ideas for new marketing concepts, and budgeting and planning all marketing conferences. 

For the recruiting work, I post positions, screen interview candidates, schedule all interviews and decision meetings, and develop offers and offer letters.  I also follow up with hiring managers to keep them informed of where candidates are in the interview process. 

So, how much should I be making for this work? 

I am going to have a meeting with my manager next week (end of year review) and I don't know how approach the situation.  I need ground to stand on to ask for more, but I don't know how much more. 

Also, I live in the Mid-Atlantic region in a medium cost of living area.

Any advice is appreciated!! Thanks!!"

I definitely struggled with it when I joined MSFT as an engineer. I was afraid to ask questions, reluctant to present in front of others, and afraid to take up harder projects I hadn’t done before. Here are a few things that helped me overcome imposter syndrome:

1. Remember that even the most experienced people on your team weren’t always that experience. They started from zero just like you.
2. Try to stick with one skill/surface area at first and get really good at it. You’ll become more confident as you learn more and also people will come to you to ask questions about that area.
3. Start presenting what you are learning and working on. Even if it seems small. This will help you become more confident talking about what you are working on and also help your work gain visibility across your team."

The school noticed I was a bright kid and didn't want me falling behind due to not wanting to show up because of the difficulties I was facing, so they said if I could get three National 4s they'd be able to let me leave high school early, so three days a week I'd study in my own classroom in high school and the other two days I was at my local college doing a general 'skills' course, once I'd passed my three National 4s and the part-time college course I was able to leave high school at 15 and get into college.

Since then I've worked a few jobs, completed a college course and my first year towards a degree through the open uni, but there's been some gaps in my education and employment due to homelessness and health issues (both of which are stable now), and like I say I don't have the best grades (that being said I passed my first year of my open uni course with a distinction). What I am wondering is whether or not I should explain the reasoning in my cover letter, and if so how much to say and how to go about it? Any help would be really appreciated as there's a job that's absolutely perfect for me that doesn't require any real qualifications but I'm worried I don't look the best on paper and will miss out on it."

So I turned my notice in Monday afternoon, and today I was pulled into my bosses office and offered a counter. $10k more and a promotion to Director of Talent Acquisition in a few months once she is confident in my skills. I told her I would need all of this in writing which she sent over very quickly. I asked for the evening to think about it and get back to her with my answer. 

I just don’t know what to choose. Less commute and closer to home, or big step in my career?

Update: Decided to accept offer from new company. 7 minute drive compared to 40 minutes two times a day is more than worth it. I appreciate all the feedback, just needed to see this thing from all angles. Thanks! 

Edit: By confident in my skills, I should say we have an entire J1 Intern program that I have not been included in. I need to understand and learn that process before they are comfortable giving me the title and extra increase."

I am a 27 year old guy who just got my AAS in computer support. My goal with this degree was to get a job at one of the local school districts or university in a help desk role, or something similar where I would actually get to talk to people and help them with their tech problems. 

I have had 3 interviews for these positions now. One for the school district in the town I live in, one for the district in the next town over, and one for the university. I felt really great about all of these interviews, I felt I answered their questions well, but in the end they went with someone with better qualifications.

I'm not upset that they are picking the people with better resumes than me, I just don't know what I'm supposed to do. I live in a very rural area in Washington State, there aren't many tech jobs out here but I have no intention of moving, my wife has her career well established in this area and we both love it here.

I have tried applying to basically every job I've seen come available that I am qualified for, and a bunch that are well above what I'd be qualified for but applied to just because I need something.

I currently am working a minimum wage job delivery auto parts to the auto shops in the area. Besides the three interviews I had at the schools, this was the only place out of the hundreds I've applied to that actually interviewed me. It's not a bad job, but the pay makes it tough to really do anything with. Ive been there for a few months now, applying to whatever jobs I find and hearing nothing but crickets in return.

I just think it's time for me to give up.

I'm working for a Financial institution and I've been assigned this year as a customer insight champion and to try and get my team to record 'more' feedback they get from customers. This is so I can give quarterly presentations throughout the year.

I've been told we can't actively ask for feedback on correspondence/calls with clients, however, if clients mention something my co-workers should record the insight in a group chat. I've had a look at the group chat and it seems co-workers don't really record the insights, or they don't receive any insights.

I've thought about gamifiing the process by offering each person 1 piece of a roulette wheel for each insight they submit during the month. Each number on the wheel will represent one of my colleague's submissions and a small prize in loyalty points which can go towards buying something from the company (as long as the boss approves!).

Really appreciate any ways to help motivate my co-workers to get on board with recording insights, thanks!"

I was recruited for the role by the CEO. It's a $10k pay raise and offers more opportunities for me career-wise. The problem is I'm 6 weeks pregnant. 

I'm obviously not telling anyone I'm pregnant yet, but I need to start thinking long term. I'm in Illinois, USA so FMLA benefits don't kick in until 12 months. I'll only be at the company 7 months before I give birth. 

At my current job in the same industry I was given 12 weeks paid even though their policy is 12 weeks unpaid. I appreciate this perk, but paid leave itself is not justification to pass up this opportunity. My concern is losing my job or being forced to take a shorter leave. 

I don't have a job offer yet, but I want to be strategic about this. How can I bring up my pregnancy to ensure job security? Is there anything I can ask for in my offer in order to be guaranteed my job back after I have the baby? I don't need it to be paid, just need job security. 

I'm hoping they're inclined to work with my since I was recruited, but I'm nervous to bring up the topic before I get an official offer. I'm even more nervous to take the job and not be granted time off after having a baby.

I will try to wrap up my story real quick to give you some insight. I am 29 years old, hold a PhD in Linguistics. Due to having a boyfriend abroad and planning to move there, after graduating I knew I needed a job that allows 100% remote work. After half a year of trying, I found a nice gig – executive assistant to a vice president of a Fortune 500 company. So, I started my first real job at the age of 28...

The job was based in Hungary, my team and boss mostly in America and they did not care a bit where I worked from. HR did obviously, so I played smart when I was abroad visiting the boyfriend. With the inflation of the Hungarian Forint and my salary disappearing + having a health insurance in a country I don't spend too much time in + primarily, the constant stress about when my work laptop breaks down and I need an emergency trip back home from boyfriend's country, I was not happy with everything. However, I loved the boss, the teams, and the tasks. Every day was different, and the position was prestigious and needed some intelligent problem-solving skills.

One day I uploaded my CV to this job portal in boyfriend's country, just to see where I'm at. Immediately next day I got a local job offer at an HR outsourcing company. I interviewed for them just for fun and to ""practice"" interviewing. The recruiter liked me even though I told her I don't think I would leave my job. The next interview was with the CEO as the company is small, only around forty employees. The CEO seemed super nice, he supports a ""results only work environment"" and working from literally anywhere. I said I would think about the offer.

Since they offered me roughly €450 more per month, a healthcare in the country I'm planning to establish my life in, and a stress-free life with the CEO's approval to work from anywhere during my travels, I finally gave in and accepted the job with a very heavy heart.

The job itself is basically level 1 customer support, we support web-based trainings we provide for this big, German external company and I get to practice German (my 5th or so language). However, the actual tasks are incredibly repetitive, as you can imagine. You have a Word doc with like 30 different response templates, you mostly use those to answer the participants' questions... You tell them to enable cookies and pop-ups, that kind of stuff + some mild administration on the learning website.

The colleagues are nice, everyone is friendly and helpful, the office is in a nice location and there are voluntary office-Tuesdays but no one is mad if you don't attend. The pay is obviously an enormous improvement.

However, I feel that after a few weeks (I started 2 weeks ago) I will get so bored, and I might resent it. I don't want to sound arrogant, but I know that holding a doctorate, I'm capable of so much more than this. I don't want to return to academia though, I don't think. I guess my best bet is to wait until something pops up and try to shine my skills wherever I can at the current job - I already fixed an arising problem teaching my colleagues what VLOOKUP is and I'm going to try to seize these opportunities.

But even if I do, a promotion is not likely to come in less than 1.5-3 years from what I see on the LinkedIn pages of my colleagues. I don't know if I can hold out that long, doing such an uninspiring job. I left the first job for this one after 10 months. Leaving *another* job after a few months will surely look bad on my CV. I miss my old job, the importance and prestige I felt, the fun I had and the problems I had to solve. I feel a bit resentful that I'm back at the very bottom of the ladder, after having worked with executives and directors. Unfortunately, there was no way to stay at my old job as they do not have a legal unit in boyfriendcountry and neither could I become a contractor for them.

I'm trying to think of the positives – I will significantly improve my spoken and written German and also the language of the country (I am quite multilingual as is); and obviously the first full month's pay will also definitely ease my pain. I can also learn about the systems they use and the way they work. Obviously, every place offers something new to learn. How can I reframe my thinking so I don't run into the toxic ""I'm too good for this"" thought? I feel like an asshole for having an objectively great job and still whine, but I feel what I feel :( I would appreciate your insight!

**TL;DR: For country-moving-reasons I accepted a nice and better paying, but too simple job and now it is hurting my ego that ""I'm too good/too smart for this"".**"

i got a very promising interview at a place i really wanted to work, i noticed that my interviewers were three women. i got a second interview. i went into the office and saw that their entire department was women. i didnt get hired. which was a huge blow because the entire process took four months and they look three weeks to send me a denial after my second interview.

so my girlfriend told me to try applying to admin assistant jobs, since i have three years of experience on my resume, and waking up at 8 or 9 is certainly easier than waking up at 2am. shes an admin assistant as well.

her job was looking to hire people, and they began the process, my girlfriend told me that they throw away applications from men without even looking at them.

today i received probably my 30th denial letter for an admin assistant job. i not only have 3 years of experience with the same job, but i have two degrees.

why will no one hire me?"

I was a student (drop out) until recently so I was working 20-30hrs a week occasionally taking on more hours. However I’ve switched to full time the last few months so I’m spending 40+ hours a week on my feet now.

I’ve heard that the best time to apply for jobs is January-February as that’s when most companies get their hiring budgets/people start looking for new jobs etc. I’m not sure how accurate this is. My current durations at my previous jobs have been 2yrs 6 months and 6 months (Temp).

I am looking to become a project manager in the tech industry, but I am having trouble figuring out how to go about it. As of right now, my work history is in health care and involves data entry as a pharmacy technician. I want to try and break into the tech industry as I am close to becoming a senior in college.

I've seen on Indeed and Coursera that IT project managers may want to learn the basics of programming and have some jobs with implementation and possibly database analysis. I was wondering, in order to stand out and gain experience in the field, should I be looking and trying to land any kind of job in the tech field to build up experience? Is it worth it to learn programming languages like JavaScript, C/C++, Python, etc? I have no experience with programming, so this would involve starting from square one. I was wondering how other IT Project Managers got their start as I am worried about putting all this time into getting a tech job and not being able to move up from there. I am aware of certifications like the PMP and PMI-ACP are really good to have in that field but I find that unless you already have your Bachelors or at least 1-2 years of tech experience, there's very little of chance of making it into an internship. Would appreciate any help or advice. Sorry if this has been posted before I looked for a while in this sub but did not find what I was looking for. Thanks, guys, and I hope you all have a happy Thanksgiving

TLDR: What are some jobs I can get in tech that will help me become an IT project manager in the future. I am looking for internships or entry-level jobs that will give me a good understanding of the field. Also, is it worth it to learn programming languages if I'm looking to become an IT project manager in the future

I was aware some of this would happen as a month earlier my manager informed me of forthcoming changes to our team and floated the idea of a new position for me. I'd been at the business for about 10 months at this point, and told him and his manager I was interested. They assured me I could have the position soon after given my performance since joining.

Nothing happened initially, which was fine, but once the restructuring occured, I became more expectant. I was already performing this new role to a degree, so as dynamics within the organisation changed, my work, workload, and responsibilities shifted to those of the new role. 

I then started asking my manager when I could expect the contract, and for one reason or another, it's been kicked down the road again and again. These reasons include business trips, other teams receiving the focus of higher-ups, and general dithering and bureaucracy. My manager has been very sympathetic with me for the increased workload as I basically balance two roles, and while I greatly appreciate his support, my patience and respect and positive sentiment for the business is wearing very thin.

There are several other people in neighbouring teams in similar positions, waiting for their contracts, and having spoken to some, I know they are angry too. Today I was told I might expect to hear more tomorrow or Monday, and I felt so upset that I could only give a weak affirmative response. 

I am thoroughly tired of waiting in this limbo, not knowing what pay I'll get offered and when I can fully focus on my new role. In recent weeks, I have lost my enthusiasm for the promotion, I'm drained, and now I feel I'll just be taking the role for the title and experience to then move on. I love my team, and my work is interesting, so it's so disheartening that it's come to this because higher management won't pull their finger out..."

First off, sorry for using a throwaway. Anyways, I am kind of at a point in my life where I am trying to settle down in a ""forever"" home as my girl and I are progressing to a point where we are getting married and would like to have kids. My niche is Information Technology for U.S. Government jobs, usually bouncing around 3 letter agency places (DoD, NRO, FBI, etc) doing tech work. I am in a great hot spot for them in D.C. however, the cost of living and the weather here is miserable.   


Our dream is to build a home on some land somewhere colder like Colorado, which has a good amount of federal government jobs that pay well compared to the cost of living. While I am ultimately trying to find a job to last me the next 20 years, I realize nothing is perfectly stable so having some fallbacks without moving is preferable. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have started looking on clearance jobs, USAJobs, LinkedIn, etc but the search functionality leaves a lot to be desired when you searching for a decent Cost of Living and can buy land. What tools are available or strategies would you use to try and figure out more or less what I am going for? I know Aurora, CO has a lot of jobs, but land and cost of living are out or reach for even high-wage earners.   


TLDR; How would you find a job and location somewhere with plenty of federal government IT jobs that has a decent cost of living and land (2-3 acres) available for purchase?"

But, before I resigned from my previous company, they gave me a certificate of employment. In case they won't able to give me the reference letter in 3 days, do you think I should just submit my COE to the new employer?

Now, I responded and did not hear back from him for about a week or a week and a half, so I sent a follow-up email and then he scheduled the call for Tuesday.

I had the call and it was about an hour long and both him and I were pretty engaged and friendly and we're talking a lot about the position and salary and my availability and it all seemed to go really well. 

I'm curious if anybody here has ever gone through a screening call or been the person screening other people and has any sort of surefire way to tell if the screening went well or not.

6,2022-11-24,Deciding between jobs,u/violetharley,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z3zrxn/deciding_between_jobs/,jobs,"So I have been in a job since September. It's not bad, but it's also not great. I got the gig because I was friendly with the lady who is now my manager. Pay is decent, but it's your standard push-papers around a cubicle and make phone calls all day to make someone else rich. I can live with that, but it is SOO boring. I have to motivate myself to go in most days. Even better yet, when they hired me on my work schedule was to be Friday through Monday 10 hour days. I wasn't thrilled, but I'd had few other prospects, needed a job, and this lady got me in,  so here we are. We are woefully understaffed here. They just hired another woman to work with us. Other woman is nice but I also find her annoying (she's pushy and one of those Type A, gotta be busy types) and they of course love her. My manager who got me in can also be tough (I'll be on the phone with someone and she will be yelling stuff in the background (ask him this! ask him that? did he do this? find out if he did that) to the point where I either can't concentrate or just wanna ask her if she wants to take over the call or what. Sheesh.

So long story short, I got another offer from a guy last week. They invited me to an interview in their huge fancy house. We instantly hit it off. They hired me on the spot. Salary is equal to first place, but there is a potential for a commission that could give me up to 20K over the salary. They are having an office custom built that should be ready next month, but I would be working for husband and wife at their home office till then. They seem demanding too, but also seem like the ""do your job and everything will be fine"" types. They want me to start asap, like NOW.

Torn. First job is OK and has been in business a long time. I like the boss ok and supervisor is nice, but most other people I can take or leave. It's the kind of job where if I stay, in five years I'll be in the same seat doing the same thing and that's about it. Second job may be the same, but I have sales commission potential, plus I would literally be in charge of the place according to them if they hire a helper.

So. Leave first job and go to second? Stay at first job out of stability's sake and hope the new lady isn't my replacement? My fear is if I ditch and go to second job and they decide in 2 weeks they don't like me, I'll be out on my arse with nothing but a bridge burned here. They seemed to really like me, but you never know...and I already had a job pull that on me once earlier this year. I'm so stuck and don't know what to do.

UPDATE: Thanks to all who replied. I got a text over the weekend asking me a question from the 2nd employer, and then almost immediately a nasty follow up text from them saying that if I could not communicate or reply to them in a timely manner, then they would have to move on even though they were disappointed. WOW. I'm talking maybe 5 or 6 minutes between messages. So...yeah. I'm thinking I'm going to tell them thank you and goodbye and stay with Door #1. I can deal with boredom and a rude ass coworker, but a boss who's throwing a tantrum because I didn't text him back in a six minute span when I don't even work for him yet? Hard pass. I appreciate it y'all! "

I just interviewed for another job and never told them about my Hippa violation. This job is a weekend program and it pays a little over 20% more than the job I just started at. Bascially, this job is 8am-8pm Friday through Sunday. I would be off Monday through Thursday which is great if I want to further my education. The negative of his job is that it is 40 minutes from my house and 40 miles but it is an easy quick ride. I am actually going to go to the other job to shadow them and get a feel for the place. The other job is 13 miles each way and 23 minutes away due to more traffic.

The second jobs hours work better for me, but I just started this other job and feel a sense of loyalty being they hired me after the Hipaa violation. Everyone has been really good to me and don't know what to do."

I’m not sure what direction to go. I don’t know if I should just go with the one that is going to make me more money.

I’ve been working in healthcare for the last 8 years. I was kind of looking forward to the break of not having to “deal” with patients and going back to scientific research. Plus, the research gig is with a big corporation. I’ve never worked corporate so I have no idea if I’ll excel in that setting. The research job is entry-level; hence, the rate difference. The dental job is administrative. I feel like I have potential to climb in the corporate job where essentially the sky is the limit, but idk if that is me being naive. While in the dental office setting I’ll only be able to work up to being a manager. 

Idk what to do. Should I go where the money is?"

I literally started working here right after graduating so I have no experience in finding jobs or going to interviews and ect, I guess I just got lucky that I applied the boss liked me and accepted me then lol.

I'm not in the US btw. Currently I'm in a state where I don't want to work in this field which I've been in for 5 years (POD, e-commercial...) but I'm also having a hard time finding out what I want to do. I see job recruitments and I always feel that I don't match up with the requirement and I don't even know what I'm good at. Heck, I cannot even write a proper CV as in my current job as I don't even know what to put in it, I work in a lot of parts (upload products, doing fulfilments, customer service, email marketing: all I have to learn myself because my boss made me do them). 

I know a little bit of everything but I'm master at none. Most people who know me think my English is good but honestly, I'm not even confident in it, I can do a little bit above average I think, they are just overestimated my skills. 

I'm sorry if I don't make any sense, currently I'm a mess, having to pay bills and keep my cat happy, not making my parents worry, peer pressure and ect"

Last summer I had an internship at a restaurant, it was so difficult and painful but I made it through it. I recently got a job a few weeks ago as a market research associate and I lasted two days. Even though this job was less physically taxing, the minimum hours were much more demanding. Most teens get a job a fast food restaurant like McDonald's or a retail store like Old Navy but I'm afraid my body can't handle that. I am struggling to work and focus on school. I've been told to give up looking for work but I have no choice, if I don't get a job then I won't be able to afford to drive and the bus routes in my town are practically non-existent. My dad has given me no other option but to work to pay for my car insurance and honestly it's stressing me out so bad that I don't see any hope."

Soon after graduating during the pandemic, I got a research job at a social research institute. I was not too fond of the job as it was remotely related to my education. My job tenure was for 18 months which got over 7 months ago. I applied to two companies where my degree would be put to use but I couldn't clear the interview round. In my opinion, there are not many companies in India that are dealing with nuclear energy.

I am good at programming and like numbers so I took the google analytics specialization course online and completed it. I want to work as an energy analyst at a consultancy company. So, I applied to different companies and got rejected by all of them. I noticed most of the good companies are looking for an MBA candidate (from top tier b-school).

As I was not making any progress I started preparing for GMAT but getting into a good college would be difficult for me as I lack the required experience. My other option is to apply for Ph.D. which I am not so sure about committing to something for 4-5 years.

I have used this time to take online courses and learn other things but I think my patience is running out. Slowly I am losing self-confidence. It feels like I am stuck now, very badly and it is frustrating.

Any suggestion would help."

I said that my language is spoken in 25 countries and accidently said ""25 countries, which I had travelled to all of them"" then I quickly blurted ""NOT ALL, not sure why I said that"" as I laughed.

They laughed too, and I just redirected the convo to how I had travelled ""across"" all of them and understand a complete perspective of interactional business and localisation etc.

But there are no software engineering jobs available. Would you look for software engineering jobs at other companies or see what other jobs Google and Medtronic have. The reason for the latter is because you really have interest in working for the company so the title doesn't matter as long as the pay is good. Also the focus isn't on engineering, it could be business, it could be sales. The focus is whats more important- working for THAT COMPANY YOU WANT vs THAT JOB TITLE."

Recently we had a new CIO from other public company. This new CIO started hiring many he knew from his previous organizations and gave them good titles. Those who got hired , hired others they knew from the same company/ies they worked previously and everyone got good titles and higher wages compared to the ones currently in the same organization.

Many current employees started moving out including my team mates. I am on the outlook  as well.  But how do I approach this situation, I have already contacted Ethics Hotline and complained a month ago, but I did not get a response nor any questions.

CIO hired VP, VP hired sr directors and director, director hired sr project manager/s, leads etc. sr project manager hired team leads, developers. So all/many from just 2 organizations.

While many working here for years are still under old compensation, these new hires had adjusted salaries for increased inflation. Plus good titles and stock options as well. The only few promotions current employees got were at low level profile, eg a developer promoted to sr developer etc. only if they worked harder to support this new team. 

I have invested in company stock through ESPP program and have continued through from the past 4 years.

I have conducted some interviews myself for these new hires and have given a negative feedback/rejected the candidates (like sr developers, leads) , but they were still hired. The reason given was that there are no candidates in the market. I also noticed that the job profiles were created to suit the candidates they plan to hire.

Its been almost 8 months all of this started and I still don't see any achievement from this new team, except they make good presentations and host fun events etc.

I really like the company and want to be ethical as long as I am working. How do I approach this situation?"

&amp;#x200B;

I recently applied for a junior position in a London based Cyber Security firm. I had two interviews and everything was going really well, I spoke to the third party recruiter and he said that they would love to offer me the job. I was given a start date and all was well. I never handed in my notice, as I hadn't received my contract. The day after being offered the job (today, was offered the job yesterday) I received a phone call from the third party recruiter saying that they have to retract the offer due to some internal miscommunication. The miscommunication in question (to my understanding) was they they meant to hire 4 Sr pen testing positions, and not 2 jr and 2 sr. Now I obviously have my own judgement on this, and I don't believe it is at all professional, especially considering that I had been looking at flats to move to as I was relocating from over 200 miles away. 

My question is, I have the interviewers email details and I was wondering if it is worth emailing them asking for feedback, and if there is anything I could have done to potentially change the outcome. 

Looking for advise as to what, if anything, I should say. I appreciate any help/advice."

The problem is, most of my experience is with one blogger. I learned a lot and became very good at what I do, but I was harassed to the point of quitting that job. I cited a hostile work environment in my notice of resignation to make sure there was indisputable proof of why I left in case they retaliated.

Since this bridge is now burned, I can't use them or link any of my work that exists on their website for my resume. How should I proceed? Should I exclude them from my resume? Include them, but redact the name of the blog I used to work for so I can be honest about why I quit? 

I wouldn't like to name and shame them to other bloggers. Besides the fact that I think that would reflect really badly on me in an interview setting, They paid me my full two weeks after I submitted my notice and let me take the time off completely.

When I was talking to HR he just picked the 5th because it was exactly two weeks away, but he said the real date would be up to my soon-to-be boss. My contract says the start date is “anticipated” as the 5th too but it’s subject to change based on background check, etc. I still haven’t heard anything from my boss if it’s definitely going to be the 5th, and I am still in the background check process too. Would it be a bad idea to ask to push back the start date to the 13th? It’s whatever if I can’t make the trip, it’d just be a little disappointing not going.

2,2022-11-25,Terrible job but stuck with it - Any advice?,u/Czieto,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z4umez/terrible_job_but_stuck_with_it_any_advice/,jobs,"First of all, sorry for my broken English, it’s not my native language. It's going to be quite long so there is a TL;DR at the end. 

To give you a little background about myself, I am a last year engineering student at one of the French “Ivy League”. For my last year, I chose the “apprenticeship” program: basically, I’m working part-time as part of my degree. I interviewed with a lot of companies and NGOs, and eventually got several offers. In particular, two of them stand out. Even though they were quite different (a big company, on one hand, and an NGO on the other hand), they had a major common point: sustainable development, at least that is what I thought. My heart told me to choose the NGO, while my brain and family told me to choose the company. I eventually chose the company and started working there in early September. Turns out I’m feeling completely miserable right now. 

I would like to have your advice and opinion about my current situation.  

**Company’s missions and tasks:** The position got falsely advertised as the perfect job for someone who cares about the environment and wants to propose innovative ideas, and that’s what got me interested in the job in the first place. But honestly, the job is anything but ""innovative"" and nobody cares about the environment. I would even say it’s quite the contrary: some colleagues are borderline climate skeptics. What’s funny is that I told them during the interview process that it was very important to me and probably the main motivation behind my application. What’s more, the tasks are not interesting at all. I am spending all my time finetuning excel sheets or doing minor improvements. Sure, I did a little bit of that during my previous internships (which I loved btw), but it was not the ""end goal"" of my job, just a tool to be used for other activities. I don't feel like I am learning anything, but just doing some work at a low cost for the company. It should be a two-way relationship, and for now, it’s definitely one-sided. I honestly feel like a secretary (not belittling the people doing that job, just saying it's not the position I applied for): my typical day consists of transferring outlook account creation requests to the IT department, saving and sorting documents in the appropriate folders. On paper, I’m supposed to be an “international project engineer”. I think we can all agree that it’s not really related to engineering and I’m starting to get bitter, I don’t see the added value for me or society in general. 

**Uninvolved manager:** he was appointed as my “professional mentor”, and is legally accountable for supervising and tutoring me, but he doesn’t do the job at all. I never get any feedback on my work; he doesn’t have time to dedicate to me (we probably had like one or two hours of face-to-face conversation in three months) and he makes sure to tell me every time he’s too busy to see me. To some extent, I *do* understand him because he really seems to be busy, but this is quite frustrating. Sure, I can always try to have a conversation with him but honestly, it does not make me want to try. I had one of the best managers ever at one of my previous internships so I may have set my expectations too high, yet 

**Toxic atmosphere:** The whole team seems to be dying inside, nobody talks to each other except during lunchtime and it's always work-related. People don’t even say hi to each other (which seems to me like the bare minimum of politeness to me). There is a constant feeling of uneasiness. Of all the 3 persons I met during the recruitment process in June/July, 2 have already left the company, one of them being the only person that showed a tiny bit of consideration to me and tried to tutor me. I mean, I’m not really fond of constant team-building, but gosh it’s totally absent there. There’s no team at all, just people sitting next to each other in an open space. The other trainee in the department (way older than me, currently changing careers) seems to have a similar experience as well. I’m an introvert myself so it’s sometimes difficult for me to socialize, but still, I do appreciate a little bit of team-building and my previous experiences came off well despite my shyness. My manager often goes on business trips, and I can’t express how much I feel relieved when he’s not around. All interviews were done remotely since I was doing an internship abroad, which is a shame because I would definitely have noticed something was off. 

**And then there are all the subtle things that may not appear as serious issues when considered one by one, but become disturbing when added up:**

· When I received the contract, I found out that the pay was lower than what they initially offered me during the recruitment process. I asked them if it was a mistake and they replied that it was there was no mistake (even though I’m pretty sure it’s not the case, I take many notes during interviews, and it was not what I wrote). Btw they sent the contract to my school but never sent it to me directly and replied really late when I needed it asap to rent an apartment.  

· I was not invited to the onboarding event for trainees like me and only found out about it a month later. 

· My predecessor completely changed careers after her contract ended. 

· My manager is passive-aggressive with other employees, badmouthing them on many occasions. For instance, he seems to have a grudge against the secretary of the department, who is probably the kindest person I’ve met so far in the company, and has a workload of three people since they laid off the other secretaries. Another example is when we held an online meeting, and he asked me to send everyone the list of absentees in red even though I told him that a lot of them were on vacation that day. 

· The atmosphere doesn’t seem that tense in the other teams. I interacted with some people from the other departments, and they all seem much happier. Maybe the grass is greener, but my interactions with them were all positive.  

· I tested positive for Covid yesterday and today I was not feeling well at all (I’m barely able to stand and I’m bedridden for now). He called me this afternoon and I thought it was to check up on me. Turns out it was just to ask me if I sent an email for a completely non-urgent task. Gosh, at least pretend you care a little bit. 

· First interviewer initially sent me an invitation for a totally different job. 

· Second interview (now my boss) showed up very late to the interview. I can’t remember the exact delay, but he was so late that I thought he forgot about the interview and started writing an email to HR to ask if there was an issue when he finally logged in. He also replied to one of my emails on Sunday at 10 pm. 

· Third interviewer barely answered when I asked her what she liked about the job. She left in early October. 

· Inappropriate questions and comments regarding my ethnicity. I can’t really say if it’s tactlessness or something more serious, but this has already happened quite a few times. Hearing things like 'you speak French well” when I was born and raised in France my entire life is really inconsiderate. 

· There is an infamous project in the department that is known for making every project manager that worked on quit in the following months. Well, it got transferred to a new project manager, and turns out I have to support her on the project as well. People were joking about that when the previous project manager (3rd interviewer) left. 

· This is not related to the job directly, but I should point out that my parents face extreme financial issues. My entire salary goes to essential needs (food, rent, commute) and I don't save a single dime. Thus, I don’t have any money left to pay for hobbies outside work to compensate for the boredom. To make it worse, the pay is just a little bit above what the NGO offered me, so it’s definitely not worth it.  

At first, I told myself that there were only a few months to go, but honestly, this is soul-crushing and very depressing. I don’t think that it will teach me anything useful, so career-wise it’s useless too. Furthermore, I feel incredibly guilty since my gut feeling told me to choose the NGO and I completely ignored it. In a way, this experience *did* teach me to listen to my intuition, but I understood that in just a few weeks and now I have to endure the job for 9 months. Problem is that it's part of my curriculum: I don’t have my degree yet and so can’t start applying to other jobs. Every day I’m just daydreaming about September 2023, hoping that I will make better choices. I’m spending nearly half of my days taking a look at more interesting job offers to get some ideas for when the time comes, but it’s escapism. 

I wish I could easily bring up these issues to my manager, but my description probably convinced you that he’s not the kind of person you want to interact with. Besides, I can’t find any redeeming qualities, so it would be really awkward. 

Do you have any ideas of things I could do to improve the situation?

**TL;DR:** missions and values totally different from what they sold me, uninvolved manager, toxic atmosphere, numerous questionable practices, but I can't quit. Any ideas?"

19,2022-11-25,"Moved out and accepted a role for 55k, should I stay or move back in with family?",u/ElectricOne55,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z4w5yg/moved_out_and_accepted_a_role_for_55k_should_i/,jobs,"I was working a remote 2 year contract role for 2 years which only paid around 42k and offered no chance of promotion, and it had poor benefits (no days off without pay). So, I accepted a role with a university that has good benefits which pays 55. But, I had to move away from family, rent is 1450, and I often pay around 250 a month for groceries.

I'm still left with some money after expenses, but after family visitied for the holidays I debated if I should move back to living with family and work remote. However, another reason I accepted this role was that most of the remote jobs seemed to either be

1. help desk support type roles with no chance of promotion.
2. roles that were more system admin which was good, but they would be with small companies with poor benefits, 6 month contract to hire, and no health insurance until 60-90 days

I moved out to move to a place where I thought there would be more to do, and maybe find some people to date in late 20s to mid 30s. But, after I moved to my new location, I found out I guess that it's tough to meet people anywhere. So, I'm debating if I should move back to family to save money even if it means I have less of a social life. Where my parents lived it was mainly retirees. But, with inflation and rent costs being the way it is I feel it may be tough in this position.

Although, I do feel that I'm learning a lot more in this role than prior roles, but the workplace environment seems really siloed off and cliquish so idk if I'd ever have any chance of a promotion unless someone in a spot ahead of me leaves.

With that said would it be better to stay where I'm at or move home with family? Or am I just being overly negative or overly exaggerating the costs?"

I turned in the aforementioned illustration test, and I felt ""okay"" with it. Then I started tinkering with colors/details yesterday, and now I have something that I think looks WAY cooler.

The role itself may be a slight step down in terms of reporting line. Both roles are within Analytics. The UK role had the advantage of being mostly remote. I am interested in working in Switzerland as it looks like a great place to raise kids and the nature is nice"

I am a 30 year old male and I want to get into front end development. However, I have got a job in Payroll. I been in Payroll for a month and I do like it a lot and I do get to use some of my skills. I do plan to change after a year or two maybe, so maybe I can move up in payroll if I cant get into front end. 

I am making projects and practicing my front end skill in my free time. 

Here is the question. 

What skills can I carry from Payroll to front end?

I am really good with excel and using Marcos and VBA. 

Also, regarding my skills with front end. I am using HTML, CSS, Javascript, React. I also know how to use C++ because I did that while living in Japan. 

Just don't know if it would be hard to make a career change at 30, and if some of my skills in payroll are great for front end."

I really enjoy my job and I am payed well (minimum wage + $15-40 in tips per shift). I typically work about 6 and a half hours on Saturday and Sunday because it is a breakfast and lunch restaurant, so the hours really aren't terrible. 
My conflict in all this arises because I feel that I don't have that much free time to do a lot of things outside of school and weekends. Mon-fri I have school obviously with Tuesday having extra curriculars until roughly 5:30PM and Thursday having a dance class in the evening. I am also an IB student in junior year and I am beggining to feel the stress of taking college level calculus coming from honors algebra 2, to say the least. I have also recently joined a church choir with my girlfriend (and also recently got a girlfriend) 

Tldr; I want to make the most out of my time and enjoy my life in high school. Would it make sense to quit my job or is it a bad idea?"

Since then I have had different jobs, working in different companies but recently I think I found what I want to dedicate my professional career to for a very long time (if not, the rest of my life). By the way, I now work as a Junior at Deloitte in their accountancy and finance division, where other companies externalize certain tasks and we, as Deloitte employees, carry them out.

I want to get into finance, preferably into investment banking or wealth management. The thing is, based off what I've read on the internet, that it is very difficult (if not impossible) to get into top companies in these fields if you don't come from a private or ""Ivy league"" educational institution. At least that is how it works in the US. I've read many testimonies from different people but what I've concluded is that almost all of them were students from top universities and that they took on an internship in these top companies, that I've mentioned before, during their time at college, so that when they graduated, these same companies hired them as Junior or whatever entry-level position they had available.

So, with all that in mind, living in Spain, having graduated from a public university in Business Administration more than a year ago, having no possibility to take on an internship anymore (as companies here only do that if there is an agreement between the university and the company) and no Master's Degree in finance or any related field (although I have in mind enrolling in one and trying to undertake an internship in the best company I am able to),

what would you do if you were in my position and wanted to break into investment banking and wealth management?

I will spare everyone a rant and listing my applications/interviews ratio. Instead I want to get some more tactical advice.

How can I become more competitive as an applicant and how can I avoid a 2 month long interview process? Luckily I am currently employed (God I could not imagine going through this if I wasn't, I feel for you all!) and I am trying to manage my time well as I do not want to spend hours tailoring my resume for employers who are ""actively recruiting"" and or for positions with 200+ applicants. 

Look, I understand the resume spray and pray technique, and know that out of those 200 applications, 120 of them don't even meet the basic requirements for the position. And yes I know about another 20 of them are crap interviews who might have tweaked their resume a little too much. However, that  still leaves approx. 60 applicants, which is still extremely competitive and smells like a loooong interview process as the company needs to give their hiring teams ample time to weed through all qualified candidates. I don't mind taking time with employers for interviews, but come on, do we really need a 4th/5th zoom with the Janitor?

So my question -- Is there practical value in being A) first to apply to a posting, and B) apply for jobs with less than 20 applicants? Surely not every role with few applicants is a bad opportunity right? Just lesser none companies...

Thx!"

For context, I live in the United States and I’m about to graduate college with a criminal justice degree and I have been looking at the job market for a couple of months. 

Not sure if anyone can relate to this or not, but I’ve always been one of those people who just has a great difficulty doing things. Throughout my life, I’ve always ended up in last place, and I have to put in twice as much time in as everyone else to learn something or develop a skill.

I got high grades K-12th because I worked hard, but when I got to college, work became more skill/application based and I struggled. 

This is sort of depressing, but I guess I would call myself one of those people that isn’t very good at anything. With that in mind, I don’t think I’ll ever be rich, but I would like to at least find a job that pays at least $17 an hour.

That being said, I don’t see a whole lot of jobs in my degree that pay above minimum wage. I could be a corrections officer but honestly I’m terrified of that after hearing some stories…

To be honest, I’m only in this degree because I struggled too much in other degrees, no matter how hard I worked. I’m at the point where I’ve switched my major too many times and school is too costly.

The only previous job experience I have is in food service. Every time I click on something that is “entry level” it seems to require previous experience. How am I supposed to find a job that pays above minimum wage if all jobs require previous experience? Where do you *get* the previous experience?

Honestly, I’m depressed. Inflation and the cost of living is skyrocketing. Wages have not increased. Everything seems to require previous experience. I feel like I wasted time and money getting this degree. How do I find a job?"

I previously interviewed for another role with a company, got through all interview rounds only to be told they went with another candidate. Fast forward a couple weeks, and I applied for another role with the same company. Met the same hiring manager from the last process and she let me know I am a great fit for the company but wanted to make sure the role she put me in would keep me challenged and engaged enough. She had all great things to say, so I was hopeful. I had an interview panel for a role with a company on Wednesday this past week and the panelists had some tough questions. My direct manager didn’t seem to really like my answers or was playing it cold for the most part. The person that I would be replacing was very sweet and seemed to have positive reactions to a lot of my answers. She let me know decisions would be made at the end of next week, but I have this feeling that I don’t think I’ll get it…

How much weight does the hiring manager have on the decision to hire versus interview panelists? I know I shouldn’t dwell on the situation, but I really want to work for the company and hope I get an offer."

I am a 24 year old male nearly two years out from college working a job that I do not love. I graduated with a B.S. in Mathematics with a Computer Science minor. After working retail 1.5 years during COVID feeling like a failure for not getting experience outside of school and struggling to find work in the field, I applied to over 500+ jobs and ended up ""starting"" my career as a remote support analyst for a healthcare technology company. The job pays around $22 an hour and it does not involve any math or computer science so I am working a job that does not use my degree at all (sadly).

I have been going on for 5 months working and while it's nice to work remotely from home I feel like I do not have a social life and that it's become just tedious, repetitive work trying to deal with clients who are super entitled clinicians with righteous egos about the software not working their way or just trying to manipulate us to do the work for them. There have also been some layoffs at my company last month and we have not been hiring people for this role recently so I've been having to take call after call with little breathing room in between calls. The company has been having hiring freezes for mostly all roles with the exception of executive roles. As a result of this, I have been feeling really burnt out.

Regarding my current living situation, I live with my parents and have about $23k in my bank account but I am hoping to move out soon. I feel isolated at home in my room in my desk working 9am-6pm with no social life on the weekends. My parents are happy to have me home and are letting me live rent free but I feel like I cannot grow staying in my small hometown all of the time.

I really want to work in the more technical roles such as software engineering and data science, but I feel like all my knowledge is very basic for that and self-studying is a challenge not being in a school mode anymore + working full time. It's also hard to compete against people who have the experience and actually CS/engineering degrees. Plus I feel the more I work tech support the more my dreams become dreams; I feel like a failure for a STEM major not doing actually STEM work.

I was planning on maybe living at home for at least one more year and going back to grad school for 2024 for if I cannot land a better role within the next year. I could grit my teeth and self-study and just apply, but I feel like I'd prefer a formal setting.

I just don't know what to do or what the best course of action is and my fear is I'll lose out on the rest of my 20s trying to chase down a career that I haven't started yet working in a career that I don't enjoy. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I’m 33f and just started working as a legal assistant about 3 months ago. I have an associates of arts in psychology, a legal secretary certificate and I’ve worked in customer service, retail sales, warehouse production and administrative support roles since I was 14. The paralegal training me has attempted to walk out numerous times in the 3 months I’ve worked at this law firm and I’ve seen 3 associate attorneys quit since I started. The other support staff call the attorneys “bozos” and other unmentionable names.  HR assigned me to the main principal attorney, knowing I’m struggling to learn from my fair weather supervisor. I have applied to numerous jobs and I’m praying to find a better opportunity soon but frankly I do not have the experience to handle the work load I have been assigned. I have a strong work ethic, a positive attitude and I genuinely enjoy people. I’m open to any ideas as far as a job change is concerned. Thank you for your insights!"

Also, why my contracting company would want me to sign a renewal offer letter in November, that expired in August and then add an addendum later",u/ConfidentYellow1978,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z5l9ay/im_currently_working_as_a_contractordata_analyst/,jobs,"My contracting company wants me to sign an offer letter they sent that is thesame hourly rate as one year into working through them as a contractor  (I am not happy with the offer and have given them a rebuttal number to meet me fairly ).

They claim they will add an addendum to the next offer letter that may be renegotiated if they offer me more money , which doesn’t make sense to me. 

Since my initial  contract working for the fortune 150 company ( let’s call them capital A is over) capital A retained me and aare glad with the work I’m doing. Likewise, I’ve really improved things for capital A and get along with the new director who knows the value I bring and sting work ethic. Regardless, the company that hired me isn’t aware of all I do and really hasn’t been checking on me or my progress for over 12 months. I’ve only had contact with my lead at the third party/ contracting company 2 times. Both times they rejected basic requests I had and I was told PTO were non paid. I infrequently asked for any PTO and the one time I asked out of 9 months was given the aforementioned info. 

Regardless, while renegotiating my offer that was supposed to have been sent in august 2022. (But didn’t hear from anyone until I had to ask) the person in charge of my contract at the company mentioned there’s a hiring freeze due to inflation and will likely not increase my pay. I was also told to sign the renewal offer and then they wil go ahead and approach the fortune 150 company for more funds and if it was approved then they would add an addendum to the offer letter they want me to sign. Which seems odd! Is this common in the IT field ? 


Also, when I do the math I’m really only making 60k a year after taxes. With all the work I do, the work to money value doesn’t add up. Plus  my contracting company unfortunately doesn’t see this at all as they don’t manage me. 

Any suggestions how to deal effectively with this situation and not come out of it cheated ? Just want a fair deal and it seems cutthroat so far ! Thanks for any input



Edit;

I was able to get a raise of 25$ using some salary negotiation tactics and tips I read online . If there’s anyone out there going through this process don’t give up and know your worth at the end of the day . All the best to you all and thanks for whoever responded"

I recently accepted a new position within my company after months of waiting for the right fit. I should note this was a lateral move. I applied for a couple of internal jobs, but also was externally searching during this time frame. 

I technically haven’t started performing the work for the new job yet, as I am on Short Term Disability until the end of the year, but on paper I am officially in my new role. 

This week, one of the external companies I applied at reached out to me to set up an interview. The job pays 10-20k more than I make right now. 

If I were to be offered this position, would it be wise to accept? Or would I come across looking like a scumbag? Or maybe I’d be a scumbag but I should still accept? Any advice is welcome."

Does anyone have any experience to share from either field? 

Overall I think I prioritize stability and some sense of job fulfillment. 

Obviously not every day in any job is gonna be world-changing. But I feel like my current job is adding no value whatsoever to society so I want even a tiny bit of a sense of fulfillment.

There isn’t a specific way to add bullet points so I was just going to use numbers as the bullets. Also, how long should the description be? What’s a good general rule of thumb?

I fixed a couple of bugs, rewrote a bunch of scripts as they didn't work well and improved a lot of other things. However, I missed the deadline and the pipeline still didn't work. Unfortunately people always kept reminding me how the other developer never had these issues (basically it is/was always assumed that I destroyed working code).

Today, I am either finally getting some help or getting fired. I was asked to onboard new people to help with the project. In retrospect, I should have asked to work with a team instead of solo.

I'm currently working in the advertising space and am conflicted to leave or stay. Recently I got offered a position to join an agency that's going to pay me way better and is more in line with what I want to do. However, I feel an immense sense of guilt for leaving my boss and very small company. I've already signed the offer letter for the new company but am still hung up over my old company and am literally having constant anxiety attacks even thinking about turning down the counteroffer.

For context, my old company hasn't really been treating me the best - truth be told I'm constantly shoved to the side, underappreciated, and never felt like I belong. Hence, although I am comfortable and know the ins and outs of the company and the job, I decided to respond to a new opportunity and landed the new role with ease. With that being said, when I tried to put in my notice, my current boss counter-offered me. Reason being that it's gonna be inconvenient for him to find my replacement.

The counteroffer would give me an overall salary package that would be less than the other job but his point of difference is an offer to commit to sponsoring my work visa in the future.

I guess I really want to know - should I still have faith in my boss that in a couple of years he really will commit to sponsoring my visa or should I not depend on him and just go ahead with the new offer that financially will be better for me in the long run?

EDIT: Thank you so much to every single person who has gave me advice and pretty much opened up my eyes to the reality of the situation. I genuinely cannot be more grateful for the kind and wise words this community can give to a stranger just to avoid them suffering and for that, thanks for restoring my faith in humanity reddit :) 

I put in my resignation for good today and turned down the counter offer. Didn’t look back. Boss wasn’t too happy (that’s an understatement) and said some really harsh things. Cried my heart out but realised it’s for the better and I have a better opportunity in front of me. 

To every single person who told me not to take the counter offer, thank you. God knows what could’ve happened if I did. And to those even thinking about it, unless you have absolute faith in your boss that things will change - do. not. do. it. 

And as a wise Redditor who commented on this thread - “Guilt don’t pay the bills”

Signing off, a staff who knew her worth and chose to walk away."

I'm trying to fit in since the place is actually a decent place to work. I'm a receptionist and the office is about 300 people, including a large plant staff. The old receptionist still works here, but she wanted to get into finance, so she's working in that department. I'm 47 and have loads of experience.

How do you deal with office drama? I don't think it's a dramatic place to work by any stretch of the imagination, but I do feel like I have big shoes to fill in my roll. I'm having a hard time gauging other people since I'm new. I think I'm doing okay so far. But, I sense some of these ladies are more wishy washy/sensitive and I tend to be a bit more assertive/aggressive in my personality. I've toned it down a lot but how do you deal with trying to fit in? Just fishing for ideas so I can do a good job socially."

So I have been working at a restaurant for two weeks now, and it’s my first job. However, I have not been given any tips to this day. I usually receive around $20 or more within my four hour shift, but have to put them in a shared TIP jar. 
At the end of a shift, employees share the tips. However, I am the only person waitressing throughout my 10-2 shift, and I cannot receive the tips because my manager said that the first two weeks of a new employee, they cannot receive tips. I’m so confused, can anyone help?
I also work 4 hours but never receive a break. Yesterday, I worked from 10-2, then was told to come back 5-9. But I also received no break during that time. I see other employees have a “break”, but it’s usually only 10 minutes and they have to clock out for it. 
I also never signed any contract when I got hired, because she said we didn’t need one, and she constantly scolds me in front of the clients whenever anything goes wrong even though it’s not my fault. Is this even legal? Customers often make a “yikes” face to me, and even tell me that she is terrible and to not listen to her because I’m doing great."

""I knew this one happen one day. [VP of Operations] wants you to start a digital technology department."" He mentioned some of our internal applications, but also a lot of Excel and automation where possible. Aside from that, he didn't have many details, and our chat was only maybe two minutes long. He encouraged me to negotiate strongly with the VP when it came time, and he said that the intent is to get started ""sooner rather than later."" Aside from that, I didn't have many other details.

I don't have any issues with those specific skills or technologies. I have a very generalist set of skills with computers, and my job title is actually ""[Department] Technology Specialist"" even though I work with a lot of other departments. I think he did that to get me in a more accessible location while also getting rid of some of the administrative work I do with the department I'm currently attached to. My two main issues are that I don't have experience building a department, and that I'm not sure what sort of things I should consider for a situation like this. 

So far, I put together a brief presentation. This highlights some of the potential ramifications of calling the department ""digital technology"" and instead advocates for an analytics, initiatives, or insights division. However, while one of my previous job titles included the word ""analyst"" I didn't even have a bachelor's degree until last year. I'm pursuing my master's in data analytics, but I'm worried about how choosing that sort of term might affect our scope and workload in the future. 

Regardless of the name, I also wanted to propose that the three major outputs of the department would be analysis, automation, and data products. The tasks my boss told me the VP had planned all fit under one of those categories. I've identified a total of ten projects and charted which output(s) each project relates to, which are anywhere in development from being a nice idea on the horizon to being something that I've already been actively maintaining.

I don't know when the VP will be trying to meet with me, and when it happens, I don't think I'll be in a situation where I can easily show off a presentation, so I'm considering changing to a report I could hand him. Is there anything else that I should include, like plans for potential growth of the department? Are there any things (outside of what's normal for a job interview) that I should negotiate for from the start? 

Thanks for any help!"

I will say my own thinking was flawed because I was working at a place that was so messed up and toxic, there was drama with the CEO and the staff I was working with happened to be very wrapped up in said drama… it was all just beyond repair… there was also no growth because of all that was happening, so my mindset was sort of like “anything is better than this place.” I happily accepted a remote position at a dream company. It’s two months in and everything has been going well up until recently…. two weeks ago my supervisor was micromanaging me about a past event and I felt so bad about it. I’ve never had to deal with this because my previous job was so wrapped up in drama, that I was often not really managed. So I went from
no management to micro-management. New supervisor asked how I was feeling at the recent two month review, and I said I didn’t feel trusted/ supported in the way that works best for me. She thanked me for the honesty and brainstormed ways to better handle management that works best for me and her. At the end of the day, I felt relief. The next day I’ve been asked to go into the office near my home. I didn’t think anything of it, new supervisor said it would be okay, right? Wrong. I was sat down with someone who is not my manager and given a “talk” about expectations, training schedules, different responsibilities, and to top it off, am now required to go into the office (where I work in a common room because they don’t have enough offices for me. Think waiting area outside of a doctor). They didn’t say why I am coming into the office, but I assume so that they can watch me. Did I mess up by expressing my concerns?

I recently applied for a freelance part-time job related to Excel to help fund my studies. I found this through a university job advertising page, and heard back quickly (&lt;30 mins). I have a competency test soon and was wondering if anyone had any advice, as this is my first experience with any kind of job like this. I am relatively confident in my Excel skills at a basic level, which is what the job required. It has been described to me as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Checking all numbers against the raw data on an Excel spreadsheet.

\-Checking quarter numbers and page numbers.

\-Confirming donut proportions and graphs are correct and sense checking it against the data.

\-Formatting checks including outlining anything that is misaligned or inconsistent throughout the report.

\-Checking colours of graphics ensuring they match the key provided.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if anyone had any advice or experience in a similar field to reassure me in the process. I am keen about this as it pays relatively well for a student job and is a remote role so allows me a lot of versatility around my studies. 

Apologies for any mistakes as this is my first post here. Thank you!"

3,2022-11-27,Is my company taking the piss out of me?,u/rylexia,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z6h51v/is_my_company_taking_the_piss_out_of_me/,jobs,"I work for a recruitment agency. I joined one of their teams on a £21k salary back in February with a very good commission structure. I’d say basic salary + commission would earn me around £35k per year.

In July, the company announced that they were cutting commission. Instead they would give a yearly bonus of 10% of our annual salary IF we hit our targets and a raise in basic salary. I was given a pay rise to £22.5k. As you can imagine, this caused chaos as a £1.5k raise is nothing compared to the £15k we’d earn in commission annually. MANY people quit. One of my colleagues explained to me that it didn’t make sense for us to have been getting commission in the first place as our roles were quite easy and didn’t really deserve it. I believed this, and I still do think it was odd that we were getting paid so well for what we were actually doing. The company does still offer commission but you have to be doing a different type of recruitment to what we were doing (360 recruitment- it’s a lot harder and more work). I think other agencies only offer commission for this same more difficult form of recruitment so I don’t feel that changing workplace would be worth it. It was just random luck that my company did give us commission until they realised against it.

So I stayed. I liked the culture of the company and it was a very laid back job so I stuck with the 22.5k salary.

Something then happened which changed everything again. The company had a contract with the client my team recruited for and the contract expired. Therefore the client had to go up for bid for a new agency and annoyingly was won by somewhere else. (I’m going to use a fake example, Apple.) Apple was then taken off my company’s hands and a different company took over their recruitment. However, to stop us being made redundant, we were entitled (and even encouraged) to move over to the new agency (called TUPE). I didn’t want to TUPE over to the new company because of a number of reasons, so I stayed yet again.

Staying meant I had to join a new team which was quite different to my old one. At first, it started off quite nice. Relaxed and easy-ish like the job before. I didn’t want to take on a 360 position (the one that paid commission) as I just don’t think it’s for me, I think it would be too hard. Recently, they’ve really been piling on the pressure for us. We have some DIFFICULT targets to hit and they keep getting harder. Every move we make is monitored. The excuse is that “because the company has lost Apple as a client, you guys need to make up the difference in profit by working harder.”. I just don’t think that’s right? Why does the fault of the company mean I have to work harder? It’s not my fault they didn’t bid high enough to renew another contract with Apple? 

I’ve come to realise that I really don’t like working somewhere with such high expectations and and targets. It makes me panic and get overwhelmed. That’s the whole reason I didn’t join the harder recruitment role (360) because it’s SO monitored and such high pressure. I’m also worried that I’m just simply not going to hit my targets and I’m going to get sacked. I don’t think that’s the case but I even dread the thought of a stern talk about my low statistics. The high targets have only recently been implemented so I haven’t failed yet but it’s definitely on the way. The team I originally joined was nothing like this. It was relaxed and just let you crack on.

I’ve been speaking to my old team who decided to transfer over to the new agency back in September. So far they’ve all said it’s so so good. There’s no targets in place and it’s a very chilled out environment. I didn’t want to transfer initially as it’s WFH and I didn’t like my boss. However, I’m kind of willing to deal with working from home if I means I’m not under all this pressure anymore. Also, my boss is leaving in January. 

Am I stupid? Are they being unfair?
Should I join the other agency and quit?"

I was let go this morning. The department I was in was doing an insane amount of reorganizing and I wasn’t hitting my goals (even though I reached out and asked for help and pretty much got nothing). Here’s the thing - I was put on a PIP 11/10, which was supposed to end on 12/9. My boss even confirmed that’s when the PIP would end.

I was sent an email about it and a reminder email the day before. But I missed both of them and I take responsibility for that as I was not checking my emails so I never saw them.

I saw this email the day after I was suppose to take the training. I emailed the provided email apologizing for my carelessness and asked what I need to do to reschedule.

Today I checked to see if there was a response (I also checked before Thanksgiving) and I saw that in the original email they sent, it said there are no additional training classes at this time so everyone needs to make an effort to attend the ones they're scheduled for.

To be fair this was a temporary position and my work time is almost up. But I have the possibility to continue at the job, as my old boss is retiring and a new guy is coming in whom I've contacted and provided my resume.

I really don't want this to be messed up because of one careless mistake. Has anyone had this happen before? How did it work out? I plan to send a follow up email if I get no response but I'm not sure what to do from there.

Edit: Wanted to add that I have been working at this job since May of this year. I have also completed other required training for this job. This is the only training that I have missed."

(im black/cuban btw and as well nonbinary, and constantly got misgendered by that employee and she used the r slur and cried because i called her out for being weird, gaslit me why she cant get that word out her vocabulary like why tf r u crying hello??)

so i applied to hot topic and fye, and with fye, i was really happy to know that my manager is non binary, however, even though the interview and everything went well, i told them i have autism and idk if that was a bad thing to do and that limited my chances. it seemed like it went okay but my manager said they were gonna call me and let me know but ive been waiting for like 3+ weeks now and im starting to get anxious like. they have my number and just if i didnt get the job or whatever, i really hope its not due to my disability like....i mentioned that ive been in customer service before, i can learn quickly, i can just get overstimulated if there is like bad altercations, but im willing to work on the weekends, know the layout of the store and with hot topic, they said they will call me back when they have more positions cause now i get told they are fully staffed. idk if i was dumb to tell them im autistic but i feel like if its not mentioned, people are gonna do shit that either offends or just is downright disrespecting me..."

* **Job A** - Job I want most. Best all around career step up.

* **Job B** - Offer on the table, better situation than current job, but not nearly as much of a step up (or culture fit) as Job A. 


Current Situation: 


* Job A - The previous and final interview before salary/bonus negotiation went VERY well. I was told that I will hear back in regards to next steps no later than this Friday December 2nd.


* Job B - Made me an offer that was slightly underwhelming, but undeniably a step up from my current role. I told them I would get back to them with a decision after Thanksgiving (this week). This company has reached out via text inquiring about my decision today. 






My current thoughts: 


Accept offer from Job B, and tell them I am putting in my two weeks notice in my current role this Friday. 

Then provided I hear back from Job A before this Friday (as they stated), I will then  withdraw from my offer with Job B. 

My current concern is that all three positions are technically in the same industry, so I do not want to risk burning any bridges should any part of this process not go as planned. 

* Is it reasonable of me to withhold from my current company that my two offers are within the same industry to avoid being let go in the interim? 

* Is this the best way to go about handling said situation?"

1,2022-11-28,Impostor Syndrome During the Job Search,u/astergrim,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z757it/impostor_syndrome_during_the_job_search/,jobs,"Some background: I’ve been in my current role for three years and super dissatisfied for at least half of that time. I stuck around because they were paying for my master’s degree in communication, which is about to wrap in the next couple of weeks, thankfully! Considering I’m also about to hit the newly-instituted salary cap for my role and my entire department is undergoing restructuring (with speculation that it’s going to be dissolved next year), this is awesome timing.

The problem is, I’m looking for a career change. My education is in digital media//filmmaking (undergrad), and with the knowledge I’ve gained through my master’s program, I’d like to go into marketing, especially with a focus on content creation, community management, and storytelling. I’m okay going back to entry-level (to an extent - I recently bought a home and my financial stakes are higher) but my background is in sales and admin roles with a bit of supervisory experience. I’ve highlighted what I feel are the marketing-relevant aspects on my resume, but I’m having the damnedest time getting calls back.

I know some of it is that Q4 drag, but the absolute silence is concerning. I’ve had one phone interview that I was certain was going to pan out into at least a second virtual one, but got the rejection email last week. It hit me with some depression and clearly some self-doubt; it’s been a minute since I’ve been on the job hunt, so it’s a fresh sting all over again. Since I’m being more targeted than I’ve ever been with my submissions, that also means that each one feels a little more personal - even though I know it’s not.

Part of me hates that I didn’t have a “career plan” when I was younger and just settled into generic, dead-end jobs, but I was doing what I needed to do. I know that I’m a bright, creative, innovative person, and I’ve been awarded multiple times for my communication skills. Still, that doesn’t stop the feeling that I’m an absolute garbage, uncompetitive candidate. 

I took a break from applications over the last week, but I’m ready to hit the ground running again. I’m already writing cover letters for positions that give me the option of submitting one, and as I apply for new roles, I intend to tweak my resume more intentionally to suit the position. For those who are going through similar, though, what advice do you have? How do you stay positive when things are slow and it feels like getting something new is absolutely crucial? How do you make that impostor syndrome shut up?"
1,2022-11-28,Received offer while waiting for better offer,u/0106lonenyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z75hfg/received_offer_while_waiting_for_better_offer/,jobs,"I'm waiting for an offer by company B. It's little more than a formality at this point. I'm 99.9% sure they will make me an offer and I plan to accept it.

However, a couple weeks ago I received an offer by company A. It's a pretty good offer and I would totally accept it if company B didn't exist. They already sent me the contract and I've managed to buy some time because the contract is in another language and I ""needed to translate it"", but it's been two weeks and I'm starting to get nervous and run out of excuses.

I don't want to sign a contract and then have to cancel afterwards. It sounds really not correct or professional of me. At the same time, there's still that 0.1% of possibility that company B won't call me back so I need to have a fallback option.

What should I do?"

I'm the highest I currently can go in my department and already have more responsibility than majority of my coworkers and I am the most senior contractor. 

I've been passed up 3 times on being hired to tue company full time. 2 of the people that got those jobs over me have already been fired for being bad at their job yet I continue to be passed up.

I make good money ($36/hr) and the work is relatively easy but I have to commute 3 hours each day and they have started sending me to a different location where I work  10 hour days with 4 hours of commute so 14 hours a day work related.

I rarely have any free time since I wake up at 5am and get home at around 6 exhausted. 

My aim is a remote job so I can just remove the commute but anything I've found only pays $20-25.

3,2022-11-28,Should I quit my job? I needed help please,u/LiteroticaSharon,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z76uig/should_i_quit_my_job_i_needed_help_please/,jobs,"I know right now is a terrible time all around for everyone looking for jobs, so I just wanted to get you guys’ opinion on if my quitting my job is justified. 

I work at a marketing agency and I’ve been here for less than a year. Since I’ve been here, I’ve gotten on anxiety/depression meds because some days I had so much work to do, I felt like I was going to have an anxiety attack at my desk and I think I did one day. 

When I was first hired, two people immediately quit so I was dumped with tons of work within my second week and then had to assist my coworkers with their own work as well. 
I’ve gotten hit with (several) microgressions, I’ve reported my old boss (not for anything specific, he was just a bully that had a pattern of harassing women), who called me the next day on video chat to discuss the issue with me because HR shared it with him (this is the second time that’s happened with him, but only the first with HR being the leak. The first time it happened a high level manager I was asked to speak to by another high level manager let my boss know everything I had to say), I received my 90 day review 79 days late (after I finally gave up waiting and asked for it because my coworker received his on his 91st day), sat through a meeting where the CEO happily broadcasted an old video the company made and published with an employee that is not a minority wearing a grill and speaking in a Blaccent in an incredibly stereotypical manner (this video was showed to the entire company and kind of shocked me as a minority myself, so sorry if this isn’t that offensive), then during the same meeting the CEO fatshamed two employees. I’ve had a fire extinguisher fall on me, and my final straw; I might not get to take my time off this year because it’s “a busy season.”

Would you quit, or am I dramatic? Has anyone else ever been through anything like this? 

 If you think I should stay and power through, can you please give me some advice? 

This is just the stuff I can remember at the moment, but I’ve been living a never ending saga these past months, it seems. I may be a bit more frustrated with it than necessary, but this role pays well below average, and I can’t afford a one bedroom apartment with this salary, even. They have no plans to give ANYONE here a raise, which contributes to my frustration. 

I’m severely depressed, and being here contributes to it, I think. I’m so loaded down by work that by the time I get off, I can’t even entertain the thought of putting in applications or anything else. I’ve been thinking, and this job has provided no benefits for me. I’ve learned nothing to advance my career, they have no 401k, and their benefits suck, but luckily I have insurance with my parents for a few more months. I’m still magically getting charged monthly for health insurance, though, wouldn’t you know! I’m just rambling now, sorry, but thanks for reading!"

&amp;#x200B;

I don't use reddit all that often but I figured I'd get some advice as a recent college graduate who seems to have lost their path for the first time. I graduated with a degree in Communications in May and have been somewhat job hunting since September (I wanted to enjoy my final summer as a student). Quickly enough, I landed a salary position as an entry-level data administrator making what is calculated to be a little over $20 an hour. I've only been working here for about a week now, but...I feel like I hate this position. I feel like office jobs don't match my energy, and everybody else who works here, while nice, is significantly older than me (10-15 years minimum). I feel quite isolated, depressed, and out of my element. I have talked to multiple people about this, but both sides make good arguments. Some consider me quite lucky to have found a position that pays alright, is close to home, and isn't currently overwhelming. Other people have told me that I can make more money looking for a job that better aligns with my interests and that I shouldn't sacrifice my mental health for this. I'm hoping people with more experience in the work field than me can advise me on whether I'm being a brat, or am justified in thinking like this. Thanks so much in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

To add: I am financially okay for another 5-6+ months before it becomes critical to have a job. So while it wouldn't break my bank to continue job hunting, some would argue it wouldn't be the smartest of ideas either considering how long the hiring process can be."

I am a graphic artist, web designer, I also do illustrations and take my own photography for my projects when possible.

I have had a couple freelance jobs but not necessarily paid that I have done to “widen my circle” of jobs and notoriety. 
So far all my clients have been happy with the results but I have had trouble finding more clients to expand…

I am on multiple freelance websites and of course social media etc.. 

SO.. I was wondering if anyone knew any artist agents ? 
Or if they have had experience with them? 
Are they worth it ?
What am I supposed to do to have the best chances of being selected ? 
I was thinking of making a special book to present to them with my projects and illustrations, photography etc If I find some … I don’t know if anyone has anymore advice or thoughts ? 
I know they take a percentage of the fee but I thought it would be the best option for long term freelancing …

Thanks for reading :) 
I am just throwing that out there but if anyone needs a graphic artist or web designer I am here haha 

I hope you have a stellar day !"

I came here seeking for a few tips but before doing so I ll take this time to explain my situation which is most likely very similar to a lot of people !

Last couple of years after finishing my BA's and MA's in Hospitality Management I was always working on the side ! Here I would like to mention that I started as a trainee in jobs ever since I was 16yo moslty the summer time but they used to pay me around 450eu/month plus teh environment in such indusrty is down right horrible. Coming back to today a few months ago I used to be an outlet manager in a very large worldwide hotel chain but the toxic environment and the underpaid salary for working 14h per day made me leave thinking that Hospitality here is ruined! 

Eversince I left I ve been looking for a job while helping a few family businesses and been doing interviews I think right now am at 326 Interviews in and out the country ! Yet no employment am at the point where i genuenly feel like I wasted 5 years studing to feel stranded. Also I always supported the idea of starting small so I've been applying to jobs that at least require less experience and then grow with the company !! Further after the experience I ve had in that hotel I said that smaller companies focus on the people a bit more than just see you as a number. However, after 5 months on the look now been getting a huge pressure from the family and friends calling me names and all I know they care but its getting to a point where I just feel the looser of the fam !

 Cant even show up anymore because of that, missing a few gatherings because of that and I just cant stand being seen as such while every brother that I have is moving on their own way ! Even now I feel like a sore loser asking for help on the web but thats because I was taught not to show my battles ! I dont know am at the point where everything is so confusing it's just f'ed the idea that am on my mid 20's and I have 0 clue on hwo to move forward and do the right thing for once !"

In contrast, my coworkers...don't seem to trust me to do the important work. Tech lead is limiting my work scope to really trivial stuff...other coworkers at my level get more important pieces of work (theres only two other guys but both have been at my company way less).

I'm worried that my coworkers may throw a fit (""he doesn't deserve a raise"") in the case that my promotion goes through with HR. Honestly, my only motivation for staying here is that I get the promotion because otherwise, I do not get the tasks I want so I've been spending most of my time understanding and learning the system for my own growth."

I will be graduating this december but have found it extremely difficult to find a job in tech. I have a passion for software development and my best languages are Python, Java, C. I also know Javascript and C++ and would be okay with learning on the job as I am a rapid learner. I have experience with building web apps, scripting, compilers, Git, Docker, and OOP/DSA. I am at my wit's end trying to find a job and am extremely worried that it might be too late to do so. If I don't get a full-time offer by December's end, I will have to go back to India due to not being able to meet OPT requirements and I really think that it will be a waste of my parents' money and effort if that ends up being the case. 

Does anyone here have any tips or leads for jobs I can apply to? I am really stuck and would appreciate any help you can provide. Please DM me for details like my Resume and contact details. Thank you!"

This is my first time encountering multiple interviews with the same panel. When asked, recruiter gave no feedback on how to prepare or any indication as to what these interviews will entail. 

I'm assuming these might be continued behavioral/situational interviews. On my end, though, I am unsure what the expectations are for me in terms of questions or info gathering. I already asked my questions last stage and think I have a solid understanding of the company and role and certainly enough to make a decision. Any suggestions on how to tackle this scenario?

I really am not sure how keen I am on switching jobs right now, but I know I'm being underpaid compared to many of my peers, so I have been having a look at the market recently.

This recruiter reached out to me without me doing any work at all, I simply received a call, she asked me about my experience and asked me to add a few details to my resume. Less than an hour after sending my updated resume to her I receive a call telling me they want me for an interview asap. This makes me think I'm quite likely to be accepted for the role already, so I want to ensure I ask the questions that give me the most information

The pay is what I'm looking for, work from home policy is adequate (2.5 days p/week), responsibilities are more than what I have now but in line with the level I am expecting

The issue: I'm currently working for a very well respected performing arts organisation (in accounting), with an amazing culture that I've grown to truly appreciate, and the company I'm interviewing with is a gambling company that I haven't really heard about before. I do love a lot of things about where I work, but the salary limitations are unfortunately starting to make it a bit too hard to justify staying there.

I really just want to know what specific questions you guys might ask to get a sense of whether you would actually enjoy working a particular business. Things that might lead a bad manager to give away some red flags. I do think I need to change jobs for my own sake, but the one thing i do not want to risk is my mental health"

This appointment will last all day because the person lives far and I am getting braids which takes hours to install.

I told him that I wouldn’t be able to go because of those reasons and he told me that I need to have my schedule cleared to attend these events. If this was literally anybody else, he would’ve understood and not said anything smart in front of anyone. Besides, weekends are my time.

Im a college student and I recently got fired from Little Caesar’s. I hope I don’t have to explain how bad a fast food job can be and especially when you’re understaffed, but that day it was pretty busy for a weekend morning and it was another coworker and I. I took johnnys order which was a cheese, bread and wing.( Keep in mind that Hot and Ready items are only Pepperoni, bread, wings.)
More and more people walk in for pepperoni’s and obviously walk right back out because they are the hot and readys. ((Can’t believe we had pizza ready, because of the amount of people coming in and me being on register and watching the oven while my co-worker was HOLDING IT DOWN in the back making pizzas by the second.))

About 10 mins passed and some guy ordered the same thing as Johnny only that his was a pepperoni instead of a cheese, so I gave it to him on the spot.
However, I took note of that so I asked Johnny for his name and he showed me his receipt…. Cheese, bread, wings. I said okay let me take a look I’ll be right back.
I check in the back and see his will be out by the time I finish taking a phone order about 3-5 min.(I didn’t tell him how much longer because I planned on giving him his order as son más I hung up the phone.))

I’m on the phone walking back to the front to compete the mans phone order when I see his mom, Sherry beside him with a mad facial expression. I try to walk to the computer but before I could reach it she says loudly where is my order, 
I reply I’ll be right with you I’m just going to finish this order. This exchange 3x until she says I don’t care that you’re on the phone where is my order.
(Me already annoyed and tired)
I replied then I don’t care that your order isn’t ready.
She says that people have been waking in and out and that her order was it out.
(Again every time she sounds angry and loud)
I try explaining that her order is not a hot and ready and that it was a wait and that the others’ order was hot and ready.
Johnny then says I ordered a pepperoni you messed up my order 
I then say your receipt says cheese
That why I gave you a receipt so I mess up you can show me, I would’ve gladly gave you the right order but you guys always decide to make a big deal out of everything.

She then begins to say how old are you 27 and still at little Caesar’s (Hint: I’m ALMOST allowed to drink)
I said my age and took out my ID put it up in front of her face.
I said I work to help my parents and to pay for school .
Johnny then says how old are you,,, and I ask how old are you that you have to bring mommy to defend you
He keeps saying things while his mom defends him (any mom would but my mom wouldn’t scream at an employee for not getting an order on time)
I say if you want to know how old I am let’s handle it like men outside. 

Skipped over the part where she leans over the counter and tells my manager to stand up , by the way he wasn’t on the clock yet…. Back to the last part….
He doesn’t say anything 

And now really long story short 
Some lady says that I spit in johnny and sherry foods which I would never do to anyone 
I clock out say let’s handle it like men then I walk out to go home he says something under his breathe I come back and I say what did you say 
He then says he gonna call the police cause I threatened him 
I say you guys are ridiculous and go home 

I go back to work for a few days some higher up  comes to interview me about the situation 
I get suspended for a few days and then next thing I know my final paycheck came in the mail.

The lady ended up calling corporate or someone. My manager didn’t even care when I came back to work.
I do wish he would’ve stood up for me more in that moment though but it is what it is.

Everyone at work knew me for being really nice so it was a surprise for people to know that I was in that situation

I guess I learned my lesson:
Even if you mess up once it can still cost you BIG.

Still can’t believe I got fired off of me being angry 1x in almost 2 years and 1 year as an assistant manager.
All because they couldn’t wait till I was off the phone and because they couldn’t come up to me nicely to say I made a mistake.

Now I’m jobless till next year because I am leaving the country for 2weeks in December due to a family emergency and don’t want to get a job and ask right away for two weeks of time off.

I still have a little bit in savings but still payments, hope it’s uphill from here :,)"

I do really need a job but it seems that all the work I'm doing to change my resume over and over, joining resume classes to help me get an interview, hiring resume writers, getting on calls with professionals from LinkedIn to get tips... None of it seems to be working. I'm at the point where I feel depressed and I just expect a rejection letter to come. I haven't had an interview at all and I have 90 days left at my current job (and 120 days left of my visa in Korea). I don't know what to do anymore. I'm losing motivation and hope. I'm tired of applying. I'm tired of getting certificates. None of the tips and tricks seem to be working. 

How do y'all deal with job search burn out? How do y'all regain motivation?"

For context, I have been praised for my work throughout the year and have picked lots of work and completed many of my objectives or working towards having them completed before the end of the year. In comparison, my colleague always comes in late, never picks up more work and none of her objectives are complete. They complain about workload and often declines additional responsibilities. They are currently making slightly more than me in pay. I was wondering if I could/should use this as an argument to have my pay increased as I find it very disheartening to work so hard and additional hours to meet business objectives and to get paid less than my colleague. I was planning to use my mid-year review to point this out and say that using our Team as a base level, I am highly performing and should be compensated for doing so. 
I have mentioned that my colleague gets paid more than I do and my manager has said its only a little more but my point is I work very hard and my colleague barely works so regardless, its unfair! This has made me question about leaving if they will not increase my pay to reflect the work I am producing, its so hard to know that someone can come in late, refuse to do more and get paid more than I do!"

Went through round after round of interviews for an organization recently after applying online. At every step I received glowing feedback and met the hiring manager, would-be peer colleagues and senior colleagues too. 
This included several online interviews plus two face to face interviews.
Was told I’d done exceptionally well and that they were looking to offer. However time went on and no contract. It all culminated in a call today from the hiring manager to say the role had changed from permanent to a 9 month contract due to uncertainty in their market. 
I explained my disappointment because my current role is permanent and I applied on that basis; my wife and I both need permanent roles to feel secure and ensure we can cover our apartment rental, additional medical, etc. I feel blindsided. I told them I’d take time to consider, no idea why as I now feel down and kinda angry at them. 
Just wanted to to vent…."

Oh lawdd, as soon as I walked in the room, I started dripping with sweat I couldn't make eye contact and all my body language was like I'm about to enter a boxing ring. Never happened to me before and as this is a ""money confidence role"" I had the confidence of a teenager going to prom alone. The poor manager was just staring at my sweaty face in shock trying to make me more comfortable. 


I can't gather why I was so nervous for this role, it wasn't more pay than I usually get and I guess I'm a little desperate work wise but I'm living with my family and Graduated last year so I'm not feeding a family. I have other interviews lined up and recently done one that went so well and I was so in control.

I am a 23 year old, recent finance graduate. I had interned and ultimately took a job in very small financial advising firm as an assistant to the lone advisor. There are 2 other assistants here as well. 
1 advisor 
1 full time assistant (me)
1 full time assistant 
1 part time assistant 
Here is where my frustration begins. 

Assistants(one full time, one part time): No college degree, no finance background. Under 2 years experience here. They are paid hourly with bonuses every pay period based on a percentage of the advisors commission. (Sometimes bonuses bigger than my entire paycheck) They work 8-4. 15 days of PTO a year. 

Myself: bachelors in finance, hold insurance licenses, under 2 years experience here. NO PTO. And here’s the best part, even though I’m “salary” if I miss a day, it counts against my pay and he pro-rates it by the $ / day. 

To make this clear, full time assistant pay with bonuses comes out to about $20k a year more than I make. 
Part time assistants pay is about $5k a year less than me and that’s working 3 days a week. 

THE TWO ASSISTANTS HAVE THE EXACT SAME DUTIES AS MYSELF. But because I’m “on the path to being an advisor I’m paid less, with no bonuses that the other two get, and 0 PTO?!? Yet we do the exact same thing and I have more qualifications and same experience at this firm. 

No dental, health, vision. There is a retirement match. My boss is very smart and there is a lucrative outlook for me in the future whenever I become an advisor and take one clients. Unfortunately this has left a sour taste in my mouth after being here a year or so. I feel as if the pay is unfair and honestly I’m just lost on the thought process here. 

I’m just looking for guidance in any thought or direction, I’m officially at witts end want to have a conversation about pay and benefits or let him know I will be looking for a new position elsewhere. 

Thank you all so much for the feedback!"

After that, every new job I’ve had has slowly revealed itself to be a dumpster fire in one way or another. I’ve worked in a few different offices across a couple different industries. Are there really this many poorly run workplaces? Am I justified in leaving jobs after a year or so in search of somewhere I feel comfortable and respected?

Update: Thanks to everyone that tried to help

I did the interview and it was with two guys, HR hiring manager and IT a senior IT rep.

The HR guy liked me, but unfortunately, the IT guy was very soft-spoken and I couldn't understand what he was saying. I've told him several times that I can't hear him but that didn't change anything. He asked 3 or 4 technical questions. To which I replied, ""IDK but I will research the answer or ask a senior co-worker"". He would ask the question and if I didn't know the answer he would explain the answer. While he was explaining the answer I would eventually understand what the question was, some of them I knew the answer to.

It is what it is, I'll try to learn from the experience and move on."

He told me he had some trouble getting started and still does and with me it's the same, albeit not as drastic maybe. He then proceeded to tell me he was not only getting contradictory feedback but that he at times can also listen to his colleagues talk about him behind his back, without giving him feedback afterwards. He said it like it was no big deal, but I was absolutely shocked to hear this and really felt for the guy (probably for the most part because I am getting contradictory feedback as well). I want to say something to cheer him up but have no idea what. 

Note: We have a good collegial relationship but it's not like we are friends (yet), however, I still feel a lot of empathy towards him. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks a bunch!"

3,2022-11-29,I’m quitting my job of three months and I don’t feel guilty,u/Huge-Guidance5912,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z7zozx/im_quitting_my_job_of_three_months_and_i_dont/,jobs,"I’m quitting my job of 3 months soon. I don’t feel guilty.

I (f24) hate to be this person, but I’m putting in my two weeks at a job I’ve been at for 3 months and it feels so dang good. 

I’ve never cried so much at work before or been so miserable at a job. When I started, I was told I would be “pioneering” a system for a new team that the company desperately needed. Was given a desk and a team of two men in the maintenance department to help out with the physical labor of my role (not enough help if you ask me). One of them moved up from the role of assisting me and the other one quit because he didn’t want to be demoted to working on my team (I encouraged him to quit because he wasn’t getting paid NEARLY enough and had been promised a raise a year ago, only to be demoted from the position he wanted and worked so hard for) he now makes almost double what he was making before. Then, the guy that moved up had to work with me again because I had no help. 

I always knew I’d have to be doing some kind of labor on my job, but was told recently that the “day-porter” role at my position was supposed to be a bigger part of my role than I initially thought. I asked the guy on my team for help, because it’s a lot of work, and got told off for not being “hands-on” enough. I get little to no support for my mentor, and she has never bothered to guide me in the day porter part of my position so I’m left not knowing it as well as I should in the three months I’ve been here. 

My job title has nothing to do with “day-porter” roles. In fact, most of my actual job title involves administrative work. I physically can’t lift as much as I’m being told I need to, and I feel deceived into this position. Like I said, it’s in my job description, but I didn’t realize how much of my role would be doing just janitorial work and day porter activities. I’m still waiting to hear back from a few jobs I’ve applied to (I’ve applied to around 60 lol. I’m DESPERATE to get out) and every day I wake up I think of putting in my two weeks. When I took all of this up with my manager, he just said “read your job description”. My job description also highlights more administrative work than I’m being given. 

Of course, this isn’t to be dismissive of those roles such as day-porters or janitors, I just know my capabilities and what I wanted to dedicate my time to. I worked hard for this title, and I’d like to exercise it."

I have applied to nearly 40 positions and only heard back from three places. One said to get in touch after graduation, another rejected me after two rounds but gave me positive feedback, and the third was only a phone screening. I'm not sure if only hearing back from three places is a bad sign in this case. Is there something wrong with my resume then, or is it just because of the market + competition? I should mention I have fine-tuned my resume multiple times and consistently tailor my resume to specific positions. I also have done 3-4 previous internship experiences, one of them from NBCUniversal, so I'm not completely new to the workforce.

I'm also wondering if I should slow down/stop applications for now since hiring is slow this time of the year. Do people know if hiring will pick up again in January? I've heard talks of a looming recession affecting the job market, but I don't know how true that is. 

Please let me know what you guys think I should do and what I should focus on. I'm feeling a little hopeless since all my friends who are graduating early with me all have jobs lined up, but I don't and I'm aware that I have an uphill battle ahead."

With the time i have left i figure if i can time it right ill have my week off and have a check or two from both companys. 

Question: does the two week notice imply ""ima be here working till the last day of the two weeks"" or is it literally just a heads up?

I ask this cause ideally i would like to use up at least all my vacay since i dont get paid out for it.

So I'm being offered the opportunity to jump from parent company to Subcontractor A... while holding the same job and title, just someone else handles the benefits and my paycheck. 


Doing this I'd get a massive bump in PTO - increasing from 17 days to 23 days. 

The downside to this is that the insurance with the other company is worse and if my calculations are close, I'd probably spend an additional $1200 with the company over the next year with my current medical conditions.


The other downside is that their 401(k) vests over two years. I'm going to be in the same position for at least another year, but I'm not sure after that and my current city is dragging on me a little bit. 


Overall it seems like a good move? Like, apart from the financial downside, which I can afford, it seems like I could use this as leverage when moving to another company in the future?"
1,2022-11-29,Don't have a Job title for a previous job at a company where there was only 2 people. What to put on a CV that will pass a background check? (UK),u/computerwind,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z82bfn/dont_have_a_job_title_for_a_previous_job_at_a/,jobs," A few years ago a friend and I started a small business in the UK. We were young and didn't really know what we were doing or how to start up a business. The business was registered as a limited company with my friend down as the Director. I signed a form as an employee so I could be formally a part of the business. We were the only two people in the company and we ran it together in equal part, in terms of labour and financial investment. It lasted a year then failed. Fortunately I had a second job which I'm still in years later.

I am not sure how to write about this in my CV. For the job I am now applying to I need to do a background check, so I want my CV to be easily provable. I don't know what to put as my job title. In effect, I ran the business together with my friend. However, I was not officially a Director. In fact, I'm not sure I ever even had a job title. We weren't self-employed either, as it was registered as a company and I as an employee. I never took a single paycheck as we were focussed on building the business up. 

If I write on my CV that I was a manager, would that make sense? Even if there were only two of us? If I had to prove it, how would I? 

I could just not mention it at all in my CV but its just about the only interesting thing on my CV , since I effectively ran a business for a year.

Historically speaking this hasn't gone well. 

Seven years ago I left an engineering position at a national lab to pursue a career in physics. This hasn't quite worked out for me. I lieu of this, over those several years I've applied to well over +1000 engineering positions. I can't get an accurate count, however it's probably somewhere in the range of 1500-2000 applications. Roughly speaking, most of those were part of two clusters: after graduate school, and recently after another attempt at graduate school. I've gotten nearly a dozen interviews with no luck. Strange thing is, 30% of those interviews have occurred over the past 2 months.

At this point I suspect my problem is unemployment &amp; underemployment, and indecision regarding my career. I have two bachelors, one in mechanical engineering and one in physics. I have a masters in applied physics. I did very well in all three programs. Lately, I was attempting a PhD in physics, but decided to withdrawal, since I felt after already having gone through 8 years of school, with an additional 5 years of running an experiment (to achieve the PhD) ahead of me, was too much. I simply cannot afford the time and low pay associated with getting a degree, which is probably not all it's cracked up to be. I'm not trying to impress anyone in a way that shouts: ""Look at me. Look how smart I am,"" but more like: ""Look at me, I do what interests me, I'm trying my best, and I work hard.""

In total I’ve spent 8 years of formal education, three years of engineering work, worked several flunky jobs, and in retrospect the job at the national lab was by far the best job I’ve ever had.

Hiring managers will always hold this against me. Engineers are not generous people, but I don't care about that. I can do the job, even if I'm a bit rusty at this point. I can get back up to speed in no time. Quitting my pursuit of my dream job, surrendering to a life of mediocre work and not living my best life is NOT an option. Full stop. I won't debate that here.

I'm mostly looking for experiences and reassurance here. 

I am graduating with a BSc in an agricultural sciences program at a respected university in mid May of 2023. GPA is above 3.5 

I started applying for jobs in June. I got to the third interview for the biggest company in my field (starts with ""B"" ands ends with ""er""). The hiring manager for this position called me after a month after the final interview and said that the ultimately went with another candidate because they needed someone to start ASAP, but that them and their hiring committee were really impressed with me and would love to hire me down the road within the company. This whole process took 4 months btw. The hiring manager gave me their work email and personal phone number and told me to contact them any time for questions related to career in the company and for internal manager references if I apply to the company in the future. A couple weeks ago I applied to the same position but that just opened up in a different location. Contacted the hiring manager and he gladly gave me a positive reference to the other hiring manager at that location. Got a phone interview a week ago. Still waiting to hear back. 

I also applied last week to a number of jobs within a company in my area like 10 days ago, heard back from one saying they're looking for other candidates :( but they'll keep my resume on file.

I have been working for a lab in my university since I was a freshman and working every summer at a big seed company. I literally have no gaps in my resume and my resume usually exactly matches the job description for an agricultural research associate/assistant since that's basically what I've been interning as for almost 4 years now. The company i interned for offered me a job for an opening in the past because they thought I was a senior (was a junior), but now they have no open positions :( 

My bosses at my university and internship also say I have a really good resume especially for someone my age in the field. 

But my question is: Then when do they hire me?? 😭

It seems like it's too early to apply now. But I've heard so many conflicting things on when to apply! Some people say a year from graduation, some people say 6 months before graduation, some people say 3-4 months before graduation, I've even heard 2 months before! What?! How long are hiring managers willing to wait for a new graduate?

My fear is that even though my resume and experience are competitive, there will be no suitable jobs by the time I ""should"" apply (recession time 😭) Please ease my anxiety lol, this whole experience is so mysterious right now and the future in this economy is so uncertain.

I'm speaking with a university career advisor Friday but this field is kinda niche so I'm not sure how helpful they'll be in this specific industry.

My biggest fear is not having a job lined up for graduation."

Tldr: I was laid off today, and change takes a toll on me

This picture I feel is very symbolic I feel. It shows a pair of lab goggles that I used to wear. Monday morning, I came into the lab to see my goggles broken right in the middle of the bridge, and the eye glass missing. I had theorized that someone had opened the door too hard and smashed my goggles. I was left disappointed and frustrated, but nothing would come to compare for what the next day had to offer.

Today, I was laid off, among many others. I was reaching upon a year at this company, and was finally beginning to feel comfortable. This was the best company I had worked for. Several months ago, I was diagnosed with adhd, and autism level 1. This really cemented what I had experienced throughout my life, all my struggles socially, and difficulties with executive dysfunction in school and the work place. I had two others jobs before this job, and those jobs caused me way more mental anguish.

The first year is the toughest for me at jobs, because even when I give it my best effort, it's sometimes not good enough. The amount of stress that it takes to interview, then get hired and trained can cause me to have many meltdowns and takes a toll on my mental health. Not only am I devastated because this is the best place I've worked for, but it was the best in regards to being autism friendly. I dread not being able to find a place as good. I'm scared of the toll it will take on my mental health to start the job hunting process all over again."

5,2022-11-29,what advice would you give to a college student: have a very specific idea of what kind of job / industry / company you want to end up in and relentless pursue that **OR** take any decent professional job and enjoy young adult life?,u/ReKang916,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z85r4r/what_advice_would_you_give_to_a_college_student/,jobs,"Mid-career, 36yo here. Not particularly passionate about my career, but fine with it for now.

I just had a college freshman from my alma mater reach out to me asking about how to get into certain types of jobs. 

I'm trying to figure out where I stand on the ""have a very narrow goal of what you want and relentlessly pursue that"" vs. ""take any sort of job and enjoy young adult life in a fun city"".

Let's say that you're someone with a marketing or data science or accounting degree and you really really want to work for a health food startup. Let's say that come graduation time spring of senior year 2023, you still don't have a job in a health food startup. You have a waiter job that pays enough to survive on, but now it's September after you've graduated college and you're still working as a waiter, with no good leads at a health food startup, or any kind of health food company for that matter.

at what point would you start interviewing at companies that don't interest you at all, like your local highway authority or a steel company or a farm products company? how long would you wait? and let's say you've waited 'til October after graduation and now every company is already actively recruiting the class of 2024 and don't really have much interest in interviewing someone from the class of 2023 that doesn't have any full-time professional work experience? 

of course, a common refrain is, 'take any sort of professional job, learn the skills, and then switch to what you want a couple of years later'. and that's fine in theory. but in many cases, if you're interviewing at a health food startup 2-3 years later with some work experience under your belt and you say, ""I've always wanted to work at a health food startup"", they might say (or wonder), ""Well, if you always wanted to work at a health food startup, why haven't you done that yet?"" they might give preference to the fellow 25yo that already has a couple of years experience in the health food space.

so, in your opinion, where's the line? how far do you push hoping to get one sort of job / company / industry before settling for whatever else is out there? 

and what would you say to a college freshman: have a **very specific** idea of what sort of job / industry / company you want to work for when applying for internships OR take whatever opportunities come up along the way?"

I did not go back into the classroom this fall and am currently working in a biochem lab while searching for an engineering position.

I know biomedical engineering is not the most  marketable engineering major and stepping away from engineering to go into education has made me even less marketable. I've been looking for general engineering entry level positions but overwhelming get passed over. What can I do to help get an entry level position? I've started studying for an EIT in the meantime, but are there other certifications that would help make me more applicable as well? Would finishing up the math education master's be worthwhile? (I'll finish it as some point so it's not a total waste but would it help in the short term just to have a masters?)"
1,2022-11-29,[UK] Satisfactory Reference?,u/Pretty-Dependent-844,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z85vaq/uk_satisfactory_reference/,jobs," Hello,

I'm delighted to have been offered something of a dream job, on the condition of ""satisfactory references (one of which should be your current or most recent employer)"".

My existing company (and the only one I have ever worked) has a policy where only a very basic reference can be given. It's the only company I've ever worked for, so there isn't really any other professionals I can ask. Will this be considered satisfactory? I believe the only information they give is Name, dates of service and job title.

If needed I could reach out to others (for instance I acted on the Parish Council for my village for a while and could ask the council head for a reference too), or should I just give them the details to my existing company's HR department and hope it is enough?

From the way they said 'one of which' it makes me think they might be looking for more than one, and one basic might not be enough? But I know the policy at the only company I've ever worked will only give the basic, via HR.

Thanks

After initially trying to find a job within my field (data analytics) i found out that i was pretty much lacking in the skills that companies were looking for (essentially knowledge of every single coding/programming language). After feeling the pressure and anxiety of being unemployed, I began to branch out into other fields in hopes of getting a job. 

Months passed filled with hundreds of applications and it still seemed like i couldnt even get jobs that i felt overqualified for. I was receiving pressure from my parents to join the military which was something i was not willing to do. I remained patient and one day i applied to a company for a customer representative position. The company then said they would like to interview me for software automation role. After numerous interviews and rounds of assessments, i was offered the job! Its like the role was meant for me and i cant be more excited to start! It also helps that the salary was the highest among all i applied for!

Moral of the story: you can get 1000 no’s, all it takes is 1 yes"

I had an interview with job A today. They are hoping to make a decision within a few days.

I have an interview with job B in a week.

This is all hypothetical at this point, but I like to be prepared. 

Job A pays $28 per hour. Job B pays $20 per hour.

I would, hands down, prefer job Bs work. Both have room for growth and good benefits and are the same hours. Job B offers a hybrid WFH/in office schedule and is hiring for 2 people. Job A is looking for one candidate. Both jobs are applicable to my degree (accounting) in some aspects, but job A has other aspects to it, such as customer service, while job B is all accounting work.

There's obviously no guarantee I'll get an offer for either. But, hypothetically, what do I do if I get an offer for job A, without knowing if job B will pan out?

The only things stopping me from leaving: work is my social life, the work is mindless and 'easy' so leaving would make me feel guilty and I don't have much savings (but I live rent free at home so the money would last years).

In my experience, getting in touch with recruiters who look for your skill is the most important part to getting your foot in the door. Here are a few things you can do to get in front of those recruiters.

1. If you're in college, go to every on-campus networking event when companies are on campus. Getting a job through interning is by far the easiest path.
2. Make sure your Linkedin headline has the job title that your target recruiter is searching for. If you want engineering recruiters, add “software engineer” in your headline. This will help them come to you when they search keywords.
3. Put together a list of companies you want to work at then go on LinkedIn and add recruiters or titled “Talent acquisition”. Send them a note with also the link to the job role you want to apply to. You may eventually need LinkedIn premium for this
4. Email is still a very effective way to communicate with recruiters. You can look up pretty much anyone’s email nowadays with products like Rocketreach\[.\]io. Look up recruiters on that platform and get their emails and send them a note expressing interest in specific job opportunities with the link. Use Streak’s google plugin to see when they open the email. Follow up after a few days if they don’t respond."

They would like me to come back to work at the school. 
I was laid off due to Covid 19 which was not fault of mine or some others. Applied for unemployment. I didn’t leave the job by choice and they couldn’t offer me a job when I asked last year. I had to look for anothee job. She said they thought me focusing on my classes would be the best (I’m a part time college student) and said they should have asked me to come back a long time ago. 
I was actually thrilled when she said they want me to come back, but at the same time I do like the job I currently work at which is an autism school (K-12th). I’ve been working there for a year now. I currently work with kindergarten. It’s challenging but I do enjoy working with those kids and have an amazing team. 
If I do choose to go back to work at my old job, I would start in January. I used to attend that school as a child and it’s a great program. 
It’s a really tough choice I have to make so they’ve given me about two to three weeks notice to make a decision if I want to go back there. I’m at current job we do have paid time off, paid sick leave and benefits but don’t pay for break or vacations. It’s 20-25 minutes from my house. At my former job, they have the same thing only they do pay for breaks and vacations at least that’s what I was told and I would get paid more. It’s about 10-15 minutes away from my house and it would be nice to have a job close to where I live again. No they are men and my coworkers don’t know yet and I’m not gonna tell them, but eventually I will tell them as I get more information and make a decision. My former boss and I will talk more about it later this week. I haven’t made a decision yet and I’m going to think about it. 
Have y’all been in that situation?"

About a year ago I referred my friend to an open position in my department at a small org. I thought they would be a great fit, but I would be their direct supervisor. We had worked together previously at a different job, but we were on the same level. I was very honest about their shortcomings to the rest of my team before bringing them on, but they were still the best person for the role at the time so we hired them. Pretty quickly after they started, they showed that they were a pretty slow worker and didn't always follow through on tasks. They never even finished an important training that should have been done within the first two weeks and now it's been a year...the higher ups never really forgave them for that.

We are a very small team of 4, and my friend can be very emotional in the workplace. They've thrown a few tantrums about low pay in front of our director and tend to spend a lot of time socializing and complaining. There are aspects of their job they do really well, but they just can't ever seem to keep up with workflow and always seem to have an attitude about something.

They've made some comments to me over the course of the year that just haven't sat well. Saying things like they ""feel like they do my job"" or ""are better than this position"" or that they ""just don't care about anything work related anymore."" That all may be true and that's fine! But within a working relationship it feels highly unprofessional to communicate to your manager that way during work meetings. We have mutually agreed that it's probably time for them to move on sometime soon, but lately they've been frantic about losing this job and want to do better.

 I personally really like my job and have a good relationship with my managers. I generally feel respected and liked by them. The issue is that my friend is making my job a lot more difficult and I've become the middle man between upper management and my friend because no one is happy with their work or their attitude, but I have to be the one to communicate it to them. I've tried explaining this to my friend, and they seem to understand, but I'm afraid the damage has been done. Higher ups are talking about firing them, and I'm not sure how much I should communicate to my friend about this. I feel like I'm constantly walking the line between trying to do well at my job and being a good friend, but I just can't do both and I'm exhausted. Honestly I think it would be best for everyone if they left because they clearly aren't happy and the rest of the team is suffering.

Do you think I should warn my friend that they might get fired? How much should I communicate to them at this point? I feel like I've given them enough warnings about their performance so it shouldn't be a huge surprise, but I feel really guilty about it. What would you guys do in this situation? Thanks so much!!"

Now, I am taking over the team as the new manager and it’s my job to clean up the mess that the other managers created.

My teammates are feeling abandoned, unmotivated, unsupported, and don’t feel they have a voice.

If you were in this situation, or if you ARE in this situation, and you had a new manager that wanted to make it right. What would you say to them? What do you feel you would need from them? 

Also, do you have any advice for me when it comes to taking over a team of people who have felt this way and wanting to genuinely make things right? 

My goal is to prevent this group of people from feeling the way a lot of you end up feeling from your managers on this sub. I have the chance to make a difference with these people."
2,2022-11-29,Wrongful termination by supervisor who previously hurt employee?,u/burneralderson,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z8hapk/wrongful_termination_by_supervisor_who_previously/,jobs,"To make it easier, the chain of command at my office is in two branches. Construction crew answers to foreman, who answers to director, who answers to CEO. The other branch (me) answers directly to our director. 

This week, someone I work with (let’s call him David) at my company who is a crew member was fired for “unsatisfactory work” by the foreman. It happened as soon as David walked in. He was asked to sit down and the foreman along with the director told him he was being fired. They then wrote everything down on piece of printer paper with pen. It’s half illegible. Both the foreman and director signed it. 

What’s weird about this is two things. First, I overheard our director speaking with our CEO as the CEO expressed interest in wanting to pay all employees less. Her exact words I recall were, “The standard for living is much smaller at your location, so it’s nothing to feel bad about.” That stuck with me, seeing as we’re supposed to provide service to a relatively poor community. 

The other thing is actually a collection of incidents in which the foreman seemed more at fault than David. For instance, there was a day on a hot worksite when the foreman left across the county for the day, taking David’s lunch and water. David dehydrated and had to rely on a local for water. On another instance, David expressed the danger of floor joists beneath a floor. The foreman cut them and David collapsed through the floor, landing on his shoulder, which is thankfully fine. And, of course, the multiple occasions where I’ve watched the foreman scold David for constructing something one way, then shrinking when our director informs David his way is actually correct. 

As far as the foreman goes, I do believe he’s not as competent as he seems. He’s also rather rude. He hasn’t spoken a word to me in over a month despite having to hand me logs daily. He also has on two occasions pushed past me, bumping my shoulder when I’m standing out of the way in front of a filing cabinet. Not a friendly person, to say the least. 

I’m concerned for David, considering this is so close to the holidays. I’m also worried because I’ve been asked to speak with my director tomorrow. 

Is this legal what’s been done?"

My issue with my current job (Starbucks barista) is that it’s incredibly fast paced and there’s a lot of pressure for me to memorize recipes quickly. Since I’m seasonal, it has been difficult to train and memorize when the store’s always packed and I have coworkers/supervisors just shoving me off to do cleaning so that they can charge of making drinks.

Basically, I’m looking for a job that isn’t super fast paced or will be more understanding of my memory problems.

I have experience with customer service, childcare, cleaning, and being a closing cashier. I could really use some advice or recommendations because my current job has me very mentally drained and I’m not sure how much longer I can handle it :("

I’ve been with this company for 3 months. My department has undergone a restructuring which means that I’m now automatically promoted into a people manager role with 3 direct reports. I’m also going to be managing 2 products instead of 1. 

While I was surprised by this change to role and a little nervous (I’m taking on a LOT more work) I was excited for the pay rise. I was expecting ~10-15%.

I talked to my manager today and they’ve offered me a 4% raise which barely affects my pay after tax. 

I’m not happy with this and think such a small increase is not fair given the huge increase in my responsibilities. 

Plus I’ve never wanted to manage people and I’m dreading having to support 3 people’s careers. 

I’m tempted to say no to the promotion but they would likely just fire me?"

2,2022-11-30,Community service/Charitable employment,u/Coldsteelandmtndew,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z8lrsh/community_servicecharitable_employment/,jobs,"Hello. For privacies sake, I will be omitting some personal details.

I am currently 21 years old, and i’m based not terribly far from Washington, DC. I’ve been in community service as a hobby with a parent since Middle School, and it’s only snowballed from there to include actively volunteering my time raising money and awareness for various charities as one of my newer hobbies. My current minimum wage job involves food service, and i’ve been in for about a years time as of this post. This is my first and current employment, though since I was a kid i’ve done odd jobs here and there around the home for a relative or two. 

Over the years, I have grown to realize that community service, really just doing my modest part to make some positive impact in my community and others (My relevant hobbies have me do light traveling sometimes) is something of a passion and a calling for me.

I will admit, I am somewhat cynical and mistrusting of large, international charities, and would prefer to work for a more local, community based organization where my blue collar work directly benefits those in need of this organizations services. At the end of the day, I want to know full well that my work actively helped or will inevitably helped someone in need. Another personal motivation would be that I have a friend who was previously homeless, and I personally witnessed how such a horrid state of affairs screwed him mentally, psychologically, financially, and how it directly impacted my circle of friends, all of whom were really the only ones consistently backing him up. He’s got his own place now, and i’m deeply proud of him for doing what he could to lift himself out of such unfortunate circumstances, and for becoming a better, more honest person despite his various challenges. I would especially love to help young adults like my dear friend, though I admit I lack the qualifications and patience to be a therapist, and probably a social worker to a certain extent. Can’t say i’m a fan of colleges either. I am also open to relevant organizations near me that work with refugees. 

While I admit I don’t know the exact details of what I want yet, I believe I have a few key points in mind. 

Whatever it may entail, I would prefer a blue collar job that involves:

Charitable, Life Saving, Community Service, or otherwise positively and directly impactful work.

Primarily blue collar day to day work, though since I have notable hobby relates experience in doing so, i’d have absolutely no problems being am exhibitor at the occasional convention and doing what I can for fundraisers. 

Something within Northern Virginia or D.C

Something where i’m on my feet and moving most of the time.

That’s all I have to say. I’d love to hear comments and suggestions, look forward to hearing from you all. I do apologize if my post technically violates the rules here, really, i’m just looking for feedback, constructive dialogue, and stories from people with similar experiences to myself."

3,2022-11-30,Am I undervaluing myself?,u/BigJ1230,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z8qgvs/am_i_undervaluing_myself/,jobs,"1st off thanks in advance for taking the time to read this long post, to give me help, advice and respond back! Which you need to understand the back story in order to understand my situation, which is job related.

So my mother passed away in November of 96 when I was 6 of ovarian cancer. Then I lost my father in December of 2021 and I did lose other family members throughout the years before my father passed away as well. When my dad passed away I was working for him for the past 2 years. I was a caregiver to him because he was getting sick and I also worked for his law firm as he was a very busy well-known criminal attorney that needed help. 

Which when my dad passed away, I was living with him and I needed to sell/get rid of all the high-end antique furniture that we had in the house and put some of the stuff in storage for me. Also from my dad's side, I don't have any other family whatsoever and I only have my mother's family that's from and lives in the state of Pennsylvania. So I had to relocate from Florida to Pennsylvania and live with some of my family because of my dad's passing and the fact that he left me in a really bad living/financial position.

With that being said, I do have other work experience like at least 2 years of restaurant server experience, 4 years on and off of food deliveries (DoorDash, Uber Eats), 4 years of being a chauffeur (Lyft, Uber and a personal chauffeur for my dad), 6-7 years of small business retail sales, 2 years of personal assistant for a prominent local attorney and 2 years of caregiving services. 

Then when I came to Pennsylvania I just immediately started doing food deliveries again for DoorDash and UberEats. Which some of you may know that this is not a good steady income as there's taxes, gas, wear and tear on the vehicle and the fact that the amount of money you make for the same amount of hours each day varies (including days that you'll make no money and or you get no orders at all in a very very long time so you just call it a day). Which having this type of income is not the way to live my life and so I was looking for other jobs since I came up here in April. So far for a lot of jobs that I applied to, I got absolutely no callbacks and the ones that I had callbacks from and or interviews with denied me the job. Also, since I've been up here, one of my aunts (mom's sisters) kept telling me to apply to this big local high-end grocery store chain that she knows the owner/a lot of people at the company well and she also works part-time for them being a banquet server/bartender at events (they do full private catering). So for a while they gave up on me applying to that specific company, but they see that I'm not getting a job elsewhere and the fact that a lot of days lately I'm not able to get in to do food deliveries (if you want to know why, feel free to ask, which this is a known thing within the gig job economy).

Now in the past few weeks, my family has been pushing me to apply to this local high-end grocery store chain again. So last weekend I ended up applying for numerous jobs for this company. Then on Monday I get a call back and they told me that they wanted me to be a dishwasher at their headquarters office where they prep for the catering jobs and they prepare all they already made foods to be delivered to the store locations, but I'm only making $14 an hour 5 days a week with majority of the of all Sundays and all major holidays off (some weeks leading up to Thanksgiving and Christmas I need to work 7 days a week, but then I get the holiday off). Also I did apply to be a cheese specialist, a deli associate and sales at specific locations, but I never got a call back/herd any interest from them about those positions (which according to their website all the positions that I've applied for has been posted for at least 21 days or more without being filled). 

Yesterday (Tuesday) I went in for a job interview. Which honestly it seemed like they were desperate to hire somebody for this dishwashing position, then within a quick few minutes they instantly hired me on the spot. I brought my resume with me reflecting all the job experiences that I mentioned in the other paragraph. Then without being rude and direct about it, I brought up my work history/work skills to let them know that I'm basically overqualified to be doing a corporate dishwashing job and they didn't seem to care or have any interest in that. Which I knew I was coming in strictly for this dishwashing job and I should have denied coming in and then if I did go in deny taking taking the job when I was there. Also maybe I should've pushed more to try to get another position/job within the company rather than this BS dishwashing job that just makes me extremely anxious (to the point that my whole body trembles) and depressed. I mean at least if I'm going to get paid that type of BS money, then I at least want to do something that I enjoy doing. Rather than just taking/doing this job just to please my family, while being extremely miserable every single day! 

So with the experience that I have, am I undervaluing myself by taking this dishwasher job? Maybe I should just take this job until I find a better job? Also should I just not show up to the dishwashing job (even if I called to let them know) and just continue doing the delivery gig at least until I find a better stable job then this dishwashing job? 

Which on top of all this feeling very down/depressed with myself because I feel like I'm a loser and I'm embarrassed with/at myself that I have to do/I can only get offered this type of job at 32 years old (which I'm going to be 33 in January). So Honestly I'm extremely lost here and don't know what to do and any other help and advice again would be greatly appreciated!"

My direct manager was in touch last week considering some practical matters, and we agreed that I show up at 9AM. They said they also expect to be able to send my onboarding plan to me this week before I start. Last night I emailed the manager just to check in if they still except to send it before tomorrow, and ended the email with ”see you tomorrow at 9AM”

Now it’s end of day in a couple of hours and have not gotten a reply. I also emailed HR admin in the morning with a practical question regarding my company phone. Also nothing. 

So now I’ve gotten myself convinced that they are going to cancel my employment, even though that is probably not the most probable explanation. And I’m in a country where the employment laws a stricter and if they would cancel now they would have to pay me for 2 weeks. 

But even still I am pretty much panicking. In the past years my career has more or less been emotional trauma and toxic environments. 

I naturally will show up as agreed tomorrow, but I hate having this feeling just the day before."

Having been there for not long over a year, our recruitment (amount of people interviewed) to hiring ratio is almost 0. We've fired two recently. This is possibly due to recruits not wanting to teach certain age groups / courses / certain days etc. Or (and I suspect this is the real reason) they don't want to deal with the amount of behind the scenes work required.

We have no benefits either.

I've worked in seriously sketchy, dodgy places, including one place that had to be threatened with legal action to pay me. Even then, they didn't have the recruitment issues that my current workplace does. I've worked somewhere where everyone literally did the same thing day in day out and the longest serving employees had been there for over 20 years.

It's insane that we can't keep / attract people to the point where no one replaces those leaving.

We are desperately, atrociously understaffed."

0,2022-11-30,I think my new job was a mistake - should I stick it out or go back to my old job?,u/Maximum-Peach2911,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z8v2xy/i_think_my_new_job_was_a_mistake_should_i_stick/,jobs,"For some context: 
I left my previous job in May, I'd been with that company for over 5 years and in that time had been promoted a few times and become a bit of a 'big fish' within the company (won international awards, spoke at conferences around the country, etc.). I decided to leave that job in Feburary and finally left in May for a few reasons:
- That company had a relatively limited remit within my field and I wanted to get broader experience
- bullying issues with my immediate manager

-wanting to know if I could do more/have a greater challenge

However, I'd developed a proprietary toolkit and area of expertise within that company which I had to leave behind when I left. When I left that company I was approached by my team leader, the divisional leader and one of the international directors of the company asking me to stay, offering counter-offers, asking if I would like to transfer internally and letting me know that the 'door is always' open. The divisional director in particular asked me to keep in touch and said he would do whatever he could to make sure I could always come back. He said that he had flagged me as a future leader in the company. 

I left to join our main competitior and moved halfway across the country to work in their flagship headquarters. My new company is incredibly well-renowned in my industry and I'd always aspired to work for them.

Well, fast forward about 6 months and I think this was a mistake. 

-Turns out that the broader experience I was looking for within my industry is actually not what I'm good at or interested in. I've worked on a range of projects now and felt completely out of my depth (which is understandable) but I also really didn't enjoy those projects or want to go down those various 'roads' of specialism. The more I learn about my wider industry the more I realise that I'd like to specialise in my niche area which I started developing in my previous company. 
-I went from being a 'big fish' in my company to a very small fish in a company with a lot of very big egos. While this is always inevitable to an extent, I worry that I lost that opportunity to be seen as a 'future leader'. I've also lost a lot of the recognition that brought with it the opportunities to speak at conferences, write research, do external events and enter awards competitions. 
- The new job doesn't pay as much as I was orignally led to believe and if I went back to my older company I might be able to go up a level in the process (when I was leaving my previous company they offered a promotion as a counter-offer). I don't feel like a promotion is in my immediate future at my current job (which is frustrating). 
- I feel very much like I'm being pushed down a managerial track in my current role and that there isn't a clear pathway to being a technical specialist here, especially not in my niche area of interest which this company doesn't prioritise or have a great team for. I’ve raised this with my manager who wasn’t particularly encouraging and said that they’re not planning to grow their offering in that area and I should try to focus on something else. 
- The work-life-balance at this new company is signficantly worse than my previous one and the workload is very overwhelming. There are regular long nights and very early starts. I usually wouldn't mind this if I was working on a project I was interested in or towards a goal I felt passionate about, but as it stands I feel really burnt out and discouraged. 

So my question is: Should I wait it out a bit longer at my new job or should I try to go back to my previous company? I’ve learned loads in this new role and have gained really good experience and insight regardless of where I end up. I’m worried about the optics of changing jobs again so soon within 1 year, but also wonder if there’s a benefit to going back to my older company sooner rather than later if I’m sure that’s what I want to do. 

Any feedback is very welcome!"

I told the talent recruiter that late in the week and she said it would be difficult to have a formal update before the weekend, which I understood.

So Monday, she emails me saying that she should have an update by tomorrow and asked what times I will be available for a phone call the next day. I let her know my availability but didn't hear back. I followed up late the next day to which she then replies back apologizing for the delay and says she will get back as soon as possible. I am really unsure of what will happen and wanted some help if anyone could speculate on what this means.

2,2022-11-30,Career Change Crossroads,u/tealdan,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z8x7xs/career_change_crossroads/,jobs,"**Context:** For the last decade I have been honing my craft as a filmmaker.  Having cut my teeth as a sound designer/composer, I now have experience writing, directing, producing, graphic design and everything post-production. It's not my most frictionless creative outlet, as it requires a lot of competitiveness, hustle, and attention to detail, and tons of screen time (bleh). So, I find myself procrastinating or distracted when I'm working on advertising or corporate internal content. Ideally, I would approach the medium as a writer/director of both narrative and documentary films... but that takes expendable income or investors. I have a liberal arts degree. I'm a musician and designer. I like using my hands to build. And Myers-Briggs says I'm best suited for outdoors.

**More Context:** My wife and I own a neighborhood bar and venue. 5 years ago this started as my DIY project and has since graduated into a business as the surrounding neighborhood gentrified and the city grew. I have no experience running a bar/venue, so there's *always* a learning curve. While it's a really small business with low overhead, there are only 2 revenue streams: food &amp; beverage sales, and private rentals. Owners aren't taking dividends yet, but we're still investing 10-15hr/week collectively with 2-3 employees running the front and back-of-house ops. \*The third stream I aim to grow is via YouTube monetization of artists' live performances distributed as both Video and Audio content. Not a unique model, but it has viable potential to be enriching to both local/virtual communities (royalties and exposure) or businesses (advertising). To sum, monetary profit is almost nonexistent, but I am gaining experience and network even if the business growth is really slow and steady. I do not plan to sell my share, so I have acknowledged this will always be some added stress. That's par for the course. 

**The dilemma:** My wife and I also have a toddler. We both work irregular ind. contract jobs since the pandemic, but financial struggles are almost weekly. Ultimately, we both need reliable paychecks, but with the kiddo, one of us might should remain flexible.. so I feel motivated to bring home the consistent income. Overall, for the last two years, I sense that I need to hone a new trade/skill. But I've reached an impasse because I have offers for 2 paths to follow. 

1. Joining a landscaping start-up that focuses on ""re-wilding"" through invasive removal and planting native species - *Pros:* Get's me outside, pays $30/hr, it's flexible so I could still take infrequent video production jobs (good $), and I get to learn a lot. Long term, I see the convergence of botany/mycology with landscape design. In my opinion, this is a bourgeoning industry and anticipate an expert in this field will be in demand. *Cons:* it's owned by my friend; despite the demand it's still an unproven business model; I work when I'm available but only as a 1099 contract worker; it's majority grunt work until I become certified/expertise: and rainy days have to be filled with other work. 
2. Joining a construction company that focuses on high end carpentry (from framing to detailed finish work like crown molding, etc.) - I've always been handy, an amateur woodworker, but I lack the knowledge of the trade. This would get me on a 7:30a-4p M-F routine, starts at $20/hr, and it's W-2. *Pros* I'd be learning how to design and build from concept to completion. I'd be learning a valuable trade that I could parle into general contracting and design builds. They mentioned potential for designing jobs (which could supplement income). Rainy days I'd be in a wood shop prefab'ing. *Cons:* At 32 years old, taking 20/hr is a drop. I'd lose all flexibility to take infrequent video production gigs making $50-60/hr; it sometimes contributes to deforestation and habitat disruption. 

These options *seem* equally weighted with pros/cons, and I do plan on creating a prioritization matrix. Are there any folks out there who have been in this career change dilemma before? Are there any folks who have insight into longterm relevance of industries I've posited here? Are there any resources besides Google I can reference to learn about potentials in either industry? Thanks."

I do apologize in advance if anyone finds my title offensive, I don't actually know if 'career dysmorphia' is a thing.  

I (M25) have been at my current job for close to 2.5 years.  I work in the clinical laboratory space and it seems like a good fit for my strengths.  Recently I have been having this absolute feeling of just constant dread at work.  I feel like my career is not where it is supposed to be.  I constantly find myself pouring over Reddit threads and LinkedIn profiles comparing my current situation to others with similar backgrounds and just getting so depressed about myself.  I have been applying to jobs but when I get a rejection it just pushes me deeper into that hole of 'im not good enough' or 'did I just ruin my whole career path doing this'.  I realize most of this is probably unreasonable but was just hoping for some advice or success stories from others to give me hope that my life is going to turn out okay lol.

PSA: I considered this 'dysmorphia' bc I am constantly comparing my career to others and thinking 'omg why can't I be in that position or get the same opportunities as others' and I am sorry again if maybe that is not the best way to describe it."

Not sure if this is the correct subreddit to post on, but I’m just hoping and looking for advice, feedback, personal experience stories, etc.

I have a total of 3 years of post grad work experience. I’ve been working as a QA Engineer for over 1.5 years at my company. Pay isn’t terrible, but it isn’t great. I know I can find better pay somewhere else because I have been searching and interviewing at other companies for over 7 months. So I have an idea of how much money I’m missing out on. 

I either get rejected immediately or make it far into the interviewing process, but fall short of getting an offer or reaching the final round. 

Ideally I wanted to gain more experience with automation and gradually work my way into an SDET role or even a SWE role at some point, but I just can’t seem to get my foot in the door at a new company. 

Have you guys shared this same experience where it feels like you’re never going to leave your current company? I’m definitely going to continue to apply, but morale and hopes are diminishing quickly. Not sure what to do. Maybe just nose dive into learning software engineering and apply to those type of roles after a few months of OOP, DS, Algorithms and leet code?

My prior interviews have always been get to know me, skills, experiences, etc. and then if they want to hire, they'll give the offer number–– I know some folks like to get the number upfront (myself included) so that we don't waste our time on low salary offers but it gives me mixed feelings when I haven't even been asked about my work experience/etc.

It's been over a year, and I did not think it would be this hard. I graduated during the pandemic, and my college experience was pretty much shitty (both work and school because of the pandemic). Internships weren't available as business was down, and I ended up getting an internship/working in healthcare as that was pretty much the only thing available. Working in healthcare during the pandemic was definitely a challenge as I was on the frontlines on the pandemic while a full time college student. Going into this job search, I feel like many companies are not looking at me based on my experience because it's in healthcare and I don't have first hand experience working at an agency; plus this job market is tough right now with so much competition for entry level roles.  Does anyone have advice on what I could add to my resume to make myself more marketable? I thought about adding some of the big research projects I did in some of my classes as I can relate them more into what I want to go into. If anyone could give me any advice, I would appreciate it. Getting your foot through the door and starting your career has been harder than I could ever imagine."

1126,2022-11-30,I am an experienced resume writer and editor and wanted to share some pointers on how to best format your resume,u/holly948,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z90g0x/i_am_an_experienced_resume_writer_and_editor_and/,jobs,"I am an experienced resume writer and editor and wanted to share some pointers on how to format your resume to make it look the best it can!

***DISCLAIMER: Many of these tips are North America specific,*** ***and some/many don't apply to creative fields like designers/marketing resumes.*** *Also some of these are for people working in the corporate world and don't apply to food service or retail jobs. Of course, some of these won't apply to you specifically, so use your common sense to take what is useful to you.*

**THESE ARE MY TOP TIPS FOR FORMATTING RESUMES:**

* **Make sure EVERYTHING is uniform**. If most of your dates are 3 letters only and then a period, like Jun. 2016 - Oct. 2020, then they ALL need to be the same. Yes, even the month of May with only 3 letters. It looks much neater. May. 2020 - Apr. 2022. Ensure you double check the spacing is correct too, for example, the most common error I see on resumes is some dates having a space and then a hyphen, and then no space before the next date (example Jan. 2019 -Oct. 2020 and then Feb. 2020-Feb. 2022, then Feb. 2022 - Present) - this is a very small issue, but it shows you do not have attention to detail. Whichever format you choose for one, ensure they ALL follow the same format. Also double check is something is bolded, or underlined (like a title or date or company name), ensure that all the others are in the same format.
* Speaking of formatting, **ensure all line breaks are the same size**. If one blank line in between 2 paragraphs is size 7, and then the next blank line between paragraphs is size 11, it's a very noticeable detail to those looking at your resume. If your job requires attention to detail, or you state that you are skilled in that, then don't make this simple mistake.
* **For your paragraphs and bullet points, use the ""justify"" align**. It removes a bit of the white space and brings your text fully to the right of the page. It's much neater and removes the jagged look of left align.
* **DON'T WASTE AN ENTIRE LINE!** I often see people when writing their bullet points taking up less than half a line, or only a couple of words on the 2nd or 3rd line. Not only does this create a lot of white space, but it's also selling yourself short. You have one, maybe two pages to sell the sh!t out of yourself. Make every single line of your page count. Make sure every single line of your bullet points is at least halfway across the page or more.
* Need to find extra space on your resume? **Use narrow margins.** Unless you're in senior management, your resume (for North American applicants anyway) should be one page ideally, two pages max if you have over 10 years of RELEVANT experience.
* 5 bullet points max per job (of course there are exceptions, but this is as a general rule). The older the job, the less bullet points. A job from 10 years ago will only require 1-3 bullet points (and only if it's relevant to your current career - really think if you need to include it on your resume - remember, all your jobs are on LinkedIn, not everything needs to go on your resume - again, North American advice).
* **Use a different verb at the start of each bullet point.** I roll my eyes when I see the same word repeated multiple times as the first word in bullet points. Instead of just using the word managed, use words like Coordinated / Directed / Orchestrated / Oversaw / Spearheaded. There's a great article with 185 resume verbs written by the Muse - a quick google search will bring it up.
* **DO NOT USE COLUMNS** (unless you're in a creative field like a designer) - Columns do not play nicely with ATS (AI resume reading software) and as the majority of companies now rely on ATS to quickly read resumes, you're shooting yourself in the foot by using columns or any other weird formatting.
* **Put your technical/software/program skills in one line**, separated by commas or | lines | like | these. Putting a single skill on each line is a waste of space, and will create too much white space. Your resume should be concise, to the point and get everything across in as little space as possible.
* Each bullet point should not be paragraphs long. Each bullet point should be 1-2 lines long only on the page, 3 maximum.
* Each job should take up no more than 1/4 of the page, unless you've only had one or two jobs, or are more senior. Or in another unit of measurement, no more than 11 or 12 lines of the page. The more recent the role, and the more impressive the tasks, the more bullet points there should be, but don't just include the job description which leads me onto my next point...
* Reiterating that each job should only include the achievements from that job, and only the most impressive things you achieved should be listed. Include KPIs, processes you implemented, articles you wrote, dollar amounts of your biggest sales or averages, include numbers of accounts you managed, or how many calls you took each day, if you went over your OTE what was the percentage, etc. It shouldn't read as a job description, you need to sell yourself and show them what you're capable of! (disclaimer - unless your jobs are more entry level or food service etc, then job descriptions are likely the norm).
* **Contact details** \- at the top when of your resume under or next to your name, you need to include the following things: your location (if you're willing to relocate to the area the job is in, put the jobs city in and not your current location) email address, and your LinkedIn profile. Phone number isn't essential, so include it or don't, it's fine. Other optional things to include - if you have a portfolio or GitHub, definitely include them. Don't paste them as a messy link, instead write ""GitHub"" and turn it into a hyperlink. **DO NOT INCLUDE YOUR FULL ADDRESS IF YOU'RE IN NORTH AMERICA** \- only include your City and State/Province. Again, if you're in San Francisco for example but you're applying to jobs in New York because you're moving there, edit your city to New York instead, and then address it in the interview if they ask.
* **Contact details (what not to include)** \- don't include the word PHONE before your phone number, or EMAIL before your email address. They are redundant. People know what a phone and email look like. You're just taking up space for no reason. Also don't include your social media accounts except for LinkedIn (unless they are professional accounts for marketing/design/media positions of course, etc.)
* **LinkedIn link and info:** Make sure your LinkedIn profile link is customized. You can get a custom LinkedIn link from your LinkedIn profile on the right hand side at the top right, click on ""Edit public profile and URL"". Make sure your custom LI link includes your name and not just a bunch of random numbers. Be creative. Are you a John Smith and you're located in Texas? Maybe your custom link could be smith.john.tx or johnsmith.tx, or include your middle initial. Play around with it until you get the perfect LI custom link. When including your LinkedIn link on your profile, instead of including the whole URL, only include the last bit (for example, **in/johnsmith**) - and lastly, make sure you include the hyperlink on your resume so that people can click it while viewing your resume.
* **ALWAYS SEND YOUR RESUME AS A PDF DOCUMENT!!!!!!** If you send it through as a Word document, their computer could mess with the formatting and it could ruin the perfect look of your resume. PDF will ensure they view it exactly how you want it to look.
* **Try to have your dates on the right hand side of the page, and your position and company on the left.** It's the standard, and makes the person reading your resume find the info much more quickly. Trying to make your resume too unique (again, unless you have a creative job then ignore this) will only hurt your chances of it being taken seriously. Of course you want to make it look nice, but try to follow the standard format where possible so it's easy to read.
* **Don't use the ""slider"" scales for your proficiency in various skills.** Why? Well, firstly, if the hiring manager wants to know your level in each, they will ask. And secondly, the dots or slider scales aren't measurable and take up extra wasted space that again is not going work well with ATS. Instead, as I mentioned above, list your skills and programs/software etc. in a line separated by commas | or | these | lines. Don't include software that you used 10 years ago and never progressed past a beginner level, but list pretty much everything else within reason. Most things you'll pick back up quickly even if it was 5 years ago, provided you were semi-decent with your knowledge of it.
* **Interests - should you add them or not?** It's a highly debated topic and everyone will have a different view on this. I personally believe that you should include them. For example, I ride motorcycles and love stand up comedy shows, am coffee obsessed and love my local lacrosse team. Almost every single interview I land, my interests are brought up, with the interviewer connecting with one or more of my interests, or asking me more about them. It's a great conversation starter, and it makes you more than just an applicant, they will remember you as the person who they discussed their favourite sports team with, or the person who recommended them an amazing cafe that they've now added to their list. INTERESTS WILL MAKE YOU STAND OUT, I guarantee it. **Obviously, it can be negative depending on what you write, so be REALLY selective of what you include in your interests** (for example, don't include things like Anime or Manga, or the shooting range, or reading Holocaust novels, or your weapons collection, or anything political or religious, or anything you don't want to discuss during an interview - KEEP IT LIGHTHEARTED). I would make your interests 1 or 2 lines maximum on your resume, and don't go into detail (just list them out - for example, my interests on my resume are listed as ""Interests: Motorcycles, Warriors lacrosse, console and PC games, comedy shows, arcades, &amp; searching for the perfect espresso."") So basically, include them if you want, but if you do include them, make sure they aren't negative or controversial topics if it's brought up in an interview.
* **Order of resume:** If you HAVE had relevant experience since your education, then put your professional experience first. DO NOT INCLUDE YOUR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION, NO ONE CARES. 1. Experience 2. Education 3. (projects) 4. Skills 5. (volunteering) 6. (interests). **Those in brackets are optional/if you have them**, but that's where to put them in the order. If you HAVEN'T had relevant experience and your education was in the past 1-2 years, then 1. Education 2. (projects) 3. Experience 4. skills 5. (volunteering) 6. (interests). 
* Don't include irrelevant jobs/projects. If you worked at Starbucks for 6 months 5 years back, and you've had relevant experience in your field after that, then remove the Starbucks (or whatever other unrelated jobs you have) from your resume. Your resume should be tailored to the jobs you're applying for!
* **DO NOT INCLUDE A PHOTO OF YOURSELF IF YOU'RE APPLYING TO JOBS IN NORTH AMERICA.**  Companies have to prove that their hiring processes isn't based on race, gender, age, appearance, etc. Including a picture in NA can actually get your resume thrown out entirely.

**TL;DR** \- if you want to improve your resume, then you should read the above and not be lazy haha."

Decided to hand my notice in last week for several reasons, one of which was my boss' management style and the way he treats staff.  

Long story short he did not take my notice well at all and did not see it coming at all - he was shocked and genuinely annoyed with me that I decided to leave.  He then tried to convince me to stay over the following days by offering me literally nothing but vague, open ended and unreliable assurances.  So I stuck to my gun and formally gave notice. 

Well..........since then it has been super awkward.  He now makes zero personal effort with me beyond acknowledging me when he comes in, never asks me anything that isn't worked related, has a demanding and impatient attitude attached to everything he asks me to do, and basically makes zero time for me or anything I say anymore.  He has also almost completely phased me out of responsibilities I had before - basically treating me as a ghost member of the team and actively not including me in group discussions about work place stuff going forward.

Now, I of course understand that because I am leaving he isn't going to treat me like a long term / committed member of the team, and will of course prioritise the other staff members thoughts and feelings, but it has gotten to the point now where his attitude towards me just feels vindictive.

I genuinely dread him coming into work because even though I only have 12 working days left there as of today, it feels like every time he comes in that remaining time just becomes harder and harder. 

He hasn't even once congratulated me on getting my new job or wished me well or anything like that.  He is basically just ghosting me and seemingly trying to make my remaining time in the job as awkward as possible to the point that I am more stressed now after having handed my notice in than I was before I did so!!!

To be clear, my manager was always an absolute cock.  Every other member of staff says so and friends of mine have left directly because of the way he treated them.  He has always been like a Level 3 dick head to me, but now it is more like a Level 7 dick head.

I don't know if I'm looking for advice here or if I'm just venting.  But I just simply don't feel that this is any way to make an outgoing staff member feel when seemingly, all I have done is decided to do what is best for my career - 12 more working days of crap from my even crappier manager here I come :)"

He cut ties so plainly like it was nothing. I've never been laid off, and hearing it being phrased in a corporate wishy washy way completely numbed me. I heard something about cost cutting and 15% predicted losses for the next year, and to not take this decision as a reflection of my work. After that was a high pitched noise of indifference, and I told him plainly ""I'm sorry to say this but it sounds flaky at best. How do I not take it personally? We're there ever any expectations set that I didn't deliver on?""

He said something about the the decision having trickled down from the top. I tuned out again and finally asked him ""Is anyone else from the team getting the boot?"" To which he said yes. I thanked him for his time and wished him luck and that's it.

15 minutes. 

I've been here 10 months. It's not a lot but it's my first cybersecurity job, something I've dreamt of ever since I've loved computers. 

I do understand that businesses seek to protect their interests, heck even I would jump ship if the pay and company were shinier. It would be ethical to give me a heads up probably. But whatever, I have the most important asset right here, between my ears. I'll land on my feet.. Back to the shark tank.

Thanks for reading this far. I've been making tasty comebacks in my head for my exit interview (if it ever happens), I didn't ask about severance either. I guess my best move would be to take this time off to come back stronger than what I've left behind. I did make one good friend here, for which I'm grateful. 

It's gonna be a tough week.

Edit: HR reached out to me, offered a month's severance and a no cost career search initiative for my next job plus insurance coverage till Dec 31. Plus my ex colleagues referred me to jobs with the big 5, 🤞🏼 I get callbacks"

Body does hurt from current job being so physical. I’ve listed both jobs below. I would appreciate any and all advice. 


Current job:
Delivery driver (CDL - beer delivery)
Schedule: Tuesday - Friday, start at 4 AM, usually done between 11 AM/12 PM, average 32-35 hours a week
Pay: $60k a year (salary)
Labor: quite labor intensive. Lots of bending and lifting. I deliver cases, but mainly kegs of beer to bars. Not a lot of driving. 

Job offered:
Tractor trailer driver (CDL - pipe hauling on flatbed)
Schedule: Monday - Friday, start at my choosing, probably would start at 3 AM (I like the early schedule), done between 2 PM/3 PM, average 55-60 hours a week
Pay: $110k - $120k a year, based on where I deliver to as the mileage pay is slightly different. However, I’m guaranteed the whole trip even if something happens that prevents me from making it to my destination. Truck breaks down, traffic holds me up, or anything like that. I don’t lose money for not making the miles. 
Labor: relatively low labor, strapping pipe to the flatbed is the most I would do. Pipe is already loaded when I get there. 10 hours of driving a day.

I’m used to being able to afford to eat out everyday for lunch and dinner, and I feel like I haven’t been eating very healthy as of recent having to now cook for myself. Any advice on getting my life back on track would be appreciated! I feel so lazy and unproductive; I don’t even know why I’m so tired. Could be because I’ve been at a really toxic job the past couple years and just recently was terminated so I have had a lot of built up stress? Idk, but I hate feeling this way."

I filled out all my information on their management site. It's been nearly two months, and they have yet to give me one shift. I'm never listed on any schedules. What should I do?"

I am a recent engineering graduate applying for 5 months and I've been getting mixed results from the process.  


I have some working experience in industry and I'm currently working in a non-related sector, but nothing appears to be in my favour. From the waves of ghosts &amp; rejections to interviews where they move on with other candidates, it never appears to work in my favor. The process is beginning to take a toll on me. I feel burnt out at every application, filling in the same/slightly adjusted information over and over.   


How do you all deal with burn out? Just worried I might be pigeon-holing myself and tired at this stuff."

What options do I have other than finding a new job?,u/waxineyea,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z97csf/lack_of_variety_in_my_work_is_starting_to_burn_me/,jobs,I have been in my job for a year and I really love this company and my team. The only probably is the work has almost 0 variation and I’ve been doing the exact same thing every day. I have been bringing this up for months and while I’ve gotten some minor tasks here and there nothing substantial has changed. Is there anything else I can do?
