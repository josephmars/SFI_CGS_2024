In the 90's there were all kinds of pain points with storage ie floppy disks: limited digital storage, physical storage (shelves and cases etc...).  

Then Apple comes out with the iPad, their whole sale was ""gigs of music in an item the size of a deck of cards""  here's an article that anchors you in the time I'm talking about.

https://archive.macleans.ca/article/2004/3/1/perfect-pitch

That's when technology was actually solving problems and changing the world.  We went from a Walkman where you needed binders of cd's to everything in a tiny deck of cards.  

Now they purposely program in (or out) a bunch of features to make it *harder* to manage your photos to force you to buy their cloud services.  I mean just try and mass delete your photo library to stay under the limit.  It was so much easier 20 years ago, you could simply ctrl select copy/paste/delete in windows. And it's not like they can't make it easy to do, it was easy to do and they made it hard.

Is there a shrinkflation style word for that?  Dark patterns comes to mind but that's not quite it."

8,2022-07-19,Reddit vs TikTok on Data Collection. What is truly the difference?,u/RaulDuke22,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/w2z1bg/reddit_vs_tiktok_on_data_collection_what_is_truly/,technology,"Having a debate with a friend and they sent me the following two links from CommonSense.org

[Reddit's rating is a 54%](https://privacy.commonsense.org/evaluation/Reddit)

[TikTok's rating is a 57%](https://privacy.commonsense.org/evaluation/TikTok---Real-Short-Videos)

I believe the major distinction is TikTok's direct association with the CCP. Both seem to be collecting our data and selling it. There is a lot of news and headlines about the dangers of TikTok but according to CommonSense.org Reddit is worse. What triggered this was the FCC news that TikTok is a national security risk.

I would love your guys' educated opinions on the real differences between the two."

0,2022-07-21,I would like to float the concept of metaverse versus Metaverse to get your input,u/immersive-matthew,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/w4qy9r/i_would_like_to_float_the_concept_of_metaverse/,technology,"I would like to propose we adopt the following but I am unsure if this is the right way and am looking for community input. Allow me to explain.

**metaverse** with a lowercase m, are immersive worlds made by individuals or groups. VR Chat, Rec Room, Horizon Worlds, Pistol Whip, Alyx, Resident Evil and ALL the other immersive computing apps be it social or not. metaverses are owned and controlled by an individual or group.

**Metaverse** with a capital M refers to the overall collective immersive worlds made up of many metaverses including the above and any other immersive computing experience be it social or not. Metaverse is our collective space and is owned by anyone.

This means when you put on your Quest, Index, Pico and any other immersive headset including the upcoming AR/MR glasses, you are entering the Metaverse, but specifically you are entering one or more metaverses. For example, as a Quest owner, when you put on your headset, you first enter Meta’s Home environment metaverse that they control and then launch some app which is a portal to another separate metaverse owned and controlled by another. You are never in two metaverses at once, but rather teleport between them, albeit within a walled garden to varying degrees today. The entire time you are in the headset though, it can be said you are in the Metaverse.

This is just what I have been thinking, but what I really want to know is what you think? Is there a better way to define our collective Metaverse versus the countless metaverses created and owned by individuals, groups, and corporations?

I feel this needs to be defined so that when a company says they are making the metaverse, we are not taking it as the Metaverse as this is no ones, and everyones."
