0,2022-06-30,CMV: The right to life always outweighs bodily autonomy,u/Hellomyyfriend,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vons0i/cmv_the_right_to_life_always_outweighs_bodily/,changemyview,"I had this discussion with my friend yesterday about what is more important: Bodily autonomy or the right to life. He brought up a good point which I will mention at the end of the post. Also, I will not disclose my position on abortion here (you might be surprised if I do). 

A couple of things to keep in mind (not part of the argument... ie. does not justify my current belief): 

1. Bodily autonomy is by no means sacred. I mean, we can't go about naked in public. There are definitely some examples of reasonable restrictions on bodily autonomy. 
2. Barring the extreme cases, there is an element of responsibility to having sex. People know the risks to sex, and they can *choose* to do it or not.

Onto the argument: Suppose a single dad takes care of his 5-year-old disabled child.  The dad loses his financial freedom, mental and physical health, and time to himself due to the needs of this child. In other words, he loses his bodily autonomy. Then, would it be wrong to kill the child in the name of bodily autonomy? No, clearly it would be murder. In *this* example, the right to life *clearly* outweighs bodily autonomy.

I argue that this line of reasoning is perfectly analogous to the baby inside the mother. To be clear, when I refer to ""baby"", I mean that whenever *you* think the right to life should be applicable to ""it"", to not devolve into other discussions. So, if you think that a baby deserves the right to life at conception, fine, or that the baby deserves the right to life at 6 months, also fine. (The point is to discuss the right to life itself, not whenever you think that happens.)

The mother may lose her financial freedom, mental and physical health, and time to herself due to the unwanted child. Yet, *if* the baby is, in fact, a baby (and it has the right to life), then how is it any different from the example above? It is a battle between bodily autonomy and the right to life, after all. Of course, there are some obvious physical differences such as being pregnant, but in the end, bodily autonomy is affected in the same way for the pregnant mother and single dad. As such, it would be wrong to kill the baby in the name of bodily autonomy. This was my reasoning yesterday. 

My friend mentioned that a baby in the mother deserves less moral consideration than an identical baby outside the mother. I think he is onto something, but I cannot see how so I reject this idea. I imagine one twin being born while the other remains in the mother. I just don't see how one twin deserves more moral consideration.

&amp;#x200B;

But in my opinion, there can't be any way a stranger is a perv or weirdo for airdropping a nude and YOU, an individual decide to accept it. its 2022, we've collectively known as a society since the early internet not to open things from strangers on the internet. By accepting it, you basically agree to it. And in the comments of the TikTok, i remember people saying it was sent to kids iPad and the dad getting super upset. 1. I assume the stranger didn't intentionally send to a kid and rather just mass sent it. 2. as a parent it's your responsibility to monitor your kid's use of technology. because I know for a fact, that airdrop default is to contacts only, so there would be no way if you were a responsible parent for your kid to get that."

the stigma around it makes it feel like their race/ethnicity is a bad thing that i shouldn’t acknowledge.
a while ago i read a facebook post from a woman i used to attend church with. her post talked about how other people may treat her differently because she is a black woman in a white dominated area. she went into the ridiculous amounts of racism she’s dealt with over the course of her life, and how she wishes people would not put others down for such a silly difference. 
my mother, who is good friends with her, messaged her telling her that when she looks at her she does not see a beautiful black woman but rather just a beautiful woman. the lady messaged back telling her that she wants her race to be seen but she wants it to be respected. she wants to be a beautiful black woman. and that is something i thought made sense. 
it’s about a sense of being proud of yourself. why describe someone by their style or hair when you can honor the more root of someone’s being. it’s nothing offensive, what makes us different is what’s so unique about human beings-"

Yes, electric is more efficient. It’s the right thing to do in light of earth’s challenges. It may even make a statement that a lowly Volt to a mighty Sian share a cleaner, brighter future. 

But who wants a silent Ferrari? Think: Miami Vice or Bad Boys but a silent chase and no flame spewing exhaust. James Bond driving and firing missiles around a parking garage by phone in an Aston Martin quiet as a church mouse. 

Which rich person is willing to buy a $400,000 high performance Prius that’s more difficult to get into, you can barely see out of, hurts to sit in, with less tech than a Tesla, with $3,000 tires, $2,000 scratch repair and requires a constant plug-in for the upcoming monthly tour of 120 miles? Which poor shlub wants her renewable energy taxes to subsidize a super-pseudo-car owner?

At that point you’re paying for a gorgeous lightweight, expertly crafted, expensively developed shell on an Audi e-Tron. Sure, you can go 0-60 in 2.2 seconds. So can a Porsche Taycan in 2.8, but I can get my Porsche AC repaired at any dealer within the next 15 counties.

0,2022-07-01,CMV: Anitwork movement will ultimately fail because of laziness and/or ignorance,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/voytbc/cmv_anitwork_movement_will_ultimately_fail/,changemyview,"At its core the antiwork movement has some good ideas. Shitty bosses shouldn't get rewarded while good workers are punished. That's something everyone (except the shitty bosses) have agreed with since forever, long before an antiwork movement existed. But the antiwork movement will ultimately fail before achieving a ""work is optional and you can have a pleasant, safe, socially acceptable life without working"" world.

I think the main reasons for this are that (1) Probably the biggest hurdle is decisions made by people at the high end of the hierarchy are not well understood by the people at the bottom, and so the objections are not persuasive to the people at the top and their solutions often aren't viable or effective. (2) The antiwork movement attracts lazy people at a higher rate than average. People who work hard and have to carry the team with lazy team members don't like the lazy people. Ask anyone who has had to carry a team at work or do all the assignments for a school group project because you're stuck with lazy morons on your team. Ultimately you'll need strong people who are willing to carry the team, and people don't want to do that unless they sincerely believe you *can't* work like certain disabled people, for example. (3) It necessitates a drop in overall productivity - literally less stuff will get done which will have ripple effects. Same number of people will need medical care but there will be fewer nurses. This is not a deal breaker, but it definitely makes the idea of non-work a hard sell. (4) Other reasons I haven't thought of or taken the time to type out.

For example, an executive for a company needs to make a decision. For the sake of argument let's say it was the right decision for the organization but the people at the bottom will necessarily suffer as part of it. The decision is complex, and the average janitor or w/e doesn't have all the pieces to fully understand the decision, all the janitor knows is his life is getting more difficult and it's apparently Mr Executive's fault. There simply isn't opportunity for Mr Exec to explain it to everyone so they can understand - hell you might need a finance degree to even make sense of the situation. On top of that some people don't care ""why"", they're just emotionally upset because of the hardship placed upon them. Well, most of the anti-work movement's participation comes from these lower level workers, and their assessment of the working situations they and others are a part of are bad assessments. Since they are bad assessments, their conclusions, recommendations for how to fix, and activism in general are not going to result in a thriving society where work is optional. Being a janitor is nothing to be ashamed of, but it's just unlikely an average janitor will be able to wisely judge the exec's decision making.

(Before anyone says ""they're not all lazy idiots!"" OF COURSE there are smart, educated, former managers/execs, hard workers, etc that are part of this movement. But they're like white people supporting the civil rights movements in the 20th century - helpful but uncommon. More likely you've got a young guy who complains about their supervisor at starbucks by carefully screenshotting a supervisor's text message to make them look like an asshole. Well mr starbucks isn't going to solve the world's problems. And unlike civil rights movement, there isn't a fundamentally superior moral position that buoys the antiwork agenda. The answer to ""should we *have* to work?"" is a gray area.)"

In Europe we have a variety of driving skill, I thought where I lived now was bad because people don't seem to know right of way rules and take the lines in the centre of a road as simply suggestions. But recently I traveled to North America again and was reminded about just how much worse everyone seems to be at driving over there. People mounting the pavement to turn, constantly using the wrong lanes, driving the wrong way down one way streets, and just physically being unable to parallel park. At one point I was watching 2 separate people try to parallel park in 2 separate spots, one managed to hit both other cars while parking, and the other took 4 attempts to line it up properly when the space was the size of 2 car lengths. These are not one off instances but things I noticed over and over again whenever I have visited North America.

My assumption of this is that since most of the cities in North America are laid out in a grid system as they are designed around cars, people don't get the valuable experiences of trying to deal with the windy, narrow streets that we have in Europe and so don't develop the same level of spatial awareness that we do. I hate driving in some cities in Europe, but I would absolutely not drive in America."

This is not the first time I've heard suggestions like this. To me, suggestions like this cheapen and trivialize the concept of self-love. In my mind, self-love is a complex set of processes involving identity reformation and cultivation of self-acceptance, self-compassion, etc. In my mind, self-love also has to do with challenging oneself to learn and grow and become more aligned with one's values. Is all of that too complicated to explain to someone who may be in the depths of depression and self-loathing? Could there seriously be therapeutic value in just buying yourself a beauty service? Couldn't framing a beauty service as self-love even end up creating an association between self-love and needing to look a certain way, and wouldn't that be anti-self-love? Also, isn't it extremely classist to assume that everyone can afford to purchase these services and to conflate self-love with spending money?

I'm curious to hear other's perspectives/experiences on this, and I'm open to the possibility that maybe I'm missing something! If there's value in these activities, I don't want to knock/discount that. I want to be open to anything that could possibly help someone, I'm just not currently understanding how this could help.

Edit: I'm noticing many replies seem to be using the terms self-love and self-care interchangeably, or not even using the term self-love and only saying self-care. My question is specifically about whether getting beauty services can be a form of self-love.

Edit again: Thank you to everyone who responded. I was at work until late yesterday, so I apologize that many of my responses yesterday were fairly short, as I had to squeeze them in during my breaks. I did read all the comments, though, and I will try to respond to more of your comments today now that I have some more time. My main takeaways at this point are that a) getting nails/hair done can be a way of showing yourself you have value, b) getting out of the house, socializing with others, etc., is good for you, esp. if you're in the depths of depression, and c) self-care and self-love are terms that many people use somewhat interchangeably. I realized that what bothered me so deeply about what this person said the other day was the fact that he was confusing self-love and self-care. Personally, I still think self-love is a much deeper experience than could be simulated with a manicure, something I know many of you seemed to take issue with, saying ""it's not that deep"". For me, it is that deep. It always will be. So, while I don't think that part of my view will change, you all did help me appreciate the value that manicures, etc. have in helping a person get well, and you helped me understand why I got so frustrated with the assertion made the other day. Thank you all for contributing!"

But I like to join subreddits specifically of view points that I don't have to figure out how those people think. Autobanning people just for participating in certain subs does not make your sub better but rather worse because you are creating an echo chamber of people with the exact same opinions. Whatever happened to diversity of opinions? Was autobanned from a particular sub that I will not name for ""Biological terrorism"". 

I have no clue which sub this refers to but I am assuming that this was done for political reasons. I follow both american conservative and liberal subs because I like to see the full scope of opinions. If subs start banning people based on their political ideas, they are just going to make the political climate on reddit an even bigger echo chamber than it already is and futher divide the two sides. 

What ever happened to debate and the exchange of ideas? Autobanning seems to be a remarkably lazy approach to moderation as someone simply participating in a sub doesn't mean that they agree with it. Even if they do agree with it, banning them just limits their ability to take in new information and possibly change their opinion.

Edit: Pretty sure it was because I made a apolitcal comment  on /r/conservative lol. I'm not even conservative,  I just lurk the sub because of curiosity. It's shit like this that pushes people to become conservative 😒.

To me, it just seems like you are shifting trust from one entity to another. Here are some Blockchain use cases people are talking about but I am not sure I see it

1. Supply Chain: Blockchain’s immutable ledger makes it well suited to tasks such as real-time tracking of goods as they move and change hands throughout the supply chain

The problem with this is it requires the correct good to enter the supply chain in the first place. And two there is nothing Blockchain can do to prevent the real thing from being swapped for a counterfeit somewhere in the supply chain. And we already have real time tracking of goods. 

2. Healthcare: Health data that’s suitable for blockchain includes general information like age, gender, and potentially basic medical history data like immunization history or vital signs

The problem with this isn't the technology. It's getting providers to share data. 

3. Energy: Blockchain technology could be used to execute energy supply transactions, but also to further provide the basis for metering, billing, and clearing processes

The problem with this is it still relies on current data input. If your meter is fucked up, Blockchain won't save you. And what does Blockchain offer that it would be a better way of metering, billing, and clearing? I get it CAN do it. But what's wrong with how we do it today?

These are just some examples. I think the issue is really two folds. Blockchain tech doesn't work in anything that crosses over to the physical realm. And two, data integrity in any use case, still depends on people entering the data. And third (this is more of a question) - if erroneous data is entered into the system, how does it get modified or deleted, if the whole point of Blockchain is immutable data?"

I’m black, 27, and currently living in San Diego, CA. Going to school full time. I got out of the military in 2020.

I grew up with a single mother of 4 in rural Mississippi. After I graduated high school I worked at a mechanic shop for two years and at age 20 I got in the Navy. I worked two different hospitals over 6 years. I was exposed to many different cultures and new ideas. 

I think you’re qualified it’s a good short term gig. They feed you, house you, and you’ll get a skill. Free healthcare and college tuition. 4 years off your life and you go back to the real world. I extended my contact and did a few more years because I hadn’t properly prepared for the transition.

I think it’s a good option. Sucks some days but overall you’ll get some good times. There’s plenty of jobs that aren’t combat related so you can just sit behind a desk if you want. 

If it’s the thought of supporting military action you do that indirectly just by paying taxes.

I hear people say it’s having someone tell you what to do, and that’s every job where you aren’t the boss/owner

Maybe I’m missing something 

When I say poor I poor with little to no choice in career or life
 
I do believe that we need better social programs in America but what are you waiting for? They’re not coming anytime soon

First EDIT:
Wow didn’t expect this many comments but I’m enjoying the dialogue. 

As of now I see the main point of contingency is the morality of being in the military. While you won’t necessarily ever see combat or kill anyone most people don’t like the idea of supporting killing via military action. 

I would argue that while you may not want to admit it the country greatly benefits from having a military, and if you enjoy those benefits you must either choose not to support military action or turn a blind eye to the reality. I suppose I have reduced morals.


A second point is that people are bringing up the risks that come with being in the military. Things like death and dismemberment, like sexual assault, and mental trauma.

I would argue that you know the risk when you join. But regarding to sexual assault, and other harm brought on by other services members is completely disgusting. We have to highlight each of these cases and start kicking out COs and taking their benefits. A shift in culture is needed. 

A third point is your restriction of freedom. 

It sucks but again you know what you’re singing up for 

At this time I’m saying that joining is a valid option for those with little choice in life. It can be used to prop yourself up in life. It’s hard for me to change this view because of my own personal experience.

Lastly is mental health 

I don’t think you should be joining if you have any mental disorders, or if you’re at risk for developing one. 

I believe that America and the military are taking mental health more serious, but again we need more support going out to these people. Getting in the military can possibly negatively affect you but again you need to see the risk.

EDIT TWO:

I’m pro social support and understand that we need more of it but the reality is that we don’t have it"

2,2022-07-01,"CMV: Prioritizing the requirement of a strong expertise in history more than just knowledge in law, current affairs, &amp; politicial science will produce more rational leaders going forward.",u/godlike_hikikomori,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vpblgz/cmv_prioritizing_the_requirement_of_a_strong/,changemyview,"It has been shown time and time again  that actually knowing the unbiased  history of your own country and many others can aid a leader in making rational decisions. History can be used to learn from past mistakes,but can also be used to make a leader more confident about the reasons for taking a political opportunity, which could be beneficial for his/her country. Parallels can be drawn from certain accomplishments and failures of leaders from distant times, and the current political leader can draw inspiration from them, in order to make the best possible solution. 

The problem is that, nowadays, we do not see many "" historians"" in positions of power. There is the cliche saying that pretty much everyone has heard of,and that is""at the end of the day, history will be the ultimate judge of any leader/politician."" 
And so, it's important to have leaders that always try to get to the bottom of how their actions will be judged by historians, not by the media, nor even by the people. 

To exemplify, there are a few instances, in which politicians have made significants policy blunders,due to their lack of expertise in history:

1.)George W. Bush's blunder of persecuting Iraq's government and invading Iraq:

-His lack of knowledge about the history of the Middle East and the partitioning of the Ottomon Empire that was there prevented him to foresee the catastrophe that had arose when trying to install a new government in Iraq and Afghanistan, especially Afghanistan. Also, he should have realized that the different Iraqi ethnic and religious groups do not exacrly have a fond history with each other,making it that much more difficult to form a stable united democracy there. 

- Then, there was W. Bush's really ill-informed allegations as to why Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda had been pissed off for so long. He claimed that they were jealous about America's freedoms, and that they wanted to att ack the US just for the sake of that. Maybe he should have known about how pissed off the about Arab world was about the really unfair terms that were struck after during partitioning of the Ottoman Empire? Maybe after solely focusing on capturing bin Laden, he could have diverted his attention to solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by making them compromise with each other on equal terms?


2.)LBJ's authorization of the Vietnam War:

-Now,this was way before the Iraq War, but still, LBJ's administration still could have at least dug into the history of Vietnam. Not even that,the history of trying to invade a country with incredibly tough terrain to traverse. This has been proven time and time again with the Roman empire trying to invade the deeply forested Germanic lands and the Mongol Empire trying to invade the  tropical and islandic nations. On top of that, these terrains were also advantageous for guerilla warfare. And about the history of Vietnam, I do not think that LBJ knew the history of Vietnam's desire to seek independence from imperial powers. Ho Chi Minh's desire wasn't really to have a communost gov't. Instead, he simply wanted to establish a unified and independent Vietnamese government,irespective of economic system. 

3.) President Truman's go ahead with the division of Korea: 

 Truman, not known for his historical experience(like most politicians), was basically tone deaf and unaware about Korea's millenium age old desire to seek independence and unity during many times of oppression from countries. He could have  just played a mediator role for the two installed governments in Korea to work out their differences and find a compromise according to the Korean people's wishes. This could have prevented the bloodshed that ultimately did occur in the Korean War. 

4.) Obama being  unaware of people's dissatisfaction with America's elite who caused the 2008 Financial/Housing Crisis. His lack of use of the bully pulpit,as well:

-Don't get me wrong,but Obama had quite the knowledge in law and community organizing around current affairs, and multiple documentaries of him have acknowledged that he was quite a gifted student when it came to law, but there was no mention of history. However, in the wake of the bank bailouts during Bush's last year, he should of at least known how pissed America's working class were. This would have been a perfect opportunity for him to utilize the bully pulpit , in order to rally the people to garner support for his agenda. I think he truly misinterpreted the reason why Americans overwhelming voted for him. It was not because he was Black, but because he purported to be someone who was anti-corruption and status quo for the wealthy and elites. This is nothing new. In fact, he could have drawn parallels from the Gilded Age, whereas as Teddy Roosevelt utilized the bully pulpit during similar times. 


5.) Putin's  recent invasion of Ukraine:
-In Putin's case, he obviously has no clue about how it has been really hard for empires in the past to govern their colonies in which its own inhabitants do not want the invading army there. This is why he will ultimately lose even if he conquers the entire country. If he really wanted to find out how to make the Ukrainian people more reception to his annexation,he could have just spent a few more years building up a narrative that his alternative is much better than the incredibly corrupt Ukrainian government, and that he would be the one to clean things up. 

6.) Benjamin Netanyahu's unwillingness to compromise with the Palestinians:

-He is right on one thing, though. The Isrealis have originally inhabited Israel. However, the fact is that millions of Palestinians/Muslims do live in his nation. A more reconcilitory approach to Israel settlement could have prevented a more nasty approach,such as, evictions. Maybe he could have opted for a more expansive housing project for both Israelis and Palestinians. As a result of his aggressive and discriminatory approach,  Palestinians are only becoming less and less receptive to Isrealites claiming their land. Again, not much of a student in history........ Once you treat your subjects with scorn and as second class citizens, the less receptive they will be towards  your polity. 

* It's sad to see the lack of value/prioritization placed in learning  history, especially when grooming future politicians in law school. In my view, it is imperative for politicians to have a strong understanding of their own countries' histories but also other countries' histories, in order to get a full grasp of how civilizations around the world work ;and the reasons for why they are the way they are. 

To reiterate my stance,I essentially believe that there should be more worldly historians elected into office. Any counterpoints are welcomed."

* Explain our arguments well
* Make rebuttals of your opponent's points
* Don't use bad faith tactics like strawmans, ad hominem, tu quoque, slippery slope arguments, gish gallops or red herrings

Recent political events have highlighted that these high school debating tactics are idealistic, and that real-world debates are much dirtier:

* Prior to the Australian federal election in May this year, the then-incumbent Liberal party had been [attempting to enshrine the right to discriminate against LGBTs under the excuse of religious freedom](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-02-10/government-consults-religious-groups-discrimination-bill/100818568), and planned to make [a second attempt at this](https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/federal-election/pm-intends-to-take-the-religious-discrimination-bill-forward-as-standalone-legislation/video/04bd05d9e087617260f6fc8f659025fc) if they were re-elected.
   * Some politicians of the Liberal Party tried to push their anti-LGBT stance by [linking trans women and gender identity to sex offenders](https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/04/17/katherine-deves-liberal-candidate-anti-trans-comments/). While this is a red herring and a strawman argument, it also is an effective scare tactic because no one wants to be seen as pro-sex-offender.
   * On a similar note, the [Republican Party in the USA has been throwing around grooming accusations to slander pro-LGBT Democrats](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/20/republicans-grooming-democrats/). This is also an effective red herring because no one wants to be seen as pro-grooming.
   * Thankfully, the Liberal Party still managed to lose despite their bad faith tactics due to their [poor handling of various scandals](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/poor-decisions-accidents-and-fate-how-the-liberals-imploded-20220526-p5aonu).
* The recent overturning of Roe vs. Wade has led to people on social media digging up dirt on anti-abortion activists to reveal those who have had abortions (or got their partners to have abortions)
   * People who are against this anti-abortion ruling have also been complaining that with abortion rights removed, other rights could be next, which is an example of the slippery slope argument.
   * While obviously we shouldn't take social media as the gospel truth, digging up dirt to discredit our opponents is a good example of ad hominem.
   * For the record, [I am pro-choice](https://www.unddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/q0drbq/cmv_i_am_doing_my_part_to_tackle_abortion_by/), but that shouldn't mean that we can't talk about the dirty tactics being used by our side.
* I've also personally managed to lose several debates thanks to bad faith tactics.
   * On my old Reddit account u/Fart_Gas, [I lost this debate against a Holocaust denier](https://www.unddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/8pyxb6/why_are_many_odinists_nazis/e0fg48r/) thanks to his use of gish gallop.
   * At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, [I lost a debate against someone with an extreme distrust of scientific findings and educational institutions](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/fix1qi/a_few_days_ago_i_went_down_the_rabbit_hole/).
   * I managed to lose [this debate with a climate change denier](https://www.reddit.com/r/AusPol/comments/q58cnr/comment/hg5ya0f/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), as he simply dismissed all the references I sent him.

I've frequently seen [Jean-Paul Sartre's comments on antisemitism](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7870768-never-believe-that-anti-semites-are-completely-unaware-of-the-absurdity) being used to describe and criticise these bad faith actors. The problem is that they're not doing it to be playful - they're using such playful means to achieve their goals, often successfully.

To conclude, it would be nice if we could all debate in a civil manner, and use good faith tactics. But real life has shown that the skills taught in high school debating are nothing but idealism, and that some people can use bad faith tactics to win.

P.S. I've been wanting to make a CMV on this topic for quite some time now, and these recent political events made it easier for me to highlight my point."

Of course music is subjective and everyone will have their own opinions on how music sounds, but from 1960-2000 the 80's sits as an outlier of music that grates me. The music of the 60s and 70s was revolutionary and recreated how music was listened to. When the 80's hit I feel like somehow this went in the wrong direction, creating overly flashy, hallow and painfully dull music. Especially that with synthesizers that arent well developed and turned into the cool sounds that came in the 90s. I also include the rock styles like van Halen, guns and roses and mostly cru, lots of talent and interesting sounds but lacking good songs. All these bands imo paved the way for great music In the 90s but can't hold up on their own. I can understand it was a transitional period for modern music but it grates me. I believe alot of the music of the 90's was able to rectify this. I'd also love album recommendations that are exceptions of the 80's or even the style done well."

So with today, so many AAA games releasing as buggy, content-lacking, unfulfilling nightmares, with burnt out employees and lack of staff being a major issue, another crash will force the money-grabbers out of the gaming business and the ones that care to crack down on the aforementioned flaws.

Indie devs will probably survive as they thrive on PC, and corporate crapchutes like EA will stop plaguing the market with incomplete monstrocities."

0,2022-07-02,"CMV: There should not be a stigma against consenting adult same-sex incest, the concept should be normalized.",u/FireMiko,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vpnqht/cmv_there_should_not_be_a_stigma_against/,changemyview,"Last time I posted on this topic I was arguing for the particularities of making it legal for marriage. I now realize how short-sighted that was considering *any* type of incest, even only queer, can also potentially include intergenerational incestuous unions particularly between parents and their children and I’m so sure we can all agree on the inherent murky ethics of *that* sort of incest.

This is mostly in response to hyper woke fandom anti-shippers claims that normalizing/romanticizing *any* type of incest in fiction, yes even queer incest between peers is “problematic.” Well I’m here to prove that it’s not problematic in the slightest and I really wish they’d think twice and actually critically *think* before lumping us all in with the adoptive/queer sibling shippers in with the child/adult or even hetero or vertical incest crowd. I don’t wanna be associated with the group who jerks it to lolis thanks, we are not the same!

Disclaimer: When I talk about removing the stigma of queer incest, I am speaking purely on the basis of *horizontal* incest between similarly based peers only! (That’s not to say even something as outlandish as parent/child can’t have it’s nuances, particularly in an estranged scenario where the biological parent’s identity is unknown cause they were a donor and parent and child only meet up when kid is a fully grown adult - but that’s such an astonishingly rare scenario and pretty much the only situation where I could say parent/child incest could be even *remotely* ethical so I won’t even bother including it)

So here are my rebuttals towards each of the common arguments posed against even gay, horizontal incest:

&gt; **Argument 1: B-B-But Inbreeding!!!**

Of which doesn’t apply at all to queer couples, which is why they’re the only type of incest I would ever feel comfortable advocating for next!

&gt; **Argument 2: Incest is inherently abusive and non-consensual**

That’s not inherent to the definition of incest, all incest means is relations between blood relatives, nothing less nothing more. Correlation does not equal Causation, just because the *majority* of incest cases you hear about are in the realm of abuse doesn’t mean it’s an inherent characteristic. Most likely the reason for this is because the majority of the population is heterosexual and cisgendered to begin with so they can’t fathom any sort of incest that *could* potentially be consensual since us straights were wired with an reproductive imperative to seek out the most diverse genes possible, thereby giving way to our biologically wired disgust. But that says nothing about the fact that incest has to *always* be forced, it just naturally *feels* that way to us, but feels does not equal reals or objective logical reasoning is my motto.

&gt; **Argument 3: Power dynamics though???**

I have never managed to get a clear cut answer on this, it’s such a vague, immeasurable and subjective concept in and of itself that I almost consider it a non-argument. I don’t know what world you’re living in, but what sort of power imbalance could possibly exist between siblings or cousins only 1-2 years apart in age? What about twins? I mean this is considered a normal and healthy age gap for non-related couples so how does being relatives suddenly change that and confer an automatic power imbalance?

Even if there is one it’s a bullshit argument because there’s a power imbalance in practically *every* romantic relationship, because no two people are exactly the same, so I guess you might as well ban romantic relationships altogether!

It’s a silly argument because everyone knows that some differences in power are inevitable and a fact of life, the real question lies in how *much* of an imbalance is ethical in a romantic relationship. Obviously clear cut top-down authoritative dynamics like teacher/student, parent/child, boss/employee or any kind of big age gaps are big no-no’s and are usually exploitative. But how could you put the dynamic between similarly aged peers on even *remotely* the same level? Realistically their power differentials would be closer to the non-related norm which is already a tolerable level, simply being “family” doesn’t suddenly change that. The concept of “family” itself is largely a social construct that varies from culture to culture and is even subject to various scenarios on who you would even consider your family in the first place.

&gt; **Argument 4: Slippery slope leading to actual harmful heterosexual and vertical incest. **

Remember how I mentioned up above that the majority of cis heterosexuals are wired to find the concept of incest absolutely repulsive? That’s a little something called the Westernmarck Effect kicking in, biology *literally* prevents us from ever finding inbreeding attractive so we’re of no danger of ever wanting it for ourselves. Gays on the other hand can go hog-wild because they were never wired with a reproductive instinct to begin with so incest is only a socially-developed taboo for them, not an innate one like us straights are wired with.

As far as preventing intergenerational incestuous abuse and grooming, like I said before abuse and rape are not *inherent* characteristics of incest, simply cracking down harder on child sexual abuse and grooming laws will help take care of that aspect.

After all, consenting adult gay incest is actually legal (i.e. not considered a crime) in many parts of the world such as Ireland, Germany and Hong Kong and neither of those 3 have seen an uptick in either heterosexual or intergenerational incest.

&gt; **Argument 5: It ruins and breaks down the entire family unit though! What happens if they break up or feel like they have to stay together for the sake of familial harmony?**

Divorce does the same as well and that’s allowed. How many times have you heard unhappily married couples forcing themselves to stay together “for the kids?” And even when they do divorce their relationship can never be severed just by virtue on the fact that they share children together so how is this situation any different?"

To be clear: this is NOT men and women competing directly against each other, on the field/court at the same time.

The idea is to try to make sports more gender-inclusive in terms of participation, viewership and money by coupling the men's and women's game. So in a game of basketball, for example, each team's men would play two quarters against each other, and the same teams' women play two quarters. This would be one game, with one scoreboard. Either one side's men and women both win, or the other side's men and women both win. So each team would have to invest in talent in both of these genders to be successful.

If this were to happen, maybe men should play the first and third quarters, and women the second and fourth. If women start the game, I think there's a risk some men would arrive late so as not to watch them play the first quarter; and having women play the last quarter makes them play the most decisive moments."

US democracy is also ending (yes I know it's actually a Federal Democratic Representative Constitutional Republic but its functionally the same argument), with the Trump Court hearing a case that they will 99.999% rule in favor of Republicans the states will have the absolute authority to conduct elections without even the state court being able to intervene. 

Considering Republicans have gerrymandered the important states to hell and back their red assemblies will just decided to send their electoral votes to Republicans even if the state voted blue and turn the US into a 1 party state.

It's obvious that the Republican Party are the source of all the nations problems, we can't ever get proven to work European social programs because they screech about ""muh taxes"" and ""muh entitlement"" because God forbid Bob making $100,000,000 a year and who has 10 Ferraris in the garage pay $0.01 extra in tax, and passing even the most basic and necessary regulation is pretty much impossible with them around.

Many studies below are paywalled, and excepts can be viewed [here](https://www.yourbrainonporn.com/relevant-research-and-articles-about-the-studies/porn-use-sex-addiction-studies/studies-find-escalation-and-habituation-in-porn-users-tolerance/) (*I understand this isn't the best source, its just a place to read excerpts without paying for the entire study*)

This first study shows that it is exceedingly common for porn users to escalate to more extreme material. *Online sexual activities: An exploratory study of problematic and non-problematic usage patterns in a sample of men (*[2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563215302612)*).*

&gt;*""Forty-nine percent mentioned at least sometimes searching for sexual content or being involved in OSAs that were not previously interesting to them or that they considered disgusting.""*

&amp;#x200B;

*Prevalence, Patterns and Self-Perceived Effects of Pornography Consumption in Polish University Students: A Cross-Sectional Study. (*[2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31137778/)*)* A cross-sectional study on 6,463 polish students found...

&gt;*""The most common self-perceived adverse effects of pornography use included: the need for longer stimulation (12.0%) and more sexual stimuli (17.6%) to reach orgasm, and a decrease in sexual satisfaction (24.5%) "" ...""Various changes of pattern of pornography use occurring in the course of the exposure period were reported:* ***switching to a novel genre of explicit material (46.0%), use of materials that do not match sexual orientation (60.9%) and need to use more extreme (violent) material (32.0%)*** ""

It appears that **even occasional/infrequent users experience the same escalation**. From the same study:

&gt;*""Within the subset of current consumers (n = 4260), the most often reported frequency of use of explicit material was once per week."" With daily use only being reported by 10.7% of the sample.*

&amp;#x200B;

*Does deviant pornography use follow a Guttman-like progression? (*[2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563213001210)*).* This study again shows that users of legal adult pornography were likely to escalate to illegal/deviant forms of porn. I will admit that this study misses evidence that proves porn is what caused users to escalate, rather it *may* just prove that those who were bound to be interested in deviant content just started with legal content first.

&gt;*""Based on the results, this progression to deviant pornography use may be affected by the individuals “age of onset” for engaging in adult pornography. As suggested by Quayle and Taylor (2003), CP use may be related to desensitization or appetite satiation to which offenders begin collecting more extreme and deviant pornography. """"Results suggested deviant pornography use followed a Guttman-like progression in that individuals with a younger “age of onset” for* ***adult pornography use were more likely to engage in deviant pornography*** *(illegal) compared to those with a later “age of onset”.""*

&amp;#x200B;

*Internet pornography and paedophilia* *(*[2013](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02668734.2013.847851)*)*

&gt;*""...clinical experience and now research evidence are accumulating to suggest that the Internet is not simply drawing attention to those with existing paedophilic interests, but is contributing to the crystallisation of those interests in people with no explicit prior sexual interest in children.""*

&amp;#x200B;

*Motivational pathways underlying the onset and maintenance of viewing CP on the Internet (*[2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bsl.2450)*).* This study, like others, is paywalled. The excerpts I have read [here](https://www.yourbrainonporn.com/relevant-research-and-articles-about-the-studies/porn-use-sex-addiction-studies/studies-find-escalation-and-habituation-in-porn-users-tolerance/) (under the heading STUDY FOURTY EIGHT), there are too many quotes to list. After reading, it is to my understanding that many users that were interviewed experienced desensitization, tolerance, and escalation to more extreme content.

&gt;""participants often cycled between seeking novelty and habituation multiple times before they began actively seeking CP""

&amp;#x200B;

This study shows that users of illegal forms of porn are more likely to act out those behaviors they see. *Pornography Use by Sex Offenders at the Time of the Index Offense: Characterization and Predictors (*[2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30896374/)*).*

&gt;*""Participants were 146 male sex offenders incarcerated in a Portuguese prison establishment. A semi-structured interview and the Wilson Sex Fantasy Questionnaire were administered. Thus, for those individuals, pornography had a conditioning effect, making them want to try out those behaviors. This is of importance, since 45% used pornography that featured forced sex and 10% that included children at least once at the time of the index offense. It appears that for some individuals with specific characteristics using pornography may help disinhibit their sexual desires""... ""that does not appear to be equal for all individuals, since for some it was not enough and made them try to reproduce the visualized contents""*

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Watching any amount of pornography has the ability to alter your sexual tastes to become deviant, leading you to pursue illegal content, which you may act on in real life. Those who watch illegal porn for the purpose of arousal, attraction, and sexual pleasure, are by definition pedophiles. Porn has the ability to turn people into pedophiles with a seemingly high likelihood. I am in no way saying this behavior is acceptable to any degree, or that offenders lack any responsibility for their actions. The fact that this can happen is disturbing and needs to be considered as a way to protect younger people from escalating due to porn use.

Looking at history, the path to the American Civil War can be looked at like a crack in a windshield. As major events in the debate of slavery vs. abolition occurred (e.g: Missouri Compromise, Bleeding Kansas, Fugitive Slave Act, etc), the metaphorical crack began to grow and grow. But, just like how a crack in a windshield gets to a certain point and loses all its mechanical strength, causing it to rapidly shatter, the Dredd Scott v. Sanford decision, where a Supreme Court dominated by Southern white supremacists unilaterally decided slavery is permanently allowed by the constitution, triggered the rapid descent into civil war less than 4 years later.

Now let's look at the modern day. We can see a gradual decline in functioning democratic (small ""d"") principles starting with the removal of the FCC Fairness Doctrine by the Reagan administration, continuing through the 90s with the Newt Gingrich revolution and a turn toward more extreme political hardball tactics, then continuing with the rise of Mitch McConnell,  the Citizens United decision, the ""Project REDMAP"" by the Republican party in response to the 2008 election, refusal to nominate Merrick Garland, and of course Trump and everything associated with him. Recently, I fear we may have hit the Dredd Scott point, or at least are barreling toward it, with the slew of Supreme Court decisions which are a direct culmination of decades of work by Republican party operatives' efforts to stack the Supreme Court and the under-representation of Democratic voters and over-representation of Republican voters. 

Overall, unless there is a major course correction, I foresee political discourse rapidly devolving into violence. I don't know how far it'll go; maybe mass rioting, maybe armed rebellion, maybe (hopefully not) civil war... but there needs to be drastic action to curb the momentum of American politics because otherwise things appear to be reminiscent of 1857. We may even be too late at this point.

So, reddit, please CMV.

Edit: I don't know if I've *changed* my view, but I've at least *softened* my view based on some good points commenters. I still fear we're headed in a violent direction (albeit not full on civil war). But even without violence, there will still be the erosion of democratic norms and practices, which sure there won't be fighting in the streets, yay, but it still will require a monumental shift to curtail.

Basically despite feeling less certain about Northern Ireland style conflict, I don't feel good about the whole state of US democracy. But hey, you don't come to CMV to feel better. That's what r/upliftingnews is for.

Edit 2: I've given a few more deltas and further softened my view. u/WekX brought up an excellent point that deep historical ethnic divisions that create the conditions for violent conflict are not present in the US like they are in regions like Eastern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and other regions that have been subject to violent conflict. u/_Hopped_ brought up an excellent point that since the federal government has (mostly) a monopoly on force, the descent into armed conflict is somewhat of a slippery slope argument."

I am not a Republican, largely because I find Donald Trump to be a despicable person with bad motives.

I read the news all the time, and I read CNN.com, MSNBC, the New York Times, Politico, the Huffington Post and the like. (I don’t read or watch Fox because it’s not objective.)

It’s clear to me, as expressed in Democratic-leaning media, that there are elements of the Left that have animosity against white men, and particular church-going white men.  Not everyone in the Left does, but some people do have anti-white men views.  (I’m not interested in debating whether or not some people in the Left have anti-white men views; they are perceived as having those views, which is what matters.)

Democrats need to get over that and drop all animosity against white men.  This is not to excuse all of the bad things that I know white men do and have done.  This is because when Democrats are perceived as disliking white men, white men feel like their backs are against the wall when Democrats want things.  They simply won’t go along with what Democrats want.  Result?  White men vote Republican and the GOP will try to block everything that Democrats do, seeing, rightly or wrongly, animus against white men as the motive for Democrats.

So if Democrats would get over any animosity against white men, or at least be more conscientious about what they say and do being perceived as antagonistic against white men, and drop that antagonism, then white men would be more willing to cooperate with Democrats.  That could lead to the GOP being more cooperative in getting things done."

...and why it cost them the 2016 election, and could cost us far more in the future.

Looking at the 2008, 2012, and 2016 election demographics, you'll start to see a pattern.  In 2008, moderate men voted for Obama, in 2012, they were split, and in 2016, they overwhelmingly voted for Trump... and it cost Hillary the Blue Wall, many ""purple"" states, and the election.  Why?  What changed culturally that this demographic started to veer away from the left and vote for someone as radical as Donald Trump?  It would be easy to say that they're ""sexists who didn't want a woman presidency, but I don't think that's the full picture.

**Poor Branding by the Left**

Democrats have, historically, had a far worse marketing scheme than Republicans.  ""Defund the Police"" automatically comes to mind.  It doesn't really incorporate what the idea truly means, and brings to mind images of The Purge movies.  ""Police Reform"" would be a much better slogan to run on, and would be something that moderates could get behind.  No one WANTS innocent people getting gunned down by racist cops.

However, Defund the Police wasn't around in 2016 when Trump got elected.  At the time, the biggest buzzword on the left was ""privilege.""  Specifically, ""White Privilege"" and ""Male Privilege.""

These are *horrible* terms.  Arguably the worst terms that you could have chosen to convey the meaning, for many reasons.  First of all, the word ""privilege"" has historically been assigned to rich kids that have never had to work a day in their life.  Who are completely out of touch with the real world because they've never had to participate in the real world.  It has, historically, been a pejorative.

Assigning this term to the inherent advantages that some men and white people receive based on their skin color or gender was a huge marketing mistake.  It automatically puts those groups on the defensive.  They feel like people using those terms think that they've had an easy life of abundance and have never worked for a thing they've gotten.  That what little they've managed to build was handed to them instead of earned.

They look at their tiny apartments, empty bank accounts, and old POS vehicles and think, ""THIS is privilege?""

If the left had used a less contentious term, like ""White Advantage,"" far more moderates could and would have gotten behind it.  They're not dumb or blind.  They know that racism exists, and that POC and women have some disadvantages.  However, the pejorative ""privilege"" put them on the defensive, and, at the time, was a HUGE talking point online and even by several Democratic candidates.  I know that ""White Privilege"" doesn't mean that all white people inherently have an easy life with no troubles, but the historical use of the word brings that meaning to mind.

**Pop Culture and Hollywood**

In the late 2000's to today, pop culture has subtly attacked white men.  It started with commercials.  Brinks and ADT started airing commercials where someone would break into a house, and that someone would invariably ALWAYS be a white guy.  Every.  Time.

Meanwhile, other commercials started following a similar theme.  If the script called for a bumbling oaf to be educated on this easy to use product, the oaf was always a man, and the smart, knowledgeable savvy person was his wife.  If the script called for two men, the oaf was a dorky white guy, and the smart, knowledgeable, savvy guy was a person of color.

This was echoed in sitcoms of the time.  King of Queens immediately comes to mind. Husbands were consistently marketed as these foolish dullards that had to be rescued by their wives.  This is in direct contradiction to the sitcoms from before.  Friends, for example.  Sure, Joey was dumb... but so was Pheobe.  All the characters had pros and cons, and none of them were consistently shown in a negative light.

Then we move on to movies.  Watch an MCU or Star Wars movie from the past decade.  Women never, ever lose, except to other women.  Rey defeats Kylo with no training.  She beats Luke freaking Skywalker. Thor in Ragnarok gets his ass handed to him three times by women. Ghostbusters 2016 follows a similar theme.  The all female cast is joined by a white guy... who's a moron.  Oh, the evil villain is also a white guy, who's defeated by getting shot in the crotch.

This has followed in a lot of movies.  If the script calls for a villain that's evil for the sake of being evil... a white man is cast.  If the script calls for a backstabbing liar... a white man is cast.  In the rare cases that the villain is a woman or POC, those villains are often sympathetic villains who have this giant back story explaining why they're the bad guy.  It's never because they're just greedy assholes.

Video games and comic books started to follow similar themes.

The majority of these ""racist sexist haters"" were not originally upset that there was more diversity in casting, it's the WAY that it was handled.  If you remember the Force Awakens, very few people complained that a black man and a woman would be the heroes... until the movie came out and Rey turned into a Mary Sue who was just great at everything.

**Dismissal of Men's Issues.**

Men's issues have always existed, from suicide rates, to bias in the justice system and family courts.  However, when men tried to bring up these issues, they were basically told to shut up and sit down.  Then social media started allowing some hate speech, but not others.  Hate speech directed at men or white people was blatantly allowed, while saying the same thing about women or POC would get you immediately banned.  ""Kill All Men,"" ""Male Tears,"" etc, etc.  Change those terms into any other demographic, and that would be hate speech.

When men spike out about these things, they were again told to go eff themselves.  Even this very site did similar things.  r/twoxchromosomes spews just as vile things about men as r/mra spewed about women.  One was removed from the platform, the other is still alive and well today.

Body positivity is another example.  Women were 'all beautiful' no matter their size, while men were still openly mocked for everything from their height, penis size, or weight.

Articles started popping up online about ""Men are going to college less, and women are the most affected.""  Basically saying that undereducated men was actually a women's issue because that meant less eligible men for women to date.

The double standards kept growing by the day, and they didn't go unnoticed.

**Tinder and Dating**

Believe it or not, romance and sex are powerful motivators.  And since the left is the ones that championed sexual freedom, men started blaming them for their dating woes.

Modern men were raised to believe that if they were nice, caring, understanding and thoughtful partners that respect every boundary all the time, that it would be easy to find someone to spend your life with.  But they were lied to.  When they tried these methods, they are consistently broken up with for being ""too nice"" or were just friend zoned.  It turned out that women were still attracted to the same men they've ALWAYS been attracted to: Masculine, attractive, confident men who know when to push and when not to.  That know how to play hard to get, and when ""No"" means ""no,"" and when ""No"" means ""Try harder, dummy.""

Then along came Tinder, which completely blew up the dating scene.  Suddenly, men weren't just competing with the guys in their social group or in the immediate vicinity... they were competing with every man in a 50 mile radius, all at the touch of the woman's finger.  Average men started to feel left out of hookup culture, and even dating in their 20's.  If you look at the stats, a small pool of men are having a large majority of the hookup sex, or even dating in general.  It's not until women are ready to 'settle down' in their late 20's and early '30's' that these men are even getting a second glance from average women.  Thus, we see a growing population of men in the MGTOW or Red Pill groups.  They feel like they were told that they weren't good enough in their 20's, and are only dating material now that she wants someone to pay the Bill's.  While I understand that it's because people's priorities change over time, it's still a bitter pill to swallow.

Bear in mind, I'm not blaming women for hooking up with attractive men, I'm just saying that it DID lead to the radicalization of men.

**Final Thoughts**

Conservatives saw all of this, and welcomed these men.  They told them that their problems were valid, and pointed the finger at the ""evil liberals"" and slowly but surely radicalized these men to their side, until now they're Trumpers blathering on about ""stolen elections"" and ""feminazis.""  I firmly believe that if the left had tried harder to listen to and validate these men, instead of vilifying them, that perhaps 2016 would have turned out differently.  But when one side is making them out to be the devil, and the other is unequivocally on their side... it's not hard to see how they got radicalized towards the right.

What are your thoughts?  Do you agree, or am I way off base?

EDIT:  I want to make it clear that I'm NOT a conservative, nor have I ever voted Republican.  Straight blue down every ticket since 2008, including midterms.  People seem to think that I'm defending and justifying the conservative viewpoints, but nothing could be further from the truth.

Secondly, I'm speaking from experience.  Back in 2015/2016, the person I'm describing above was me.  These are the things that pushed me into a pseudo-right wing rabbit hole.  I was lonely, depressed, and it seemed that every bit of media was telling me how evil I was for being born a white male.  I started watching ""Anti-SJW"" YouTube channels like the Armored Skeptic, ShoeOnHead, then into even more radical ones like Sargon of Akkad, and even found myself agreeing with blatantly Alt-Right channels.  They called out the ""injustices"" that I felt, and made me feel validated and heard.

It was an echo chamber that I was rapidly sinking faster into.  Only three things kept me from going down that road.  First, I'm VERY atheist, and the right HATES me about as much as they hate all minorities and LGBTQ+ people.  Secondly, I absolutely DETESTED Trump.

But third?  A childhood friend.  At the time, she was about as hardcore ""feminazi"" as I was becoming an MRA MGTOW incel.  We actually sat down and had an honest conversation, not a debate, or argument, but a back and forth conversation about how we felt, why we felt that way, and what we thought the ""other side"" could do better.

We both left that conversation far less radicalized than we walked into it.

But if I had been even a little religious, and the Republicans hadn't nominated someone like Trump, I don't know if I wouldn't have been too far gone to even HAVE that discussion."

Using Californias model. Then use the taxes from the industry to fund social programs. Release people incarcerated for non violent cannabis charges, and expunge their criminal record of the charges, and paying reprimands. The government must not leave this decision up to the states, as everyone should have legal access to it. This would also allow funds from the budget on the war on drugs to reallocated to social programs as well. I like the legal being 21, I don’t think young kids smoking is a good thing. 

Housing 

We obviously also need changes to zoning laws to stop redlining and actually allow the creation of affordable homes. But using the money to invest in housing first programs, and affordable homes would bring down the homeless population in America.

Education

Cities could divert funding to education. Paying teachers more and funding school programs. This creates a more educated society.

Prison 

The release off nonviolent offenders will ease the strain on the prison system. Funds must directed towards reintegrating people back into society.

Cannabis while not federally legal is state legal for places for example it’s legal in California and we that while cannabis isn’t 100% harmless it can be enjoyed by adults responsibly and produce wealth for the state.

EDIT ONE:

I have had some misconceptions about exactly how the law works on this type of thing, and see that government would be overstepping to tell states what to do. I opt for decriminalization and the it’s removal for the scheduled drug list.

I would like to see social programs, education, housing to be funded by tax revenue.

I understand that the majority of Americans want legal access so what’s hold up? If you’re against it please chime in so far I’ve learned a lot from these short discussions. 

Also the California model sucks and Oregon is a much better model. Would love to hear more suggestions on how to make a better system while we debate this in the comments"

I am less on the fence about supporting crypto in it's raw form, though I still believe there is potential that the ideas will feed into powerful innovation. (End of edit) 

**ORIGINAL:** When new products and ideas arrive, some people win and some people lose. I don't believe crypto will ever return to what it was worth and this dip will allow innovation for small companies.

* **Innovation Trigger:** A potential technology  breakthrough kicks things off. Early proof-of-concept stories and media  interest trigger significant publicity. Often no usable products exist  and commercial viability is unproven.
* **Peak of Inflated Expectations:** Early publicity  produces a number of success stories — often accompanied by scores of  failures. Some companies take action; many do not.
* **Trough of Disillusionment:** Interest wanes as  experiments and implementations fail to deliver. Producers of the  technology shake out or fail. Investments continue only if the surviving  providers improve their products to the satisfaction of early adopters.

Crypto doesn't need to be a replacement for gold or watching the markets. It can, is, and will be a tool.

0,2022-07-02,CMV: There should be some kind of criteria for being able to vote aside from age.,u/Pangolinsftw,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vpyp1a/cmv_there_should_be_some_kind_of_criteria_for/,changemyview,"I was originally going to title this post ""You should have to pass a test in order to vote"", but I thought this title might inspire some more creative responses and ways of thinking about democracy and the act of voting.

First of all: why do we have an age limit on voting? It's because childrens' brains are not entirely developed, right? Well what does that mean? It means they're ignorant and not terribly intelligent, right? Well doesn't that also apply to a lot of adults? This is where the idea of a test comes in: if you display ignorance about the issues in America, doesn't that mean that you have the same problem children have (ignorance)? And children can't vote. So by that logic, adults who display the same level of knowledge and intelligence about political issues as children shouldn't be allowed to vote. But it's not like they *can't* gain the basic knowledge in order to vote. Children literally don't have the cognitive ability to learn that stuff, but adults do.

Should there be *any* criteria for whether or not to vote, aside from age? I understand that for many people you might say no as a knee-jerk response, but let's think about this. Is that really a defensible position?

Is the idea that we should allow for all citizens over 18 to vote, even if they're profoundly stupid, ignorant, uneducated, or have wildly distorted perceptions of reality? In that case, shouldn't we just let children vote too?

It seems to me that you either have to say that we should allow people of all ages to vote, or there should be *some kind* of criteria, probably related to a level of investment in society, and/or basic knowledge of political issues.

The idea that everyone over 18 should vote is an emotional-based argument. It appeals to our sense of freedom and equality, but I think it's difficult to make an empirical and logical argument that letting millions of people who have no education about the issues vote is healthy for the country.

I haven’t done much research on this subject but I recently had an eye opening experience that has convinced me that the “sagging ban” was created just to provide more reasons to harass, stop and frisk, and arrest black males. 

The experience:

Me and my cousin were walking down the boardwalk at this beach the other day. We walked past some old men wearing speedos with their butt cheeks literally hanging out, girls wearing skinny bikinis that leave nothing to the imagination, and some other things I don’t think I can post on here.. Then we walk by a cop who literally yells at my cousin and threatens to arrest him because his pants are about 2 inches lower than his boxers (Were to grown to sag our pants he just forgot his belt at home.) and after trying to pull his pants up just for them to fall back down  the cop gets in his face, goes on a power trip and forces him to hold his pants up with his hand until we go back home.

This cop walked by literal old man booty cheeks just to tell this young black man that his pants are too low. I don’t see any reason for this law other than maybe it could be a sign of gang activity, but even that is discrimination. Just because your pants are sagging doesn’t mean you’re a gang member."

I have certain reasons to think this way. 
let me explain by giving an example to give you an idea. i could be loyal towards a person who motivated me and brought me out of my worst times, but within certain circumstances and context. If that person is a piece of shit on other fronts, i have no duty to be loyal towards that person under those circumstances. But on other fronts, if he motivated me, or if he helped me in any way, i owe him that back. Maybe more, but either being on one side or another, idk about that, idk if that makes sense. But what i mean to say is. Lets say there is this guy, who isnt a nice guy for everyone. But towards me. Im only supposed to be loyal to that extent. I cant justify his every behavior or be completely there. He cant be like i was loyal to you, why arent you being loyal to me. Because, circustances matter. Id be loyal to you to defend on something i know about you, but if i have some doubts about some things, i will not be afraid to hold back and be atleast against or in mid level to go on with the situation. You cant demand loyalty everywhere. And loyalty isnt black or white. Loyalty, is 50 shades of grey."
16,2022-07-02,"cmv: I think the term ""Highly Functioning Autist"" is flattering, and I'm proud that I am one.",u/ImDahSnipah,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vq2spg/cmv_i_think_the_term_highly_functioning_autist_is/,changemyview,"Alright, I have no idea how this will be recieved, so let's just get right into it.

I'm a 23 year old norwegian man diagnosed with ADHD and Aspberger's syndrome. All I've known my entire life is being a little different from most, without most people in day-to-day life being able to immediately put their finger on what it is. After a couple conversations with me, most people recognize that I lack an inherent understanding of social cues, my eye contact is a little off, and some other things. I think most people understand what ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) is, so I won't describe it any further. 

Like the title said, I think the term ""Highly Functioning"" is flattering. I don't understand why people are offended by it, especially not the people without ASD who feel a need to defend us from the term, or get offended on our behalf. In my honest experience, most people who has the inherent understanding of the world and the people who inhabit it to actually take offense by the term, can reach a level of societal functionality where they too would be considered ""Highly Functioning"". The people who don't take offense by the term, based on my experience, just don't understand the inherent problematic nature of the word and it's usage, and therefore do not care.

My reasoning for taking this stance is that I have manually learned all I know about socializing, something most people learn naturally while growing up. I've studied the people around me extensively,  watched media (both fictional and reality) for hours on end to recognize patterns in speech and socializing. I've actively listened in on, and participated in conversations throughout my life, even though the most common reaction the first ten years was the others leaving because of something I said/didn't say or because I looked bored/uninterested. I've studied facial movements, expressions, and have had to manually manufacture my own expressions of varying emotions. At this point it's 85% automatic since I've been doing it for so long. However, I feel like becoming a ""Highly Functioning"" member of society is something we should all strive for, and therefore I am proud that I am classified as one considering the inherent disadvantages that stand in my way of doing just that.

Now, it should be said that I have been a part of the mental healthcare system of norway for 15 years now, and have met many others with varying degrees of my own diagnosis, as well as many others with other diagnoses that all belong in the spectrum. I have enough personal experience to speak about this without presenting it in a manner which paints it one way or the other, but I am also sharing my personal experience and opinions so there will be pre-existing biases from my point of view.

I haven't shared this opinion with others before because I can see the issues it might present. Everything from childhood traumas and abuse, to systematic oppression and societal segregation, but at the end of the day it's just a term. All that being said, I'm not completely convinced I'm in the right on this one.

0,2022-07-02,CMV: The Dark Knight Rises and Thor: Ragnarok are near-identical movies.,u/foxxgod,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vq5gqy/cmv_the_dark_knight_rises_and_thor_ragnarok_are/,changemyview,"I'm not sure how and why the MANY similarities between these two movies are overlooked. I myself first noticed it when remembering how the two protagonists of the movies lost nearly everything. Thor lost his hammer/father/hair/home/some of his warrior friends/etc. and Bruce Wayne lost his company/money/mansion/ and even Alfred. His legacy as Batman was also destroyed at the end of the dark knight and obviously this carried over into TDKR. Then later on he also lost access to his batsuit and batmobile when he was imprisoned in the dungeon.

Here is an excellent blog post someone wrote that originally noticed the movies' various parallels: [https://pariedoliaimthblog.home.blog/2017/12/08/10-reasons-why-thor-ragnarok-is-marvels-version-of-the-dark-knight-rises/](https://pariedoliaimthblog.home.blog/2017/12/08/10-reasons-why-thor-ragnarok-is-marvels-version-of-the-dark-knight-rises/)

The base plot for both films can be written like this: Protagonist gets hit hard by life and ends up losing nearly everything they value most in the midst of the most powerful villain they've ever faced coming to invade and takeover their home. The villain and the protagonist end up fighting for the first time and the protagonist is vastly outmatched by villains superior power. Shortly after the protagonist loses, they are forced out out of their home only to soon end up in imprisonment, thus giving the villain ample time to wreck havoc and rule over the people of their home.

While imprisoned, the protagonist is left without their fabled weapons and outfits but must escape the prison in time even with these handicaps in order to save their home. They eventually do overcome the hurdles and escape after learning about their inner strength before eventually rushing back home to participate in an all out war with high stakes involved.

All this being said, yes, I am aware the tones of the films are drastically different. Obviously Raganarok is far more campy and comedy as opposed the seriousness of TDKR. The endings of course are also different. But there's still no denying the two movies at their core are nearly-identical. Maybe a fan-made alternative title for Thor: Ragnarok can easily be The God Of Thunder Rises."

"". These gifted individuals should at least get some sort of special education. If we take away the gifted programs we already have, we're only going to make things worse. Gifted students won't be interested in learning anymore, because they may already have a high understanding of the things taught in class. The problem is that the gifted programs are ineffective. We need to improve them so that each student is motivated to learn. The gifted program I was in was called G.A.T.E (Gifted and Talented Education) and just gave us more work and an excuse to get out of class. If, in these gifted programs they were taught specific things that we didn't already have an understanding of, maybe they'd actually learn. We need better gifted programs!

Edit: Gifted programs should be able to teach gifted students higher than their already high understanding of a certain subject so the student is learning, motivated to learn, and not having to re-learn things that they already know, instead of adding more schoolwork. If they're doing average in a certain subject, then they learn from their normal class. But, if they're higher in another subject, they can work in small groups with fellow gifted students that have the same or similar amount of understanding to learn more about that subject. "

We now look at drug users as suffering from addiction and countries that treat it as a medical issue have far better outcomes. Why stop there? If someone physically assaults someone, why not aim to treat their anger issues and get to the heart of it via therapy? If they have made satisfactory progress, why not start to bring them back into society instead of holding them back for years more than are needed. 

Similarly, if someone stole years before and have shown change, what is the point in punishing them beyond having them return what is possible to return? 

It’s hard to trust former criminals because there isn’t the sense that there was an attempt to reform them and that they are free because they simply endured a punishment. Who does that benefit?

If we aim to rehabilitate, former criminals could reenter society with the understanding that they aren’t considered second class because of their past.

Clarification:

I‘m talking about a system in which the possibility of incarceration and it’s duration are based solely on the potential for rehabilitation. What happens for all criminals is a programme of courses and therapy. Reintegration is not possible for everyone but those in prison should always be treated humanely and afforded the possibility of education and other self betterment activities. Punitive sentences have no logic in my mind and has been debated to death already. For criminals that can’t be released, they have access to the same resources as everyone else but with the understanding that there is slim to no chance of completing being rehabilitated enough to be deemed safe for society.

0,2022-07-03,CMV: Many church activities are wastes of time and should be replaced by videos of more effective ones from other churches,u/FriendswithPoodles,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vqex65/cmv_many_church_activities_are_wastes_of_time_and/,changemyview,"I’ve been a very active church member, attending and volunteering regularly, for my entire life.

But now I’ve realized: most church services are mediocre and ineffective, as are most church Bible studies, classes, etc.  

Before radio, TV and movies, you were entertained by live performances.  If you lived in a small town, the talent level was probably pretty poor.  So when radio, TV and movies appeared and could broadcast better-quality talent, live performances largely disappeared.

The same thing should happen in churches.  A lot of church sermons are mediocre.  Music is mediocre.  Classes, particularly when led by regular church members, are also mediocre.

Now that church services are largely also broadcast online, churches whose pastors, musicians and other leaders are mediocre should give way and instead broadcast sermons, music and classes from more talented people in other churches.  

Interpersonal discussions could still take place, and there would still be a place for a small local church, but it would be improved by importing talent via online content.  For example, a mediocre pastor could still lead prayers and things during a worship service, but the sermon would be broadcast from another church.

Improving the quality of preaching, teaching and music in churches would make them much more effective.

EDITED TO ADD: By ineffective, I mean ineffective at conveying God’s Word and transforming lives through the Gospel.  If someone hears only a dull, irrelevant sermon that doesn’t do a good job explaining the Bible or what Jesus should mean to the listener, that’s not effective."

It seems as though there are many things that people SAY will bring change, but really do not do much of anything. My view will be changed if someone can provide one thing that someone who is not professionally involved in politics can do to create change. I’ll go through the things that people SAY can achieve this, but I personally believe do nothing.

1) Protesting:
This is one of the main methods that common people have tried using to combat poor action on the part of governmental organizations. From what I’ve seen, they’ve done basically nothing. Black Lives Matter protests, for example, have gone on for months, and the only changes I’ve seen have been some minor local changes by blue states. Nothing major at the federal level ever happened, which was the main goal of the protests. A similar situation exists for abortion rights protests, as those rights were recently drastically set back with the repeal of Roe v Wade. From what I’ve seen, the government has taken somewhat of a “weather the storm” approach to responding to protests. They wait for people to get tired or have other obligations that prevent them protesting, then carry on like nothing happened. It makes protests seem utterly useless in creating change, as no matter how loud those crowds are, nobody at the federal level seems to give a damn.
2) Voting:
This one is interesting, as it does technically give the individual a voice; however, that voice’s impact depends far too heavily on one’s location. Plus, with the amount of gerrymandering that occurs, along with the possibility of the Supreme Court overturning a case to give states further control over the electoral process, it seems like people’s individual votes, in the grand scheme of things, matter less than ever. As such, my view with voting is that while each vote does matter, they do not matter enough, as the best they can do is keep things from getting worse than they already are. Additionally, independents, one of the only viable escapes from the two-party system, are too unpopular for a vote for them to matter.
3) Writing to Politicians:
While writing to your local congressmen can be effective with less clear-cut issues, all of the major issues that people would want to voice their concerns over are far too partisan for congressmen to be swayed by someone writing in.

These are the possibilities that came up when I was trying to search for a way to change this viewpoint on my own, but all of them seem to have a fatal flaw that prevents me from seeing them as a clear way for someone like myself to do something that can create change. I’m hopeful that this view can be changed."

7,2022-07-03,CMV: Live university lectures with lots of math are completely pointless,u/ngruhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vqgqdj/cmv_live_university_lectures_with_lots_of_math/,changemyview,"If I sit in a live lectures (Zoom or in-person) where the professor introduces formula after formula, lengthy calculations or proofs, I find it impossible to follow. Even if I try to focus hard the entire time, the lecture jumps ahead faster than I can process it. More likely I get distracted for a moment and miss a crucial step. Usually after 15min I'm completely lost and don't get any value out of the remaining time just sitting there. 

I much prefer on-demand lectures where you can pause-and-ponder; re-watch it at some other time; or jump back to a definition I already forgot about that was introduced 30min ago and suddenly became crucial to understand the current step.

I study computer science but I would presumably have the same experience in math, physics, engineering, etc. I don't make any claims about non-mathy subjects such as history and what not.

What really puzzles me, is that many professors actively rebel against putting up on-demand lectures. Not just from my university, I heard professors from anywhere complain that they had to provide recorded lectures during the pandemic and they are so happy that they can go back to in-person lectures now. (I should say, this does not apply to everyone. I definitely have professors who produce excellent online material!)

Now, if the professor is maybe a bit old, not so tech-savvy and just doesn't know how to produce online content, I don't shame them for it. Although the minimal viable solution gets you very far already in my opinion. That is, no fancy slides; just do your lecture in-person once; record it with a camera; and upload that.

Either way, this doesn't seem to be the reason. The main argument is: it's a better learning experience for the students. It's more interactive; students can ask questions; and so on. This is obviously where I strongly disagree. *Students can ask questions*. I'm truly astonished how often I hear that argument. In a lecture hall with 500 people, how many questions do you get there usually? If any then they are  superficial (""is zero included in the natural numbers in this course?"") or they are asked by students who are either geniuses or failed the course last year. It's almost comical when at the end of the lecture, where everybody was staring at their phones for 90min, the professor says: ""Any questions ........ ? No? Ok cool, I guess everything was clear then.""

Here are are some popular reasons why students don't ask questions:

* they are scared to that the question sounds stupid stupid
* they are scared to speak in front of many people in general
* they are so confused they don't even know how to formulate a question
* they do ask a question; get an answer; are still confused but don't want to delay the lecture further

In contrast, with on-demand videos and some online question solution, non of the above is a problem I would argue. Also students can actually ask quality questions because they have time to process the material. 

Shouldn't this be way more convenient for the professors themselves? Instead of giving the same old lecture every year, how about you record it once and over the years iteratively improve/update the sections that are unclear or have become outdated? 

Another argument I hear is that live lectures impose a regular schedule. And I get that. Just having **something** every week puts the thing you have to learn back on top of your internal priority queue. But you certainly don't need lectures for that. How about exercise classes, where students already had a chance to engage with the material in advance?

So why? The amount of time and cost and effort of so many people in universities all around the world that goes into this must be enormous. Even though all the stakeholders should be incentivised to get rid of the lectures.

You probably recognise that I'm quite annoyed by this. But I'm even more annoyed by the fact that this seems to be such an unpopular opinion. Even if I talk to other students, many of them also think that lectures are important. Although they themselves go there and basically play Candy Crush for 90 minutes. And they admit that.

All of that makes me believe that this is merely an outgrowth of status-quo bias. But given that almost nobody seems to agree with me, maybe you guys can point me to something I'm missing here? Do in-person lectures actually have some great benefits? Or am I just looking at the wrong sample? Are the in-person lectures actually in decline?

### EDIT

Don't get me wrong. I love math and theory. I genuinely just have a problem with the format: live lecture."

It's just that nobody has adequately addressed my concerns over the years, and my own casual research into this topic hasn't addressed my questions either. **I sometimes use a bar of soap, but I'm not convinced this is necessary.** While I'm not angry at Big Soap, I am reminded of the fabric softener I grew up with and how, in retrospect, that was wholly unnecessary. 


Parameters:

* To be clear, I'm very much in favor of soaping one's hands. Clean hands have prevented countless deaths and illnesses. Not arguing against that.
* Washing your face prevents acne, pimples, etc. Makes sense. Not arguing against that.
* Washing your hair with shampoo can be useful for regulating the oils on your scalp and keeping your hair healthy. Not arguing against that.


My qualms are with soaping **your body** — your torso, arms, legs — in a setting where you're bathing in **chlorinated water**.


Why do people use body soap?

* To remove filth
* To be healthy
* To smell nice


**To remove filth.** 

* As far as removing filth from the body, I think the kinetic movement of water from a shower or scrub will adequately remove most dirt, grime, etc. from the skin. If I literally wallowed in a pit of mud for some time, I think a quick rinse in a shower would sufficiently remove all of said mud. This is essentially what we do at beaches. 
* **The only exception where soap would be useful** would be in scenarios where you have grease or other hydrophobic substances clinging to the body. In such cases, yeah, soap will be useful for removing that. But I reckon most people rarely have grease or substantial amounts of hydrophobic substances clinging to their torsos, arms, or legs. If you're a mechanic or bicyclist with grease on your hands or ankles, you can clean those with hand soap.


**To be healthy.** 

* I already recognize the need to soap the hands and use shampoo. And if you're about to receive surgery, it's important to sterilize that area. But, in general, my chest and back and armpits don't need to be perfectly sterilized. And even if that were achieved in the shower, it would be undone the moment I left the shower and was exposed to the bacteria/viruses in the air. Our skin does a pretty great job of keeping pathogens out, and most of us can live in non-sterile environments.
* I don't understand why chlorinated water and kinetic movement of flowing water isn't sufficient for cleaning the skin for day-to-day living.
* Frankly, I'd need to see clear evidence that a soapy torso prevents illness that would otherwise occur if the person had merely rinsed their body in chlorinated water. **If someone can give me that, I'll 100% change my view.**


**To smell nice.**

* A rinse in the shower adequately removes sweat and filth from your body. You don't need soap to remove that. A short rinse will leave your body smelling neutral.
* Sure, soap can smell nice and obscure body odor. But deodorant and perfume do this too. Shampoo, conditioner, and other hair products often have scents too. And skin lotions. How many scented products do you need?


So, yeah, convince me why I should regularly use my bar of soap. CMV!"

________________________________

Whenever abortion is discussed or talked about it seems to me that most people fall into one of two camps: 

One one hand you have those who think abortion is akin to murder, and obviously should be banned. 
 
On the other you have a lot of people who seem to think that anyone who is sceptical to abortions must be some sort of religious fanatic, and that abortions are obviously not problematic. 

I know there are many people who don't fall in to any of these camps, of course, but the discussion of abortion is almost always very polarized and polarizing. And I don't feel like either side ever talks about how complex I feel the moral question of abortion is. 

Let me first be clear: I don't support the Supreme Court of the United States' decision regarding RvW. And I think living in a society where access to legal abortions (with some limitations regarding how far into the pregnancy an abortion can be performed) is better than the alternative. 

Also I think sex-Ed and access to good and cheap contraception, as well as better support for young and low income mothers and children are the best ways to reduce the number of abortions in a society, and that this should be highly prioritized. 

All that said, I still think abortion is an extremely complex moral issue. Even if I think abortion should be legal, at least to some extent, I can't help but feel that abortion often to some extent is ending one life (even if it is not a full human life yet) in favor of the convenience of another. 

There are of course good reasons to support abortions: It must be extremely hard to raise an unplanned and unwanted child. Family planning is extremely important when it comes to getting out of poverty, and of course there are many cases where it is necessary from a medical standpoint. Not to speak of cases such as rape, incest etc. There are of course many more arguments here, and I won't go too much into them as I suppose this is the prevailing opinion, and as such it seems unnecessary. 

On the other hand, I think there also are reasons that abortions in many cases are morally problematic, and this has to do with what value we assign to the fetus. First of, if you are to allow abortions, almost everyone agrees that there need to be a limit to when a pregnancy can be terminated legally. At some point the fetus becomes a human. And I think any concrete line we draw is really subjective and unconvincing. I really struggle to see why a fetus is 'just a clump of cells' one day, and a human the next. If I were to draw such a line, conception seems to be the only logically consistent option.

The alternative seems to be some sort of sliding scale. And if there is a sliding scale that means that the fetus at all points to some extent is a human, if not fully. If so an abortion is ending the life of something that to some extent is human. And even if it is not a full human life, that is something I think deserves careful consideration, before it is ended for the convenience of another. This does not mean in my opinion that abortion is never right. But it does seem to me that it means that abortion rarely is obviously and unquestionably right

Also I find the 'my body'-line of arguments hard to agree with. The fetus has another DNA profile than the mother. That makes it quite clear to me that it is not literally part of the mother's body (or, even if I should accept that it at one point is part of the mother's body, we are back to the above argument - at which point does that change?) 

That is not to say that the wishes and opinions of the mother is unimportant in any way, far from it! But I don't think the fact that the fetus exists inside the mothers body removes the moral difficulty conserning abortion. 

So to sum up: You don't have to convince me that abortions should be legal. I'm pretty much on board there. 

But I do think that there are good reasons to consider it a very complex issue, and not nearly as black or white as most people seem to make it. 

I do think that a lot of conservatives oversimplifies the issue, by saying it is plain wrong and to not consider the impact an unwanted pregnancy can have on the mother and those around her. But I disagree just as much with those who seem to claim that it's just a medical procedure, which does not have etichal considerations connected with it. 

I would love to hear opinions different than mine on this issue - hence this post. I would love to hear your thoughts."

(Outside of dating people who only care about looks),u/AriValentina,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vqy3yp/cmv_pretty_privilege_doesnt_exist_outside_of/,changemyview,"*Im only making this post because my brother just said that the only reason people laugh at my jokes is because I'm pretty. Not because they are actually funny. Which lead us to a discussion about ""Pretty Privlege""*

First off rather or not someone is pretty is **100%** an opinion. So there's no technical way of measuring if ""more attractive"" people have more privilege than others. Who I find attractive could be the least attractive person to you.

I consider myself attractive. Others could agree or disagree and that wouldn't change my opinion on that. So just to set an example, I have gotten compliments, people have told me they think I am attractive, and I have a boyfriend.

***If I wasn't pretty would I still get compliments?*** Yes, because there are always going to be people who compliment you.

***Would people still find me attractive?*** Yes, because being pretty is an opinion and there's always going to be people who find you attractive. In fact there's probably so many people I've come in contact with that think I'm ugly. Theres celebrities that have a title of being ""sexiest man alive"" and stuff like that. There are still people who find those people non attractive.

***Would I still have a boyfriend?*** Yes, maybe or maybe not the same person though, that is impossible to tell. Think of how many people you see everyday who are married or have a S/O.. Do you find all of them attractive?? If yes then you must just be a really nice human being and I wish I was you.

I can't really think of anything that I have **only** because of the way I look. Maybe if I signed up for modeling I could get more gigs/callbacks? Thats a given though since thats PRETTY MUCH the whole point of modeling. Even with modeling though, just because you are pretty doesn't mean you have the target ""look"" that the specific modeling agency is looking for.

I get a lot of attention from females, but is that because Im pretty or is that because I'm a gay male who easily gets along with females. People in public are generally nice to me, is that because I'm pretty or is that because Im a friendly person? I work a job that I really like, is that because I'm pretty or is that because my resume had qualifications for the job? Literally the only thing I've ever felt pretty privilege in is Tinder likes, comparing my numbers to some friends.Even that though is nothing to be proud of, I used tinder for like 3 years and all I got from it was sex and being ghosted after being used as a ""pretty boy."" Regardless that falls into ""dating people who only care about looks"".

I could be completely blind of the so called privilege that I am receiving and other people are receiving, but I highly doubt it as of right now, unless you can convince me otherwise. All Im saying is, everyone is pretty to *someone* so wouldn't that mean everyone gets that same privilege? From different people? So it wouldn't be privilege it would just be everyone getting that same treatment at different times."

All life is not intrinsically good.

We’ve all seen the rise in post across the internet discussing abortion. Many people from the pro-life side seem to believe that all life will be intrinsically good, and completely ignore the quality of life that the child gets depending on the parent and their situation. The mother is only regarded as the vessel to carry the child and less human themselves. I will attempt to explain my side but please I would love be to educated on your point of view.

1. If you believe that all life deserves the upmost protection then please response to this: all humans suffer and some much more than others. So if you have a human child they will suffer. Abstinence is the only way to prevent pregnancy 100%. I argue that if you truly love your child and want to keep them safe the only way to do that is if they are never born in the first place.

2. My birth state is Mississippi so I’ll use them as an example. Mississippi has some of the worst education in America. It is one of the poorest states in America. It does have the highest rate in teenage pregnancy. I understand that you live in a fantasy, but try to imagine a young girl barely in high school pregnant. She has a high chance of already being poor and have a poor education. Couple that with the fact that she does NOT WANT to raise a child. Tell me the life you imagine them having?

3. Why don’t we talk about the implications of being raised by a parent that doesn’t want you? I’m sure there are plenty of real life adults walking around now completely mentally damaged because they weren’t loved. Not everyone will embrace a child like a miracle.

4. You say it’s a religious reason. I’m not sure what biblical text you subscribe to but if you’re god is from an Abrahamic religion I have bad news your god supports abortion. If your stance is supported by an a
Abrahamic religion, you need to explain these acts 

• A pregnant woman who is injured and aborts the fetus warrants financial compensation only (to her husband), suggesting that the fetus is property, not a person (Exodus 21:22-25).

• The gruesome priestly purity test to which a wife accused of adultery must submit will cause her to abort the fetus if she is guilty, indicating that the fetus does not possess a right to life (Numbers 5:11-31).

• God enumerated his punishments for disobedience, including ""cursed shall be the fruit of your womb"" and ""you will eat the fruit of your womb,"" directly contradicting sanctity-of-life claims (Deuteronomy 28:18,53).

• Elisha's prophecy for soon-to-be King Hazael said he would attack the Israelites, burn their cities, crush the heads of their babies and rip open their pregnant women (2 Kings 8:12).

• King Menahem of Israel destroyed Tiphsah (also called Tappuah) and the surrounding towns, killing all residents and ripping open pregnant women with the sword (2 Kings 15:16).

• Isaiah prophesied doom for Babylon, including the murder of unborn children: ""They will have no pity on the fruit of the womb"" (Isaiah 13:18).

• For worshiping idols, God declared that not one of his people would live, not a man, woman or child (not even babies in arms), again confuting assertions about the sanctity of life (Jeremiah 44:7-8).

• God will punish the Israelites by destroying their unborn children, who will die at birth, or perish in the womb, or never even be conceived (Hosea 9:10-16).

• For rebelling against God, Samaria's people will be killed, their babies will be dashed to death against the ground, and their pregnant women will be ripped open with a sword (Hosea 13:16).

• Jesus did not express any special concern for unborn children during the anticipated end times: ""Woe to pregnant women and those who are nursing"" (Matthew 24:19).

I’m concerned more about the quality of the life. If you can’t afford to give them a decent life they shouldn’t be born into this world. If you can’t keep them feed, and secure housing then don’t bring them into the world. If their needs can’t be met without great comprise then I don’t think the child should be born. Consider the points above and let’s talk."

Too many people are making uneducated votes and most get their information from social media, a source that many can agree is one of the best at creating confusion and misinformation.

The required education that I'm proposing would ensure that the voters would make their best subjective decision and hopefully not get caught off guard or regret their decision."

I don't think anyone can truly integrate the advice of more than 5 people and make something out of it. By the time the 5th person tells you something, you probably forgot what the second and third said. It's quite alright to bring the subject to a small group of friends, but I don't think you're actually there for advice. Every time I've asked something in a group chat with my 5 closest friends, I've never gotten useful tips."

27,2022-07-04,CMV: Trump will not face any criminal consequences from the events of Jan 6,u/spiral8888,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vr4kok/cmv_trump_will_not_face_any_criminal_consequences/,changemyview,"First, I acknowledge that there was a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/t8n6qb/cmv_trump_isnt_going_to_face_any_punishment_for/) 4 months ago with almost the same title. However, that was before the Congress hearings were being shown. That's why I think there is a new development on this. 

So, the media has been calling the hearings, especially that of Cassidy Hutchinson as ""bombshell"" (eg. [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/28/politics/trump-blindsided-january-6-hearing/index.html), [USA Today](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/29/cassidy-hutchinsons-bombshell-donald-trump/7767294001/), [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/3544775-sunday-shows-preview-cassidy-hutchinson-gives-bombshell-testimony-before-jan-6-panel/), [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/key-takeaways-cassidy-hutchinsons-bombshell-testimony-jan-committee/story?id=85880256)). Some legal ""experts"" and other commentators have said that this will now lead to the prosecution of Trump. 

I sincerely wish to see Trump behind bars. A president who so blatantly challenges the peaceful transfer of power that is the cornerstone of representative democratic political system should face some consequences but I just can't see how that would actually happen. 

Here are a few arguments:

1. The prosecution of Trump would have to be absolutely water tight. If there is any risk for failing in court, the political ramifications of the prosecution would be huge. It would solidify Trump's claims of a witch hunt and pave way to his election in 2024. So, even if the prosecutor would think that in a normal case he would have enough evidence for a conviction, in this particular case he would likely keep the bar even higher. 
2. Even if there is already a lot of evidence of the conspiracy to overturn the election results especially by the lawyer John Eastman, I think Trump is still able to wiggle out of that by throwing him under the bus. 
3. Trump's own verified activities will be very difficult to prove to be illegal. Yes, he had a rally. Yes, he told the people in the rally to go to the Capitol. Yes, (if we trust Hutchinson's testimony) he even tried to get there himself. Proving that any of that is illegal, is going to be really hard. 

So, change my view and show that there is a genuine chance of him actually getting prosecuted and then convicted. 

(Just to clarify, please don't present arguments regarding the tax case in New York. That's a separate and interesting case, but it's not directly related to the peaceful transfer of power. Prosecutions due to other events between the election and Jan 6 are ok, but I don't think anything has changed there due to the hearings.)"
0,2022-07-04,CMV: People should only be required to wear clothing when their bodies are going be in prolonged contact with public surfaces like seats.,u/physioworld,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vr4m48/cmv_people_should_only_be_required_to_wear/,changemyview,"Imo there are two main reasons to outlaw public nudity:

1. morality/decency. Some people think nudity is inherently wrong on some level or that it will be inherently damaging to children to see naked strangers. 
2. Hygiene. Clothing acts as a barrier between you and your fluids/shedding and the rest of the world. 

So on the first point, nudity is natural, not to say that natural is always good, but we all have bodies and nobody can convince me that there’s something inherently wrong with nudity. I could be convinced that it could be damaging to children but I find it unlikely. 

I would still outlaw the kinds of harassment that are already illegal, but I don’t understand how just seeing a strangers penis or vulva when they’re minding their own business and doing something non sexual could be seen as damaging to kids, but I could be wrong. 

On the second point, I suspect it probably is a bit more unhygeinic. The last thing you want is an accidental skid mark to be left on a bus seat, so I think that we shouldn’t be able to just drape our “core body” over public access surfaces. 

However walking on the street, we already avoid contact as much as possible with people, so it’s not like naked people will get their germs on you more than others, with the possible exception being in very busy streets, but even then I’m not too sure that a momentary brushing against someone naked is unhealthy. 

If there are other reasons to legally prohibit public nudity, I’m all ears.

I believe that people who think this is a convincing argument should also believe that a person's right to survive by receiving a new organ is more important than people's right to decide what happens to their own body after their brain death. 

Both arguments have a very similar structure.

 The US also supports 3/4 of authorian governments and has imposed dictatorships by toppling democratic governments. It also has one of the lowest COVID vaccination rates in the rich world due to misinformation. Despite its pretensions to individual freedom, America has one of the most militarized police in the world, a strong security state (NSA and PATRIOT ACT), and a history of violently censoring dissidents, especially Communists. Also, America has strict drug laws and a hugh incarceration rate.

Most other rich nations have a wider range of political parties and thus a broader spectrum of views, whilst America has two main parties which are fairly similar to one another. About 20% of Americans believe in QAnon and most registered Republicans think the 2020 election was stolen.

It could for exemple be a pill that you take each morning and allow you to be more focused or more energetic. I think those molecule already exist, many are considered drugs. 

Obviously those meds should be controlled in quality, guaranteed without secondary effect and without risk of addiction, and ideally prescribed by a doctor so you can have the correct posology.    

We human are already ""augmented"" by all our tech, and we have the knowledge to make those medications, i see no ethic or moral reasons to pass on it. Some people already try to microdose certain...substances, but with industry standard it could be way more efficient and a lot less risky.

I do not speak about some *limitless* fantasy, but if a pill existed that could help me be more energetic and focused, or have a better memory, or help me need less sleep, i'll be happy to take it given that it don't have big risks for my health.

You text them, they don't text back. Week after week they hear the ping, pick up the phone, unlock it, read the message, lock it, put it down, go back to whatever else they were doing. What do they say when we confront them about it?

"" i KnOw I'M sOrRy I'M a BaD fRiEnD""

"" sOrRy I'Ve BeEn SuPeR bUsY ""

And other such things. Annoying but that's life, right? Everyone gets busy, and going quiet for a while doesn't necessarily mean someone is being rude, but one thing we all hear from time to time is so much more ridiculous: ""i TyPeD oUt A rEpLy AnD fOrGoT tO hIt SeNd"". Let's unpack this.

Right off the bat, it strains credulity. Surely anyone old enough to be my friend (let's say 20 and older) has the brain development required to understand cause and effect. If you understand that your phone beeping means there's a message, you probably understand that the incoming message caused your phone to beep / flash. If you understand the process enough to know that not hitting send means I won't receive the message, surely you can grasp the inverse of that: to send a message, you must hit send.

So what are the solutions to this question? Either A: your attention span is so weak that the half second between finishing a text and hitting send is too long and you actually wander off into other things, or B: you're full of shit and don't want to tell the real truth, whatever it may be (it wasn't a priority, you're upset with me, you don't want to be in contact with me).

We can discount B: dishonesty because it's not really what this post is about. This leaves A, indicating you're such a scatterbrain that you quite literally can't hold a simple action or thought in your head for one full second. If your brain is really that disjointed, I find it hard to believe you can remember anything phone-related, such as charging it, paying the bill, remembering to keep it with you, not dropping it, etc.

Editing a quick update because I forgot to mention: I get that people could be forgetful / get interrupted here and there, of course. This post specifically refers to people where it happens All The Time. Once in a while sure I get, but if it's the norm, that's the point I'd say you need some form of intervention, or just say ""hey I can't communicate by text message"" and we can talk on the phone or email, what have you."

1. They are a fire hazard. Every year there are news stories about some home burning down due to DIY fireworks.

2. They are a nuisance. The noise from inconsiderate dipshits that like to set them off at all hours of the night are annoying to responsible people and scare the shit out of most pets.

3. They are dangerous. The same normally overprotective parents that, on any other day wouldn't let little Johnny ride his bicycle without a helmet and basically full body armor, suddenly deem it ok to let him play with fire and explosives.

They have all succumbed to totalitarianism/censorship, bad design, and toxic communities.

- Reddit: Most popular communities are controlled by the same people, and vaporize accounts with the wrong political opinion. If you say the T word, your account will be vaporized (I'm not even a supporter of the T word, but it is totalitarian for people who do to be unpersoned for their beliefs). Many subreddits are groupthinks, either people support you like puppets or end up hating you. Also both the desktop and mobile app are atrociously designed.


- Facebook: Nobody uses it anymore except boomers, ads and data collection. It also doesn't let you sign up without a name it chooses from their whitelist of names! 

- Twitter: Insane verification system. It locks your account if you DM/follow more than 5 people, requiring you to enter a phone number.

- Instagram: Most of the same issues as Twitter, except its motivational quotes and onlyfans scammers. 

- Amino: Has gone way downhill since the founders left. The app turns your phone into a frying pan and is packed with ads, most moderators are corrupt and ban people for whatever, insane spam limits if you try to DM a bunch of people, and IP bans affect your entire home network!

- Project Z: Most of the same problems Amino has, except worse UI. Insane spam limits if you try to dm people one-on-one

- Tiktok: More of a content-delivery system than a social network, really hard to do one-on-one chats, have discussions and make friends there.

- Discord: Tries to push Gmail-only account and phone verification (though hasn't gone fully insane yet by forcing it), most Discord servers are hard to navigate, and has insane spam limits if you try to DM people one-on-one.

- YouTube: Totalitarian regime under the mask of as social network. Removed dislike button, vaporization of videos with political opinions the founders don't like, comments have insane spam-filtering limits, the UI is atrociously slow, and it's really hard to find videos that aren't corporate shills.

- 4chan: Just as much as a groupthink as Reddit. Site design is terrible, no support for DMs and there overall isn't much interesting content there.

- All the alt-tech sites suck, so you get no alternative. Sites like Shitchute (have to word that differently because of Reddit censorship) and Poal are populated people who think there are lizards in the government, Odysee and Mastodon are dead except for crypto scammers and mirrored content.

So we can conclude that there is no social media today ticks all these boxes:

- Lets you only use email signups
- Has a decently-active community that isn't crypto scammers or conspiracy theorists
- Functions well enough (posts, comments, dms without any glitches)
- Doesn't vaporize accounts for saying the wrong thing
- Lets you freely DM people one-on-one without any spam limits

This is so insane to me, like what the fuck happened here? How has it gotten this bad and why is there still no alternative? Honestly I'm thinking of coding my own social network without any of this, I already know a bit of Django, but of course the problem is making it be popular."

My first thought was that it was a rundown shithole in the middle of nowhere that didn't even have a Starbucks. But then an elderly man held the door for me with a smile. The woman behind the counter wished me a good day with the stereotypical ""y'all come back now!"".

I looked around the town as I left. A small community bank. Neighbors celebrating the 4th together around a bbq. A farmer showing his son how to drive a tractor. Trees EVERYWHERE.

The environmentalist in me realized I wanted the same thing as this rural, Southern town: for it to STAY a rural, Southern town.

Somehow both liberals and conservatives have been led to believe conservative=Republican and liberal=Democrat and that the other side is trying to destroy our country.

I'm liberal, but I think there's value in ""looking before you leap"" on social issues (and think the Democratic party has taken PC too far)

I know conservatives that believe in the integrity of the Constitution (and think the direction the Republican party has taken violates that)

But so many issues are lumped with one party or the other that we're forced to choose, which divides us into echo chambers. I see so many posts on Reddit about cutting off ties/relationships based on politics. That defeats the WHOLE POINT OF DEMOCRACY.

I'm a liberal that will defend the 2nd amendment because I support our Constitution. I know conservatives that want gun control because they think owning something designed to KILL warrants enforcing responsibility.

I'm a liberal that questions the morality of abortion. I know conservatives that don't think Roe should have been overturned because it was for the wrong reasons.

If we can't converse about our differences we'll never develop solutions. And right now there are a lot of important problems that need solutions.

**Edit**: RIP my inbox. I would love to respond to all comments, but it's gonna take a while.

For those responding that I'm coming from a perspective of privilege: yeah, so? If you have privilege, please use it to engage in the democratic process of civil discourse. If you don't have privilege, I recognize it will be harder for you, but please also engage in the democratic process of civil discourse.

For those saying civil discourse is impossible because the other side is too crazy/stupid/aggressive/blind/etc. - I especially encourage you to engage in civil discourse; you may be surprised with what you find.

For those pointing to historical figures that were assassinated for this - we have anonymous forums online now; they didn't. Also, they were killed to be made an example of to silence the rest of us: did it work?

For clarity: [Civil discourse is the engagement in discourse (conversation) intended to enhance understanding; Civil discourse exists as a function of freedom of speech. It is discourse that ""supports, rather than undermines the societal good"".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_discourse)"

Wade and 100% pro-choice especially as a person with the ability to get pregnant. I believe overturning will have horrifying results (and already has like that 10 yr old in Ohio) both in terms of abortion itself and the precedent it sets for the restriction of the right to contraceptives and the restriction of the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community (which we’ve already seen states beginning to do). I also have a deep hatred for those justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade and wouldn’t miss a beat if some tragedy were to befall them.

That being said, the amount of racist shit I’ve seen said against Clarence Thomas deeply disturbs me as a black person. Obviously you’ve got people using the n word (which frankly I don’t like but I’m not that bothered by at this point) people saying they hope his rights as a black person (aka the rights of all black people) are next, and even people saying they hope the KKK attacks him.

I don’t know if I can say whether or not he deserves the latter things to happen to him because really I do think he specifically along with the other justices that voted like him deserve to suffer for what they’re putting people through, but I feel like people are using this as an opportunity to spew whatever racist bs they can without consequences.

I guess my main argument against this is that there are going to be assholes in every minority community, but them being garbage doesn’t mean that prejudice against the communities they’re a part of is okay. His clear lack of regard for the people that will be affected doesn’t justify bigotry against black people as a whole."

This leads to the situation that mainly majority opinions are present in the general subs and minorities separate themselves in specialized subs.

The situation is especially bad for newcomers like me. I looked at posts that I found interesting and tried to answer to comments only to discover that I have not enough karma. Then I tried to post about it but didn't have enough karma for that either. The message was always that i should gather more karma by commenting or posting without actually telling me where i can do that. 

I hope that I can post it this time after gathering a little karma.

Edit: I think that the bad effects of karma prevail the good effects and it should be completely removed or replaced with something better. CMV

Edit 2: I marked a delta and I edit this to show my change in view. I think that the karma systems good effects might prevail the bad effects. But only slightly. I still think it needs to be improved a lot.

Perhaps there could be an appeal system where you can appeal against down votes that you think are not justified. Then the mods or another board of neutral peers have a look at it and if they agree the downvotes get removed and everyone who downvoted gets a downvote as kind of a small punishment for misusingthe voting system. If the board disagrees they could double the amount of downvote or so to disencurage misuse of the appeal system.

Edit 3: an even better idea comes from u/Xilmi

&gt;I think that a great way to avoid down-voting-abuse would be that people had to elaborate their downvote, e.g. cite which rule they broke and that at least the person who was downvoted should be able to read these explanations. That should prevent the vast majority of downvotes that were just caused by the invalid reason of ""I disagree"".

I hope this gets implemented."

In this case I’d be referring to race discrimination, and things that don’t vitally make you different as a human being.

My point is, equality isn’t always justice. For example, it would be equality to give men as long a maternity leave as women, but why do we not give men a long maternity leave?

Another example: equality would have everyone have the same opportunity for any job as others on the same level. Why do some jobs still attract more men than women while some jobs attract more women than men? That’s not equality!

The point here is, that equality is not the gold standard. For example, the sex divide. People of the two sexes are fundamentally different and as such need to be catered to according to their needs and not on the basis of equality. 

I hope the idea is clear."

The same goes with degrading democracies: the involve many more moving parts than a dictatorship does, and so it's harder to create them and make them sustainable. 

It's also worth noting that asymmetry of information plays into this as well. In times or places with less access to information, it's far easier for some to dominate the playing field and use force or charisma to make people obey them. Even in the modern day, the rise of fake news and disinformation can ensure that people remain in echochambers, or simply become polarized enough to be manipulated by fearmongering. In most countries where systems of power aren't controlled by the State, corporations usually take their place. Either alternative ensures that non-democratic practices will exist. Even if none of this were the case, people are irrational and will probably never have the time or inclination to gain the knowledge required to keep a firm and fair grip on power. Those who do tend to be the minority, and often have an incentive to join the elites themselves. 

Maybe even more than that, our human nature means that either we're terribly short-sighted, or can be too blinded by fear and hate to make the right choices as a collective. All of this means strongmen and other opportunists will always have the opportunity to rise up. Unless human nature changes, I doubt we can create a world full of stable democracies. 

Lastly, I want to note that rising conflicts between superpowers, climate change and economic downfalls due to Covid have put humanity at least a few steps back. And there's no indication these problems aren't going to get worse. Stability is key to fostering democracies, and I see no sign of that in the years to come. Existing autocracies don't seem like they're anywhere close to being eliminated, and if anything they seem to be consolidating their power. Hong Kong is a good enough example of how typical anti-authoritarian tactics have been ripped apart in the face of a powerful government. 

**TL;DR: Human nature and existing circumstances make it much more likely that democracy will not substantially increase globally in the future, and if anything further backsliding is very possible.**"
0,2022-07-05,CMV: If you're pro-choice on the grounds of supporting bodily autonomy then you should be against vaccine mandates.,u/Objectionne,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vrsxi8/cmv_if_youre_prochoice_on_the_grounds_of/,changemyview," I'll start by clarifying my exact stances on these issues.

\-  I am pro-choice. While I have personal doubts about the morality of  abortion, I believe that the choice ultimately lies with the woman as to  whether she'd like to use her body to support another life and if she  would prefer to terminate that life then she should have the right to do  so. ""Her body, her choice.""

\- I  am vaccinated against COVID-19. If anybody were to ask me if they should  get vaccinated against COVID-19 then I would encourage them to do so.  The scientific consensus is pretty clear that the benefits of being  vaccinated far outweigh the small risks. However, if somebody prefers to  not receive the vaccine then that should be their choice. A government  should not be able to legally compel a person to undergo a medical  procedure. Putting heavy restrictions on where that person is able to go  and how they're able to live their lives without undergoing that  medical procedure is akin to forcing them. ""Their body, their choice.""

However,  I see quite a lot of people who are pro-choice - citing bodily autonomy  as one of the main reasons - who support vaccine mandates.

Here are the reasons that I've seen from people who defend this stance:

\-  Being vaccinated against COVID-19 helps to protect the lives of people  in the community around you, so people should be compelled to do it.  However, I think this is inconsistent with other accepted norms  regarding the extent we should be forced to protect others. We can't be  compelled to donate organs to save other people's lives. We can't be  compelled to donate even *money*  to save other people's lives. We can't - or in my opinion shouldn't be  able to - be compelled to carry a foetus to term to save that child's  life. Why then do many people accept that we should be compelled to be  vaccinated in order to save other people's lives?

\-  An argument against the previous point might be that in the vast  majority of cases being vaccinated is not going to cause you anywhere  near the level of harm that say donating an organ could and so it's more  justifiable to compel people to do this. However, if we accept in other  matters (such as abortion) that bodily autonomy is a fundamental human  right then the actual risk of being vaccinated should be irrelevant - if  somebody doesn't want to do it for any reason, whether it's rational or  not, then they shouldn't have to do it.

Looking  at abortion and vaccine mandates, I think there's also an argument to  be made that mandating people be vaccinated is a greater violation of  bodily autonomy than outlawing abortion. Demanding that people *must* undergo a particular medical procedure is a greater affront to liberty than saying that people are *not allowed* to undergo a particular medical procedure.

I  find the issues of both abortion and vaccine mandates to raise a lot of  ethical questions and I could go back and forth on either in my mind.  I'm interested to hear other people's stances and particularly why some  people support bodily autonomy heavily in the abortion argument but not  in the vaccine mandate argument."

0,2022-07-05,CMV: Believing in the MOASS (mother of all short squeezes) in GME has similar parallels to alien conspiracies.,u/kris_lace,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vs1qdi/cmv_believing_in_the_moass_mother_of_all_short/,changemyview,"When it comes to alien theories there's 3 main arguments: 

1. Statistical - the argument that statistically, it's absurd to rationalise that life on earth are the only intellectual life forms in the universe.
2. UFO's - IF you didn't know already, UFO's are a widespread officially acknowledged real phenomena. Confirmed by US. UK and several other governments as well as Nasa and a large amount of individuals working in those areas and pilots. However, as far as I know there's no comprehensive proofs that UFO's are attributed to aliens and say, not defence operations or some other phenomena. 
3. Expert testimony - Obviously, many hundreds of thousands of people have claimed to have had E.T contact. But we focus here on the 'professional' or 'experts' who'm are primarily whistle-blowers or otherwise sane professionals who'm one might attribute a higher accuracy in their claims. 

To summarise, the likelihood of the existence of aliens is statistically likely. It has *suggestive* *evidence* for the hypothesis, but has no **direct** evidence. So it remains a theory, one that's probably unfairly categorised as a conspiracy theory. We define *suggestive evidence* as evidence of UFO's or expert whiteness testimony. We define *direct evidence* as something that can be repeated in a scientific setting or objectively proven without reasonable doubt and scientifically verified. 

In the case for Aliens, while it's statistically probable and it has a a significant body of suggestive evidence - no direct evidence exists. 

When it comes to GME I will similarly segment 3 main arguments:

1. Mathematical - there's a number of mathematic and financial proofs that make the MOASS statistically probable. Specific metrics such as the % of float verifiably attributed to retail ownership, numbers for Failed To Deliver on GME stock - as well a number of key metrics that describe how unavailable GME stock is to borrow. 
2. Due Diligence (DD) - this describes the objective fact based arguments that propose a MOASS hypothesis.  These DD's vary in number and area of expertise but together, outline a comprehensive body of suggestive evidence for the MOASS hypothesis. Key areas such as citations of regulatory literature, descriptions of Hedge Funds movements and insights into areas those with a short position are subject to be margin called.
3. Expert testimony - these are the financial market and regulatory professionals with a deep first hand insight into the markets. They have engaged well with the community and have offered professional insights for the case of a MOASS hypothesis. 

To summarise GME. The likelihood of MOASS is statistically likely. It has *suggestive evidence* for the hypothesis, but has no **direct** evidence to explain why with so much suggestive evidence, why it hasn't happened yet. So it remains a theory, one that's probably unfair categorised as a conspiracy theory. 

So bringing both theories together we have:

* In the case for Aliens, while it's statistically probable and it has a a significant body of suggestive evidence - no direct evidence exists. 
* In the case for GME MOASS, while its statistically probably and had a significant body of suggestive evidence - no explanation can be given as to why, despite the evidence, MOASS hasn't happened yet. The DD for the MOASS hypothesis was as true a year ago as it is today, yet since then we've observed no short squeeze. 

So today, I present a view that there are key parallels between both theories and their nuanced positions. Particularly, the fact that despite the overwhelming suggestive evidence for aliens, the fact that there's no direct evidence somewhat contradicts the theory. Likewise, for a GME MOASS the fact that despite the overwhelming evidence for a squeeze, the fact one hasn't happened yet somewhat contradicts it being plausible.   


Note: To the keen semantic amongst you (and of course you should be welcomed in this sub) I realise that my argument is vague and therefore hard to proof wrong. I want to say, that while I genuinely have this view, I also post this more for entertainment and/or a spur for some interesting discussions. But of course, I will 100% play by the rules and for those semantically inclined; *I will proclaim my view changed when an argument is presented that dispels the significance in both theories being paradoxical in that despite the evidence for each, the fact that neither E.T contact has been demonstrated yet or MOASS has happened.*"

0,2022-07-05,CMV: Women should start charging for pregnancy,u/rebel_way,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vs23to/cmv_women_should_start_charging_for_pregnancy/,changemyview,"In the spirit of Roe v Wade being overturned, I’ve given a lot of thought to how this idea of “personal responsibility for pregnancy” is used to justify limiting abortion. Ergo, if you are of childbearing age and choose to have sex, than you should be willing to carry a fetus to term, give birth, and raise a child for 18 years.

Well, I’m a big believer in personal responsibility as well. And given the fact that this child is equally the responsibility of their father, I submit to you the following: Since men are unable to experience the physical responsibility of unprotected sex, women should charge them for the labor, risks, and results of pregnancy. I’d say $50,000 is more than reasonable for pregnancy.

Let’s say you want a baby and cannot have one. Surrogacy costs between $80,000 - $200,000, depending on where you live. Average cost of adopting a baby is somewhere around $70,000. 

Women who choose to have children losing about $16,000 a year in wages, and this doesn’t even account for the fact that medical complications of pregnancy can ultimately result in more long-term healthcare costs for women.

In addition, women should be able to sue for child support at whatever point state law dictates the fetus has a “right to life.” Of course, paternity tests would be mandatory for this to work.

When you look at these costs, I think paying your wife or girlfriend $50,000 for a baby is a bargain! 

Of course for this view to work, you’d have to accept that the father is 50% responsible for every unwanted pregnancy. And I do accept that. 

If a man really didn’t want to cause a pregnancy, he would wear a condom or get a vasectomy. If you’d like to argue that SPECIFIC point with me, you need to make a case that a man cannot prevent pregnancy with 100% certainty, *but a woman can.*

What if you don’t want a baby, but she does? Too bad. You should’ve known while having sex that impregnating a woman and financially supporting a birth is a real consequence of sex. If you’re not willing to accept that consequence, you should not be having sex.

Ultimately this whole idea is an extension of child support; instead of only paying periodically to support a live child, men should be financially responsible for the inherent labor, lost wages + health risks of impregnating a woman.

CMV!

Tl;dr Pregnancy + labor is just that…labor. Women should be paid to do it, and the men who impregnate them should pay for it.

EDIT: Thanks to everyone who replied in good faith.  To those who didn’t, I invite you to unpack why this idea was so upsetting to you.

I am going to stop responding to any comments that do not address the core principle of my argument, which is that pregnancy should be a shared burned and men can share that burden by compensation. I’ll check back later and reply on any other comments that are engaging in the discussion productively."

I believe humans are very feudal in nature. The era of kings and queens survived for thousands of years and while the idea of democracy has been more than a thousand years old it never came to be reality until the last 60-70 years. 

We had perfect conditions for democracy to thrive in the past 60-70 years. Tech had not evolved to the extent that it could be used to manipulate and control people. Now tech has evolved to the stage that it can and is being used to manipulate and control large populations. There are solutions but I believe due to our feudal nature the ones at the top will never give up their control over this power. The tactics they use to control people are also very feudal in nature. For example the major debates are about superiority and inferiority in terms of religion, race, nationality or caste. 

The era of kings and queens is now slowly making a comeback with the billionaires controlling govt and policy. The govt no longer works for the people but works for the ‘rich man’"

For thousands and thousands of years religion ruled harshly mankind, putting Tradition above all and reigning surpreme as one of the great masters of mankind. What we are seeing right now is not a decay, just the return to the steady state of mankind in terms of society and beliefs. As Sad and unfortunate as It is, and as much as i am in support of all of those things, its undeniable that religion and Tradition is way stronger than any other form of progressive ideals that we had on the last 100 or soo years. We fought hard, and we still do, but religion has a lot more power than anything that we can argue on with rationality, It appeals to our most primitive feelings and is way easier to get followers than philosophy and other means. The downfall of progress in the US is Just the beginning of a much longer process that Will soon affect Europe and latin America, as Christianism rises once again into prevalence, now radicalized with modern technology and other means. The pendulum theory already pretty much confirmed that the steady state of mankind is religious and conservative, not progressive as most desire."

1743,2022-07-05,CMV: There is no such thing as excessive force when dealing with burglars or people breaking into your home,u/TurboTortois3,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vs5nq9/cmv_there_is_no_such_thing_as_excessive_force/,changemyview,"Everyone knows about the movie Home Alone. A 10-year-old defends his home against a pair of burglars. Lately, I have heard people saying that Kevin used excessive force when defending his home against those burglars, using flamethrowers, broken ornaments, paint cans, etc. However, I believe that his actions were justified. Many people might say that he should go to jail. I would have bought him as many cheese pizzas as he would have liked to make up for his family eating it all. Had those two burglars died while committing the crime, it would have saved everyone trouble, especially Kevin in the next movie.

First, there is the saying that a man's home is his castle, and he has the right to defend it. I think this should mean unlimited amount of force. If someone does break into your home, it is very likely that he or she would want to steal your valuables, and if he is mentally insane or something, might want to harm you or a loved one for no good reason. I don't really see why you shouldn't be able to defend yourself with a firearm or a deadly weapon, such as an axe, provided that you are legally allowed to own one. There's no good reason for the law to say that you MUST retreat. I shouldn't be expected to first thing call the cops, because they will take too long to get to my house and deal with the burglars. By then, one of my loved ones might be hurt, and all my jewelry and electronics will be gone.

Second, the burglar should have assessed the risks of breaking into a house, which is a crime in itself. I think that the law stating that excessive force should not be used just makes it so there are more burglaries, because a burglar will know that they will not be grievously wounded or killed while committing that burglary because the law somewhat protects them in that regard. If a potential burglar knows that they could be killed or crippled in the commission of a burglary, they would be less inclined to actually go out and commit the crime.

Finally, I have heard that it is illegal to shoot at a burglar who is running away with your stuff. Honestly, I think that this is stupid. I get it if they are no longer in your property, or if innocent bystanders could be hurt, but am I supposed to just let them get away? Even if I were to call the cops and the burglar was arrested, they might have already sold some of my stuff, and there would be no guarantee that I would ever get it back. A diamond ring that my grand uncle left me after they passed? Gone. My PlayStation 5? Gone. My iPhone 13 (or whatever is the newest model)? You guessed it, gone. Some of these items would be gone forever, all because you can't shoot at a burglar who is running away.

So, all in all, I believe that there is really no such thing as excessive force when dealing with a burglar.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I don't always mean lethal force when talking about ""excessive force"". Sometimes, just brandishing a weapon to defend your home already constitutes ""excessive force"" in many places. As for the part about shooting a burglar who is running away with your stuff, I don't mean lethally.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2: I see how many people are talking about the part where a burglar tries to flee with your stuff. Besides deadly weapons, I'm sure that chasing the burglar down and beating him up is still considered a lot of force but it's not usually deadly.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 3: When I say burglar, I mean some violent guy who will steal everything you have, hold your family at gunpoint, and is armed with a weapon. Not some drunk who staggered into your house just looking for loose dollar bills or spare change for some booze money. So please assume that it's a violent criminal, not a harmless guy.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 4: Really wish I could change the title. I've kind of changed my mind about all burglars.

11,2022-07-05,CMV: Abortion is not killing a baby,u/KimJontheILLest,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vs6wut/cmv_abortion_is_not_killing_a_baby/,changemyview,"Even the most liberal, modern abortion laws are designed to prevent the termination of viable fetuses, which are distinguished by having a heartbeat and having developed the neural pathways necessary for consciousness. Because this development occurs at between 24-28 weeks, abortions -- except for when the mother's life is at risk -- are only permitted before 24 weeks. These laws strike a balance between protecting a woman's right to choose with the moral concern for taking a life. These laws also have the distinction of being based on scientific fact. 

This is in contrast to what's probably the main argument heard from opponents of abortion -- that abortion is the killing of an unborn child. This argument in underpinned by the false assertion that life begins at conception, or somewhere about, a radically false statement that can only be justified by religious dogma and other forms of non-scientific literature. 

In truth, abortion is not killing anything -- at least not killing anything that resembles a form of thinking, feeling life that we cherish, protect, and bestow rights upon. Rather, by taking something that could become life and preventing the natal process from proceeding, abortion exists as a form of late-stage contraception. From a moral perspective, the stakes are identical to using a condom, an IUD, or the day-after pill. And so it comes as no surprise that some of the people cheering on the overturning of Roe v. Wade are also calling for prohibitions on contraception as well. 

Not only are claims that abortion is the act of killing a baby demonstrably false, it is a cynical rhetorical device based on willful ignorance, which underpins a more insidious agenda predicated on the desire to control all people's reproductive rights wholesale."

0,2022-07-05,CMV: The way we handle transgenderism is logically inconsistent with how we handle other but similar issues.,u/legaless101,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vs7r63/cmv_the_way_we_handle_transgenderism_is_logically/,changemyview,"I hold this viewpoint because I’ve noticed peoples reactions and treatment to those who identify as transgender seems counter to their beliefs and views of relatable circumstances. I’d like to know if their is some nuance I am missing or something inherently flawed about my viewpoint. I have three main points in regards to my viewpoints on this issue.

Point number 1: It is my understanding that race is much more of a social construct than sex is. We are currently unable( and possibly never will be able) to determine a persons race by genetics, only heritage. However sex can be determined by genetics by looking to see if an individual possesses or lacks the Y chromosome. This being the case it seems logically inconsistent to tell a man who has transition to a women or a women who has transitioned into a man that they are the gender they now identify with while also telling a person who is born one race and transitions that they are not the race they now identify with. By extension of this it seems inconsistent that a person who transitions sex isn’t accused of cultural appropriation when( for better or worse) genders do have a culture. 

Point number 2: There exists a certain subset of people who believe they are disabled in ways that they are not physically. This is a very small subset admittedly. I’ve read about a man who cut off his arm as he believed he was truly an amputee, a women who blinded herself as she believes she is truly a blind person trapped in a seeing persons body, and another man who cut off a leg for similar reasons as the man who cut off his arm. These individuals do not seem to regret the choice of doing so however if they came to their doctor with the desire to amputee/blind working limbs and organs they would be denied.

Point number 3: Individuals who go through extreme body modifications such as greatly enlarged breast implants, butt implants, synthol injections, and other very noticeable physical modifications are likely to be diagnosed with body dysmorphia. Which is considered a mental illness. However those who seek to transition go through similar and even less reversible modifications are only considered to have gender dysphoria which is not a mental illness.

Edit:

For the 1st point it’s been brought to my attention that those who consider themselves transgender will likely have the brain of the gender they identify with and are not born with. I.E. a biologically born male who feels they are a women will likely have the brain of a woman. Whereas while males and females have identifiable different brains those of different races do not. So I acknowledge the difference in those two regards. 

For point 2, I now understand that those who suffer from BIID do benefit from the elective surgery to remove the limb/organ they believe they shouldn’t have in a very similar way to those who suffer from gender dysphoria benefit from surgery to change their gender. While I object to both on ethical grounds I acknowledge and cannot refute the benefits of these surgery’s for the afflicted individuals. 

For point 3, I was wrong from the beginning as gender dysphoria is a mental illness according to the DSM. I am frustrated that so many sources online would say otherwise but that is on me for not vetting my sources properly. 

I appreciate those who took the time to truly respond to this post as I have learned a lot while also being presented with more questions than I began with."

22,2022-07-05,CMV: Russia is overly dependent on artillery and I don't see them holding this advantage through the length of the war,u/Krenztor,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vsa2vi/cmv_russia_is_overly_dependent_on_artillery_and_i/,changemyview,"**TLDR**: Russia is currently only moving forward using artillery.  IF they lose artillery superiority, can they find another way to continue to make progress?  If yes, what other ways do they have?  If no, can they retain this advantage?  If they lose this advantage, will they be able to make a defensive stand to hold off the growing Ukrainian military?

Russia recently completed their conquest of the Luhansk oblast and already control over half of the Donetsk oblast.  They appear to be well on their way to take over the Donbass region which is one of Putin's stated goals.  Along with this they control a land bridge to Crimea as well as Kherson and some surrounding territory.  On top of this they've continued to make slow but steady progress ever since pulling back from other northern regions to focus on Donbass.

That said, Russia seems like a one trick pony as they have come to rely on making gains through use of heavy artillery bombardments.  Let's look at the other segments of the Russian military outside of artillery.

**Navy** \- Early on in the war they used their navy to seize Snake Island and some sea assets around Ukraine and continue to uphold a sea blockade.  Ever since the sinking of the Moskva they seem to have admitted that their navy isn't going to play a significant offensive role in the war outside of some sporadic use of sea based missiles against Odesa.

**Air force** \- Military analysts have been scratching their heads since the war started at how Russia's air force hasn't been able to control the skies.  The ship seems to have sailed as Ukraine continues to be provided with more and more anti-aircraft weapons.  No doubt their air force can play a supplemental role in the war, but it isn't going to be something they can rely upon to dominate the Ukrainian forces.

**Tanks** \- Putin certainly thought that his tank and other mechanized forces would be enough to crush Ukraine early on, but after their underwhelming performance around Kiev, it seems apparent tanks, as with the air force, will be supplemental at this point and not act as a way to move the line forward.

**Infantry** \- Due to Russia not being willing to declare war on Ukraine and instead sticking to the ""special military operation"", Russia is starved of infantry if anything which has made taking cities like Mariupol and Severodonetsk incredibly challenging.  They are not acting like the Soviet Union of old that threw hundreds of thousands of troops into the meat grinder to push the line forward.  They can ill afford to even lose troop right now especially after losing so many experienced troops earlier in the war.

**Missiles** \- The shock and awe tactics that started this war have rapidly been drawn back as it appears that Russia's missile stockpiles have been drained as far as they are willing to allow them to be over a war with Ukraine.  Surely they have many missiles held in reserve for other defensive purposes, but it doesn't seem like we are going to see another round of shock and awe especially given all the missile defense systems coming into Ukraine.

My concern for the Russian war machine is that if they ever have their artillery threat countered, then they really don't have a good alternative way to continue.  So the question I have in my mind is what are the odds that Russia is able to maintain artillery superiority throughout the remainder of this war?

I've heard a couple analysts say now that artillery has a certain limit to how many times it can be fired before it needs to be re-bored.  These same analysts questioned if Russia has the capacity to re-bore so much artillery all at once or if it is going to need to constantly cycle out artillery at some point meaning that the artillery we've seen up to this point marks the high water mark for Russia and it is going to face a permanent reduction as the war wears on.

Then there is the question of anti-artillery and heavy artillery weapons coming into Ukraine.  Currently these devices are in very short supply, but I don't think there is any argument to be made that those numbers will only increase.  I heard one analyst say that about 20% of all artillery in Ukraine right now is foreign and that number is expected to ramp up dramatically through the end of the year.

I haven't heard that the sanctions should have any affect on Russia's ability to continue to produce artillery and ammunition so I don't see them as a hinderance.

The conclusion I've come to based on the information I have at hand is that Russia **NEEDS** to maintain their artillery advantage if they want to win this war.  I am uncertain whether they will be able to do this or not though the longer this war goes the lower their odds drop.  If the west continues to supply Ukraine, then Ukraine is currently as weak as they will ever be.  Russia is almost certainly as strong as they will ever be right now and will only continue to get weaker as we have watched them become only a few months into this war.

The only x-factor I see for Russia is the use of **nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons**.  If they were to use these, then the outcome becomes almost impossible to predict.  I hope we don't ever get to find out what happens if Russia decides to use these methods."

If we can discriminate cops based on their ""choice"" of occupation, then so should people getting abortions. If an employer wants to *only* hire people who have had abortions, that's their right, same as vice versa. I know this is an extreme view, and I am trying to change my view to something less extreme, but at the moment, consequence free abortion - which is what I believe 95% of pro-choice want, seems more evil to me than this.

Quick list of pros and cons

* Pros

1. In the rare cases of rape, incest, or the mothers life at immediate risk, in which all sides of this debate agree their should be no social stigma this would exonerate you socially.
2. There would be hesitation to terminate a potential life for ""convenience"".

* Cons

1. There would be hesitation to terminate a potential life for ""convenience"".
2. Hard to prove conception from rape."

I vote in all elections, local and federal. I have written to my elected officials. I see both anecdotally and in official data that most Americans share my core political beliefs. But nothing really changes.

America, throughout the years, has become viciously efficient at undermining democracy around the world, both through overt and covert actions. It seems as though these tactics are also being applied to the American people.

PRISM, Guantanamo, Operation Condor, etc. (plus all of the recent political decisions that are seemingly made in dissent of the majority) clearly demonstrate that the American government can and will operate independently of the interests and desires of its citizens.

Whether it’s for control, trade power, or lobbyist money, the government is rapidly accelerating the adoption of actions and ideologies that are in stark contrast to what its citizens actually want - despite society becoming more liberal at an even faster rate.

Lobbyists and organizations (both government and government-adjacent such as NCOs) have exponentially more sway than the American people. I’m aware that, to a degree, the capitalist system is designed this way, and the majority opinion has never necessarily been the basis for our rule, but my anecdotal feeling is that things are less aligned with the interests of the people than they have been in the past.

Other examples: majority are pro-life. USA actively covering up torture in Guantanamo and spying on its citizens as I mentioned earlier. Coverups of innocent civilians slaughtered overseas to line the pockets of billionaires. And the list goes on.

How is the average American supposed to make a difference nowadays when the government will do whatever it wants publicly regardless of the interests and desires of its constituency, and will just make rulings / operations secret if they know we will disagree too much? The whole state of our lives feels utterly hopeless. 

Note that I’m discussing federal (and state to a limited degree) politics, not local politics which people seem to actually have a voice in.

Also note that I’m not talking about any crazy conspiracy theories, just things that are known the be factually true, however it does beg the obvious question of what else the government is doing behind our backs."

If a person has a repeated history of assault and abuse on others is mentally disabled to such a degree that they can no adequately take care of children without neglecting them then these people should be sterilized. 

REASONING: (I don’t believe children should suffer because of somebody else’s choice if that means they can not make a better life for themselves. If a parent kills their child before they even have the chance to grow up that child suffered for almost nothing why should we allow this to happen? Another reason is personal experience I have seen the affects abuse has on people’s mindsets my mother was abused when she was a kid and that really tore her life apart. Another reason why I believe this is a better option than say foster care  is because my mom struggled to go to college she had no financial support without parents so until CPS is fixed wouldn’t  it be better to put a temporary solution namely sterilization.)


(Explanation of system and why)
If you believe in my body my choice then don’t some Pro Choicer’s  believe an individual no matter how evil their intentions are should have the rights to their body? And don’t some Pro lifers  believe that all lives deserve a chance and that all (human life) that is should be protected. This is a a problem I see with both these ideas.  I ask the question to both factions of philosophies. Would you allow a potential abuser, neglecter, Predator, Sexual harasser etc to have a kid of their own knowing their is a possibility that these individuals may or may not abuse and possibly kill their kids? I think it is Justifiable to force Vasectomies and Tubal ligations on these individuals. See as in the case of Gabriel Fernandez, or the Turpin parents who Tortured abused, starved and chained their own flesh and blood to Walls and Beds. Another example would be in this case linked Here were a Drug Addicted women Abused, Neglected and eventually killed her 5 year old son it was all preventable had we stoped this person from being able to reproduce. Because CPS in America wasn’t helping in all cases. My mother was beaten as a child by her Drug addicted mother and had no real parents throughout her life because the father was not present she was taken away from the custody of the mother. I heard some Pro choicer’s  say giving abortion rights to these individuals would stop things like this from happening. My answer is no it wouldn’t if these individuals knew they could had gotten an abortion and chose not to and now a child has to suffer because you have gave this person the choice. And these children have no chance at life  they will be killed by the hands that should be protecting them
This system isn’t just assuming someone can’t bear the responsibility of raising children it looks at the criminal history of an individual and checks does this person have a history of repeated abuse assault and or molestation of others and if they fall into that category they should be sterilized. You may not know for sure that this person will beat or kill their kids but look at it this way. If you see a man with a criminal history of Violence Mental illness etc walk into your gun store would you let him buy a gun? Of course not it’s not because you know they will be a shooter it’s because it’s predictable that this person has a higher probability to shoot up a school than someone with no criminal history or mental illnesses."

He was simply the most successful con artist in American history.",u/HalfWayDead87,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vsj74k/cmv_trump_was_never_a_politician_a_racist_or_even/,changemyview,"I do believe Trump is racist, but not any more racist that any other 75-80 year old man. At his very worst 30/40 years ago he’d be considered a liberal. 

Trump inherited a fortune, which adjusted for inflation would probably be less than his  current net worth. By all accounts he made some decent investments on real estate in the 70’s, albeit backed by tax payer money. However, all of his other business ideas and businesses for the next 2 decades flopped miserably. He may be the most litigated man in American history. 

By the early 90’s Donald Trump was a punch line in late night comedy shows. Banks wouldn’t loan him money, and he became more or less a B List celebrity. He was a professional wrestler, appeared in popular sitcoms, starred in Pizza Hut commercials, and made brief cameos in popular movies.

Ironically it was playing a successful businessman on a reality TV show that revived the viability of the Trump brand. The producer of the wildly successful Survivor series wanted to create a business world equivalent of Survivor, and wanted to use Trump for name recognition. Initially Trump thought of reality television as beneath himself, but thought of it as a free way to promote the Trump brand. Trump had been inept in the business world for 2 decades by this point, and the producer thought his office was tacky and dated to the 70’s so they built him a fake contemporary office. 

The show was wildly successful and marketed Trump to the masses as a successful businessman. He was able to make his brand solvent by licensing his name to properties the world over, and claiming he owned these properties with his name plastered everywhere. 
 
It was around this time that Barack Obama had succeeded the historically unpopular Bush 2. Trump made himself the political Skip Bayless. He opposed anything Obama from his birth certificate to his healthcare plan. He became a fixture on conservative news media for his anti Obama stances on everything.  

Trump became the darling of the Republican primaries. He said things other Republicans would only imply. There were a demographic of Americans that hated Obama and what he represented and Trump’s strategy was to tap into that hate. He famously promised to “ban all Muslims”, promised to build a border wall, and called Mexicans drug dealing rapists. He was all marshmallows no lucky charms. His years of pro wrestling and reality television made him the perfect political heel. Down to the chants and juvenile name calling. Pocahontas, Lying Ted, Sleepy Joe, “Build the Wall”, “Lock Her Up”…once he got some momentum he hired white nationalist Steve Bannon to be his top advisor and doubled down on everything that made him successful.

My theory is that Trump never intended to be president. He just wanted to shake up the system and promote his brand. Actually being elected president was a burden he didn’t anticipate. Ultimately being president revived the viability of his brand, and despite his comical incompetence he could hire qualified people to keep the machine operating. Once he acquired the highest level of celebrity and power he ever achieved power was not something he’d readily relinquish. The byproduct of his success is that the right has become a political sideshow, and their biggest celebrities are the most politically viable. The most batshit crazy right wing nuts have the biggest followings."

0,2022-07-06,CMV: Men shouldn't support Roe v. Wade,u/_thiagoo_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vslg8h/cmv_men_shouldnt_support_roe_v_wade/,changemyview,"I saw a r/Trueoffmychest story and wanted to share my story and get thoughts from everyone. It's a bit long but maybe you'll understand where I'm coming from.

I (16f) got 2 sisters and 2 brothers. We've always been pro-choice and quite liberal even though our parents are a bit conservative. 

My second oldest brother (let’s call him T) just graduated and won a scholarship to a prestigious college. He has a girlfriend, TG, who graduated with him and she was waiting to hear back from the colleges she applied to. They've been together for 2 years now. 

A few months ago, TG told T that she was pregnant. He said they talked about it, how they were too young to handle this right now and how they needed to get settled and have an income before even thinking about children. And since T's moving in a couple months, they decided to get an abortion. 

A few days later, TG msgd him and said she's changed her mind. She didn't want T to go to college and asked him to get a job to support them. When T didn't agree, TG told her parents and created a huge argument and got our parents involved as well. TG talked about how the child was gift from God and how her parents wanted them to get married and stay with them. When T didn't agree, everyone including family and friends started bashing him. How it was his fault for having sex, how he should have worn a condom even though TG was on the pill and how he should man up and suffer the consequences of his action. Reluctantly, T agreed.

This is where it gets interesting. TG received an acceptance letter from a good college and suddenly her whole family's attitude towards the pregnancy changed. Now TG had decided she wanted to go to college and that she's gonna have an abortion. Naturally, everyone was thrilled at the idea (except the parents of both sides, but her parents sided with her decision ) and all their friends complimented her on how she's an empowered woman, who's planning ahead and thinking of the future etc. Obviously T was happy but I can't shake the feeling that his future was on the hand of a girl. That whatever the girl decided was the path he was gonna have to take. 

Now, all my friends are liberal and pro-choice and they take part in the protests. I still support pro-choice, because in any case no government, state or institution (unless medical) should have a say on whether or not I carry a child to term. But I shouldn't be able to wholly decide for myself and another person. The issue I see here is if it takes 2 people to have sex and conceive a child, and both those people need to support the child when it's born, how is the decision solely relied on the woman?

We need something that allows both the parents to have some kind of say. I'm not saying the guy can force the girl to carry the baby to term but at least if only the girl is interested in the birth, then the guy should be able to sign away and not be responsible for a child that they didn't want to have instead of throwing their life away. 

TLDR;
Men should fight for a better system than Roe v Wade where they're input, lifestyle and choices matter. They shouldn't be responsible for a child that their significant other solely decided to have. 

PS. The other post I'm talking about is where a guy says he's happy his gf had a miscarriage. They're both 18 (I think) and he had no say when she became pregnant. His words were ""... And has made it abundantly clear that we would be keeping it"". How does society accept this?"
2,2022-07-06,CMV: Quantum computing invalidates the Copenhagen interpretation,u/ImpossibleSquish,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vsma82/cmv_quantum_computing_invalidates_the_copenhagen/,changemyview,"The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics has never sat right in my mind. It doesn't seem intuitive. The Everett interpretation makes more sense to me. But I don't want to fall prey to confirmation bias, so I'm seeking out opposing views.

I'll describe the difference between the two interpretations, as I understand it, by referencing schrodingers cat. Schrodingers cat is a thought experiment. There's a good description of the hypothetical setup on this page:
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrödinger%27s_cat

Copenhagen interpretation: the cat is both alive and dead, until you observe it, at which point it becomes one or the other.
Everett interpretation: there is a wavefunction that describes a quantum multiverse containing a universe in which the cat is alive, and a universe in which it is dead. When you observe the cat you become part of the wavefunction. A version of you observes an alive cat, another version of you observes a dead cat. From your subjective point of view the cat is one or the other, not both.

Some people may find the idea of a multiverse contained in a wavefunction equation to be unintuitive, but to me mathematics - even the idea that my physical existence is inside an equation - makes more logical sense than the idea that a cat is both dead and alive at the same time.

The most common response I've heard when supporters of the Copenhagen interpretation are asked about schrodingers cat is along the lines of: it doesn't matter. Science is based on empirical evidence, not philosophy. Ignore the cat superposition. What matters is what we see when we observe. The rest is just a convenient way to make sense of and predict what happens in quantum experiments. It doesn't represent reality.

But the thing is, in quantum computing, a qbit (a computing bit in a state of superposition) is very much a part of reality. The computer uses them to make algorithmic calculations. How can we just accept them as a convenient means of explaining something without accurately representing reality, if computers are literally running off of them?

Anyway, I'd love to hear the viewpoint of supporters of the Copenhagen interpretation. If I've gone wrong somewhere, I'd like to know."

2,2022-07-06,CMV: We should treat non-western political actors as moral agents,u/phileconomicus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vsn3ys/cmv_we_should_treat_nonwestern_political_actors/,changemyview,"So I notice that when bad things happen in a non-Western country they are routinely analysed as the moral responsibility of actors in the West - governments, companies, intellectuals, consumers, etc. 

For example, 

* Responsibility for wars is assigned entirely to the Western country involved (or ally in the case of Saudi Arabia in Yemen). 
* Governments' oppression of gays and political opposition is routinely described in terms of 'colonial era laws'
* Government dysfunction and corruption is blamed on Western consumers/companies' demand for natural resources 
* Terrible environmental and labour regulations (or enforcement) are blamed on Western consumers (as if children digging up coltan by hand makes our phones cheaper)

Obviously there are exceptions to this. e.g. Al Qaida and ISIS were identified as moral agents in mainstream analysis, and so has Russia. But I think it is quite pervasive. (And even for those counter-examples, there is a strong counter-current of analysis seeking to pin the real blame on decisions by the US or NATO)

In the context of the current decolonisation movement, this seems rather bizarre. It seems to betray a pernicious asymmetry in the recognition of moral agency between Western and non-Western actors. Western actors are assumed to have the power to make decisions that matter and to bear moral responsibility for their choices. Non-western actors are not. This asymmetry is unfounded, patronising and unhelpful - it continues rather than repudiates the West's unfortunate colonial history. 

Hence my CMV: I think non-Western political actors have the power to make significant decisions and should be held morally accountable for their choices just as people in the West hold our institutions and leaders accountable."

* I realize that the series titled ""Baki"" on Netflix is not the beginning the story, so it might not be the best place to be introduced to the series, however I didn't know this before starting to watch it

I'm not going to sit here and act like I'm a pretentious intellectual. I mean, I love the Marvel movies and plenty of Shonen-style animes, so it's not like I'm sitting here sneering at anything that isn't ""high art"" while sipping tea and reading the New Yorker. It's not like I can only be entertained by literary masterpieces or anything.

But this series seems like it's marketed for no reason other than ""hurr durr, look at violence. Isn't fighting SO COOL?""

To put that into perspective, I *love* My Hero Academia. Which, being basically about super heroes, has a lot of fights in it. So what's the difference? The *emotional weight* and the *stakes* of the fights.

When I get hyped for a fight in MHA, it's because of what the fight means to the fighters involved, and sometimes, society as a whole. This is completely absent in Baki, where there IS no point to the fight aside from seeing who's better at fighting. 

This Baki series begins by introducing 5 death row inmates who are all martial artists (but 'dark' as in they don't follow any rules) as they brutally escape from confinement and all head to Japan to ""taste defeat."" So, basically, it seems like it's getting set up to have them all fight Baki and the other protagonists that were introduced in other works. Ok, sure.

But eventually I lost interest and watched purely to see how utterly insane it would get because it does.

It seems like every episode they introduce some brand-new character who exists only to act as representative of some real or fictional martial art. The series went from having like 10 fighters and some side characters to, like, 30 characters that I can't even keep straight. 

They'll even be like ""here's a character you've never seen before. He's mastered making his hands and feet deadly weapons""...just a few episodes after that was some *other* fighter's whole shtick. There's so many scenes where I'm like *what is the POINT of this scene?* I'm watching some dude I've never seen before fight one of the criminals, and then next episodes, it's like it never happened.

* You can't care about any of the characters because they exist simply to fight, and don't have any relatable qualities
* If the series DOES try to make them relatable, like Baki's relationship with his girlfriend, it's so sappy and amateurish that it ends up being annoying or funny, not heartwarming
* The characters often have ""Michael Myers Syndrome"" in that they can just be anywhere, at any time, as if they have omnipotent knowledge of where everyone else is
* The series seems to exist just to put epic blows on screen and have people recoil in pain from them. As if, that's it, that's the show; watch gory fights because violence is cool

I have ADHD and play violent video games and watch violent shows and even I feel like this show is the most juvenile thing I've ever seen. I don't understand how even a teenager would like this because there is simply no narrative weight to any of its violence when compared to just about any Shonen anime. Naruto, One Piece, Bleach, Dragonball Z, etc are all *not perfect* and often appeal to a *younger crowd* yet they still all depict fights far better because the fights are established to actually *mean someting* aside from just pitting characters who have no identity aside from their fighting ability seeing who's better.

Am I wrong here? What am I supposed to be getting from this show? I'm finding it hard to respect any man who's into this show (I'm also a man) because it would make me think he's got absolutely no taste at all."

No. For me, a night in cooking and small talk -- like, say the abortion issue (yes, I'm that guy that would bring this up as small talk), with two or three friends or family, is much more my speed. I find it intensely stimulating and simultaneously comforting (not abortion, but the act of embracing deep conversation is comforting and meditative and reflective). *However*, this means that in social situations I just... fail. Miserably.

I'm sure it is a matter of ""social interaction training"" you could call it, seeing as how I grew up in a cult that was hinged upon *not interacting with the outsiders* (Jehovah's Witnesses, those sociopaths.) But this unfortunate reality has left me unable to ""Do social interactions"".

I can be quite charming and witty, but put me around a group of people that are *normal* (whatever you may determine that to be is probably what I'm thinking as well), and I just can't do it. And on top of this I think my upbringing really has helped me embrace introversion, and I really enjoy it as well, but shit. It can make you feel pretty shitty when it seems society *very much so prefers* (but never explicitly says) extroversion. It is presented everywhere as the thing to do: The career world, for instance, and the drive to network, chit chat and build what can feel like genuinely hollow and/or contrived connections. I know that these connects don't have to be contrived, can be genuine, but if the process feels so foreign, it is very hard to embrace wholeheartedly.

My CMV proposes that we need to move toward a normalization and embracing of introverted people. And I say this quite clearly: I should be able to just say to people, ""you know, I'm really not into this. I'm an introvert, you know? It's no reflection on you, I just prefer to do *xyz thing*."" Maybe this will even help people understand me better? Because just trying to go through the motions is a total bitch. But is this not a good idea? Am I just supposed to ""learn extroversion and straining social interactions for my perceived societal benefit and to limit the stress on society?"" (lol I know that that statement is a reach)"
0,2022-07-06,CMV: Vegan leather should not exist,u/Bojangly7,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vspceu/cmv_vegan_leather_should_not_exist/,changemyview,"Vegan leather is a leather-alternative sometimes made from mushrooms. It is used to replicate the look of leather while not actually using animal products. 

In the US leather is used from the skin of animals often animals that are slaughtered for meat. If leather were not made from this skin it would simply be wasted. 

The end goal of veganism is to eliminate animal husbandry. However in the current society it exists. The best thing to do would be to use traditional leather. Some vegans argue against the cattle industry because of the large amount of greenhouse gases released. If there is leather available choosing to ignore this and spend resources to produce vegan leather is putting more of a tax on the environment not less. 

It makes simple sense that in a society that has animal skin to be used that it should be used.  

The obvious hole here would be vegans who put animal rights above environmental issues sometimes because they feel its more moral and my opinion on that is that in fact is immoral to ignore environmental issue that are affecting humans and cows both to only focus on cows. 

Vegan leather should not exist because there is no moral argument for its existence."

Every time I date a woman I just realize how fucking annoying it is in comparison to dating a guy. Before I go into detail I have to say there are exceptions, probably a lot of them, and I know that, which is why I said ""a lot of men "" and not ""all men"". But talking about in general not every case.

With that out of the way I'd like to start at the beginning of the dating game: showing interest and asking out

This is where the, as I have noticed reoccurring, theme of women putting in zero effort first surfaces. As the bi dude I get some of the gay guy privileges in girl groups so I do talk w a lot of them and I have known girls that have had a crush for YEARS and have made ZERO effort of trying to find out whether he likes her back or even just establishing any relationship with them, they legit just wait for them to make a move. This isn't even the worst I've witnessed as there's girls that legit reject a guy to play hard to get. WTF?? I know that that's a very small portion of women so I won't be generalizing this bt this does say some things about straight people's dating life and how fucking retarded it is for men. I am certain that this generation will end up as one of the ones with the most men that die single. 

Now look at gay guys. They're super up front with it, both try to put effort into building and most importantly maintaining a relationship.

Because  this is the second part women have these huge standards for what their boyfriend should do, especially thanks to the internet, namely tiktok, with videos of couples looking perfect and the comments being things like ""if he doesn't do this dump him"" etc, auch i could rant about for hours but I think it's obvious that the videos don't show the flaws in the relationship that EVERY relationship has and only these highlights. But a lot of the women I've been with or friends of mine have been with have put such little effort in any of it. it's always the guy who takes them on a date, buys stuff, brings flowers, helps with any problems they're having, be it mental or like fix something. Again, these aren't all women, but I feel that the percentage is just so much higher than it is with men and I mean a lot higher. My best friend is a girl and she's a fucking gem in that regard, she constantly attempts to help me with my mental situation and is generally someone I can really vibe with. This shows me two things: again that not all women are terrible I'm this regard, but also that women are able to put more effort in, I mean again I often chill with girls and they do care for their friends and all try to provide support, atleast some do, which wasn't that much of a thing in most Male friend groups I was part of. why not put that effort into dating? 

I already know what the reddit hivemind will say. ""this guy got rejected by a girl and now he's mad at girls because he can't pull any."" or something along those lines and that's fine if you want to believe that I can't change that all I can say is that I do indeed suck at dating, but i atleast try not to and I do regularly also pull a gf or bf for a while else I wouldn't have the ""experience "" necessary to come to this conclusion. 

then why am I bi and not gay? because no matter how I see it women are generally way hotter than guys appearance wise. there are exceptions here too but in general women are just way better looking than we are and I do believe that I'll be able to find a gf that doesn't do these things.

I also just realized I should probably clarify that I get that men can be very unpleasant to deal with too, I mean I have also had some shitty experiences with men but those are problems that already get adresses a lot on the internet while I don't see anyone talk about what I just brought up."

For example Mao zedong claiming to be communist when in reality he starved to death and killed millions. 

But If a leader was mentally stable and a true communist that believed everyone was equal and actually cared about people’s well-being then it would be a fantastic idea. 

Like the leader could share the wealth equally amongst the population so that there would be no poverty and starvation and homelessness either. There wouldn’t be snobby billionaires who lived in ridiculously luxury mansions or starving homeless people on the street. Everyone could have a regular apartment and a good supply of food and clothing and other necessities. Then we could achieve equality and there wouldn’t be class divides and class discrimination anymore

EDIT: you guys made me realise that my communist idea is unfortunately just a fantasy that wouldn’t work in everyday society :((( no matter how mentally stable and passionate the leader would be :("

At the same time, I think the pro-gun control side are very focused on mass shootings. Despite the fact that mass shootings statistically kill very very few people. 

https://www.statista.com/statistics/811504/mass-shooting-victims-in-the-united-states-by-fatalities-and-injuries/


It's pretty rare that the US, a country of 320 million people, even see 100 people killed in mass shootings per year. In most years the number of mass shooting death is single or double digits. To put things in perspective the probability of dying in mass shooting is lower than literally being struck by lighting in the US.

Even for gun deaths as a whole mass shootings hardly accounts for 0.2% of total. The leading cause of gun death (over 50%) are due to suicides. Almost all homicides are conducted with hand guns, not assault-style weapons or whatever gun control advocate seem to focus on. And they focus on them as result of mass shootings.

If we are gong to talk about gun control, we should at least focus on the type of shootings which statistically kill most people and happen more frequently. Not very rare incidents.

E: Ok so this kinda blew up and I won't have time to respond to everyone. I'm also not really trying to argue for or against gun control, just the centrality of mass shootings to the entire debate. So I'm just going to respond to the most relevant arguments. But thanks to everyone for their comments."

I let them know I didn’t have an issue because it was strictly platonic and we both agreed on a bar. They wanted me to meet them at their place and we’d walk the rest of the way so I said sure. I Ubered there and they kept saying they were getting ready and overall it took them almost 45 min to come out. I only waited that long because 15 min in I order a Uber home and It didn’t get there. When they did come out they didn’t look AT ALL like they did in their pics. I’m pretty sure it was their face but heavily edited. Anyway, not wanting to be mean I told them we should head to the bar because it closes in a few hours. It’s a 10 min walk which took 15 min and we didn’t make it because they randomly kept stopping and walking back the way we came. At this point I ordered a Uber and faked a call to come home because I was very sketched out. When I got in the Uber I immediately reported them (reason: does not look like their picture). I think the account got banned because the person the person later texted me angry saying it was due to transphobia but I just blocked them. 

I did somewhat do it out of annoyance and take a little enjoyment they did get banned, but also felt that it was in line with the rules of the app and probably best for their safety and others. I would’ve done the same for anyone else so I don’t think it’s different just because they’re trans

So can you cmv and help me see it from their perspective"
23,2022-07-06,Cmv: The relative world peace (compared to pre 1945) is coming to an end.,u/Torotiberius,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vsrvef/cmv_the_relative_world_peace_compared_to_pre_1945/,changemyview,"Basically my theory is that the trend of massive wars costing millions of lives was essentially put on hold by the use and threat of nuclear weapons.  I feel as though the use of such terrible weapons is almost guaranteed once the last people to ever witness them in person have passed away.  

The current war in Ukraine has only made this even more clear. I have seen countless people say that nuclear weapons can't really be that bad and the media repeating false information such as describing thermobaric weapons as the mid point between conventional and nuclear arms.  Many of these same people want NATO to intervene which would almost certainly make this regional conflict to explode into a much larger conflict similar to WW2. 

The threat of turning the wild into a nuclear wasteland with billions of casualties used to be enough to keep the world powers from engaging in direct conflict. The problem is that it appears that the use of nuclear weapons is essentially off the table because of the implications of their use. This will increasingly encourage bad actors to push the envelope potentially leading to a huge global conflict. While in the past, this would have definitely been horrible, it would not have led to the possibility of a losing country having to make a choice between the complete destruction of itself (ie: Nazi Germany) or having a line, that when crossed by their enemy, triggers the death of the a majority of the world population.  

The other parallel situation that is clearly evident in the USA and other countries, is the internal division and increase in political violence. My personal experience comes from living in the USA, and I believe there is a massive lack of shared cultural values that contributes to the ""othering"" of large groups of people that have never even met each other. The  internal instability of the worlds only true super power has massive repercussions in the way that less powerful countries interact with each other. Not being sure it's the USA will support them if they are invaded leads to possible alliances with nations that are far more likely to take advantage of them.  

Please let me know if you agree or not. If not, I'm open to having my mind changed.

Thanks!"

I realize that many Redditors find guns distasteful, but I'm not interested in debating guns or gun ownership in this thread. 

The SCOTUS ruled that the subjective ""proper cause"" requirement of NY's pistol permit regime was unconstitutional.  The idea being that a constitutional right should never be beholden to the whims and opinion of a single government bureaucrat, and any requirements should be objective.  In response, NY's governor Kathy Hochul has gone off the deep end signing any ridiculous gun legislation that flies across her desk.  NY has been signing tons of gun restrictions into law for years, but it's escalated to a very troubling level.  

The new restrictions include things like giving access to current and past social media accounts to the licensing officer to review them to see if anything the applicant may have posted would, in the mind of the licensing officer, be objectionable and disqualify the applicant.  She also expanded the list of ""sensitive places"" where guns are banned to include government buildings, schools, colleges and universities, medical facilities, churches, libraries, entertainment venues such as theaters, arenas, and stadiums, bars, any restaurant that serves alcohol, and more.  In fact, guns are banned in any business that doesn't post a sign saying they are explicitly allowed.  A CCW holder that happens to walk through a public park on their way home, or picks up some takeout could be convicted of a felony.  Essentially, Gov Hochul is doing everything she can to circumvent the law and the ruling. 

Most, if not all of these new restrictions will eventually be struck down in court, but that could take years.  In the meantime, however, millions of potential and current NY CCW holders will be disenfranchised and wrongly convicted.  There's no recourse because lawmakers have immunity.  They can keep knowingly drafting and enforcing unconstitutional laws without restriction while taxpayers foot the bill for all the legal challenges.  When the current laws get struck down, they'll just write new laws and continue the cycle. 

Gov Hochul was asked at a press conference if she was aware of the data and statistics around CCW permit holders and violent crime.  She responded ""I don't need the numbers"" and then proceeded into a speech about ""protecting NY'ers"".  [We actually have data on this](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3233904).  The general public is convicted of crimes at about 37 times the rate that police officers are convicted of crimes.  CCW holders are convicted of crimes at 1/6th the rate of *police*.  The statistics we have on this suggest that CCW holders take their responsibility seriously and are about the most law-abiding group in the country.  The slew of restrictions in NY seem to fly in the face of the actual data we have on the subject, and Gov Hochul's response seems to indicate that the laws have nothing to do with protecting anyone. 

I think the solution is simple.  Any new or updated laws in a state's penal code should be required to go through a judicial review process.  The new law would be unenforceable until it goes through constitutional scrutiny, and is signed off by a federal judge.  This would save a lot of time and money that the state wastes trying to uphold laws that they know aren't going to survive a challenge, and the people affected by the laws won't be turned into felons overnight and have their lives ruined."

Guys rarely complain about a woman’s vagina and even if they do it’s usually turned back against them. For example if a guy says it’s too loose ppl will just say he’s probably too small to feel it totally ignoring that vaginas do come in different sizes too and just blaming the man in this situation again. If sex isn’t something a man does to a woman and something that two partners do together why do men get a lot of blame for bad sex.

It goes along the lines of ""women face most consequences of unwanted pregnancies (meaning carriage and parenting) while men get to just pay the bills and roam free"" then they go arguing that it's only fair that women get to abort and that whether the foetus is a person or not isn't relevant

while i agree that is unfair, it isn't a sufficient reason to allow aborting a foetus (if you consider it a person), the fact that the costs of a human life aren't evenly distributed between both parents does not imply that the life in question should be terminated

we could apply this fallacious reasoning to other social issues for example: ""certain people get to evade taxes so it's unfair that others should have to pay them"", do you think all state expenditure should be suspended until we come up with an unevadable tax system?

Basically what the title says. I know some women who aren’t the prettiest/ or pretty large that are dating very handsome men. I don’t know any stereotypically hot women that are dating fat guys. 

I’ve heard of some women with pretty big guts/ thunder thighs say they only date men with 6 packs. And shockingly, it seems to work out for them. I have not seen the same work for guys.I don’t know any fat guys who would only date supermodel figured women and actually have it work out. 

I know this is not a rule and circumstances differ, but generally speaking I think a stereotypically attractive man will entertain a bigger girl way more often than a stereotypically attractive woman would entertain a bigger guy.

Edit: to conclude, I believe weight is a much more critical factor for a male’s dating than it is for a female"

468,2022-07-06,CMV: American Christian Nationalists are the same as Fascists and Theocratic Islam: Totalitarian,u/WithinFiniteDude,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vsxdbe/cmv_american_christian_nationalists_are_the_same/,changemyview,"All three groups share the same underlying beliefs and I will show this group is present and actively seizing power in the Usa.

Edit: Groups that fall into this category would include Evangelicals, Qanon, anyone trying to establish Christianity and serving its God as the guiding principles of the USA.

1)Strongman Authoritarianism: A group gathered around the ideology of a single person who claimed to be able to save the world thru belief or thru obedience towards them. I dont strictly mean prophets, the Leaders either understand the faith or the will of the people better than anyone else and are incapable of being wrong. Democracy and the rule of law has no place in their world as it is inferior to the Leader/God.

Example: Qanon associated Trump with Gods will and as the nations only hope against Satanic Democrats. This culminated in the Jan 6 attack after Trump lost the 2020 election, and the following waves of voter restrictions brought about by Republican state governments. The Rule of Law is being dismantled by the Supreme Court who apply Originalism readings of the law based on their ideology, and appeal laws based on fiat: declaring something ""egregiously wrong"" like Roe.


2) Violent Repression of Opposition: The state will use violence to eliminate opposition, supposedly in service of the service of the people/faith. Thru whatever legitimizing myth, the state is incapable of commiting bad actions as it is the champion or source of all good things.

Example: Jan 6, Trump and other Republicans like Rep Goser, Gaetz and Taylor Green have alluded to committing violence against political enemies. Rep  Cheney, Kinzinger and his family were threatened by Trump supporters for not falling in line with Trump.


3) Totalitarian: there is no limit to the states influence and it permeates every aspect of public and private life at the government's whims. Truth is what the state decides on that particular day.

Example: Jan 6, Trump wanted to curtail the First Amendment by opening libel laws, and republicans in Texas have stated in their platform that private matters between consenting adults are ""abnormal"". Rep Boebert said ""The church is supposed to direct the government, the government is not supposed to direct the church...I'm tired of this separation of church and state junk.""


4) Regressive, Anti-Egalitarian views: belief in God or a natural order ordained society be organized in a specific, heirarchcal way, such as restrictive gender roles or racists beliefs.

Example: 172 republicans opposed the Violence Against Women Act, Texas' anti-gay stance, Republican resistance to trans-rights, disproportionate restrictions that affect voters of color."

I am not talking about higly skilled and specific jobs, like doctors, surgeon, scientists, methematiciant, or pilot, this kind of things obviously need long and intensive training, but i think i am very generous if I say they represent 10% of all current jobs available.

For the 90% left : 

50% of those i think can be learnt in 2 or 3 weeks, like cashier, waiter, barman, taxi driver (given you have a driver licence), shopkeeper, retail or warehouse worker, kitchen staff in fastfood restaurant, delivery driver(given you have a driver licence), security guard, secretary (mother was one, confirmed it), ""low-level"" administrative worker...

The remaining 50% (of the 90% jobs that arent highly skilled) can, i think, with proper tutoring be learnt on the job within 2 to 6 months, not including the physical preparation for jobs requiring it like firefighter or soldier.

For the ""technicals"" jobs like plumber, electrician,  mecanics, bus and truck drivers, farmer, tatoo artists (not including the ""creative"" side)... If you have someone very dedicated to teaching you it can be very fast since you'll have a lot of practice. 

Next we have all of these jobs i think can be regrouped under the (sorry for that) term of ""bullshit jobs"" :  I have many friends who went to business school,  when they describe their job to me, the tasks seems so repetitive and so... easy, they mostly do powerpoints and give presentation... Yes they master certain subject but it is almost never needed in their day to day job. I have friend who work in human ressources, same thing, mostly interviewing candidates and redacting reports about them, almost no use of what she studied in university... Some account manager at a bank, mostly calling client who overspend or trying to sell product to other client, or entering numbers in a software to see if the client qualify for a mortgage. 

Considering teacher, if you have highschool education and spend an additionnal 3-6 month with a teacher studying the matter and teaching you to teach (lol) I think you are good to go teach middle and highschooler (I myself gave some math and french class to highschooler in my first year of university) 

Considering IT, i myself am a software developer, I dont think i can teach you everything I know in 6 month, but the job, and only the job, my day to day task, I can, in 3-4 months. 

It maybe become more complicated with engineers level jobs because there often is a notion of responsability, if you f\*ck up it can have consequences, so it actually depend on the field, I have a friend who work as an energy engineer who litteraly said to me he can teach me is job in a few month because he mainly do management. On the contrary another friend of mine work at a nuclear plant, he could never teach me in even a year, because you need to know absolutely everything) 

To be safe I'd say 10% more of all total jobs are enginneer level jobs or bear a level of responsability that make it impossible to learn in 6 months. 

So, by suppressing from the list the 10% jobs that are highly skilled and knowledgeable (surgeon, doctors, scientist...) and the 10% that bear too much responsability (nuclear plant engineer, lead of cybersecurity, building engineer...) It give us 80% of the jobs that I think can be learnt in 6 months max given PROPER and EFFECTIVE TUTORING."

In essence, it means that, while not all ideas are good or acceptable, all ideas should exist freely without being denounced or removed. All ideals are welcome regardless of their validity or moral value. When you look at the past 200 years, you can see that societies haven't been as inclusive of ideals as they are now, and by doing this, businesses in those societies have struggled to grow their market base.

Societies have always had groups of people deemed morally wrong or inferior (lgbtq+ folk, racial minorities, religious minorities, women, etc.), and so, large markets of individuals were left untappable unless a business wanted to face social retribution. How would a business solve the issue of selling to a market of individuals deemed societally lesser than? They could try to market and sell to that base, but they would risk losing a majority of their customer base in addition to the earlier mentioned social retribution. Instead, these companies have accepted all groups and their ideas to grow and expand.

A great example of this would be large marketplaces such as Walmart, Amazon, eBay, Craigslist, and others. You can purchase almost anything on these platforms. You could buy Nazi memorabilia, Romani artwork, the Torah and other religious works, pride and lgbtq+ materials, and other conflicting ideological products all on the same platform. Another great example is social media sites. Sites such as Twitter, Google, Facebook, and Reddit excel profit-wise because they've allowed almost any idea or group to have a platform. By making all ideas acceptable, companies have made everyone a sellable market group. I'd go as far as to say that most political and social extremism in the modern day would not exist if companies did not think that extremist ideals and markets were profitable."

1. Dogs can go out with you and be your companion in various activities: hiking/jogging, kayaking, swimming, fetching frisbees/balls, biking, skateboarding, herding various livestocks including cows, hunting, playing soccer, retrieving items, and in some extreme cases, a person regularly takes his dog to glide with him. While on the other hand, cats typically stay indoor and the only things considered intelligent that cats do are relieving inside a small box and catching rats, and barely anyone in the first world country gets a cat to catch rats. And there aren’t anything that cats can do that dogs cannot do according to my current knowledge.

2. Dogs are typically less detrimental in comparison to cats. Here is why: when cats don’t feel comfortable near strangers, they run away. But it is also commonly that cats scratch or slap people when someone gets too close. Dogs do also run away when they are scared, and some bark. And what changes is that dogs never bite before they bark, they bark to warn others to back off.

3. Dogs have the idea of pack/family. They stand in front of their owner and bark to tell the intruder to back off while constantly looking back to ensure their owner is ok behind them. They are also able to tell apart sounds the pack members make. Dogs also know to call for help when their owners are in trouble

4. Dogs can read emotions. They are able to tell apart your facial expression and your voice tone to react. They know when they did something wrong and they are angry and snuggle with you to try to ease the situation. And when you don’t want your dog to do something you can just make some grumpy noise to let them know.


5. Dogs are able communicate with their owners. Dogs bring toys to their owners to play. When dogs need relieve themselves they whine and sit by the door and look at their owners. When they need to drink they constantly paw at the water bowl and look at their owners.

Right now the way most courses work is the student is given information, expected to remember it and perhaps work on it for a bit, and then they are tested on it in the future. 

Instead, I believe the way it should work is the student is given information, and right after they are given information, they are tested. This allows them to be corrected in the moment. After this correction, they can then apply it, and have that application corrected. Etc etc etc.

Then the mid term and final exams can be used as a main assessment of what the student has actually learned over the class period.

This method would also avoid grade inflation, as currently students can basically just put in the work and memorize things for a short period of time to get good grades, which doesn't necessarily require them to really sink their teeth into the material.

If you ask any high level performer in, for example, chemistry or engineering, the amount of ""A+"" students who don't know what they're doing is astronomical. At the same time many ""B"" students can posses phenomenal aptitude but they weren't able to necessarily demonstrate the depth of their knowledge due to how many courses are structured and taught."

First of all, the paper used to wrap gifts is inconsistent. When you don’t need it is everywhere in the house, but when you actually need it suddenly it disappears into thin air, leaving behind just a shred that’s not useful to wrap even the smallest gift.

Secondly, it’s only use it’s being thrown into the trash, because once the present is unwrapped, the paper is no longer useful unless the person was very careful unwrapping it, while usually it’s not the case. It’s a waste of paper. 

Thirdly, it’s really difficult to wrap something with it and make it look good, specially if you have a little piece that was cut by other person, and they cut it in an uneven way, leaving you with diagonal cuts and too much paper in one part and too little in the other.

My suggestion is to start using either cute bags or cute wooden boxes, which becomes a two gifts in one, because now they have a plus bag or box that they can use to keep things, go shopping with a cute bag or something like that. The box can even be used to keep the gift, offering them not only a plus gift, but also a place to guard it, making them to not have to think about where to put this new gift. 

Maybe bags or boxes are a little more expensive than wrapping paper, but I think that the time it saves you by not having to wrap the gift along with the frustration is more than worth it."

Recently I was on tik tok watching a video of a woman speaking out about women being abused. One of the commenters said men can be abused to and every one attacked them.

I was explaining how it’s a separate space then they asked me why.

I froze because I couldn’t think of why I kept pondering until it hit me. It’s easier for the government to handle when it’s segregated.

Think about it abuse is abuse. The gender of the victim doesn’t change the severity. It’s wrong in all ways. Men rarely ever get to speak out and women aren’t taken seriously. 

No matter how much I try to see the reasoning I can’t help but think we’d be better speaking out as a whole.

(I did explain this to them as well for opening my eyes)

It took a lot of courage but women did take a stand. Though men sadly couldn’t sue to social views like.

“Oh please I bet her hits didn’t hurt”

“Why are you uncomfortable she’s just flirting”

“You should be happy to be laid”

“Happy wife makes a happy life”

While women receive.

“Well you must have done something wrong”

“Boys will be boys”

“Well it’s your fault for picking such a partner”

Victim blaming happens the same. Abuse can be done in all the same ways. Physical, verbal, emotional, sexual.

So why is it separate. Even with the excuse that some women fear men after being abused. Some men fear women just the same.

It’s the same severity. 

I do believe for this reason there should be options for help groups and therapy singular  for either gender (or non-binary individuals) 

Added to that we’re in the year 2022. Transgender individuals exist to. If they were born the from sex they were abused. Can they not participate until their transition or can they not because they’ve transitions.

Everything has sub labels when the problems are the same. Abuse is abuse no matter who it happens to and any movement should be for everyone abused not just for a specific party.


Another movement is the BLM. Before I’m attacked I’d like to state I’m a black female. Now then.

Personally as of recently I’ve been seeing this change but can’t help but think it should be the overall approach.

BLM should also include other minorities. Such as our Indigenous citzens, or Latinas/latinos, or middle easterns, Asians etc.

Why is each person speaking out separately? And yes we have it hard but so do they. Simply because you haven’t experienced another’s struggle shouldn’t be the reason you can’t speak out on it. Obviously not BLM was a trend at one point but that’s not what I want. I want a movement for all of us not just splash of you here and me there. Why fight the same battle separately with your only excuse being that it’s in different font. 

The only general movement I seen that included everyone is the LGBT+ And though they are still pushing to be accepted they are at least doing it together. 


Politics aren’t going to fix our issues we will. But not if we’re each taking small nibs separately. 

Segregation has always made things harder as a black person trust me on this. And I’m not talking about a water fountain I’m talking about against each other. Simply because one was darker or lighter we viewed our struggles as separate. 

“You don’t understand my pain.”

“You had it easy”

Etc. Because of things like this for decades we’ve hated each other you can say what you want but as a whole we did all while questioning “when things will start to get better” well we have gotten a bit better though it’s still common I can honestly say I’ve seen a huge improvement on hating on someone simply because their shade is different and guess what. It has made us stronger it’s brought us closer and we are being heard more. So why not be even more heard?

Instead of balancing the system by constructing and maintaining two separate parties, the results of our system as it stands and the current structure that was built and maintained seem to produce more harm than good. People on both sides become ideologues who care more about power and reelection rather than the benefit of the people and mankind as a whole. Instead of our citizens having respectful conversations on the state of affairs, those who have a differing view in their immediate environment that is in the minority are labeled and attacked. Instead of examining issues of critical importance to the nation and world at large, those in the minority are often silenced, alienated, and not given the opportunity for an open honest discourse. Politicians echo hateful sentiments towards those who disagree about the things outside of the majority, creating a powerful us vs. them mentality.

Also, collectivizing farms was a bad idea: all the best land was taken from war and is appointed through usually, that luck so collectivizing it would cause environmental damage because the land is not meant to host that many farmers whereas with a mineshaft, you have more men to drill deeper or woodcutting etc. but not drilling for oil: it could be done that way but economically, that's a resource to be conserved.  Basically, the farmer knows best where to farm, and foodstuffs should be redistributed and farmers should be able to swap land on leisure.

I also see recycling as a Industry BEGGING to be nationalized. Nationalizing is simply the government controlling resources or a commune doing the same. So because of our climate disaster, it would be a needed tool to distribute key resources in a manner least detrimental to everybody or most.

Also, before someone blurts out ""no Incentive to work"" Stalin had a piecemeal wage system where a base pay was guaranteed and you would earn a set amount more based on your production but Khrushchev Removed that for a one time bonus and higher wages.

Last point is to remove subsidies for Industries that go just under their quotas to receive said award unless they can prove that they're extracting a finite resource and aren't striking much. These would be rules for Industries that should be profitable or where then continue to underperform when they have too many employees and to deter such actions, call it industrial sabotage so as to charge it as a crime."

-	Trump has been voted out, has all but disappeared from the public stage, and is haunted by countless legal issues.
-	Johnson barely survived a vote of no confidence *in his own party* a month ago, and is currently watching his cabinet disintegrate because of yet another scandal.
-	Putin is an international pariah, and has to fear the wrath of his own oligarchs, following his disastrous invasion of Ukraine.
-	Erdogan is up to his neck in domestic problems, facing economy-destroying levels of inflation among other things.
-	Netanyahu was ousted as prime minister, and is facing criminal charges.
-	Bolsonaro is almost certain to be voted out in October, considering the commanding lead Lula has in the polls.
-	Duterte is no longer president, though it’s unclear whether his successor is any better than him.

The biggest right-wing election success this year has been in France, but the numbers are still insufficient to control national politics, and certainly don’t by themselves reverse the global trend in the opposite direction.

Pan-European sentiment is experiencing a renaissance, fueled by the disastrous Brexit experience and the renewed threat from Russia. With Trump gone and NATO suddenly being valued again, trans-Atlantic relations are quickly healing.

In summary, I believe we are currently witnessing a global decline in the influence of right-wing and far-right populist ideologies. Change my view!"

This is because we are humans and not robots.    
Bill Gurley, billionaire venture capitalist, recently said that even though he thinks valuations are crazy, he has to stay in the game because his firm did the research, and if they don’t participate, and invest, in the final few years of speculative froth, they will underperform and lose assets.    
So even the most steady hands who view themselves as logical investors will be caught up from time to time and speculate.    
By speculate, I mean you are only investing because you believe someone will pay more due to the market environment, not due to company fundamentals. But then, when the market blows up, some speculators stay the course, start doing due diligence, taking their time, and buying the best companies at reasonable valuations.  

Many speculators leave when markets decline, but some stay and change their feathers.  

So, I think there aren’t 2 distinct types of people in the investing world, but rather, there are both traits in anyone who invests."

4. Russia has effectively made Ukraine a landlocked country and the O&amp;G reserves of Ukraine are in Russias hands now
5. Ukraine will never join Nato again, allowing it to join would have exposed flat terrain to Russias and cut off Belarus, a russian ally which is unfavourable if a conventional war between nato and russia ever occurs.

Sanctions have mostly failed and nothing will happen that will return these annexed territories. Ukraine would be wise to hold direct talks, potentially even surrendering. It was extremely stupid to ignore Russia and play stupid up to the day before they invaded. This was either an enormous policy error or Ukraine was lead down this path by the US, as not once did they even consider compromising to a far greater power.

It's just harder to avoid the illusion these days,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vthh7h/cmv_we_have_always_been_in_a_posttruth_world/,changemyview,"Disclaimer: For the sake of this thread, I'm not trying to get philosophically fancy with ""what is truth, really?"". Taking the common lay person's version of the idea of 'truth' here - meaning something like ""accurate"" or ""in accordance with facts/reality"".

Definition of 'post-truth' from wikipedia: [Post-truth is a time when ""objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief"".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-truth#:~:text=Post%2Dtruth%20is%20a%20time,the%20causes%20of%20the%20phenomenon)

We've had written word for a few thousand years, but we've been telling each other stories for like half a million years, maybe more who knows how animal communication works. Stories have always been more powerful than truth - everything from people buying shitty products due to clever marketing to world-shaking religious wars. ""Truth"" (perhaps more accurately called 'approximating the truth'), from a scientific perspective, is an even more recent development. For eons we didn't tell children not to go in the forest because they'll get lost and mom will be sad, we said the forest monster will eat you. Why? The story works better for deterring the behavior. You can extrapolate this in both the positive and negative direction.

Politicians have lied since the dawn of civilization. People have used social programs for their own advantage since the dawn of civilization. People have pretended to work in good faith for their own gain while secretly working in bad faith - probably way before civilization.

Nature/evolution sometimes **rewards deception**, and that's true from the simplest forms of life to humans. We have a lot more time with that influencing human nature than our recent ideas and the internet. The internet has given a voice to lots of people, some bringing 'new' ideas or complaints to the social sphere, others trying to do good, others trying to take advantage, and so on. We're all being forced to confront the reality of a post-truth world, but we have not *become* a post truth world in modern times, we've always been one."

No, it’s just a kiss between two people, should be sweet but as soon as it’s two characters of the same sex people “shouldn’t have to explain why two people of the same sex are kissing to my 8 year old”. Tell me, does your 8 year old already know what a kiss is? Does your kid learn about war and how terrible it is in school yet God forbid they learn of this “forbidden love”? Will you turn off your Disney+ subscription and ban your kid from watching Disney if they featured a regular kiss because it’s “too sexualized”? What if your kid turns out to be gay, will you blame Disney? If they turn out to be straight would you blame straight media? I’m not criticizing people who have this view, I just want to understand why they’re so passionate about it.

Edit: I want to clarify this has nothing to do with if this characteristic makes a movie is bad. I’m talking about people who are against it solely because it’s exposing the LGBTQ lifestyle to children."

Absolutely; and (3) should the US do what it can to bring her home? Also absolutely. 

But...

her supporters seem to think she deserves special treatment and to be a priority over other US citizens detained in by unfriendly foreign countries, including Russia. To me, it appears she was lucky to get the ""wrongfully detained"" official designation at all and that was probably special treatment already due to her status. For her to be there in the first place, or at least not back well before February when she tried to leave, was reckless at best as the US intelligence services had been saying since December that a Russian invasion of Ukraine was likely and it those reports only got stronger since then and a level 4 travel advisory was put in place in January - yet she stayed. And she not only stayed, but broke the law and gave Russia the excuse to do what it did. She had been to Russian many times in the past and had to have known its has draconian drug laws, yet she took that risk. 

The US should work to bring her home, but she does not deserve priority over the other roughly 40 US citizens that have been designated as wrongfully detained by foreign countries. And that priority is exactly what her supporters are demanding and it is selfish and entitled. It is also unrealistic in arguing as they do that the US should do whatever it takes to secure her release, including a swap for somebody like Viktor Bout. Of course she and her family/supporters want her home, and everybody should, but they are going about it in a very selfish, entitled, and unrealistic manner.

There has been a considerable movement to bring her home through a prisoner swap with the Russian government.

Recently Mrs. Griner admitted that she had erroneously packed the 2 vape tubes with Marijuana products in them and brought them into Russia. 

My view is now that she has admitted to committing a crime the US government should apologize for letting the drugs slip through screening at our airport here, and that we should support the Russian justice system and any reasonable punishment they administer. The reported 10 years she faces seems fine to me. 

Additionally, if she flew out of a state that prohibits the drugs she had on her the state should bring charges if she returns.

While it's possible her confession was coerced I highly doubt it. She most likely realized her best bet was to ask the Russian court for leniency."

Based on the Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer (STEP) and other studies and meta-analyses, there is evidence that intercessory prayer has no effect other than a placebo (for those who pray for themselves) or a comfort tool (for those who pray for themselves or others). Since people in the experimental groups have not fared any better than those in the control groups, prayer has been shown to have no discernable effect.

Now some people might say that these studies are problematic because people in the control group might be being prayed for by others and so the control sample is contaminated; however, simply by virtue of the law of averages, the level of background prayer is probably evenly distributed amongst the experimental and control groups, so I don't know that this argument is a good refutation of these studies, especially given that the same result has appeared over and over again.

And look no shame but I think it looks dumb and it’s an ugly habit that doesn’t make you look cool. The exception being if your using it to ween off tobacco (congrats by the way), but if you’re just a teenager doing it as a habit then it looks stupid. I know people have their own stories but I can’t possibly fathom why you would  smoke vapes when there is shit out there that makes you look cool and is less harmful to the lungs (not promoting the use of anything but if you’re gonna do something then at least try not to die young).

497,2022-07-07,CMV: People who are against an extensive welfare/social program because they won’t benefit from it are selfish and not very bright.,u/Zsu17,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vtnjd4/cmv_people_who_are_against_an_extensive/,changemyview," Generally speaking, I don’t think highly of most people who are against welfare/social programs, but the argument that makes the least sense to me is the “my money shouldn’t go towards something that doesn’t benefit me/I shouldn’t have to pay more for someone else to get xy”.

For the sake of this argument let’s ignore that helping the less fortunate has a positive effect on society and thus benefits all members as they clearly don’t believe that.

According to the dictionary, selfish means “lacking consideration for other people; concerned chiefly with one's own personal profit or pleasure”, so I think it’s pretty clear that the people who think along these lines are selfish.

I also think that they are not the smartest either, as a selfish but logical person would see that the best option for them is to have the security of an available and accessible welfare network even if they won’t need it. Let’s look at the options:

A. *There is no welfare system in place and you would’ve needed it.* Clearly a bad situation.

B. *There is no welfare system in place and you never end up needing it.* Congratulations, you were lucky. However, you lived your life knowing that your luck might not hold and you’re just one unexpected event away from being in a situation where you could have benefited from a safety net. You had an accident/got sick and now you’re disabled/can’t work? Too bad. You found out you’re pregnant but can’t afford to raise the child as a single parent? Tough luck. You were on a family trip, got in a car crash, and now your child is an orphan? Sucks to be them. There was an earthquake and everything you own is destroyed? Hope you don’t mind.

C. *There is a welfare system in place and you end up needing it.* It’s great that there was help available but it sucks that you fell on hard times. Not an ideal situation.

D. *There is a welfare system in place and you never end up needing it.* Most ideal situation. You lived a relatively comfortable life with the added reassurance that, were something to change, you wouldn’t be on your own.

**Thus, my view is that on top of being selfish, they are not the smartest either as, all other things being equal, having the safety net of social welfare and not needing it is the best/most logical option.**

Ideally, I would like my view changed on both aspects, but proving that they are either not selfish or smart is also ok.

Arguments that I heard before/won’t change my mind:

*People are responsible for their own lives/they should have prepared/they should have been more responsible/etc*. I’m not talking about rich people who can fall back on their money/their family’s money. In reality, most average people are one tragedy away from homelessness/poverty/hardship. I wish I could find that reddit post where the guy was explaining how it took 5 months after his wife’s cancer diagnosis to lose 20 years' worth of savings and to have to remortgage their home. Basically, you can do everything right and still find yourself in a difficult position.

*There is/could be an option E in which such systems/programs are not needed to begin with.* I don’t think that’s plausible.

*Option B is preferable over D for said people because the possibility of their own misfortune bothers them less than the idea of someone else benefiting from their taxes.* This just proves that they are selfish and dumb for thinking that it’s a good idea to sink the ship they are on just so the captain drowns.

*Option B is the best for them because they are not worried/they don’t think it possible that they could be in the shoes of the less fortunate.* That just shows a total lack of empathy and awareness, assuming that just because they don’t need it now, they’ll never need it in the future proves they are not smart.

I also would prefer it, if your argument wouldn’t be over semantics. English is not my first language so do let me know if something is unclear."

The same goes for most people.

1. People tend to only read things that they are immediately interested in. Just because something EXISTS doesn't mean people will flock towards it.
2. People have limited time and energy and that fact has not changed from history until now. Even if the amount of knowledge available literally multiples by a factor of 10,000,000,000 humans will still only use certain, limited parts of it.
3. Not all information is equal or accurate. People tend to remember stuff from the most convenient, flattering, easy to digest sources. That doesn't mean the information is correct either.
4. People tend to try not to work. They tend towards leisure. Learning new things, especially difficult-to-grasp, complex subjects is a lot of work and takes a lot of time. People just won't do it.

No civil discourse and now everyone is getting posts and comments removed if they don't agree with mods viewpoints. I've had comments taken down and gotten minimum responses from mods about why it was taken down. Just feels like anyone thats a mod on Reddit now is constantly abusing their power and act like kind of people that blow up on twitter about anything they don't agree with. I guess my main point is Reddit seems like an echo chamber now more than ever and I think the mods are purposely doing it. Reddit used to be a place where just about anything can be said or talked about and it doesn't seem to be that way anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if they removed the anonymity in the future.
902,2022-07-07,CMV: Speaking about homosexuality doesn't mean grooming or speaking about sex. And the same goes for other queer identities,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vtrot7/cmv_speaking_about_homosexuality_doesnt_mean/,changemyview,"[The other day I made this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vocx4y/cmv_theres_no_argument_for_being_mad_the_gay_kiss/) it details my issues with with the criticism surrounding the gay kiss in Lightyear and a prevalent argument I saw was the idea that talking about or mentioning homosexuality to children is grooming. 

This isnt just one internet post I see it everywhere it's the reason behind the groomer nonsense and the don't say gay bill, the idea that speaking about these things is inherently sexual. 

The biggest issue I find is that largely this logic is withheld from heterosexual things libs of tik tok will upload a video of a teacher saying they're gay to their students is horrific but they'd never upload a video of a teacher saying they were getting married to their students, or a video of a clearly pregnant teacher even though those things both imply sex just as much as a gay teacher would. Everyone wants to ban gay representation in kids movies but would never do the same for families even though a family directly needs sex to exist. 

Largely the idea only seems to be homophobia repackaged for the modern day."

Ransom pointed a fake gun at officers and was repeatedly told to lower his weapon. When he did not, officers opened fire from both sides of the store.Ransom was shot eight times but survived. Simonsen was accidentally shot in the chest and killed by one of his fellow officers. The Legal Aid Society, which represented Ransom, said officers fired 42 shots in 11 seconds.

The officer that actually killed Det. Simonsen wasn't charged with anything or punished at all as far as I know. Meanwhile his widow says this

""Jagger freeman not only killed my husband, but he killed a part of everyone who knew him and loved him,"" Leanne Simonsen said. ""He was warm, generous, always smiling, always willing to help out, always willing to help out anyone in need.""

Freeman was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison for murder.

This is a disgrace. He should go to prison for the robbery not murder. It's not his fault poorly trained police officers shot each other. Simonsens  partner was also hit in the leg by friendly fire.

Yet, at the same time, if you look at what humanity, as a species, does and has done, it's hard to feel anything other than disgust for everything we are

We constantly destroy ourselves, each other, and everything around us for no reason other than greed and cruelty for their own sakes. As a whole, we are nothing but a blight and we have the gall to feel superior about it, that we are the conquerors who deserve to do whatever we like with the world and other people. It's a disgusting sense of entitlement used to justify everything from war, to ravaging the climate, to mass starvation, to causing extinctions (likely including our own one day, as we’re not acting near quickly enough on climate change and I doubt we’ll respond to future threats any better than our pathetic attempts to mitigate disasters today – eventually one of them will catch up to us). Sure, we're the only advanced species that we know of, that might make us special by some definition, but “special” doesn’t mean “not terrible”

""Look at the good news"", they say, but most of the good news involving human actions are just that we slightly helped a human-created problem. 'Local man saves 10 orphans from the orphan crushing machine' - great, yes, but why is there an orphan crushing machine to begin with and why are we not forcing those keeping it running to turn it off rather than just plucking what few orphans we can out of its maw? How can I consider that uplifting when it’s a reminder that the orphan crushing machine is still running and crushing orphans?

Yes, certain things have gotten better in certain places, rights have been won, but as a whole, on a global level, are we really tangibly, measurably getting better? Wars are still going on. Genocides are still happening as we speak. Rights previously won are being lost. Democracy is all but broken in many countries, completely non-existent in many others. We continue to irreparably damage the environment. When we have the chance to keep doing better and constantly improve, we keep choosing to either keep status quo or regress instead

Non-human animals do things we consider barbaric too, but the difference is they don’t know better. They’re inherently morally neutral because they don’t have a concept of morals. They don’t have a concept of good and evil – we do, yet we still, as a whole, choose evil. We’re the only animal (that we know of) that knows what evil is and yet we still *choose* to be evil

Most people don't want to be cruel, I know this, the vast majority of us are just trying to do out best and our main aspiration is just making it to Friday. Yet an entire civilization of these people, of people who largely do want to be kind, is still such a disgusting version of reality where horrible, preventable, human-caused atrocities occur every day and always have. What about that is worth having hope in? How can one see the problems in the world and still think we're worth saving from them when we'll inevitably just do something else horrific?

For the record, I do want my view changed on this. I don’t enjoy thinking that we deserve annihilation. It’s not that I don’t believe in the everyday good of people, I do, that’s indisputable, I just don’t see how it’s enough to make up for all the harm we’ve done and continue to do as a whole even though we know perfectly well we’re doing harm"

But now, unfortunately, we have a huge Flux of ontarians selling their houses in Ontario for hundreds of thousands of dollars, coming over here, and buying whatever is available for half of what they sold their old house for.

0,2022-07-08,"CMV: Bumble's ""women make the first move"" policy is unnecessary and does more harm than good.",u/xTylordx,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vu25fg/cmv_bumbles_women_make_the_first_move_policy_is/,changemyview,"For those unaware, the difference between the two major dating apps Tinder and Bumble is that Bumble has the exclusive restriction that a person identifying as a woman will always be the person who gets to make the first move in the event a man and a woman match.

I'll first start by giving some background because I think it is relevant for consideration, but not to support my argument. I started using Tinder to see if I can meet new people and possibly make new friends close by since I just turned 21 and feel a new sense of freedom (I'm in the U.S. where the drinking age is 21). My bio states that I'm *mostly* looking for friends, but if something happens and we catch feels for each other then I'm not closed to the idea of a relationship.

A friend suggested I use Bumble's BFF mode for this pursuit, though I've seen enough Tinder profiles to think that enough people are looking for friends that I might not need it, alas curiosity got the best of me. Full disclosure, I chose Tinder as my first app because I wasn't a fan of Bumble's policy even before I was interested in this endeavor. I remember seeing this in the description on the app store in passing like they were proud of this feature when I thought it was kind of dumb.

Anyway, back to the CMV.

I've heard the argument before that ""women getting to make the first move is appealing to many, and it helps to keep women safer from creeps."" I have some problems with this.

The first one, a personal gripe more than anything, is that if I match with someone, I like to introduce myself with a semi-generic ""hi nice to meet you"" just to get the ball rolling. It just feels incomplete to me if I match with someone and just continue on with my business. Or if I open the app and see that I have matches who didn't message me, I'd message them with that ""hi nice to meet you"" message. The gripe I have is that the argument supporting the restriction mentioned above presumes that men who would message their matches first would be creepy. It could be a fair presumption depending on the magnitude of the problem. However, I feel that by restricting someone like me (I wouldn't consider myself a creep) and presuming that I would be creepy if I were to message a woman first is just demeaning. **TL;DR, I won't like the argument that ""women will feel safer by this policy"" in the event you decide to use it, but don't feel unwelcome to try.**

The second problem I have is that it feels unnecessary. I feel like the restriction itself won't stop people from being creepy. Suppose a creepy guy matches with a woman. He waits for her to message first, and suppose she does. What is stopping him from behaving in a creepy way? By the time she messages, all bets are off as far as the policy goes. What is effectively the case is that if the restriction is meant for women to feel safer, then that safety is guaranteed only up to the point where she sends her first message. To follow with an anecdote, not only do I get spammy Snapchat accounts trying to get me to buy premium naughty subscriptions to NoNoville, but yesterday somebody added me on Snapchat and was basically trying to sell me her body for $60 for a month of ""free access."" She saved censored pictures of herself in the chat, and they're only still there because I'm considering screenshotting the chat just to prepare a permanent record for anyone who might be interested in the ""who is more creepy online"" debate.

The third thing I want to note is that this restriction is exclusive to women and men, which means that if a guy matches with a guy, then there is no restriction on who gets to message first. This is like Tinder's setup. What I wanted to suggest is that, from my experience, it was really fun to be able to message these people first and I haven't gotten creepy vibes from anybody (yet..? I hope I don't though). I mean, what's the point of restricting men from making the first move with women if men can just make the first move with other men? Maybe an improvement here would be that the order of swiping right matters in who gets to message first.

My next argument was that the policy is more harmful than good. Suppose that there are no creepy anybodies on dating apps, particularly on Bumble. Suppose everybody there is looking for a good time or for a date or something long-term and everybody is respectful. When women match with men (that is, the man swipes right first, and then the woman matches), then men will look at their notifications and see that they've matched with someone. Maybe this is their first match in a couple of days, and they're hoping to see that first message. The woman they are matched with has 24 hours to start a conversation or the match expires. The man, then has 24 hours of opportunity to feel anxious about the status of the match.

If there's no response by the end of the 24 hours, any range of feelings is valid barring extreme or unreasonable reactions like anger toward the person he matched with. For instance, it could impact self-esteem or body image. If this is a repeat occurrence, it might be hard to follow the advice on official wikis and guides suggesting not to take anything personally.

Therefore, I argue that as the policy is currently implemented, it does more harm than good. Maybe an improvement would be that any match with a woman would only be displayed to the man once she actually messages back.

I'd like to be shown other reasons I might not be considering that this policy would be in place, or reasons why I shouldn't have the problems I have with the policy itself.

Sorry for the long read!"

I ask this because I'm preparing a sermon on this commandment and how Jesus fulfills it, and having previously thought it was jealousy for his people, I've started to become convinced that it's not.

I think this is because if it's about his people then it doesn't make sense as the reason for verse 4 and the start of verse 5, which it needs to be because of the ""for"".

Verse 4 and 5 are not talking about the people making and worshipping images that are other gods, since God addressed having other gods in verse 3. Instead, this commandment is about not making God into what you want him to be and instead letting him be who he says he is. Therefore, the jealousy mentioned in verse 5 is a jealousy for who he himself is, not to be warped by something taken out of creation; rather than a jealousy for his people who have gone to worship another god.

So I was just wondering if anyone had a good counter-argument to help me think through a bit more."

1. It typically causes suffering/pain to the victim.

2. It typically causes suffering/pain to the relatives, friends, and personal relationships of the victim.

3. It contributes to a society where others may fear being murdered.

Given these, we can construct an example where a person painlessly kills a sleeping hermit who has no family, friends, or relationships, and the crime is not likely to ever be discovered. 

Let's assume that this scenario fully neutralizes all three of my axioms (i.e, the hermit feels no pain, has no personal relationships or at least no intention to ever communicate with anyone in the future, and the crime doesn't cause fear in other people).

In this example, I struggle to articulate why such an act would be morally wrong, despite it seeming obviously so. What am I missing?"

I believe that the housing crisis in America can be easily solved by building a few skyscrapers.

In America we’re have a housing crisis, meaning that there aren’t enough affordable homes for people to live in. One of the things that I find interesting about America is that only a few cities have tall apartments. 

To me it only makes sense to utilize the vertical space available to us. Any futuristic media the building are always tall and that’s because we already know that space will be an issue. 

Zoning laws need to be changed in order for this to happen.

These don’t have to be luxury apartments. For example I live in California so I’ll use it as an example. They could build a few skyscrapers. The apartments should be at least 1200 sq ft. And charge $1500 for a spot. An engineer can figure out the max height.

Obviously I also believe that these buildings could be used for housing first programs.

Housing should be offered to current residents of the state first. It’s only fair that the people already living in the states get a chance to move into the homes before out of state residents move in.

I also believe that these buildings need parking to go with them. 

If you’re worried about the building ruining your “neighborhood” it won’t be right next to your home."

I don't think parents are doing enough to prevent their kids from shooting up schools. 

I know that the gun problem in the US is far more complex and larger than just this, but we all know that basic education starts from home. Parents are fully responsible for ensuring their that kids feel love and support. If any issues are being experienced by the child, the parents should be first in line to address it. 

So what's one way to enforce more parental attention at home? Charge the responsible adults in the house with the same exact crimes as their child. Currently, parents can be charged with child neglect or endangerment in the US. Parents are also fined for all the civil damage done by the child. However, I don't think these convictions do enough justice to all the lives ended and the families ruined by a school shooting. 

Parents should still be charged like the current system says, but also add their child's crime on top of that. 

IT'S YOUR CHILD SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY!
If your child commits an act of violence that ends in the loss of life, you FAILED as a parent and you're just as despicable as your scum of a child. 

That's just my opinion."

I accumulated student loans, dropped out of college, and racked up over 20k in credit card debt by age of 21. 

I grew up in a lower-middle class home with parents who hadn’t completed high school, so I didn’t have a “support network” to help me. No connections, no pre-planned path, and no financial assistance. (I will acknowledge that I did have the privilege of having non-divorced parents that loved me though. And, if it matters, I’m white.)

Despite this adversity, I now have a net worth of &gt;500k, own my own home, a rental, **and I really haven’t done anything that special**. 

I don’t have illegitimate kids to support because I was willing to endure the momentary hardship of avoiding premarital sex.

I worked a non-glamorous (but high demand) job where I could earn 6 figures with no education. 

I used the opportunity at my workplace to learn new skills and increase my employment value.

I avoided eating out and blowing my money.

**Why do people act like financial success is such an impossible thing for my generation?** The “recipe” is honestly so simple, it just takes self control and temporary delay of gratification. I have helped/encouraged ~10 of my friends do the same as I have, and none of them (with varying backgrounds) have failed… Which leads me to my conclusion: Being financially successful in your 20s is simple as long as you’re willing to endure momentary hardship. **CMV.**"

If a guy starts developing feelings for the girl then what’s so wrong with him asking her out on a date. One argument I heard was that it just means that the guy was just friends with her to get into her pants. Hypothetically speaking the guy gets rejected and he doesn’t make anymore advances. He still wants to be friends with her because he still enjoys her company as a person. How would that mean that he is just friends with her just to get into her pants when he still wants to be friends with her after he gets rejected. I’m aware that not all guys act like this after getting rejected. However asking out a female friend is normal and in my experience how most relationships form. The girl is attracted to the guy from the start then they are friends develop a lot of chemistry and then the male friend asks her out. How would a guy get to know a girl and decide if he wants to date her without being friends.

You are invited to a dinner party. You ask the host if he.she would be willing to prepare vegan food, since you are vegan. The host declines your request, telling you that you can have the beef wellington they have prepared or nothing at all. You attend the party with a dish that you prepared for yourself.

I personally see nothing wrong with that. You want to eat vegan food at the party. The host is unwilling to serve vegan food. Therefore, you prepare food of your own. If one of the other guests wants to eat the food prepared by the host, you are okay with that. You accept and tolerate everyone else's choices, so it only seems fair that everyone else should extend you that same courtesy.

The popular belief is that you are invited to a dinner party, it is important to eat exactly what the host served. If you attend a dinner party as a guest and eat something that was not prepared by the host, then all is lost. John Rosemond says that attending a party with a meal that you prepared yourself is rude ( [https://www.beaconjournal.com/story/lifestyle/2016/12/25/john-rosemond-guest-in-someone/10618730007/](https://www.beaconjournal.com/story/lifestyle/2016/12/25/john-rosemond-guest-in-someone/10618730007/) ).

2-America has a long history of making decisions for India and other countries and arbitrarily enforcing them. 

3- I know it's a very debated argument, but America's actions in the Indo-Pak wars and subsequent support to Pakistan are a point against allying with America. Indo-American relations were pretty good before Nixon decided genocide was ok if the victims were brown. Now it might be argued that it is in the past, but the last president was Trump.

It’s annoying and misleading for childless people who don’t want kids in the mix, especially when the app doesn’t let you filter them out (though they still fall through the cracks).

I think there needs to be a separate dating app specifically for parents (and childless people who don’t mind dating parents) and parents should just not be on mainstream dating apps because it’s misleading and unfair to the strictly childless/don’t want kids crowd."

I cringe when I see a table like the following:

&amp;#x200B;

|Issue|Candidate A (D)|Candidate B (R)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Abortion|Pro-Choice|Pro-Life|
|2nd Amendment|More Gun Regulation|Less Gun Regulation|

Why do I cringe? For one, the issues/stances  are grossly over-simplified and they usually fall along obvious party lines. At best, a table like this will highlight an outlying candidate such as a Pro-Life Democrat or a Pro-Choice Republican. Secondly, and more important for this post, the issues are only a portion of what I think people should consider when choosing a candidate. 

What should one consider? Well, I expect my elected representatives to not only set policy but at a minimum solve problems/crises (a natural disaster or a broken department for example) and represent me. This means I look for evidence of problem solving ability in the candidate- did they fix a broken system as a mayor/city council or even fix something a struggling company? As far as representation, I look at personal conduct. Do they manage their temper?  A criminal record? A litany of accusations of some sort or the other? A candidate represents you on a larger stage. If it's your mayor, they might interface with the state government and might appear on as the ""face"" of your town on a large media outlet. If it's the POTUS, the stage is much bigger. Beyond that, I also like to look at evidence of bipartisanship, evidence of corruption or ability to uproot corruption. 

I'm not arguing the policy is unimportant.  There are some stances on both sides of the aisle of the US that I regard as fringe and I will refuse to vote for candidates with those views (though I may or may not vote for their opponent). In the interest of avoiding rabbit holes, I will avoid giving examples.  However, I generally don't hold it against a candidate for merely holding a mainstream view that's different than mine. Perhaps, I've spent too much time around hyperpartisans who don't seem to get it, and people on this subreddit will find this glaringly obvious? We'll see."

I’m from Bolivia. I’ve never been in the US but reading why they say they are going downhill makes me think they have no clue what they talk about.


First they complain about their gender ideologies saying they don’t get enough respect. But still you can sue, you can do something about it. Here justice system doesn’t even work so can’t sue and specially not for something like that. Gay people get zero respect and they can be discriminated against. Trans people are almost non existent. The LGBT community is seen as a joke.



They complain about the government and they may be corrupt, but not like ours. The government officials have illegal parties with narcos (recorded) and they protect the biggest cocaine labs in the Chapare. If you dare try say something you risk getting thrown in jail, killed or drown with internal taxes that come out of nowhere. Where in the US have you seen politicians partying with narcos? They can do whatever they want and no one can say other wise. 



Poverty is another one. A poor person from here is not the same as a poor person from the US. The minimal salary here is 2000bs which is less than 300$. You don’t see ‘poor’ people with Iphones and cars. They have to ration everything if they want to eat along with paying everything else.


Here education (unless you were in a private school) is terrible and they fill you with political lies. The books are about our ex-president and they have festivities only for the current political party. Since kids they brainwash them. Would you say it is possible to do the same in the US? I don’t think so. People would complain and riot. The media would talk about it. Again you can do something about it. 



The justice system is non existent. The winner is the one who has more money. All the judges are bought and if you try to do it the right way, you lose the trial. 


Basically all public services have to be bought if you want them to work. Police, health care and schools. I’m having a hard time seeing how the US could be comparable to my country in any aspect."

There's other options out there, instead of killing ppl!

Yes, the decision no longer mandated that states allow abortion and some states will ban them. BUT, the decision also made it so that even hardcore pro-lifers have no route to place a federal ban.

It's my view that this is the most neutral decision the SC could have made and with the way the US is set up, this should have always been a decision left to the states. It's also my view that the Federal Government *should* (and rightfully have) step in on big things like slavery and suffrage and civil rights, but they have overextended massively on things like abortion since WWII."

Free Restrooms (not a big deal, but still)

Connected Road System

Arguably the most iconic National Parks

The USA is the single most dominant force in the entertainment world. Hollywood, NBA MLB, NFL, and all the biggest music.

The ADA(Americans with Disabilities Act), basically has lots of regulations for buildings, websites, and really anything for the public use to make them more accessible.

True Free Speech

Diverse Places

Diverse People

NASA

Higher Education

Public Library System

Scientific Innovation, there is no other country that even comes close in terms of what we do and have done for science.

There’s probably a few more, so I’ll edit the post if I remember more. Good luck changing my mind!

63,2022-07-09,CMV: The obsession with preserving cultural identities is bad for humanity,u/Jpm1123,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vvbmcu/cmv_the_obsession_with_preserving_cultural/,changemyview," 

There's this constant fear among both the right and the left in my opinion of cultures mixing and synthesizing. To sort of boil down the argument I often hear goes something like this ""French culture is beautiful Islamic culture is beautiful, but if we start mixing them then both cultures will just end up being destroyed, or one will just devour the other"". 

You can see examples of this like I said allover the political spectrum. Whether its the ""replacement theory"" lunatics in the US, Anti immigration in Europe, The Quebecois obsession's with maintaining their French heritage, the Japanese obsession's with racial purity and their strict immigration quotas. Religious households of multiple faiths wanting to create enclaves so that their kids aren't exposed to other cultures or beliefs. 

There is some truth to this, the cultures will be destroyed, but they aren't mentioning the 2nd part, that a new culture is created that is a synthesis of both. Cultural achievements are just as real and as important as scientific achievements. Do we have ""american"" science or ""british"" science? Does calculus and Newtonian gravity belong to England, but Einstein's discoveries belong to jewish people? Science belongs to humanity. I don't see why culture is any different. Shakespeare doesn't ""belong"" to English people, Dostoyevsky doesn't belong to Russia, Socrates doesn't belong to Greece, Lao Tzu doesn't belong to China. They belong to humanity.

We should be encouraging as much cultural exchange as possible just like we encourage as much scientific exchange as possible. Look at how much better food got after the Columbian exchange. Italian food exists because native american culture (tomatoes) Chinese culture (Noodles) and Mediterranean culture mixed. Creole food classic french cooking with african and spanish mixing, probably my favorite type of food in the world. Music, Jazz mixing African rhythms with European classical music. Basically all modern western music stems from that mix.

Mixing makes things better not worse. We should be increasing the scope of our identities toward a more global human identity and away from provincialism. Now I do agree that one culture shouldn't erase another, which often does happen. A good example is rock music where the contributions of African Americans are significantly downplayed in relation to white stars like Elvis, the Rolling Stones, Beatles etc. When all those guys basically took most of their inspiration from black musicians (they admit it themselves most of the time). But the end product of Rock music is still good for humanity. People should get the credit they deserve obviously, but  the actual mixing still produced something great."

I have also seen more empathetic views towards suicide in general. Specifically, I have witnessed growing support among some people for the idea that ending your own life is a completely personal decision, and that suicide can be justified for any reason. I wholeheartedly reject this proposal and postulate that in order to commit suicide without being terminally ill, one must not be of sound mind. I don't see suicide to be a solution to any possible problem that a non-terminally ill person could have, whether that be pain, boredom, apathy, hopelessness, or any other existential crisis. Even if they have no problem at all, I see the choice to end one's life on a whim as one borne of mental instability.

I wish to learn from people who express different views on the topic as to why they believe as they do. I can't say that I expect my mind to be changed; in all honesty, I hope that this post helps someone who is hurting out there. However, I can only see through my own tiny window of existence, and I wish to see what others see so that perhaps my own view is changed.

Below, I will summarize my view as to why someone who commits suicide cannot be of sound mind, with the exception of those who are faced with a guaranteed, impending, slow and painful death.

1. *Suicide is a permanent solution to an often-temporary problem. An inability to understand that the desired solution is too extreme for the problem at hand is a failure of critical thinking.*

Nearly all problems are temporary, unless they concern a terminal illness. Life circumstances are temporary; they may grow better or worse with time, but no individual is able to see into the future and definitively say that their individual life will get better or worse with certainty. That is, as long as they are hopeful. To conclude that your own life will definitively only get worse, with no possibility for improvement, is to lose all hope in existence. I find this to be a mental instability.

2.  *For a seemingly ""permanent"" problem, the true problem often resides in one's thoughts. To feel that one's thoughts are inescapable is a sign of mental illness.*

Whether the problem is that you are unattractive, or that you have no family, or that you have been maimed in an accident, or anything else of a seemingly permanent nature, the true problem rests within your mind: you **feel** as if you cannot continue to live with this facet of your existence. The key word in this statement is **feel**. Feelings are temporary reactions to the thoughts we are having, and at the end of the day, we have control over our own thoughts. It may be difficult to change those thoughts, but it remains a fact that those thoughts can be changed through conscious exertion of willpower. For those who believe their thoughts cannot change, they have accepted that personal growth is impossible. I find this to be a mental instability.

3. *Few, if any, decisions that we make affect only us as individuals. To believe otherwise is madness.*

Humans are an interconnected species. As much as we make ourselves out to be individuals, we are all connected to one another in some fashion. There is a biological reason for this: we are more effective at surviving together than we are alone. This interconnection spans the breadth of humanity, from the family unit to the community, the town, the county, the state, and the world. Pretty much any decision we make is having some sort of impact on the world. Furthermore, it is impossible to know in advance the impacts you are going to make with an arbitrary action; a well-timed smile or a wave to a stranger could go on to completely change the world.

No matter how alone or disconnected from humanity you are in the moment, you also have no way of knowing your **future** impact on humanity. Some words you write online 20 years from now could inspire the next world leader. I don't believe that it is possible for a sane person to recognize the infinite possibilities that arise simply by virtue of them existing, and still commit suicide. From my perspective, an inability to see the infinite possibilities created by your existence is a mental instability.

4. *Barring extreme circumstances, an untimely death cannot possibly bring about good. An inability to see this, or conversely a desire to bring about bad, are both indicators of being mentally unwell.*

This point is related to #3, in that it concerns an inability / refusal to perceive how one's actions will affect the world around them. Unless someone was a truly horrible person throughout their life, nobody will be pleased when they die early or unexpectedly. Family and close friends will be devastated long after you are gone. Dependents will be left without your care and guidance. Decades after you are gone, there will most likely still be people asking the question of ""if they were still here, how would my life have been different?"" For someone to know this and still make the decision to commit suicide symbolizes a stark lack of empathy in my mind. To either have no empathy, or to be so distraught that you are blind to it, is to be mentally unstable.

5. *Martyrdom, while sometimes effective at catalyzing change, ignores your ability to enact the change.*

I am including this section because I have a feeling that some people will reference martyrdom. Barring the most extreme cases, I don't believe martyrs to be of sound mind. That isn't to say that their methods can sometimes work to great effect: the reasoning behind my judgment is that you are boiling your life down to a single moment **that could fail to generate any impact**, while ignoring the potential change you could enact by staying alive and exerting continuous effort towards your goals.

I can't pretend to peer into the minds of suicide bombers or people who self-immolate, but I can imagine being in their shoes. If I, of sound mind, was considering martyrdom, I would need to conclude that my final act would have an extremely high probability of generating momentum towards an outcome that I won't even be a part of. This would require a combination of extreme selflessness, no sense of self-preservation, and no belief that I could impact the world in any other way (a violation of point #3). I find it highly unlikely that anyone of sound mind has the necessary data and computational ability to make that absurd judgment. Once again, this isn't to say martyrdom has never been successful, only that the martyrs are most likely someone of unsound mind making a gamble, rather than someone of a sound mind making a rational computation.

&amp;#x200B;

EDITS:

1) So far, one poster has definitely influenced my view on the topic. u/CrapulantDrunk brought up the fact that I am approaching the topic from a very utilitarian and consequentialist point of view, and that sometimes people will commit suicide from perspectives that do not align to this point of view. I presupposed that all people are approaching the problem the same way as me, and in doing so I neglected other perspectives. **I can officially say my view has been changed.**

2) As a clarification to my post, I would like to further define what I mean when I say ""mentally unstable"": I mean this phrase as ""not thinking rationally in the moment of their decision, whether that be to circumstance, event, or chronic mental illness"". As I pointed out in edit #1, the ""rationally"" piece of that definition was me imposing my framework of thought onto others; it is clear to me now that what is rational to one person is not rational to another and vice versa.

3) Never in my post did I intend the meaning as, ""all people who commit suicide have a pre-existing mental illness"". I apologize if that misconception offended anyone, I could have worded that much better. I am speaking of mental stability from a purely transient sense.

4) To anyone struggling out there, this post is not a critique against you. If there's one thing I hope everyone takes from my comments, it is this: please continue to choose life every day, you have so much to live for.

Thanks to everyone who participated, I will be replying here and there to new posters but with my view on the topic now changed I am satisfied with what I have gotten from posting here."

My view is that Borris Johnson resigned because right wing and conservative circles that support things like Brexit tend to also want a military exit where the West does not prop up states.  Therefore, his decision to support the West supporting Ukraine likely ran afoul of conservative circles.   However, I am seeing what the other opinions are.  Am I wrong about UK conservatives?  Or, were domestic issues the true issue here and foreign policy relatively irrelevant?  Obviously, until I see comments my view stands.

Some people may have noticed a similar post disappear before.  That was for an unclear title.  Also, I acknowledge the view that some people prefer not to call the country ""The Ukraine"" but just ""Ukraine.""

edit: I've awarded a Delta for introducing a good point about Brexit and whether it is about inward influence (towards Britain) or outward influence (from Britain).   But my point is talking tough on Putin is a political game that you're expected to play in Western Politics, but I think the problem here may be that Johnson seemed to actually believe in what he was saying."
0,2022-07-09,CMV: There's no culture war because the vast majority of people are socially conservative,u/FalzAbyss,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vvftac/cmv_theres_no_culture_war_because_the_vast/,changemyview,"We are living in the era of social media. Liberals saying that they have to fight some culture war to reduce the stigmatization of progressive media is pretty much delusions because its like fighting a losing battle since most people are just naturally conservative. There's a reason there's always  a significant backlash featuring anti-LGBT, anti-diversity, and anti-progressive viewpoints everywhere.    For example, the buzzlight year movie, which had a small kiss between a gay couple, drew outrage all throughout media. Some even referring to it as a gay agenda. Apart from a few tweets and chris evan, no one seems to have challenged these reactionaries despite these people doing everything in their power to bomb the film and destroy its credibility with that alone. The film received hundreds of 1/10 before it was even released. Stuff like this happens all of the time, buzz is just one out of hundreds. 

 Regardless of how often that statement is used in bad faith, it is pretty much the case in entertainment media like Youtube that ""if you are a minority/woman, and if your characters isn't a pick me or completely perfect, it's woke pandering."" This double standard is hardly challenged on most platforms, making me assume that's what most people genuinely believe

Even just using social media alone. Facebook, YouTube, Discord, TikTok, 4chan, ect...tend to lean right while Reddit and Twitter tend to lean left. While all of these platforms have issues ESP facebook and tiktok, only the latter two (reddit &amp; twitter) gets completely dragged in social media. They dunk on reddit and twitter (youtubers like ghostgum and moon, for example) despite all of these platforms hosting very obscene stuff. I can assure you that places like Youtube can be much, much worse. People rarely call out the grotesque aspects of social commentary Youtube, or discord, or 4chan in general despite all of them being rife with terrible practices.

You have gamergate, stigmatization of feminism, rejoicing of roe v wade, blue/all lives matter, tons of youtubers with millions of followers all using the same reactionary talking points, hundreds of anti-LGBT bills going into legislation, anti-""woke"" culture ect ect...

 there's clearly a dearth of media, outlets, and overall power to oppose this reactionary culture because most people are simply naturally reactionary."

Are humans smart enough to actually think all of that through beforehand, execute it with 100% precision, and still have every single person involved keep it a secret?

It takes just 1 person to spill the beans.  It takes just one drop of human error to make the entire plan crumble.

It's unfair that a portion of my tax dollars are sent to the Israel regime.,u/PlinyToTrajan,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vvktp9/cmv_usa_its_unfair_that_a_portion_of_my_tax/,changemyview,"As far as I can tell what is going on is that sectarian interests use lobbying to convince Congress to send U.S. treasury funds to the Israel regime.  Organizations like Democratic Majority for Israel and American Israel Public Affairs Committee are largely composed of and supported financially by Jewish people specifically, not by a broad religious-ethnic cross-section of Americans.  The mostly Jewish people who support these organizations feel a natural and understandable affinity with the Israel regime, because after all the Israel regime intentionally associates itself with both Judaism and the idea of establishing a nation and protected home for the Jewish people.\[1\]  In addition, Congresspeople who have a lot of Jewish constituents tend to be more supportive of Israel than those who do not, and Congresspeople who are themselves Jewish tend to be more supportive of Israel than those who are not. \[2\]

These organizations use their political influence to divert U.S. treasury funds, essentially tax revenues and public borrowings, for the purpose of making cash transfers to the Israel regime.  These are essentially one-directional cash transfers for which the U.S. does not get equivalent value in return.  Thus, the activities of the Israel regime are being carried out, in part, using the labor and sweat of the ordinary U.S. taxpayer.

Now, if you believe in *pluralism* as the appropriate political-theoretical model of the U.S. policymaking process, this is all well and good.  A segment of the population uses their political and financial resources to bring about this result; other segments of the population can use their own political and financial resources to pursue their own pet issues; there's horse-trading and everyone is happy;\[3\] that's the pluralist model.  However, I do not believe in pluralism.  My personal belief is that American citizenship entails a duty to maximize the prestige, international standing, and well-being of the United States and the American people as a whole, foremost, above any foreign country to which the citizen feels an affinity based on ancestry, religion, culture, or what have you.  Thus I resent what my fellow citizens are doing, that is, influencing Congress to send funds from the public treasury to a foreign country because they personally identify with that foreign country and/or feel an affinity with it.  I feel that their actions are inconsistent with being patriotic Americans.  

&amp;#x200B;

\[1\], \[2\]  When speaking of generalities as I am here it is of course important to note that they shouldn't be used to make assumptions about any individual.  Generalities have a lot of truth and usefulness for what they are -- *generalities --* but individuals defy the trend all the time.  For example, there are some people who are Jewish but who are very skeptical of the Zionist project and/or the activities of organizations like Democratic Majority for Israel and American Israel Public Affairs Committee.   Also for example, Bernie Sanders is a prominent American politician who is also Jewish, but who does not get along well with groups like Democratic Majority for Israel.  These counter-examples don't disprove the general trend, but they underscore the importance of not being prejudiced against any particular individual based on the mere fact that they belong to a certain religious/ethnic group.   

\[3\] Note, however, that segments of the population with more per capita financial resources will have an advantage vis-a-vis segments with less per capita financial resources under such a system of pluralist politics: this is one of the big problems with pluralism."
0,2022-07-10,"CMV: I'm with you if you are able to make a decent and convincing argument, not if you're riding the current ""moral wave""",u/PM_ME_YOUR_NASHID,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vvldir/cmv_im_with_you_if_you_are_able_to_make_a_decent/,changemyview,"This applies to most global issues. I'll start by immediately giving some examples, but please keep in mind that I'm not taking sides here, I'm just stating why someone leaning towards the ""unpopular"" stance on an issue shouldn't be demonized, given that he knows what he's talking about. 

So let's say someone doesn't want to take the covid vaccine, but has a really good reason for why he believes it's harmful and has done enough research to arrive at this conclusion. Again, I'm not saying he's right or wrong, I'm not here to argue vaccines, nor am I saying I'm an anti-vaxxer. However, when you compare someone like that with a person who just reads headlines and social media posts about how stupid anti-vaxxers are and decides to ride this wave, either out of fear or ignorance, and goes on to mock everyone who doesn't want to take the vaccine for the sake of redditors patting him on the back and giving him their upvotes, then I'd gladly side with the first guy.

Another example, and this gets on my nerve a little more than it should because I personally have been following the Russian-Ukrainian conflict for a bit more than 6 years. Now, I'm not by any means an expert on the topic, and I want to make it clear that I'm NOT siding with anyone in this conflict (GASP! you're not against the evil Russian regime!!!!????). However, how the fuck does someone who was introduced to this conflict by CNN an hour ago decide that Putin needs to die, Zelensky is a hero, and that it's all power-hungy-Russia's fault? oh because that's what he's been hearing non stop on TV? Do you even know what Putin sounds like? I personally would rather hear someone's logical, non-emotional take on the matter, doesn't matter if he's pro-Ukraine or pro-Russia, just give me something, anything other than ""SlAvA UkRaInE!"". 

Again, PLEASE, don't miss the point entirely and come to this post to explain why it's Russia's fault, I'm talking about the majority of people who learn their morals from MSM and don't bother to research anything.

For a bit of context, and just to let you know why this is an important topic for me: I'm from Lebanon. Ask 90% of people in the US what they think of Hezbollah and they'll immediately reply with ""TerRoriSts!"". Well, did you actually research Hezbollah? Did you know that Hezbollah got the most votes in the recent parliamentary elections in Lebanon (and it wasn't even close) ? or is it American/western media outlets doing the talking for you? And no, please don't visit /r/lebanon for the general sentiment on Hezbollah because it's mostly comprised of LF supporters (LF is a party that strongly opposes Hezbollah), and they mostly parrot Saudi and US media outlets. 

TLDR; if a person has his reasons and can articulate them clearly, be it a Trump supporter, someone who is pro-Russia invasion, an anti-vaxxer, whatever. I'll gladly hear what he has to say over any MSM wave rider who just parrots headlines."

67,2022-07-10,CMV: Cosmetology schools should be required to teach about textured hair,u/SpicyWhiteDress,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vvnomv/cmv_cosmetology_schools_should_be_required_to/,changemyview,"So for those of you who don’t know, traditional hair dressing schools typically only teach styles and looks for people of European descent. All the modules they cover mainly focus on how to style and color straight-wavy hair types, and they do not cover how to properly treat and style textured hair. The only thing they teach about textured hair is how to straighten it, which is basically useless because not everyone who has textured hair goes to a salon just to get it straightened. 

If being a hairdresser is one’s job, why would they not be required to learn how todo all types of hair? Why would they only need to know how to work with a specific race’s hair type and not all races? If you want to learn how todo textured hair, you either need to teach yourself or attend additional or advanced programs that are specifically for textured hair. I don’t think this is fair because why not just cover it in regular beauty school? Yea textured hair can be more difficult to work with but like I mentioned before, if you’re going to school for hair then you should be responsible for learning about ALL hair. 

Another reason I think this should be taught is because I feel like not teaching it breeds segregation in the hair industry. Being a black female with curly textured hair I can speak from experience on this one. I cannot go to “white” salons because they do not know how todo my hair, and I’ve had some salons just flat out refuse to take me. If I want to get my hair done, I have to go to a “black” salon and I don’t even see a reason as to why we need “black and “white” hair salons. Isn’t this the literal definition of segregation? If Hair schools would just teach about textured hair this would not be a problem anymore as I could walk into any salon knowing that they know how to work with my hair type. Working with black hair should be a part of the “normal” not considered a “specialization”.

I’m posting this here because i’m genuinely curious to see what others think and to learn if there is actually a good reason why cosmo schools don’t need to include textured hair in their curriculums."

The main difference is that the intersection does not come to right angles. Rather, it slices a right triangle out of them so it's ""flat"" as seen from the center of the interserction.

There are two main advantages:

(1) in green, those are usually parking spots. They are great for loading and unloading, as well as just generally adding more parking into neighborhoods. 

(2) in red, the little extra space for cars to clear the intersection mean that there's much less ""block the box"" activity and therefore far less gridlock than in a place like NYC, where cars apparently consider the intersection to be a parking lot. 

The only main criticism I can suss out is that pedestrians have to walk several extra steps to cross the street, but most able-bodied people can use a couple extra steps in their day.

For example, in a population where 99% of people can digest lactose, a lactose-intolerant person preaching the dangers of dairy consumption would seem crazy. 

There are people who have severe food allergies and who can only eat meat from animals that were killed the same day, but for the majority of people eating food that was frozen for months is no issue.

So, I think that it is unfair to say that just because we can’t *currently* prove that an element that a person claims is harmful to them is actually harmful, they are lying or crazy.

To me, that's just clearly discriminatory. It's simply not giving men the same ability to work out only amongs theirselves

0,2022-07-10,CMV: If conservatives want to whine about LGBTQ content in kids media pushing a “gay agenda” then the censorship of this content in localizations of anime in the 90’s by turning it straight is just as much pushing a “straight agenda.”,u/tsundereshipper,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vw5cj4/cmv_if_conservatives_want_to_whine_about_lgbtq/,changemyview,"I will be using the anime Sailor Moon as an example here.

For those unaware non-weebs, Sailor Moon is one of the most popular and genre-defining anime franchises of it’s time. It was part of what was known as the big “Millenial Boom of the 90’s” that helped popularize and mainstream anime into the West. Sailor Moon alongside Dragon Ball Z, Pokemon, Yugioh and Cardcaptor Sakura are all global hit phenomena that managed to bridge the gap between “those weird Japanese porn cartoons” and “normie society.”

These types of shows were also all aimed at kids back in their home Japan, and I’m talking *really* little kids, like kindergarten aged and up little.

So what did American dubbing companies at the time proceed to do when they brought such shows over to the West? Surely such innocent and benign child-friendly media would remain virtually untouched in the localization process right?

Oh you sweet summer child…

See due to the difference in culture Japan has much more lenient standards on what’s appropriate to show to little kids - at least compared with America at the time. Yet even then some things remained universal, the Queer romances featured in Sailor Moon for instance were as chaste as any Disney Renaissance Romance film at the time if not chaster. 

But I understand if America simply wasn’t ready to introduce the concept of two mommies or daddies to their preschoolers, it was the 90’s after all.

But there’s still no excuse for not just simply removing these characters/relationships but actively *turning* them straight instead, and there are three instances where this happens in the original DIC Sailor Moon dub (DIC was a subsidiary of Disney, so technically Sailor Moon was originally licensed and localized by Disney, my have times changed indeed if we’re going from a world where Disney actively straight-washed queerness in their licenses to outright *creating* it.)

* In the first season of Sailor Moon we are introduced to two villains from the evil organization who are a canonical gay couple. How did DIC handle this you might ask? Instead of removing the characters altogether or editing/changing their scenes and dialogue they instead kept everything else the same except turned one of them into a *woman.*

* In the second season we get a scene where another male character not explicitly, but heavily alludes to secret feelings for another man. The context for this scene was just as rife for DIC to leave out the subject of romance altogether on the man’s part and simply have him neutrally mock the female character’s feelings instead. (In the original they both shared a romantic interest in the same man) What did DIC do? Instead of taking the neutral way out they instead change the man’s dialogue into confessing a secret crush towards the woman he’s currently conversing with in the scene, again *literally straight-washing a character and inventing their own hetero ship out of nowhere!* Why did romance even have to remain relevant to this edit in the first place? If they were just trying to avoid the controversy of showing the queer boogeyman to the kiddos and risk having angry Karen moms calling the broadcast stations why did they feel the need to interject their own made up hetero fanfiction, why couldn’t they just censor the scene as is and avoid any mention of romantic intentions on the part of the male to begin with?

* The third and final instance is from the 3rd season and involves yet another canonical queer couple (only this time lesbians) who were infamously censored into cousins, but the cousins thing isn’t what I’m going to rant about that’s just whatever, network requirements and the like. No, what I *am* going to rant about is DIC taking the chance to gratuitously insert a moment of heterosexuality into a specific scene involving these lesbians when they could’ve just left it well enough alone as is and the kids wouldn’t have known the better. In the scene the girls are reminiscing about their first kisses and one half of the lesbian couple is talking about her first kiss back in Junior High, she never reveals the identity of who stole her first kiss even in the Japanese original but again it’s heavily alluded to with the way she gazes knowingly at her partner from across the table. So what did DIC do? Instead of just removing the scene or even just the gaze altogether or assuming that the kids would be none the wiser cause you know, they already changed this couple into *cousins,* they instead had to cringely make Sailor Neptune’s character describe in detail who the identity of her first kiss was - why it was BRAD the CUTEST guy in her school of course ~!

All these instances I mentioned go beyond just mere censorship and into straight-out (pun intended) heterosexual propaganda, so don’t talk to me about chaste LGBT content in kids media being used to indoctrinate kids when anime dubbing companies of the 90’s were hypocritically doing the same thing. I’d like to see if anyone can explain to me why the above was okay yet it’s somehow “propaganda” for kids to see a lesbian kiss in the new Buzz Lightyear movie? I’d be interested in seeing if anyone can justify how the above three examples *aren’t* in fact, blatant heterosexual propaganda and indoctrinating kids into being straight when they could’ve just as easily left well enough alone and edit out the scenes altogether rather than leaving them mostly the same just with a “straight” altercation. 

Why is Buzz Lightyear considered gay propaganda but the above examples aren’t hetero propaganda? Why is it only propaganda when Disney creates original queer scenes but not when they localize existing characters into being straight? Propaganda is Propaganda, either criticize all instances of it or just admit that you hold homophobic double standards because I assure you it would’ve been *far* more sanitizing for the kids if they just edited out all allusions to romance in general with these scenes/characters."
781,2022-07-10,CMV: Movies should start on time.,u/greysky7,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vw6fwa/cmv_movies_should_start_on_time/,changemyview,"I really hate being forced to watch trailers before movies, and I think it would be reasonable and respect my time much more if movies started at the actual showtime. To be clear, I'm only discussing movies shown at movie theaters.

Here are my main issues with movies starting past their scheduled showtimes.

First, movies generally are becoming longer and longer (this is a [shitty source but given it's a pretty easy experiment I think it's ok](https://www.whattowatch.com/features/are-movies-really-getting-longer)). So I'm going to a movie and that's usually already two hours or more. Now I have to watch *at least* an extra 15 minutes of trailers. This is turning into a pretty long date.

Second, I don't see the value in seeing trailers on the big screen. To be transparent, I already hate watching trailers. I don't understand why people even like watching trailers. They're just lame hype/marketing for the movie and give little indication imo as to whether the movie will actually be good.

I understand why the theater is showing me trailers, as it theoretically entices me to come back and see movies that I may not have if I didn't see the trailer. But in my view, this is essentially just a forced commercial at an event that I already paid for.

I think trailers made sense at a time before youtube but now if you're interested in a movie, you can just go watch it on your own.

Third, and this is a big one. I like eating my popcorn while watching the damn actual movie. They go together, the movie and the popcorn. It's a classic experience. But if I wait til after the trailers, my popcorn is already not warm when I can start eating it. So I start eating popcorn during the trailers and it just kills that classic combo. I know this is really just a preference and my view can't be changed on this part, sorry for adding it.

Now, one would hope that this could all be avoided by just showing up late to the movie, but that obviously doesn't work for two main reasons. One, you don't know how long the snack line is going to be, and two, you don't know how long the trailers will be (in other words, you don't even know the actual showtime). So it's too much of a risk that you'll miss the beginning of the movie if you show up late.

I think my view could actually be changed on this, there must be benefits of trailers/late showtimes to me. One that is already creeping somewhere in my mind is that sometimes my friends are late for double dates or something, and they get in just as the trailers end. Perhaps the time buffer is actually an important benefit, since I'm someone who generally isn't late to things.

Are there any other benefits to showing a movie later than the scheduled showtime?!"

0,2022-07-10,CMV: There can't exist multiple infinities,u/PoodleDoodle22,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vw96k4/cmv_there_cant_exist_multiple_infinities/,changemyview,"The famous Georg Cantor believed he could refute the 5th Euclid's principle (that the whole is greater than the part) by arguing that the set of even numbers, although being part of the set of numbers integers, can be placed in one-to-one correspondence with it, so that the two sets would have the same number of elements and thus the part would be equal in all:

&amp;#x200B;

1, 2, 3, 4...n 2, 4, 6, 8... 2n = n .

&amp;#x200B;

With this demonstration, Cantor and his epigones believed they were overthrowing, along with a principle of ancient geometry, also an established belief common sense and one of the pillars of classical logic, thus revealing the horizons of a new era of human thought. This reasoning is based on the assumption that both the set of numbers integers like the pairs are actual infinite sets, and it can therefore be rejected by anyone who believes, with Aristotle, that quantitative infinity is only potential, never actual.

&amp;#x200B;

But, even accepting the assumption of the infinite current, Cantor's demonstration is just a play on words, and very little ingenious in the background. First of all, it is true that if we represent the integers each one by one sign (or cipher), we will have there an (infinite) set of signs or ciphers; and if, in this set, we want to highlight by special signs or figures the numbers that represent pairs, then we will have a “second” set that will be  part of the first; and, both being infinite, the two sets will have the same number of elements, confirming Cantor's argument. But this is confusing numbers with their mere signs, making an unjustified abstraction from mathematical properties that define and differentiate numbers from each other and, therefore implicitly abolishing also the very distinction between peers and odd numbers on which the alleged argument is based. “4” is a sign, “2” is a sign, but it is not the sign “4” which is double 2, but the quantity 4, be it represented by that sign or by four dots. the set of numbers integers can contain more number signs than the set of even numbers —since it encompasses even and odd signs —but not a greater number of units than contained in the series of pairs.

&amp;#x200B;

Cantor's thesis slips out of this obviousness through the expedient of playing with a double meaning of the word “number”, sometimes using it to designate a quantity defined with certain properties (among which that of occupying a certain place in the series of numbers and that of being even or odd), sometimes to designate the mere sign of number, that is, the cipher. The series of even numbers is only made up of evens because it is counted in pairs. two, that is, skipping a unit between every two numbers; If it was not counted like that, the numbers would not be even. It is useless here to resort to the subterfuge that Cantor refers to the mere “set” and not to the “series ordered”; because the set of even numbers would not be even if their elements could not be ordered two by two in an ascending series uninterrupted that progresses by adding 2, never by 1; and no number could be considered a pair if it could freely switch places with any another in the series of integers. “Parity” and “place in the series” are concepts inseparable: if n is even, it is because both n + 1 and n - 1 are odd. In that sense, it is only the implicit sum of the unmentioned units that makes so that the series of pairs is pairs.  So - and here is Cantor's fallacy - — there are not two series of numbers here, but a single one, counted in two. ways: the even number series is not really part of the number series integers, but it is the series of integers itself, counted or named in a certain way.

&amp;#x200B;

The notion of “set” is that, abusively detached from the notion of “series”, produces all this crazy mental gymnastics, giving the appearance that even numbers can constitute a “set” regardless of the each one's place in the series, when the fact is that, abstracting from the position in the series, there is no there is no more parity or no impairment. If the series of integers can be represented by two sets of signs, one only of pairs, the other of pairs odd, this does not mean that they are two really different series. THE The confusion that exists there is between “element” and “unity”. a set of x units certainly contain the same number of “elements” as a set of x pairs, but not the same number of units. What Cantor does is, in essence, substantiate or even hypostasis the notion of “even” or “parity”, assuming that any number can be even “in itself”, regardless of their place in the series and their relationship to everyone else numbers (including, of course, with its own half), and that the pairs can be counted as things and not as mere positions interspersed in the series of integer numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

In his “argument”, it is not a question of a true distinction between all and part, but of a merely verbal comparison between a whole and the same whole, variously named. Not being a true whole and of a true part, then one cannot speak of an equality of elements between whole and part, nor, therefore, of a refutation of the 5th principle of Euclid. Cantor misses target by many meters."

This has nothing to do with animosity towards Puerto Rican or Hispanic people. 

I am well aware of the bias when you are not familiar with a genre of music that it can ""all sound the same"", people often feel this way about rap or metal. However, there is something unique to popular Reggaeton that I hear all over my majority-Latino town in the USA, and that is the fact that all of these popular songs use the exact same beat, just with different instruments or tempos. 

I'm talking about [this](https://youtu.be/aX7k4fPKsHA) kind of beat.

My latino friends have tried to get me to listen to Bad Bunny and Daddy Yankee and while i love some of Bad Bunny's music, I can't help but notice a lot of songs use this exact same Reggaeton beat. 

This goes beyond mere sampling, which is a popular music production technique, this is full on laziness. If AC/DC or Michael Jackson or the Beatles or Taylor Swift or Drake or Beyonce used the same beat across all of their music, or heck, even across multiple songs, they'd be ridiculed for it as being lazy and unimaginative.

When you open the box the cat will either be dead or alive. If the cat is alive when you open the box, some people say that an alternate universe would have been created where the cat did not die. I however disagree, because compared to the universe, a cat dyeing is extremely insignificant. Also if another universe was created just because a cat died then that would means a universe would be created for everything that people do.

I believe it can be sexual harassment, but I dont believe this is sexual coercion.

I mean if a woman tell guy 'no' and he keeps asking for sex and the woman give in to be left alone I dont believe this was rape.

Threats, blackmailing, sex with unconsious person, deception (not sure about that one) - all of this are pretty clear.

The stark difference to me is that rape is about taking the ability to make a choice from raped person and doing something against their will. I know it's tricky subject in grey areas, but lets put it this way: if someone have sex with your wife forcibly, under threat or when she is unconsious - it would be clear to you she was raped.

But if a guy at party keep asking her to have sex for whole night, and she do it because reasons, I doubt you would consider this rape as well.

I have similar problem with deception; on one hand if someone lies about their STD status thats clearly unacceptable. Is it enough to call the sex rape? Well, again, if your GF has sex with someone who lied to her about the STD status she may feel like sueing him, but from your perspective this would be cheating. 

What kinds of deception would we consider to be enough to call rape? Std status? Gender? Financial/martial/ social status ( I believe some people sued someone over this and won e.g. 'Jerusalem rape').

And then last thing - having sex after alcohol. That's so tricky and relative. Apparently two people can now rape each other when they are wasted. What the hell is that even supposed to mean... I understand good intentions behind it, but I feel like this doesnt make full sense.

I believe that all things Iistes are bad, but cant put my finger on how to call them. Calling them rape is a bit of overexageration to me. I can't help the feeling that rape used to be one of most vicious and disgusting crimes, but now its ""umbrella term"" for so many things that sometimes fall in some gray area that it trivilaizes this hienous crime.

I am open to change my mind :)

(Bonus round) martial coercion. Saying ""if you dont have sex with me I will divorce you"". On one hand coercion, on the other hand perfectly valid reason to end marriage over dead bedrom.

""It all depends how you say it"" sure, agree. Timing, tone, everything matters. But fundamentally, the threat to leave your spouse over no sex is there and sure as hell you can phrase it in legally and socially appropriate way that is still a personal threat.

EDIT 2:
Lets consider implied threats still a threats. But is solely man being stronger than women an always existing 'implied threat'?"

A country where around 1 in 7 people - [over 14%](https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/news-internal/monthly-poverty-february-2022)\- live in poverty. A country where [over 10% of households](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/food-security-and-nutrition-assistance/#:~:text=The%20prevalence%20of%20food%20insecurity,had%20very%20low%20food%20security) are food insecure, and [3.9%](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/food-security-and-nutrition-assistance/#:~:text=The%20prevalence%20of%20food%20insecurity,had%20very%20low%20food%20security) have very low food security throughout the year. A country where 17 million children are struggling with hunger. And therefore, I currently don't see it as justified to send money to other countries, when so many within our borders are desperately in need of help.

Now, the opposing argument is that some other countries have far worse situations, with more citizens going hungry, and more living in poverty. But I will argue that the US government is principally responsible for US citizens. The US government is appointed by Americans, to represent the interests of Americans. And therefore, even if we see higher rates of food insecurity elsewhere, the fact is that it still exists in the US. And it exists in quite high rates. And so, before we even consider helping other countries with their problems, we should devote our effort to solving those same problems within our borders.

Another opposing argument is this: ""Taxpayers generally don't have to worry about poverty. If they contribute towards ending it, they are only helping other people. Why should it matter if those people are at home or overseas?"" I would respond by saying the following: if tax money is spent on things that will directly improve American society, it will benefit all Americans. Helping low-income families doesn't only benefit people in those families. It benefits the entirety of the US. After all, [it's been documented](https://www.childfriendlycardiff.co.uk/2020/11/study-links-childhood-poverty-to-violent-crime-and-self-harm/) that children growing up in poverty are more likely to go on to commit crimes. If poverty goes down, crime will do the same. If American tax payers spend money on foreign aid, it won't benefit themselves or their community. This is important because a community where everyone is reasonably well-nourished makes the experience better for all. 

I see that this view is unpopular, so I would like to understand why it may be wrong. Debate away!"

0,2022-07-11,"CMV: Humans are naturally socially hierarchical and the amount of compassion, care and respect (i.e. love) a person is given by others is directly tied to their percieved social status.",u/hjvdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vwiuxp/cmv_humans_are_naturally_socially_hierarchical/,changemyview,"(Re-posted since I couldn't reply within 3 hours last time due to life stuff) 

With 'social status' I don't necessarily mean status in their society/culture, as that can be unnatural, but more general life competence (having strong social skills, ability to create wealth and master difficult skills, etc) and genetic quality (genetically gifted with intelligence, physical prowess, beauty, health, etc).

Humans are drawn like magnets to a person who have high scores on these factors and feel a rush of positive emotions simply from being around them, and even more from being accepted into their circle of relationships, even if they've done nothing good for them. And on the other hand humans repel the person with low scores, and might feel irritated, disgusted, depressed or creeped out by them, even if the person haven't done anything bad.

There are some who voluntarily spend time with and help people with very low social status scores, like helping people in need, the poor, the homeless, the intellectually disabled, the crippled, etc, but they're not driven by compassion and are instead doing this as a way to build up their own status, e.g. to look like a nurturing person who would be a high quality parent/sexual mate, or gain status in a religious community, etc. They might not have done the self-reflection to realise this though, as competing for status is so instinctive and spontaneus few probably think about how it effects our actions, and most people dislike learning about it too.

I think the only people who exist outside of the hierarchy are small children and maybe very old people who struggle to live independently. For children, as they age they quickly start to enter the hierarchy - maybe after 4-5, when children exit their ""narcissistic"" phase and their caretakers love instinctively shifts from unconditional to conditional and more demands are put on them. And with old people, since they've already ""proven"" their status and aging is inevitable, we instinctively cut them some slack.

The reasoning behind my view are:

1. The lack of compassion towards low status people in society. For example someone did a test/prank on YouTube where they pretended to collapse unconscious in the street wearing cheap clothes vs a suit. People ignored the first collaps but formed a crowd around and helped in the second. It very common that autistic or intellectually disabled kids are bullied and treated with disdain by adult teachers in school. Abusive therapists are also common in mental health support. Homeless people are seen as less valuable in general. The examples are endless and uniquitous in all societies it seems.
2. The worship culture of celebrities, who are often super-high status (attractive, in great shape, high intelligence, talented, able to achieve goals, etc). Also the halo effect, where attractive people are seen as morally virtious or forgiven no matter what. I remember a news story about male criminal who committed henious violent crimes and had the looks of a supermodel who became very popular online and offered model jobs.
3. It makes sense evolutionary and, AFAIK, all social animals that live in groups have some kind of social hierarchy. The hierarchy makes sure to limit mating opportunities so that the good genetics are passed onward. If everyone had the same mating opportunities evolution wouldn't work that well since the only other way to prevent the less fit individuals from mating was them dying, which is less likely is a social species that cooperate.

0,2022-07-11,CMV: A libertarian alternative to mandatory health insurance (full freedom but full consequences),u/Glaucon123,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vwjiyi/cmv_a_libertarian_alternative_to_mandatory_health/,changemyview,"**My view of the problem:**

In the current US healthcare system, (emergency) treatment cannot be denied to anyone even if that person is uninsured and therefore cannot pay. This is a major problem because the costs of treating such a person are then absorbed by the hospital, forcing the hospital to raise costs for all treatments on patients. This has resulted in the US having some of the highest healthcare costs in the world. This is problematic for a few reasons:

(1) For some people, it is a disincentive to get insured. They know that they will be treated regardless so do not purchase insurance because the greatest incentive to do so (the fact that they might be left to dies) is not there.

(2) It is pushing the costs of treating those who cannot pay onto the rest of society. This is the same principle that those in favor of universal healthcare promote, however this ad-hoc way of doing it is inefficient in both costs and outcomes since it focuses on emergency care instead of the (cheaper and more effective) preventative care.

&amp;#x200B;

**Commonly suggested solutions:**

One solution to this is to mandate health insurance. This is the case in some US states (Massachusetts) and some foreign countries (Switzerland). Another solution is to provide state-run healthcare (France). 

The problem that I have with mandating health insurance is that it impedes individual rights. Some people are willing to take the risk of not having insurance and--in my view--they should be allowed to since they are adults living in a free country. 

I also object to state-run healthcare for the same reason (no opt-out option). I also worry about the outcome results and efficiency of a state-run system. To its credit though, it would likely be more cost-efficient than our current ad-hoc version of treating everyone and then passing on the costs.

&amp;#x200B;

**My proposed solution:**

Every adult must submit an annual form regarding his insurance situation. The form would contain the following choices, of which one must be selected:

(A) I have health insurance and am covered up to this amount: $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (proof of insurance is attached)

(B) I do not have health insurance but agree to cover all costs of my treatment up to this amount: $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (link to escrow-style bank account with these funds if number entered is &gt;$0)

&amp;#x200B;

The form would also clearly state that: ""Any treatment cost above your specified amount will not be performed. Please note that this may result in your preventable death or disability due to insufficient funds."" And the citizen would then be required to sign the acknowledgement. To be clear, citizens are free to write the number ""$0"" on line (B), they would still have to sign the acknowledgement. 

Hospitals would then have a database with the amounts that the citizens set aside for their treatment. Hospitals would spend no more than the allowed amount as specified on this database even if meant withholding treatment that might result in disability or death. I know, this is dark and sounds quite cruel, but it is what people chose. They are being treated as adults in a free society, part of that means dealing with the consequences.

And the lighter side is that I believe that the very act of having to fill out the form and agreeing to such a dire statement would make the vast majority of people purchase insurance. People would want to put aside some funds for treatment--since the prospect of being left to die if an accident occurs is terrifying--and would quickly realize that by buying insurance they could write $1M+ in the line on option A without setting aside savings and would likely feel better with that option.

&amp;#x200B;

**I've never heard of a system like this being seriously considered and am interested to see what the objections to it are. I feel that it would be effective at incentivizing people to purchasing insurance (which is a societal good because risk can then be shared among people) while preserving full individual freedom.** 

(I'm more interested in seeing arguments against the general idea as opposed to flaws in the specific implementation that I outlined above, but both are welcome of course)"

It appears that a majority of voters are in favor of banning assault weapons and high capacity magazines in the US. If Canada can do it, surely America can as well.

But the amount of people who refuse to comply with the buyback will most likely do so non violently. The belief that a mandatory gun and magazine buyback in the US would lead to regular citizens massacring law enforcement en masse seems unrealistic to me. Sure, you might have a few incidents where a couple whackos make a last stand against the ATF with a high body count, but those will probably be very rare occurrences. Most people who do resist giving up the items will give them very reluctantly or will be arrested and jailed. So, most dangerous items will be returned without a single shot being fired.

At the end of the day, people have families to support and don't want to go to jail or die."

It would be enough to cover only living expenses such as rent, basic food and basic bills. Many countries have taken the idea seriously enough to have pilot programs to test UBI with pretty positive results.

In a world where unemployed people have enough to survive on, the power to turn down exploitative work is very valuable.

On the flipside, it opens up jobs that normally wouldn't be worth it for the employers unless they pay very little. As an example, food delivery jobs such as doordash/skip do not typically pay enough to live on and are typically done as a secondary job. If every job you do isn't to survive but rather to improve your quality of life, it could be much more rewarding. You do it to build up your wealth rather than to avoid getting behind.

Other benefits of UBI worth mentioning are reduced crime and violence, reduced drug and alcohol abuse, improved mental health and less overall stress.

It also goes without saying that AI and automation will replace more work every year. Even if most people keep working and more jobs are created, the hours we work are decreasing, and that can be a good thing."

I don't know who the main character will be for the series, but for comparison if they had been making a remake of the trilogy they could have made Frodo black.

The only physical characteristic that needs to be preserved is that he is a hobbit.  Everything else doesn't matter to the story.  LOTR is not about skin-color, so making sure it matches the author's descriptions isn't an issue and won't make Tolkien roll in his grave.  I've heard some folk talk about LOTR being set in a world based off Europe as an argument to keep the characters white, but I don't see how that influence is important to the story.  The core of the story IMO has to do with power, corruption, and how hope can from unexpected places.

*So why even change skin color in the first place?* Tolkien might have been a little subconsciously racist.  The elves, the most powerful good race, had fair skin.  Orcs had dark skin.  The few humans who sided with Sauron were also described with swarthy skin, and described as savages much like racists described black people.  Now, LOTR is an amazing story and shouldn't be hidden from history for its racist influence, so I think a few changes to the adaptations to make it more palatable for the modern era makes sense.  Like retro-conning some important characters to be black."

Why do we accept individuals collecting at the expense of the taxpayer for (sometimes) decades?

The career welfare recipient should not be a thing. These programs should be limited to a year, with a possible extension of an additional year if an individual is showing discipline &amp; promise of getting “back on their feet”. For those who do not demonstrate the ability to do this, it would be far more economical to provide group housing and cheap government issued meals. Public assistance should not be comfortable, but merely the bare minimum to survive.

This post was inspired by the endless rants and comedic genius that is Rhod Gilbert.

If you are unfamiliar, No fear Shakespeare is a series of books that attempt to rewrite Shakespeare's text into modern English. The books present the original text on the left and the corresponding updated text on the right.

I don't admit to be an amazing writer nor novelist, perhaps thank my lack of interest in literary arts, but the juvenile in me wishes to uphold that if you're writing has to be rewritten to be understood, you are a in fact a bad writer.

Now I honestly dont hold this the case of Shakespeare, as one such good rebuttal I hear all too often is that his writing was meant for a different time, circa 1500s. But that's my gripe. I agree there is beauty in the motifs, the themes, the tone, the overall message of Shakespeare's writing, but old archaic English and iambic pentameter have little relevancy in modern day writing let alone my  high school's Shakespearean art projects worth near 30% of my grade. 

Certainly we can discuss poetry as art by the written word, but I don't subscribe to the notion that we must thoroughly peruse 500-year-old Shakespearean hieroglyphics on cheap recycled paper with both borrowed &amp; chewed pencils atop creaky, gum covered, never-level desks across every High School in place of modern poets. If anything delegate his writing and associated half-explained homework assignments to my history class. Thank you for coming to my ted talk (*mic drop*)"

To start with [youth crime rates have dropped 80% since the 90s](https://www.crimeinamerica.net/national-juvenile-crime-statistics-show-major-declines/), that sounds pretty good to me!

So basically, today's youth is more educated, tolerant and better behaved. Doesn't sound like a crisis to me

Indeed, while kids in the past may have gotten beatings instead of groundings and may have more access to entertainment. Evidently the youth are improving on most fronts. I really don't see how getting an allowance or not being beaten for getting an 'F' is some immense travesty, in fact it seems to have had a positive effect!

If the decision to have an abortion or not is allowed, it necessarily, logically facilitating eugenics as people are free to pick and choose what genes are desirable or not.

Abortion is the ending of life, ie killing of something that is human, albeit lesser developed human.

One reason to get an abortion is because of genetic testing reveals some kind of condition, such as Autism/Aspergers. (edit, or most on point, Down Syndrome)

Some people choose to get abortions for that reason.

Therefore, being pro choice, by necessity allows for that.

Eugenics is the practice of choosing good genes for reproduction and/or discouraging bad genes for reproduction.

Having an abortion because of a genetic test showing genes for something such as autism is denying life because autism genes are deemed bad.

Therefore, being pro-choice passively allows for eugenics, and is arguably pro-eugenics.

In my mind it is pro-eugenics because abortions cannot be separated from the consequence. Similarly, pregnancy cannot be seen as separate from sex.

I have thought about this topic a lot and participated in many threads on reddit, but this I just had this epiphany, and this is the first time I put it all together clearly like this.

Edit: People are focusing on the intent part of eugenics, and I do concede that is the weaker part of my argument, and manslaughter and murder are different, but at the end of the day, someone died. At the end of the day, people could select for whatever trait. This has been a lot to think about.

Edit 2: I'm done here, I think this has been fully explored. Its starting to get a bit off topic now, ie discuss abortion more generally. And I'm kind of done talking about it because the left leaning side  of Reddit is making this impossible for me to continue with all the ad hominems. I've had these types of ""discussions"" before, and its not worth it anymore. My mental  fortitude is breaking, not directly because of this thread, but [r/law](https://www.reddit.com/r/law/), which has become [r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/) among other subs.  And because I felt like answering and reading other stuff I still haven't gotten sleep. I'm too fucking drained and demoralized right now. So much ad hominem because people assume you have a  different opinion you must be a fascist.

The reasons traditionally mentioned are to ‘preserve wildlife’, ‘preserve nature’ or for general safety. 

It’s my view that pushing these rules onto all dogs is not right. In doing so, we make the life of dogs a living hell by limiting their freedom of movement and robbing them of the essentials they need in life (running, sniffing around things, etc.). It is also unfair that we have rules like this for dogs specifically. The ‘risk’ the average dog poses to society does not justify enforcing rules on all dogs.

Most fenced dog playpens and the sort, are literal prisons. A sad cry from the nature that should be open to anyone.

Most human beings do far more damage to wildlife and conservations than the average dog. E.g. by destroying trails, flora, leaving trash, throwing cigarette butts everywhere, you name it. Besides, human beings inflict far more damage onto other humans than dogs do. The risk of anything happening to my daughter due to the ill intentions of a human should be exponentially larger than it is by a dog. I have no source for all this, these are I think fair hypotheses to have.

I will say that - if your dog has not had a good upbringing and been taught to behave, you might need to abide by these rules. Not doing so, is unsafe to others. Do you know your dog will chase and kill wildlife? Then don’t have them off lease. Do you know your dog won’t listen to you on first or second call? Then use the lease.

To anyone saying ‘you never know what your dog might do, it’s an animal’, you are wrong. As a dog owner, you know. You have tried it before. You know if the dog will listen, even in busier environments. It is up to you as an owner to make the evaluation and decision. Similar to how it’s up to parents to raise their children and decide if they are well behaved enough to go out on their own without hurting anyone.

To force lease requirements and bans upon all dogs as a group, is torture, unfair and not justified. Considering the average person is more harmful to both nature and others, we should leash and ban people."

0,2022-07-12,CMV: Pay to Win is over used in video games it should be called Pay for Convenience,u/gothpunkboy89,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vx8y3v/cmv_pay_to_win_is_over_used_in_video_games_it/,changemyview,"I think the term Pay to Win is overly used and an over exaggeration of words in an effort to make an opinion sound more important then it actually is.  Much in the same way  people will often use the term ""objective fact"" when describing their personal opinions of a game in an effort to make their opinions sound more important. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is because with only the very rare exception there is no real pay to win just convenience.  Any discussion about what qualifies as winning quickly devolves into some gaming philosophical discussion about the nature of games.  Which usually ends up with the person complaining about pay to win screaming shill before (potentially) blocking you because how dare you disagree with their most holy of opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

But winning has a clear meaning in the real world and in video games. When your team scores more points or gets more kills in a multiplayer game you win. When you reduce a boss's health to zero or complete the game you win.  But the first team to beat a new raid in WoW or Destiny doesn't ""win"" their respective games. The first person to beat Forbidden West or Elden Ring doesn't ""win"" those games.  The first person to get an Oppressor mk.2 on GTAO or a full bloodied set on Fallout 76 didn't win their games.  Nothing about these actions are winning simply getting their first or simply before another person. The 1st person to beat a raid and the 90,000th person to beat a raid still beat the same raid and gets the same rewards. No one really ""won"" over another person and me completing a raid before a friend doesn't mean that I beat them in the game. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now there are countless examples to use but I will focus on 2 popular or at least well known examples in gaming. GTA Online and Fallout 76.  Both are commonly called pay to win games and both are stellar examples of why it should be called pay for convenience rather then win, because calling it pay to win is a deliberate exaggeration.

&amp;#x200B;

GTA Online has Rockstar selling card sharks which is basically in game currency that you can then use to buy what ever you want in game. But it is the same currency you earn in game doing jobs and missions.  Early game you can struggle to earn money but after you invest in several business you are able to make much higher returns.  Combine that with the fact Rockstar is always running some event were certain jobs or activities provide a x2 to x4 pay out you can earn a fairly good chunk of money in a short amount of time.  Particularly some of the largest single pay out business generate money in the background as you play. 

&amp;#x200B;

So a new player can choose to spend money on card sharks and speed up their progress in the game but they didn't really win anything. Simply because another new player can refuse to spend any money and still reach the same position even if it is a month or so later. It is a convenience not winning anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Fallout 76 has a couple of examples that are all valid for this but I will focus on junk stash boxes. Basically Bethesda introduced Fallout 1st subscription to the game that offered several perks for paying the subscription. The key one people complain about is the junk stash box which allows infinite junk storage. For what ever reason you will find people acting as if this is some mandatory thing that was excluded from the player base. Yet in every discussion about it asking why they need 500 copper scrap  or 1k black titanium the arguments generally are variations of ""because I want it"" or ""previous Fallouts had infinite storage""  which really are not very good or strong arguments as it makes the user sound like a bit of a spoiled child and deliberately ignoring that from the start 76 was created to be different from previous Fallout games. 

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who has been playing the game almost since launch the junk stash is not necessary in the slightest. Inventory management is pretty easy and using the tag feature to only target junk you need and not grabbing everything like some hoarder allows for extremely easy inventory management.  With the exception of when I am gearing up to mass craft ammo the junk in my stash is maybe 300-350 out of the 1200 stash weight limit.  Even with all the legendary weapons I horde as they are unique quest drops I still keep around 100-200 weight free in my stash box at all times. 

&amp;#x200B;

So again it is a convenience and nothing more. Having the junk stash doesn't effect your ability to advance in the story, your perk load outs, your legendary gear rolls. You can easily reach max caps just though playing the game so you don't even need to super rely on filing your stash with stuff to sell to other players though player vendors at your camps. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

While I am sure there are some game(s) some were that actually for-fill the pay to win (most likely mobile ones) the vast majority of them are simply pay for convenience and we should call it for what it is. Using pay to win is just exaggerating for the sake of exaggerating or to make it sound more important and worse then it actually is."

I will state up front, however, that this thread is more to hear other's opinions more than anything else.

Rehabilitative Justice seems like the most logical way to go.  If someone is causing issues or crime in society they are isolated and given training/treatment in order to ensure they can function in an orderly society when released.  This lowers the risk of future crime and lessens the likelihood of children growing into criminals.

In regards to Revenge, I believe it is a natural human desire that, while it can be destructive, is far to demonised by society.  I do not support vigilantism nor believe that a person should be allowed to take the law into their own hands.  Additionally however, I believe that people are far too quick to say some empty platitude like ""Living well is the best revenge,"" or ""Revenge is lowering yourself to their level,"".

Some people can forgive an injustice at the drop of a hat, no matter how grave it is.  Some struggle to forgive, but decide it is the best way for them to heal.  And then there's others (like myself, I'm forced to admit) who feel they *CANNOT* move on until they receive fair retribution and not getting it can affect their mental and emotional recovery from an injustice.

When a person is hurt unjustly, they have a natural and healthy desire for revenge.  It is this desire, along with a desire for an ordered society, which first began the concept of Law and Justice in the first place.

I think that for those who *need* their revenge as part of their healing, Courts should factor the strength of this desire while sentencing criminals.

For example:  Drink Driver gets drunk and knock's down a member of the public.  DD survives, but his victim had to have his arm amputated.  DD has a history of driving drunk, but the Court has a guaranteed 100% effective rehabilitative prison nearby where he would only need to serve 6 months.  However, the Victim is angry.  He was training to become a fire fighter and now has had to drop-out due to his amputation.  His dream career and many other such physical jobs are now beyond his reach.  He does not care that in 6 months DD would be a fully-functioning member of society and wants his desire for revenge to be factored into sentencing.  He  is sent to a court therapist who testifies that the victim is unlikely to let go of his desire for revenge and this will affect his mental health.

In a desirable outcome, there would be processes already in place to calculate what would be a ""fair"" compensation to the victim (say adding an additional 5-10 years to the sentence).

Any part of rehabilitation should include remorse and an admission of guilt.  If DD is completely rehabilitated, then even he should admit his victim's desire for revenge is warranted."

-I work to the average retirement age of 62
-I never get a raise/increase in my “social security” contribution
-I only get 6% return on my investment (far below what most would consider conservative over 30+ year spans)

This gives me ~37 years of investing, which with the above figures, comes out to over $1.1MM! The same 6% yield would return 66k/year in perpetuity. This is far above what I would receive through SS benefits in a lifetime, plus it would allow for my descendants to collect this indefinitely.

The party of ""waiting until marriage to have sex"" now has a large number of supporters who thing they are oppressed because they *aren't* having rampant promiscuous sex with large numbers of hot chicks. The states which claim to be ""Christian"" specialize in creating megachurches and ""prosperity gospel"" preachers who scam their followers out of millions and use it to buy jets. The party of family values gave us the likes of Donald Trump, Matt Gaetz, Roy Moore, Lauren Boebert, and many more politicians who have been embroiled in sex scandals or in cases of criminal sexual assault. The party of ""patriotism"" refused to wear masks and get vaccines in the name of ""personal freedom"", and as a result hundreds of thousands of Americans who could have lived are now dead. 

It seems rather hypocritical of them to cling so desperately to abortion and gay rights as cultural issues, claiming to be the religious family oriented crowd, when they have almost no legs to stand on anymore.

27,2022-07-12,CMV: Online political discussion does more harm than good,u/j3mtanks,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vxh3nz/cmv_online_political_discussion_does_more_harm/,changemyview,"I think that the majority of political discussion only furthers the division in the United States. It has done some good, but I think more harm has come out if internet politics than good in recent years.  To me, it seems like people believe the things the do only because they hate the other side rather than their own personal convictions.

One of the main things that causes toxicity online is anonymity. People can say what they want with almost zero repercussions. This allows personal attacks to happen rather than a solid argument against an idea. Nearly all of political Twitter seems to be this way. What kind of progress can we make if we are ""owning the libtards"" by spamming ""L + Ratio"" in the reply section. Reddit is also very toxic. r/politics is just a left wing circle jerk because most right wingers are banned or downvoted without a thought. People mass like or mass upvote things based on party affiliation even if it makes zero sense. I got mass downvoted in the Portland sub because I said it was a bad look to write ""F\*ck Lives Its her choice"" on a crappy anti-abortion sign. I never even took a pro-life stance in the original post but that one bit of pushback was too much for some people. Other people who criticized the messaging were also mass downvoted and ratioed by baffling takes as well. Sure the sign was cringe but why stoop to their level? The internet allows people to play down to competition easily and its tiring. 

Most in person political conversation has been a net positive for me because there is no anonymity. I grew up in a conservative home surrounded by conservative people in the overwhelmingly left leaning Portland. I feel like by beliefs have been refined if not downright changed through socializing with other people who were further left than I was. Now I consider myself to be more of a slightly anti-authoritarian centrist/moderate if anything. I had a face to relate the opinion to, and knew they had good intentions for their beliefs. Online, you don't usually have that and most people assume the worst in each other immediately.

Online political discussion has also led to vilification of those with opposing viewpoints. Nowhere is this more prevalent than in the debate on abortion. Pro-life people call Pro-Choice people murderers, while pro-choice people often say that people who are pro-life only want to control women. These are clearly not the reasons why people believe in either viewpoint, so why do I see these statements everywhere? Body baby's lives and bodily autonomy are strong and moral arguments, so why is it okay to attack someone else over their subjective morality? It is basically impossible to convince people of your arguments while directly attacking them, not their ideas. If KKK members can be convinced to change their ways, so can anyone else. I'm tired of people undermining the humanity of others because their beliefs are different. 

Most people only listen to sources within their own echo-chamber. Most people I know get all their sources from biased sources and aren't open minded enough to even try to understand the argument for and against certain things. Its really easy to think that your political opponent is terrible when you have Tucker Carlson or Sam Seder constantly telling you all the bad things Dems/Reps are doing currently.   

I also think that internet access has allowed more radical people to gain more widespread power and influence. I think it is sad that people/organizations like Vaush or PragerU have really large followings when their ideas are not supposed to be normal. Mainstream presence of weird ideologies only comes as justification for the vilifying of the opposition for a lot of people. It also allows people to lump in half of a nation with the extreme group of people. I'm tired of people calling each other commie or fascist when they are nowhere close to those ideologies. I'm also sick of people trying to counter one those two radical systems with the other.  Like fascism is awful, by why try to counter that with communism? Both are terrible authoritarian government systems that have killed millions of people in the last century alone. 

It seems like our bickering only benefits those in power. Politicians usually only pursue political positions to increase their own personal wealth. It sickens me that Nancy Pelosi has a nine figure net worth but represents a district where a 100 sq. ft. closet costs $1,000 a month in rent. But if you point that out, you are automatically labeled a conservative because you criticized a left wing politician. I think our immature political discourse and our fanboying over one side of the political spectrum enables this behavior. I don't understand blind allegiance to political parties. If someone in you party is bad, kick 'em out and find someone better. Why do people talk about the Clintons being on Epstein Island while conveniently forgetting Trump was on there as well? Why do people still defend Biden when his presidency has done nothing of positive value? No one keeps the same energy. The media is not exempt from this rule either. News outlets, youtubers, etc. all make a profit by selling you on their ideas. Their ideas always suspiciously change with their audience because it is more profitable to do so. Hasanabi will not stop being a ""socialist"" because he will lose a majority of his profits though capitalism if he causes any friction between him and his audience. Likewise, you never seem to catch someone like Ben Shapiro ever taking a stance that isn't the default conservative rhetoric. When H3H3's money from the edgy iDubbbz crowd started to dry up, Ethan self appointed himself as the new arbiter of social justice even though there is video of him gleefully using the N-word and homophobic slurs in the same sentence. These guys make profit off of us and are not genuine.  

Honestly, I'd like to be wrong and have some hope in this area. The internet has done a lot of good but it has come at a cost. We have widespread access to information but oftentimes it is bad information. I just feel very weary with all the nonsense both parties have spewed out over the last decade or so. If you took all this time to read all my nonsense thank you and have an excellent day :)"

Allowing 16/17-year-olds (sometimes younger) to marry is completely illogical to me. There are two main cases of marriage involving minors:

Marriage between a minor and an adult: allowing marriages like this clearly leads to child brides and exploitative situations. This obviously should not be permitted. This is already illegal in some countries.

Marriage between two minors: while this is generally not exploitative, it is still a terrible choice. If someone is barely old enough to drive, why should they be able to enter into something as serious as marriage? Marriage should take a lot more thought and consideration than a 16-year-old is capable of. As well, what's the harm in waiting a few years? A couple that young has hardly had any time to find out how compatible they are with each other in the aspects of life they will share after marriage.

I'll award a delta to anyone who can prove any benefits associated with the existence of these laws that are significant enough to outweigh the harms they bring.

Edit: I've awarded two deltas for the terminal illness point. Further change in view will have to attack my point that the laws allowing minors to marry should not exist."

The way I understand the general situation of anarcho-communism, is that, despite its ideal being far-fetched and unsustainable in a world with states, it as an ideology serves well as a compass, as something that factors in decision making. For instance, an anarcho-communist revolution need not apply the anarchism element right away.

When reading about historical events related to anarcho-communism, I can't help but notice a conspicuous lot of pressure from both Western and statist-communist (Marxist-Leninist) forces to quell those movements. For instance, the Spanish anarchists during the Spanish Revolution, who were ultimately quelled by *both* the Nationalist (Francoist) faction and the Communist (USSR-backed) faction.

I can't help but imagine that, had Kroportkin not perished in pneumonia, and survived until the rise of Stalin's rule, he would have been labeled a ""Trotskyite"" and sent to the gulags. It's a lot easier to honour an intellectual post-humously, because from their grave they cannot point at your regime and tell everyone all the things that are saliently wrong with it, culminating in assassination missions (as happened to Trotsky, sadly another statist, but an example of the staggering drawbacks of over-reliant statism)."

I'm talking about speeding offenses that are below reckless levels (whatever they may be).

Disclaimer 2: I'm writing from the U.S. perspective. 

\---

Reason 1: The punishment-- \~$70 - $250 and negative impact on insurance rates -- **disproportionately affects the poor.** Wealthier individuals are literally above the law when it comes to these offenses. **Billionaires don't even have to give a shit.**

Reason 2: The majority in-group are more likely to ""get off with a warning,"" than the othered minorities. The propagation of ""how I got off with a warning stories"" sow great discontent among those that tried and failed to do the same thing under similar circumstances. 

Reason 3: Because of Reasons 1 and 2, perceptions of how good or bad the justice system is, is divided along racial and economic lines,  sowing feelings of discontent, mistrust, and an overall lack of patriotism for those that have the short end of the stick. This then perpetuates a vicious cycle where the othered will be viewed and treated with even greater disdain by law enforcement for proving that they ""don't belong"" or ""don't love America enough"". 

Reason 4: Those that suffer from injustice will more likely mistrust the law and the legal system. They will likely break the law or keep it purely on a pragmatic basis, not out of some desire to uphold a shared value, because again, to them, the law can't be trusted nor respected. 

I'm not a philosopher or logician, but you can probably use some kind of inductive reasoning to prove that these consequences apply upstream, to even more serious offenses. 

**Alternative Solutions?**  
If it's not a violent or sexual crime, if no one is harmed, then the punishment should be adjusted such that it's proportional to the income of the offender. Tax the rich by giving hire fees for traffic violations. 

Give a fair ""let off with a warning"" quota. For example, everyone gets two strikes. It shouldn't be up to the officer's discretion, because people are biased, and this bias is disproportionately shaped by pre-existing social factors that are outside of most people's control. 

**TLDR - something seemingly as mundane as a traffic ticket could lead to perpetual problems, including but not limited to racial/political/national division and higher rates of crime per capita.**"

Seriously, this is not a sacrifice.

As I understand it, Catholics are supposed to abstain from meat on Fridays and Fridays only, during the 46 days of Lent between Ash Wednesday and Easter Sunday, a period that contains only 7 Fridays.

The reason this is not a sacrifice is because something can’t be a sacrifice if you can ACCIDENTALLY do it without even trying. If you eat a lot of basic vegetarian meals, like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, you may have accidentally done it without even knowing.

Let’s consider some other dietary guidelines, shall we? Kosher doesn’t ban ALL meat, just some. But it’s an all-the-time thing. I can respect that. The same goes for teetotalers and alcohol. Ramadan bans all food AND water, from sunrise to sunset, for a period of 30 days. That’s pretty tough. I also believe there are fully vegetarian branches of Buddhism, Hinduism, etc. These really put the lent thing to shame.

I think this Catholic meat thing needs to be extended in one of the following three ways:

1. Make it so it applies to all Fridays, year-round.

2. Make it so it applies to all 46 days of Lent.

Or 3. Make it so that you fast from all food and water, on Fridays during Lent.

The bar can go a little higher, can’t it?"

Also a real quick Trigger Warning I do mention prolific rapists and murderers and I suggest not looking them up they're disgusting individuals who do not need any glorification of any kind and deserved their deaths at the hand of the state.

First a little preface I actually am for capital punishment I do believe that there are crimes that should be punishable by death (i.e mass murder, rape and similar crimes)

But I've heard the same argument time and time again from people who are large proponents of the death penalty ""There are people out there who wpuld be mass murderers but because the death penalty exists theyll never kill anyone""

In my personal opinion people who commit a crime heinous enough that would warrant the death penalty basically don't care if they do die. I personally believe that they are already down on their luck and basically understand that if they do get caught they will be killed. But that they don't want to get caught so they can continue to commit their crime. 

Examples being John Wayne Gacy, Ted Bundy, Robert Alton Harris, John A Bennett, Ronald Wolfe, and Laurence O'Connor who when put to death all seemingly didn't care about being put to death but were more upset they got caught in the first place. With this in mind I believe I should restate my question a little more clearly than the title suggests.

The death penalty does not actually stop individuals from committing a crime what it instead does is only gives incentive to not be caught and continue to commit these crimes with as little evidence to be caught as possible. (If there's a better wording please let me know but I think that's my view at the moment)

So with that being said the discussion is open and I'd love to hear from people about this."
0,2022-07-13,CMV: The US Senate Filibuster is Bad Irrespective of Who Uses It,u/Slinkusmalinkus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vxykz6/cmv_the_us_senate_filibuster_is_bad_irrespective/,changemyview,"**Background:**

The US Senate filibuster is a tactic that takes advantage of the Senate rule which requires that 60 or more votes are required to end debate. This allows for 41 senators to block legislation even when there may be 51 senators that wish to pass legislation.

This rule is derived from the constitutional power of the Senate to set its own rules. This rule is not itself in the constitution and can be changed with a simple majority vote of 51 or more senators.

The Republican Party uses it far more than the Democratic Party (at least up until the 115th Congress) and the Democratic Party has been criticized for abstaining from removing the filibuster. This may be due to a misguided fear that the Republican Party will use that as an excuse to remove the filibuster when they are in power, but I digress.

**View:**

*The Filibuster is Bad Irrespective of Who Uses It*

It is my view that, irrespective of who is in power and who makes use of it, the filibuster is bad. The role of the legislative branch is to create and pass legislation and this is directly undermined by the plainly obstructionist procedural rule. It is evident that this is a major source of dysfunction in the Federal government's ability to govern, let alone govern well. If there is some theoretically good purpose for the filibuster, then perhaps that purpose can be accomplished with something less severely abusable. How can government be responsible to the people when it can be so easily gridlocked? To the argument that it provides another check and balance against majority rule, there is already such an excess of checks and balances in the US system in the form of the House, the Presidency, and the Courts. Why aren't those enough?

**Why Do I Want My View Changed?:**

I am curious if I am missing some hidden redeeming quality of the filibuster."

544,2022-07-13,CMV: Being recorded at work is a huge invasion of privacy and is very degrading.,u/swagonflyyyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vy22vr/cmv_being_recorded_at_work_is_a_huge_invasion_of/,changemyview,"I've been struggling with this issue for the last 2 days because I started a new WFH job in which a webcam was included in the package sent to me.

I've been WFH for 3 years and have been working in call centers for 4.5 years. I usually last an average of 1.5 years before I quit and move on. 

This would be the first time that I am required by a company to actively record me in the comfort of my own home. The micromanagement seems pretty tight.

The company in question is a fortune 500 company that operates in the US and Europe. They're just another corporation that deals with liability (FMLA, Disability, etc.)

I'm familiar with this field and during the interview I was actually hired on the spot. They are paying me $22 an hour with benefits and bonuses included. That's right, its just taking calls, no selling, no commission required since it is customer service, not sales.

I should consider myself lucky to have this job and I am grateful for the opportunities provided by them but they never told me they were gonna record me with a webcam and surprise, surprise! I'm being recorded on the job!

This has been distressing for me because now I feel like I'm constantly in a rush because now I am *forced* to organize myself, buy groceries, wake up an hour before work and prepare myself for the day, like my entire routine has been upset because of this and I have been losing sleep at night because of the thought that this may be the future of labor. I feel my privacy is being violated and there's nothing I can do about it. The mere fact that I am being put under a microscope is affecting my life decisions because now my life revolves around a webcam and I have accomodate *everything* because of it. 

I mean, I *shouldn't* complain because the company is investing a lot in me but something doesn't sit right with me and that seems to be at the core of my issue with this because I feel like I'm giving up my right to privacy over some corporation that is seeking to turn a profit.

This would be different than, for example, joining the army since they discipline you in defense of the state, not running a business, so I can see why the army would do something like that.

But then I think about other perspectives, such as celebrities (Britney Spears, etc.) and politicians who are used to being pressured by the press showering them with cameras for the sake of accountability and entertainment and don't have much privacy. 

But then I think about Amazon drivers being recorded on the job, among other things and I think in the next couple of years companies are gonna start following that trend and it worries me. 

So I don't know how I feel about being recorded on the job. I *guess* there would be pros and cons but I think this will open doors to abuse by controlling entities. They always have a way of getting what they want at the end of the day.

Maybe they should replace their employees with machines if they're gonna be like that. Seriously, can anyone really last a year in this job with this level of micromanagement? How can a person's body and mind hold out long-term dealing with back-to-back calls while being put in a box?

You can publish a funny Youtube video, but chances are, if you didn't, the viewer would have found a different video to capture their interest. The reason you made that video was yes, to make the viewers laugh, but you wanted them to laugh at YOUR video.

You could also apply this concept to love/relationships. Chances are, if you never met your wife, or if you never ask out the cute girl in math class, she will find a good lover and be happy for the rest of her days. But YOU want to be the one to make her happy and reap the benefits of love.

I’ve seen 2 videos that were pretty much the same but different. 1 family had 2 boys and at the gender reveal they were having another boy and the mother was upset and just walked inside the home. But she didn’t receive any backlash (that I know of). 

The other family already has 2 girls and found out that they’re having another girl but this time the father was so upset that he yelled a curse word, the “f” word. And you guessed it he received a lot of backlash. 


But what’s the issue here? I’m pretty sure they’ll both get over it &amp; love their new child. I’ve seen many comments saying that they were dissatisfied with having a boy/girl but turns out they love the boy/girl with all their heart. So it seems like it’s a temporary feeling of disappointment.  Now before you say it, I know it would be wrong of the person to neglect the kid cause they didn’t want a boy/girl. And I know everyone had their reasons for not wanting a boy or girl &amp;&amp; I definitely don’t want any daughters. Maybe I could go into details if anyone cares but if not then oh well I guess.

I said that this is an irrational assumption to make, since Allah just means God in Arabic, and Christians, Muslims and Jews who speak Arabic all use the term Allah to refer to God. The term Allah, from a linguistic perspective, does not tell you anything specific about that person's theology, only that they are monotheist and speak Arabic.

So, based on this alone, it would be irrational to assume that the person follows Islam.

The term Allah is used in the Christian Bible in Arabic translations, since this is the way to refer to God in Arabic. Just because it is used in The Quran also doesn't mean we can assume what the person believes by the language they speak and the terms they use.

They both consent to have sex and either one or both parties use protection. They wake up the morning after, no laws were broken, they enjoyed themselves, and most importantly nobody got hurt.

Similar thing can be said between cousins and so on and so forth.

0,2022-07-13,CMV: The officers responding to the Uvalde shooting acted appropriately,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vyczzx/cmv_the_officers_responding_to_the_uvalde/,changemyview,"Surveillance video of the Uvalde shooting was recently released ([link](https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2022/07/12/uvalde-school-shooting-video-of-robb-elementary-shows-police-response/65370384007/)). I think this footage shows officers responding appropriately, while everyone else I know seem to think that this proves officers took too long to respond. Let me lay out my position while I describe what I see in the video.

The shooter enters the room and opens fire at 11:33:24. Screaming and gunfire continue for 2 minutes until the last scream is heard at 11:35:31. Police arrive in the hallway about 20 seconds after the last scream but while gunfire continues (11:35:53). As police approach the door, the gunfire seems to stop. At this point, I think it's fair if the the officers believe that everyone else inside the room is likely dead. 

When they reach the door, a burst of gunfire is heard, and officers fall back in response. One officer repeatedly checks himself, thinking he might have been hit. To me, this implies that the officers were reacting to being shot at, which is plausible considering the door had a vertical window that could have been shot through. These officers did not have any specialized equipment, so entering the room immediately would have been extremely risky. This risk is unacceptable when combined with the belief that everyone else inside was probably already dead. 

A couple more bursts of gunfire are heard from inside over the next couple of minutes (until 11:38:37). After than, no more gunshots are heard for a long time. It is almost certain now that the shooter is the only one left alive in the room, so acting quickly is no longer a necessity. Police now appropriately treat this like a ""barricaded subject"" situation, covering all of his exits and waiting for reinforcements. The shooter is no longer a threat unless he leaves the room, which he cannot. 

Yet this is the part people criticize police for, saying that they ""took over an hour to stop the shooter"". During this time, the shooter was not able to kill anyone else, so I don't see the problem? Maybe one can argue that there still might be kids alive in the room silently bleeding out, but if this is the case then those kids would be dead within a few minutes, which just goes back to the argument that the police should have immediately rushed the door. If the police were going to save anyone by acting quicker, then they should have entered the room within the first few minutes of arriving. After that point, there is no use in rushing things. So why does it matter that they sat outside the room for an hour, as opposed to sitting outside for 10 minutes? It has the same chance to save lives, but gives officers more time to prepare.

People also mention the single burst of gunshots 40 minutes in (12:21:07) to prove that the shooter was still active during the entire time. I think it is highly unlikely that this late burst of gunfire could have killed anyone. The shooter has been stuck inside the room for a long time at this point, I think a far better explanation is that he was either trying to bait officers, intimidate them, or was just bored.

Lastly, some people remark at officers doing trivial things during the standoff, e.g. using hand sanitizer and checking their phones. This makes no sense to me, as there is no need to rush things during a standoff; and even if there was, not everyone needs to be busy for the full duration of it. What else should they be doing? There is already plenty of other people watching all the exits, it's not like someone is going to die because a single officer used hand sanitizer for a few seconds during that entire hour.

**Q:** Is there something here I am not seeing? I am by no means an expert in any of this, but I don't see what the problem is with how officers responded. What should they have done differently to have potentially saved more lives?

**TL;DR**: Footage seems to show the shooting was over in the first few minutes, right when officers first arrived. The remaining hour and change of the time was just a standoff. What should police have done differently?"

Let me first start off by saying that by physically large/small, i only mean height and am assuming everyone to be the ideal weight/fitness for their height and gender. This is not about fat people.

So, back in the ancient times, big people were given big jobs that took advantage of their strength and were paid handsomely for it since only they could do it. But in return, they usually had to pay more for food and other amenities due to their size. Go back even further to the hunter/gatherer era, and the biggest men were given the biggest piece of the Mammoth since they were the ones who pulled the Mammoth back to the cave.

But civilizations change, and now 99% of western middle class people have jobs that either require little to no physical strength and labor laws that would prevent those jobs from existing for the sake of equality.

I don't want that equality.

Being big is still as expensive as it always was, arguably even more so, but we're expected to live off of the exact same amount of money as someone half our size. Here's an example:

Meet Tommy (male, fit, 6'5, 200lbs) and Erica (female, fit, 5'1, 100lbs).

Tommy and Erica work the same job doing the same things and are paid the same, $1000 a month after taxes and rent.

Erica has a good balanced diet and spends around $300 a month total on breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Tommy sets the same food budget and buys the same food, but he ends up starving. Why? Because Tommy weighs twice as much and needs twice as much food to survive. He realizes this, and he starts buying twice as much food to compensate. Now he's also well fed with a balanced diet, but he suddenly spends $600 a month on food instead of $300.

This means after taxes, rent, and food, Erica is left with almost twice as much money as Tommy ($700 vs $400 per month) even though their pay is the same.

And it's not just food, it's everything. Clothes cost more because they need twice as much fabric, furniture costs more since it needs to be sturdier to support more weight, transportation can sometimes be more expensive because tall people need more legroom, and so on and so on. I also assumed Tommy and Erica paid the same in rent, but the reality is that a lot of the cheaper apartments in my area are built in old basements with 6 foot ceiling heights. I've had to turn down some of them because i didn't have standing headroom in them, forcing me to look at similar but more expensive places instead. Could probably save a couple of hundred a month if i were 5 inches  shorter.

I'm not proposing scaling salaries directly to height or weight, that would be crazy, but even something like a SNAP-type system to let tall/big people live the same quality of life as short/average size people with the same salaries would be nothing but fair in my eyes.

This would probably have to be normalized to the average heigh and weight of your gender to avoid any discrimination/wage gap issues but those are details, the base idea seems hard to argue with, at least to me.

You may bring up the fact that taller people are socially privileged in other ways, but i really don't think being good in a bar fight or getting more Tinder matches outweighs the fact we need to pay so much more just to be able to exist.

Either that, or let me work as a human forklift for $100k a year like the good ol' days. Except we have actual forklifts now so that's a bit out of the question."

A lot of careers do require you to be able to do math accurately and very fast, and the time pressure also prevents you from brute forcing or doing it by any inefficient means, which may set you up for failure later on. Or language, where if you aren't fluent enough, which is a problem when you need to speak the language, you probably won't finish reading the passage in the required time.

For science, though, it makes absolutely no sense. Like the ACT science section requires you to read these lab reports like a maniac and skim them, when in the real world that's how you get someone killed as a scientist.

But I kind of realized my biggest issue internally is that it feels wrong to consider a human fetus less than a baby or full-grown human. I do understand it's not conscious or autonomous but it's still technically human cells like it's still a baby human that's not developed. Like it has the potential to fully mature with basically only time and caretaker which is different with contraceptives, bc contraceptives prevent the fetus from actually forming most of the time... so there's never a combination of the two parent cells to form the baby cells...  


I still feel really strong about my opinion that a fetus is basically identical to a baby, so I want to really educate myself since the only thing holding down my opinion of restricting abortion is where life really begins or if it's really worth pinching off that potential life for the benefit of your own.   


I believe life is sacred and everyone gets one shot at it, and to have it cut off before you're even able to have a thought feels really fucked up to me personally especially if its for a reason that's purely ""selfish"", like body changes or food cravings. But again too risky to actually ban abortion, so I'd like some enlightenment por favor.   


Ik my stance is really weak but my feelings towards it are really strong, that's why I want to either solidify my feelings or chance stances through an outside perspective."

This has become a somewhat normal part of society and almost nothing is done to make the situation better. Yes there are laws in place that punish these people and yet it doesn't get better.

Every time someone gets pulled over and charged with a DUI they've most likely already driven drunk probably dozens of times and just haven't been caught up to that point. Some people have 2, 3 or more DUI's which insinuates they've probably driven drunk hundreds of times through the decades.

One DUI should ban you from driving for years. 2 DUI's should ban you for life. If anyone is ever seriously injured or killed due to your DUI, the repercussions should be drastically worse than they are now. You KNOW what you're doing and risking..You fucking know. Through your entire childhood you're told ""Don't drink and drive"" it's in tv shows, movies, on billboards, the radio etc. Entire scenarios are played out in school plays and in driving schools.

The amount of times I've heard stories of a drunk driver killing a family, going to jail, being released years later and having their license reinstated only to get drunk and kill someone else is fucking asinine.

For the counter arguements:
""Judgement is impaired while drunk"" 
I have been blackout drunk, not remembering the night before and have had people tell me I refused to drive them home because I was drunk. Do I have a superpower to make conscious decisions while drunk? I doubt it. Regardless that's not when the judgement is made. The decision to drink and drive comes from the first sip while sober. If you drove to the bar, the party or your friends house...how the fuck did you expect to get home?

""So a mistake that someone makes when they're in their 20's shouldn't allow them to drive again even 40 years later? That's stupid""
Not as stupid as another paraplegic who would still be paraplegic the same 40 years later with their entire life ruined while the driver is back on the road living the dream. If there's even a single life saved or a single disability prevented with the exchange of the inconvenience of the offender(s) no longer being allowed to drive...then it's worth it.

""I'm actually a better driver when I drink"" has to be the dumbest arguement one can make. That's literally what every single drunk driver says until they get into their first accident.

Within a decade the vast majority of repeat offenders will be taken off the road forever. ""Hell no, I'm not taking that chance"" will be echoed in every bar and party because people may not care about the lives of others, but they sure as hell care about losing their privilege to drive.

This wouldn't stop all drunk drivers obviously, but it would make a gigantic dent (pun intended)."

This is going to be a bit odd, but I feel very confused about current rules of Trolling practices. This might be just an IT tech thing, or maybe I was just part of a very odd bit of the internet.

When I first got on the World Wide Web it was still the 90's and 4chan was still known for having the worst and best of all Trolling. In tech support, all the way from when I was a teenager and into my professional career it was common practice to enter into declared Games of Trolling. Both to help with different IT professional practices and also just for fun.

Rick rolling is probably the best known artifact of classic Trolling. Where you get someone to click on a link that actually goes to something very different than what you thought it was. For me it was usually super awful porn or gore. The nicer Rick Rolling thing didn't happen until later, and I wouldn't recommend bringing that part back. But, practicing Trolling games with other techs is actually really important.

The rules go like this: If you're the person that's trolling then you get a point when you succeed in pulling off your Troll. You win when the other person calls you out or says you're a troll. You lose if they succeed in not falling for it. So, it comes with a bit of trust of not just falling for something and then saying that you didn't, but it's important for recognizing misleading information because the point is to willing try to be convinced of it.

Usually this game is played among techs, sometimes they'll declare that they're playing the game, but sometimes they'll just try to see if they can pull off a successful Troll. Since it's a common and useful game everyone by and large tends to play it about the same way.

This behavior was super common and somewhat expected edicate in different boards where people would mess with each other. It makes a lot of the rules about saying the word Troll in the subreddits very strange to me, because it was important to call Troll when giving someone a point.

I think this Troll game is great for saying that you believe something is a Troll. Meaning it is purely to make you believe it's something that it's not or is ment to rile you up for no purpose. Winning a Troll point can be very difficult if people are practiced at the game and I feel like that practice helps to also weed out bad information that's presented as something else.

Am I just crazy or too old. Also are there any parallels to things that provide similar behavior or goals. I would also very much like to understand what people use in place of this. I always feel so out of place with it and I don't understand what the current culture is around the word troll.

Edit: I think I understand now how Troll is used now vs how I understand it. It's just an insult for you guys that means that someone is giving misinformation.

For me it's a way of labeling something as being Misleading and then being obligated to have checked the actual information and provide why something is misleading. Since you declare troll that means it can also be checked that the person who declared the information as misleading can also be checked.

Edit 2: It's in the title but just to make it clear. I am not saying that there should be more trolls. I am saying that the declaration of misinformation that I know uses the word troll to make it so that if someone identifies misinformation they are also obligated to have checked it and provide what the actual thing is.

There's a lot of misinformation. It wouldn't have to be the word troll but a common declarative that states that it has been found and corrected is what I am most used to with identifying it. It's what made it so everyone could trust if someone could actually back up what something is."

It harms the animal? Yeah, so does killing it, turns out. 

The animal didn't/can't consent to it? I've never spoken with a farm animal, but I can't imagine they're very enthusiastic about their predicament. 

It's unnatural? There's nothing natural about 96% of mammal biomass being farm animals, or much else about how we produce and consume meat these days really.

I don't think this is surprising either; murder is typically considered a worse crime than rape, it's unclear to me why a different moral standard should apply to animals.

Eating meat also has much more severe externalities, including:

* Significantly contributing to climate change
* Wasting land and resources by being much less efficient than just eating veggies; it takes 10 calories of feed to produce one of meat
* Horrific worker abuse, especially in meatpacking and adjacent industries

I realize these aren't necessarily intrinsic to eating meat and are more related to factory farming as a practice, but realistically it's how most meat is produced so seems fair to count it as part of the moral impact of eating meat. Besides, even if the meat is organic/ethical/fair trade/whatever, an animal was still killed and mutilated to produce it, so it seems weird to get that upset about someone sticking their dick in said animal instead. 

I don't fuck animals; I do eat meat. Go figure."

A lot of Economics is about consumer sentiment.  It seems irresponsible to give some Americans (who aren't hip to economics) the impression that inflation is going up by 8 or 9 % every month.

EDIT:  A lot of people are focusing on ""**Prices rose 9% since last June""** and saying this is incorrect because inflation is a '**basket of goods**' not **prices**. As many have pointed out (thanks) **inflation** refers to the process of prices rising (in general, or as specified with respect to a basket of goods). So it sounds awkward (and is possibly inaccurate) to say ""~~Inflation~~ The Rise in Prices Rose...""  My main point was the problematic confusion over the timeframe in which prices change.  When I said ""or something like that"" (above) I mean that I am not that adamant about the word Prices being used if there's something better.

People who still believe this are clearly very ignorant of the history and development of Western classical music.

\-The birth of the modern concert form, on which classical music is practically based, mainly by composers such as straddli, Corelli, vivaldi, albinoni, platti, torelli and many others

\-the birth of modern opera, with composers such as Monteverdi, Jacopo peri, baskets, etc.

\-the birth and development of the string instruments(especially violin), the most important section in an orchestra, while woodwinds or brass are only supplementary and don't have a lot of importance.

\-the birth of the modern piano by Bartolomeo cristofori, and its formal development by composers such as clementi (the father of the modern piano), and scarlatti earlier.

\-the birth of the modern symphony and the forms of musical classicism, thanks to composers such as sammartini, brioschi, and in general to the Neapolitan school, therefore Pergolesi, cimarosa, anfossi, paisiello, etc ...

\-the birth of Gregorian chants in the early Middle Ages and of modern notation by the theorist and musician Guido of Arezzo

\- the contribution of Palestrina, Gesualdo, allegri, marenzio to Renaissance sacred music has remained the standard model for centuries to this day

\-the birth of different genres of ethnic music such as tarantella, medieval saltarello, Neapolitan song, traditional Sicilian music, and Sardinian tenor songs

Italy is the birthplace of Western classical music. Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven “copied” literally the Italian styles, from Palestrina (Bach) and Vivaldi (Bach/Handel) to Mozart (the Neapolitan classic school), etc…

Even apart from classical music, Italy has always been very active also in the field of soundtracks for films, documentaries, or TV dramas. With composers such as Ennio Morrison, Nino Rota, Giorgio Moroder, Goblin, Riz Ortolani, Armando Trovajoli, Stelvio Cipriani, Franco Micalizzi, Pino Donaggio, Piero Umiliani, Piero Piccioni, Nicola Rainani and many others, who with immortal soundtracks will contribute to giving the “Italian” sound typical of cinecittà

A transcript of her testimony and a video is [available on this website](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/07/law-professor-humiliates-josh-hawley-senate-committee-hearing/) - and I encourage you to watch the video before continuing.

**Rhetoric:** at issue for this CMV thread is the following exchange:

Professor Bridges:

&gt; Do you believe that men can get pregnant?

Senator Hawley:

&gt; No, I don’t think so

Professor Bridges:

&gt; So you’re denying that trans people exist

This rhetoric, that *disagreeing* with the stated identity of a trans person constitutes *denying that trans people exist* is common. In the /r/politics thread about the linked article, several commenters echoed it.

/u/orionsfire with 3000 upvotes [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/vxi4m5/law_professor_humiliates_josh_hawley_during/ifw4wzd/)

&gt; denying that people exist is an example of bigotry

/u/ARPDAB1312 with 400 upvotes [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/vxi4m5/law_professor_humiliates_josh_hawley_during/ifwbciv/)

&gt; he was in fact denying that trans people exist.

**My View:**

First, Bridges' claim is just logically **unsound**. My belief that something *exists* is separate from my *agreement* with its identity. For example, I don't believe that Christians go to heaven when they die. I don't believe Muslims go to paradise. I don't believe Vikings go to Valhalla.

If a Christian says, ""I'm saved; I'm going to heaven"" and I say, ""no, I don't think you are"" - I am **not** ""denying the existence of christians"" - I'm well aware that he exists. I just disagree with his beliefs.

Second, Bridges' claim is **dishonest** in the sense that, (in my view) it is a deliberate attempt to cut off any debate. I suspect that if I pointed this out to her, she would say something like, ""why would we debate a person's existence!!"" But see, *we're not debating their existence*.

A Christian's identity as a Christian, and a Muslim's identity as a Muslim, is arguably *more important to them* and *more central to their identity* than a trans person - as evidenced by the willingness of devout religious people to give their lives to protect it.

...and yet, I'm allowed to disagree with them. If you disallow me to disagree, then you're bullying me. It is wholly dishonest.

Finally, Bridges' claim is **dangerous**. And this is really the reason that I post this CMV. I first found the video of her exchange with Hawley [in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntellectualDarkWeb/comments/vy6inc/will_the_united_states_enact_hate_speech_laws/). It makes what I feel is a good point: she's a law professor; soon enough, we will have lawyers, then judges who will share her ideas and implement them.

Bridges' position on this issue is, as I argued above, wholly logically unsound. And yet, I have no doubt that she would make it law if she could. One of her students likely will. That will be a tremendous injustice. CMV.

**Here are some things which will not change my view:** just trying to save us all some time here.

- That's different!!

Yes, everything is different. That's only relevant if the difference invalidates the comparison. Obviously, before posting here I considered the differences and decided that they do not invalidate my comparison. Here are some of the things I considered: (1) both a religious identity and a gender identity are *identities* - they are central to one's conception of oneself. (2) both a religious identity and a gender identity involve expectations regarding treatment by others. For example, a religious person is going to request that you not blaspheme in their presence.

- Trans people face violence!!

Yes, but that's irrelevant to my view. *I'm not denying it*, it's just irrelevant to this specific view. Similarly, the fact that [christians face violence in muslim countries](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/02/persecution-driving-christians-out-of-middle-east-report) is irrelevant to a discussion about them going to heaven when they die.

Christians do not go to heaven when they die. And I'm allowed to say that *even though christians face violence*. And if you say I'm not allowed to believe that, or to state my belief out loud, then you're a bully and you're on the wrong side morally.

- She's just being metaphorical

No, I don't think she is. If you want to change my view on that, please do more than simply claim it's a metaphor with no accompanying argument.

However, in the interest of honest debate, I will consider two possible interpretations of ""denying existence""

(1) ""if you can't choose your gender, then you can't be trans"" - but this is like saying, ""if jesus isn't the son of god, then you can't really be a christian"" or ""if Mohammad wasn't really a prophet, then you can't be a Muslim""

But no, that logic doesn't follow. You can believe whatever you want to believe. You can be a Christian even though there's no heaven. And if I disagree with you about the existence of heaven, that doesn't mean you don't exist as a Christian.

(2) ""if you don't agree with me, you're saying I'm faking"" - here's an example: I could probably agree with the statement, ""flat earthers don't exist"" - why? Because I suspect that they're just trolling. I suspect they don't really believe what they're saying, but that they enjoy winding people up.

But no one who says ""there is no afterlife"" (or the parallel statement re:trans) is saying that christians are trolling or faking it or whatever."

My stance is not that I should be able to light a cigarette any time I want around whomever I want, instead my stance is I should have a smokers space to smoke away. 

Can’t smoke in restaurants, some bars I’ve been to, apartment buildings and especially every workplace I’ve been employed at recently. 

This is wrong. For example, I currently work at a college which is of course, like just about any job in the area, is a smoke free facility. I don’t understand it. 

If I am on my 10 minute break and I want to smoke, what’s the harm? Smoking certainly doesn’t diminish my work ethic (although I’ve seen others allow it to). 

Bottom line is, I believe that we should have designated smoking areas.

Edit: I’m AM NOT asking to smoke anywhere freely or forcing businesses to bring this back. However, there should CERTAINLY be a bench with an ash tray outside that I and others can smoke. People will smoke anyway, at least provide an ash tray so that cigarette butts are not littered everywhere."

19,2022-07-14,CMV: Pit bulls Should Require a License to Own,u/Masta-Blasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vyzgvq/cmv_pit_bulls_should_require_a_license_to_own/,changemyview,"In this month alone, 6 people and 9 animals have been killed in a pit bull attack. Many others have been maimed and permanently disfigured/disabled because of a pit bull attack. 

Pit bull supporters often say ""it's the owner, not the dog."" Personally, I disagree. According to Wikipedia, 

&gt;The bull-and-terrier was a breed of dog developed in the United Kingdom in the early 19th century for the blood sports of dog fighting and rat baiting, it was created by crossing the ferocious, thickly muscled Old English Bulldog with the agile, lithe, feisty Black and Tan Terrier. The aggressive Old English Bulldog, which was bred for bear and bull baiting, was often also pitted against its own kind in organised dog fights, but it was found that lighter, faster dogs were better suited to dogfighting than the heavier Bulldog. To produce a lighter, faster more agile dog that retained the courage and tenacity of the Bulldog, outcrosses from local terriers were tried, and ultimately found to be successful.

These dogs were bred specifically because they are aggressive, powerful, and violent. Now, personally, I believe all pit bulls should be neutered and the breed should be heavily restricted. But at the very least, I think owners should be required to demonstrate that they are experienced pet owners, carry insurance, and perhaps have taken a dog training course, so they can recognize when their pit is agitated and how to prevent a tragedy. 

I also think pit bull ownership should carry a legal duty to reasonably protect others from the pit. ""Reasonable"" would include measures such as displaying signage warning neighbors and guests that a pit bull lives in the home, not letting the pitbull stay in a yard unmonitored (regardless of fencing), and keeping the pitbull leashed at all times in public. 

I would also like to see regulations preventing shelters from ""rebranding"" obvious pit mixes so that families and owners are not duped into adopting a pitbull mix. Ideally, shelters would need to provide a warning to potential adopters (and of course, adopters would then need to have a license to own a pit). 

Before anyone tries, please know that I'm unlikely to be swayed by any kind of anecdotal ""but my velvet hippo is a good girl and never hurt anyone"" arguments. That's what most owners say when they're being sued for injuries their pit caused a child or another pet. I understand they don't all attack- but it's in their breed, so something could trigger them."

884,2022-07-14,CMV: Jesus would be embarrassed by today's Christians,u/ProgressivePatriot_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vz0lzj/cmv_jesus_would_be_embarrassed_by_todays/,changemyview,"
I want to start by saying I don’t include ALL of Christianity in this assessment. If you identify as Christian but you are embarrassed by the behaviors outlined below, you are the exception to the rule. If anything below offends you…. Well, you’re unfortunately the “Christians” I’m referring to.

I have nothing against a true Christian who spreads understanding, love, and light. These are all things we need more of in this world. However, many churches today thrive by spreading hate and fear.

An outline of the teachings of Jesus Christ (I will be addressing these one by one):

Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
The Golden Rule. This is one of the greatest tenants of Christianity. Not only does it mean treat people with kindness and compassion, but it also means that you are no greater than your neighbor. You treat them with respect because they are a human being, made in the likeness of God. You would not walk up to Jesus in Starbucks and start berating Him if your coffee is made incorrectly. We are all humans, regardless of who we are, how we look, and where we work. Behaving otherwise is an affront to Jesus.

Forgive
This one is easy. If your child spills his cup, you forgive him. If Trump commits treason, you forgave him, right? If anyone else in the entire world acts contrary to your moral beliefs, you forgive them. Because #3.

Do not judge
Lest ye be judged. Do not condemn lest ye be condemned. This includes you, your pastor, and your church. No one is allowed to judge another’s sins unless you are God Himself. This includes homosexuality, ab0rtion, Black Lives Matter, or anything else you may not agree with. People are living their lives to the best of their abilities. To deprive them of that is to go against a direct teaching of Jesus. It is not up to you to determine the sins of another. If your pastor is giving you direction on who to hate, you may want to remind him of that as well.

Love your Enemies
Progressing right on from the last point…. If you have been told to hate homosexuals because they are our enemies, your pastor is doing you dirty again. If you are told to hate Democrats, women, trans people, or any other group of people, you are being led astray by Satan. We are told to LOVE our enemies. These are Jesus’s words. If someone is telling you otherwise, they are leading you away from the teaching of the Lord.

Love God
This is a big one and I saved it for last. Love God. That’s it. Do not fear God. Do not fear death. This is something that is being sold by church after church and it is heartbreaking. So many churches have people tied to their alter by fear – the fear of rejection from Christ, the fear that He will not bring you into His fold. You must be “saved” by Christ and wholeheartedly accept the teaching of these false prophets, or you will not see life after death. I cannot stress enough… This. Is. Not. True. Jesus will save us all. If you believe the teachings of Christ, you will believe this above all else. Love God for He loved your first. He loved you so much, He gave up His only begotten Son. Over and over again, God loves you. You are enough just the way you are. Your neighbor is enough just the way they are. You don’t need to worry about them, God has them covered too. Just love – God, yourself, each other.

Rules of Engagement on this post: 1. Act with Christianlike behavior. Speak as Jesus would have spoken. Be kind to your neighbors even if you disagree. 2. I challenge you to only quote the teachings of Jesus if you quote the Bible. This is, after all, a debate on how Jesus would view the Christians of today."

For example: social services, environmental services, opportunity to volunteer/work in various fields and in various positions. This program should also include an interstate exchange aspect where young adults have to live in a part (or parts) of the US unlike where they've grown up and work and interact with people unlike those they're accustomed to, up to even living with host families, maybe moving around every 6 months to a new location and being a part of a new project.

Such a program would have several benefits: For one, it would make the next generation(s) all have this one experience that they have in common and that brings them together as a people culturally. Two, it would cut through dividing lines of ethnic, geographical, and socioeconomic differences, particularly if the young people are exposed to and come to appreciate the differences in the way others live; as they say, travel is the cure to ignorance and intolerance. Three, it would give young adults an appreciation for public service, giving back to your community and your country at large, perhaps even fostering a passion for helping others. Four, of course the country could always benefit from the help in some of the very important public  work that is in high demand for labor. We could clean our parks and forests, improve our infrastructure and agriculture, rebuild dilapidated inner cities, provide volunteers for our nursing homes and hospitals, our schools, and a million other things with the help of young energetic enthusiasm. And five, how much fun would it be for young adults to have the opportunity to travel away from home, be grouped with maybe a dozen or so other people of their own age from different parts of the country all experiencing a new place, doing pubic work which helps others, allow them to grow their character and their minds, allow them to learn new perspectives, to have empathy for others, and to grow to have love for the country? This love would manifest in a genuine desire to help others, which would hopefully translate into a population of Americans who are a little less selfish, a little less ignorant, a little more willing to raise all boats in a rising tide, and it would feel a little less like living in a society where everything is a zero sum game against others. And as a bonus, it would certainly make more a richer college experience with more mature adults (and a 4 year collegiate track that ends at 24, closer to when science tells us brains reach full maturation anyway). 

What could go wrong?"

What if in the future people decide that gender is completely a social construct, imaginary or made up and so they would then see our gendered societies of the past as oppressive and the people like you and me who don’t view gender as a social construct as bigots akin to how we treat Modern day racists.

What if there really is nothing wrong with, say, white supremacy but only people in the future will be able to see it, in the same way that in the past homosexuality was considered wrong but we’ve progressed why couldn’t morality evolve in that way?"

Also, the law could have better and more practical variations, my point is just that we should impose extremely strict laws on the wealth of presidents, or even other types of political leaders."

140,2022-07-14,CMV: Twitter is overall detrimental to human society.,u/beanbootzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vzb7ba/cmv_twitter_is_overall_detrimental_to_human/,changemyview,"I work at one of the non-Meta FANNG companies (I guess MANG companies, now, sorry Netflix), so I absolutely think that premise of The Social Dilemma ([linked summary/review](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/21/netflix-movie-the-social-dilemma-slams-social-media-review.html)) is correct. **In short, social media companies use algorithms based on psychology to show you the most engaging content possible in order to keep you on the site as long as possible.** From the social media companies' perspective, their goal is to keep you on the platform to expose your eyes to as many ads as possible. **However, ""engaging content"" is content that triggers some kind of strong emotional response, and the stronger your emotions are, the longer you'll engage with the platform's content.**

Meta, rightfully so, gets a lot of heat for this because they own the platforms that control a staggering amount of human communication -- Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and their now-unified Messenger. **But I think Twitter, while significantly smaller in users, has an outsized negative impact on society.**

Twitter's 280 character limit forces users to make extremely concise points. That is terrible for trying to explain complex ideas, which normally take way, way more than that. **You just can't sum up entire concepts like ""Marxism"" or ""critical race theory"" or ""do masks work?"" in 280 characters.** And yet, that is what a lot of people use Twitter for. Twitter, I think, also suffers from only really having a ""like"" option, where there's no way to counter pile-ons, and drives very one-sided content with no counterweight.

**Sharing very abbreviated thoughts about complicated concepts on a platform that is designed to make you angry or horny does not result in high-quality conversation.** Twitter users are, in my opinion, a lot like reactive dogs, and have no clue how to respond to a stimuli they don't agree with beyond screaming. The platform is coded to sustain that kind of reaction, and when you have a bunch of people screaming about public health and racism on it, you just end up with the worst perspectives on both sides of the spectrum. 

Twitter has fewer than 400 million worldwide users, which is relatively small for a social media platform, but its influence extends beyond that reach because pretty much every ""elite"" has an account. **In the U.S., the elites that concern me the most are journalists, because journalists absolutely** ***live*** **on Twitter (although I won't let other ""thought leaders"" or whatever off the hook).** First, journalists are competing for viral content and followers on Twitter in the newsroom, which a lot of editors encourage (I have friends in journalism who are open about it). Journalists, IMO, are supposed to be focusing on reporting accurate news, and explaining important things going on in the world. Setting aside any and all objectivity concerns, even nonpartisan news doesn't benefit from being written with the goal of going viral.

The other problem with ""elites"" constantly being on Twitter is that they exist in the echo chamber, too. Good journalists are supposed to spend time talking to people, and just wandering around observing things to try to gather information. **But now that journalists are spending all of their time on Twitter, their ""observations"" can be extremely influenced by the pack of reactive dogs on there.** The ""man at the diner"" has been replaced with ""man who went viral,"" even though there are way, way more humans like the man at the diner in the world. At its most exhausting, you have entire news cycles about drama that only happens on Twitter and has no impact elsewhere -- like the inane Taylor Lorenz vs. Dave Weigel ""scandal"" -- in major publications. But much more subtly, any journalist who isn't really careful is going to have their worldview shaped by only hearing the most extreme ends of either spectrum on a daily basis. So even if you're not on Twitter, you can still get sucked into the reactivity because it's influencing so much of the conversation around you.

I spent way, way too much of 2020 and early 2021 on Twitter. I rage-quit the app after I spent over 30 minutes in a circular argument with a stranger about classism and food in the Ohio River Valley, and suddenly realized what an insane waste of my time, and, more importantly, emotional energy that was. I've always prided myself on being a pragmatic and open-minded person, and quitting Twitter also made me realize how much more reactive and closed-minded I was becoming. **Spending too much time on Twitter ultimately just makes you overly emotional and intense.

0,2022-07-14,cmv: Donald Trump is not (yet) the worst president we have ever had.,u/KarmicComic12334,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vzbfyc/cmv_donald_trump_is_not_yet_the_worst_president/,changemyview,"Yeah he's a crude crooked egotistical treasonous POS. but at this point trump is not the worst president we have ever had. Let me start by explaining the caveat. If he runs again, the repercussions will be devastating, win or lose(i mean win or claim he won anyway). It will probably be enough to give him the nod. But as it stands now, and giving him the same kind of defference we give those idiot presidents long dead, he is mot the worst, it only seems that way because he is fresh in the mind.

Lets go down the list.

Crude: sure he's on tape saying to another dude in his trailer that he grabs women by the pussy a decade before he ever thought of running for president. 70 years ago we had a president photographed with his half naked mistress jumping out of a cake singing him happy birthday while he was in office. Before that we have no pics, no tape, if past presidents smuggled a new prostitute into the whitehouse every night, strangled them, and dumped the bodies the evidence we have a century later wouldn't be enough to interest r/conspiracy.  So we can't say he's the crudest.

Crooked. He's a crooked con man. Famous for cheating his way to the top. Failing up. Once called too crooked to run a las vegas casino by their city council, no one can seriously say he's a stand-up guy unless they are serious gangsters who own him.  But most politicians are crooked. They trade power now for money later, and they always have. I'd need a genuine analysis of every president's personal profit from backroom dealings adjusted for inflation to show he was worse than what for example Hayes got for selling the robber barrons half of the american west(literally 7% of the united states) for pennies while giving them top dollar for every foot of rail built on land they now owned.

Egotistical: not even close. Sure he's a blowhard that is never wrong. Most of them were too. Harrison was so invulnerable in his own mind that he gave a two hour inaugural address in a blizzard without a jacket and died within the month and that wasn't even televised. He could have just gone inside, sat by the fire and published the speech and no one would care. If it weren't for global warming and penicillin Trump might have done the same.

Treasonous: who interfered in the supreme court, supported a constitutional amendment to neuter congress's power to meddle with states rights, and divided the country so badly that a civil war broke out within a year of his leaving office in disgrace? James Buchanan of course. 150 years later we've mostly forgotten,  but at the time the press was saying everything against him that they say about Trump now. Without giving both the space of time and perspective, it is hard to say one is worse than the other, and so far at least Trump's treason has not led to war.

All in all, it can't be said that trump is the worst president just because the media hates him and his crimes are fresh. He committed no atrocities, never ordered tens of thousands marched to their deaths or distributed plague ridden blankets. Ended wars, and avoided other wars. Didn't completely crash the economy. Never endorsed chattel slavery. Anything bad you have to say is holding him to a higher standard than his predecessors, not comparing what they actually did."

42,2022-07-14,CMV: Mental health regulation in the gun control debate is irrelevant and would be impossible to implement,u/bowlofcinnamontoastc,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vzeywj/cmv_mental_health_regulation_in_the_gun_control/,changemyview,"Whenever I see people talk about gun control in the United States, there's always people who take the mental health treatment/ testing route. It's either A) We should have better mental health treatments in general to lower the amount of mentally ill people (who could possibly get a gun and misuse it) or, B) We should require more tests/reports/ investigation surrounding an individual's mental health when they go to get a gun license and inevitably a gun. However, I find this argument to be idealistic and like it comes fron people who don't understand enough about mental illness.

 First of all, better treatment for mental health (better school counselors, cheap/free therapy and medication, raising awareness, etc.) will not eradicate mental illness. Especially not for people who are so ill to the point that they want to shoot up a school. These kind of facilities require the mentally ill individual (or their family who KNOWS that they are mentally ill) to go get help. Many people do not want help, and many people do not trust psychologists and counselors. It's a harsh reality, but many mentally ill people will actively avoid seeking treatment. Someone with a lot of hatred or betrayal in their head is even less likely to seek treatment. A lot of people with mental illnesses don't even think of themselves as being mentally ill. 

As for the second approach, it neglects to address that many times, you cannot get an accurate test from someone that does not want it. Sure, psychology has come a long way— there are many psychologists who can figure out what's wrong with a person even if they lie their asses off. But not all psychologists are that good at their jobs, and not all people find lying hard. Trust me, from personal experience, mental health patients trick their doctors a lot more than people think. The other part of this approach is looking more deeply at medical records as well as crime/school incidents. That would be effective, I agree, but it also doesn't address that sometimes this is the first extreme thing someone will do due to mental health issues, and that if someone never looked for help/did something extreme we will have no records on their mental health. On top of that, there are plenty of perfectly sane individuals who would be denied their rights (not my view, but for the sake of my argument, sane individuals have the right to bare arms) in this scenario because they did something while intoxicated once 5 years ago, or struggled with depression when they were a teenager.

It would also be incredibly hard to implement this all nation wide— in poor towns and rich towns, rural villages and large cities— there's now way we could accurately assess people's mental health statis every single time they get a gun license or a new gun.

People of any culture should feel free to experiment and create what they want, and that includes perhaps being inspired or borrowing musical elements from cultures they don't belong to. I'd say that not doing so would be restricting the possibilities of your own artistic expression.

Granted, this doesn't mean I condone stereotypical recreations of what someone *thinks* another culture's music sounds like for the purposes of mockery or reinforcing stereotypes, but if it's simply borrowing the style and sound for the purposes of just creating music, I don't think that's a bad thing. Example: UB40's music often borrowed a lot from reggae and sometimes directly covered it, and it....wasn't very good if you ask me, but at the same time I don't think it should be considering ""wrong"" or offensive.

If the end result sounds bad, then it's just a song that sounds bad. That exists in almost any culture and style, and doesn't have to necessarily be *because* it's trying to borrow from an unfamiliar culture

They're small, and generally hide in small spaces. You could have a dozen spiders and you wouldn't know, unlike flies which will buzz in your face or wasps that sting you. 

They don't eat your food, unlike many other pests. Cats and dogs are expensive to keep. Spiders are cheap and friendly and only eat your enemies.

They're cute and cuddly. Unlike many creatures which bite and attack you randomly spiders are mostly friendly, adorable looking, and fairly happy to run along your hand without attacking you.

Anyway, this is why I think more people should either accept spiders which aren't venomous enough to do notable harm to humans in their houses, or overcome their arachnophobia and accept spiders into their houses. A lot of people disagree with me though, so CMV."

115,2022-07-15,CMV: You should take both boxes in Newcomb's problem,u/Jeff_Bezels,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vzqgdc/cmv_you_should_take_both_boxes_in_newcombs_problem/,changemyview,"Newcomb's problem is a thought experiment that illustrates how two imperatives in rational decision-making--do whatever would maximize your expected utility, and always play your dominate strategy--come apart. They come apart because they tell you to do two different things in the case.

Here's Robert Nozick's 1969 paper on Newcomb's problem: [https://web.archive.org/web/20190331225650/http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/rjohns/nozick\_newcomb.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20190331225650/http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/rjohns/nozick_newcomb.pdf)

Here's a simplified description of the problem from Paul Weirich at the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-causal/#NewcProb):

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In Newcomb’s Problem an agent may choose either to take an opaque box or to take both the opaque box and a transparent box. The transparent box contains one thousand dollars that the agent plainly sees. The opaque box contains either nothing or one million dollars, depending on a prediction already made. The prediction was about the agent’s choice. If the prediction was that the agent will take both boxes, then the opaque box is empty. On the other hand, if the prediction was that the agent will take just the opaque box, then the opaque box contains a million dollars. The prediction is reliable. The agent knows all these features of his decision problem.

You can refer to Nozick if you want a longer description.

Basically, you can take one box (the opaque one) or both boxes. The way the problem is set up, you should expect to get more money if you only take the opaque box, since, if you only take one box, a reliable predictor of your behavior would have put $1 million in the opaque box (and you know this). So picking only one box maximizes your expected utility.

On the other hand, you know that there is $1,000 in the transparent box. So no matter how much money is in the opaque box, you'll have $1,000 more if you pick both boxes. Picking both boxes is your dominant strategy.

My view is that it's rational to want to *be* a person who would pick only one box. But whatever kind of person you are, what it's rational to *do* is to pick both boxes, since, no matter what kind of person you are, you'll get $1,000 more if you pick both boxes.

I wish I believed that what it was rational to do is only pick one box. For one thing, if you ever encounter a Newcomb's problem in real life, it would help to already be the kind of person disposed to think that only picking one box is rational, because then you'd have a higher expected utility. But also, I think a lot of other puzzles of rationality might be partly addressed if we could say that picking one box is the right thing to do. For example, if you're playing a public goods game with people who are sufficiently psychologically similar to yourself, then it would be rational to contribute (since your contributing should increase your confidence that others will contribute, thus increasing your expected utility) even though not contributing would be your dominant strategy.

I should start out by saying that retro-causation is probably a dead-end. Your picking one box now does not cause the reliable predictor of your behavior to have put $1 million in the opaque box in the past. They're a reliable *predictor*, not a reliable *causal mechanism*.

Edit: Good discussion so far, I feel. Most of the comments have been about whether the problem is well-formed, i.e., whether it violates some law of physics or is conceptually impossible for the predictor to be wrong, or things of that sort. I am not open to changing my mind about whether the problem, which has survived in decision-theory discussions, in several disciplines, for over 50 years, is poorly constructed because of some basic philosophical error. I'm more wondering whether, if you accept the problem as structured, it's a good idea to one-box or two-box, i.e., is it a good idea to maximize your expected utility or play your dominant strategy. I'll have to put it down for a bit and pick it up later.

Here's another case you may like if you find Newcomb's problem objectionable for some reason. (Text taken from [here](https://formalisedthinking.wordpress.com/2010/08/18/43/).)

&gt;The Smoking Lesion Problem is as follows: In the world of the Smoking  Lesion, smoking is correlated with cancer but does not cause cancer.  Instead, there is a genetic lesion which, if present, increases a  person’s chance of smoking and their chance of developing cancer.  The  Lesion is either already present or not present. You do not know if it  is present in you. The question is this, if you like to smoke (but  strongly dislike having cancer), should you smoke?

It varies from area to area but they are often required to use roads rather than sidewalks. This seems hilariously unsafe.

**Visibility:** Bikes can see pedestrians much better than cars can see bikes. Cars have to keep track of more variables and tend to pay closer attention to other cars. 

**Speed:** Bikes cannot possibly keep up with cars, but they can slow down for pedestrians.

**Chaos:** Bikes can't keep a steady speed, rarely use turn signals, and are generally unpredictable. That throws a wrench in the flow of traffic and probably leads to more accidents.

Edit: I agree that bike lanes are the best solution. Sadly most cities don't have the budget, so bikes need to be on roads or on sidewalks. My view is that the second option is safer."

There are two different ways to explain karma I have found for karma in Hinduism:

1. Karma means action. This means we receive the good and bad fruits of our past actions now, and we also have to bear the good and bad fruits of our present actions in the future.
2. ""Karma” is a Sanskrit word which means **deed, work or action**. It mainly means that the actions or intent of an individual will determine his or her future, and is the spiritual principle of cause and effect.

[http://kids.baps.org/thingstoknow/hinduism/1-5.htm](http://kids.baps.org/thingstoknow/hinduism/1-5.htm)

Hinduism also believes that karma can influence future births and lives (reincarnation)

My view is,  that this belief necessarily implies that things like abuse and rape are caused by previous life actions? Buddhism, Sikhism, Jainism (I think) and some pagans make a similar claim. If it does imply this, is there any way we can alter the claim in order to make it sound less like victim blaming?

As well as society's stance on the Russian soldiers who are actively invading Ukraine. However, I would like to see a differing opinion about this subject. If, for example, a person put a gun to another's head and threatened to kill them unless they kill someone else, would they be morally/ethically in the clear if they did? I'm not talking about the law, I'm aware of what it says about this. Is killing under duress a valid moral defense in your opinion? If so, why? I believe it isn't, because if someone only has two options, kill or die, and they choose to kill an innocent to save themselves, they are acting as if their life matters more than another's. 

To be clear, I'm only talking about killing innocents, not killing in self defense. If someone threatened you with a gun and you kill them, I believe that's fine. But if someone threatened you with a gun to kill a baby, and you do, that's not fine. 

I believe an altered version of the trolley problem applies here. You're in the trolley, the brakes are gone, and you're heading down the tracks at 80 MPH. If you do nothing, you will crash into a wall and die. If you press a button, the trolley will redirect to a different track that has a baby on it, but is also designed to slow down runaway trolleys, meaning you'll live unharmed if you redirect yourself, but the baby won't. My view is that you must die to save the baby."

Even though that is also a possibility, I get to it later. The first thing that AI might ruin is of course economy.

Many people might be happy with the idea that everything will be automated, and we'll have more time to spend with our friends and stuff, and on top of that, we'll have Universal Basic Income. Ok cool but here are some questions, Why on earth should they share their money with us? and how much, and what if that much money they give to us is not enough, will they give us even a penny? 

And of course what is the point of automation? so we'll have more products right? and who's going to buy them?

What I feel might happen in the future is that the middle class will become unbearably poorer, the poor class will starve to death, and the rich class will become even richer and more powerful.

Why do the most powerful in this take into account with us? Because we have value, we produce many things that make their lives better, and without us, they will easily decide who gets to live and who doesn't. They'll eventually create military AI, use AI to spy on us (which they already sort of do).

And who will be these people?  the ones who'll own most robots, the ones who'll have the military robots. I believe even those people might die, from a possible error. but until that point humanity will be destroyed already.

Now a lot of you will say ""pfff this will happen like 500 years later"". Well nowadays robots do complex surgeries, write poetry, create art, translate and edit, sing a song, and understand images. If all these continue we might achieve that future earlier, much earlier.

There are of course other ways that AI might kill us all, like:

Creation of super AI, killing humanity by accident, Using AI-generated video to cause war, many many versions.

No wonder millennials and Gen Z are being more and more depressed and nihilistic, There are wars, Global warming, the economy going to the trash, and now this. None of us are prepared for any of this, as technology became better at manual work humans became weaker, and when robots started doing intelligent people started to become dumber, and might even become much dumber.

My point is that our future isn't any good. The only way we can stop all this chaos is to regulate it internationally like Nuclear weapons are being regulated. Even harsher regulations.

Why are we the dominant species? because we are the most intelligent beings, we are basically creating a smarter specie, which we might not even be able to control. it's like we are sending an invitation letter to aliens that might very well replace us. Some say ""ow we humans are filthy we deserve it"", as someone who almost committed suicide, I can say that you always regret it when you get to the actual point. All these people who say it will be cool and stuff untill we'll get to the point when they'll starve and lose their freedom.

Ok I talked too much what do you guys think?"

Isn't the whole point of making exams and testing students to see how well they mastered the subject based on several categories including time management? For example if I were to hire someone based on their skills which I deduce from the marks they get I would expect them to be somewhat comparable by having the same measuring standards. I would not care what ever disease, disability, gender, height, race etc someone has as long as they meet the skill requirements but how can I look into the skill requirements if they are not represent their actual skill compared to other students on the same standards.

What makes someone with learning disability but a wealthy family with lots of resources to support their child more worthy of having disability compensation than a poor child who has no time to learn and was not able to read a lot in his free time and does not have the monetary capabilities to get more education who is basically only hindered by his family situation which he can't do anything about to get compensation?

I feel like I am missing a crucial point because lots of smart people I know do agree with these measurements but I just don't see it.

Disabilities, diseases, family related problems, ethnicity, gender etc. are a part of someone and something you have to deal with. Naturally people who have some kind of disadvantage should be able to get the required support to level out the playing field and have the same chances as others. But I feel like in the field of education this should only extend as far as to grant those children more individual help, more attention, special textbooks and other resources, extra classes but not to the one and only instance of comparable results which are exams.

(I know marks, exams, professors, teachers, schools, ... are never actually fair. There are no results that can 100% be compared without dismissing some kind of variables that resulted in an unequal and unfair assessment of skill)"

Via this article [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5333793/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5333793/) to paraphrase, essentially Chronic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors are found in places other than areas of the body related to sex, including the hippocampus which is related to learning and memory. GnRH agonists (GnRHa) are indicated in a variety of situations however for the purposes of this post we will focus on their use for early-onset gender dysphoria (as stated by the article). We can see from the first paragraph that despite reproductive function returning after 37 weeks of cessation, it altered how they progressed through a maze and ""The long-term spatial memory performance of GnRHa-Recovery rams remained reduced (*P* &lt; 0.05, 1.5-fold slower) after discontinuation of GnRHa"". The study states that the reason for this is probably that the hippocampus is at a critical stage of developing due to the release of sex-based hormones during puberty.

Therefore as we do not fully understand the effects of puberty blockers in livestock and other mammals, we cannot - safely - prescribe these to children whose brains we know are still developing -until the age of 25 believe it or not!.

So what should we do about the children who are quite clearly suffering, they may be suicidal and really struggling with their gender identity. Personally I think we should treat them anyway we would treat a child struggling with depression, suicidal ideation and anxiety, with intensive counselling, therapy and IF needed first line depression medications, simple SSRI's or the such, NOT the heavy stuff they use in the states. Although this is not intended to and will not cure cases of gender dysphoria, I personally think it will do a few other things.

1. Allow children's brains to develop at least until they are 18 (although not fully as that doesn't happen till 25)
2. Help children who may not be gender-dysphoria and just suffering with mental health issues possibly recover and make a decision they may regret. I AM NOT saying this is the case with all people but that there are SOME documented cases of this happening, children being pushed by parents or clinicians.
3. Allow children to receive what I regard as important pre-transition therapy, counselling and psycho-therapy, which may uncover and help people suffering from trauma or other such issues.
4. Prevent companies from trying to recruit as many trans children as possible, who are inevitably more susceptible to manipulation, to use them for hormones and gender-affirming surgery so they can make a quick buck, I'm only saying these based on a few articles I've read in the UK about children who have de-transitioned saying they felt pushed into or didn't fully.

Please be mature and don't scream transphobic at the first opportunity, I think i've been pretty reasonable and explained myself and would like to have a good discussion from all sides. Have fun changing my views!"

0,2022-07-16,CMV: Both sides interpret the 2nd amendment to the US Constitution incorrectly.,u/wedontmakeanysense,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w0oyme/cmv_both_sides_interpret_the_2nd_amendment_to_the/,changemyview,"According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the word ""militia"" was first used in 1599, with a single definition. ""A body of citizens organized for military service."" A definition into which all current branches of the US military, as well as minutemen groups, fit perfectly. In the current usage, ""a part of the organized armed forces of a country liable to call only in an emergency,"" it has become synonymous with ""minutemen."" Defined as ""A group of men ready to take up arms at a minutes notice. Although the current definition of ""militia"" really better describes reservists.

Now I am no etymologist, but this seems easy enough. The word ""minutemen"" was first used in 1774. So it didn't share a common meaning with ""militia"" at that time. Otherwise a new word would not have been coined. For the writers of the Constitution to have meant the modern definition of ""militia"" 14 years later, the word would have had to evolve to its current definition in 14 years, during a time that was still half a century away from the first electrical communication device. Then that definition would need to remain idle through the entirety of electrical communication into the internet age. Again, I'm not an expert, but I would guess advances in communication have hastened the evolution of language.

It seems pretty obvious that ""well regulated militia"" is referring to the structured armed forces, but intentionally broad enough to encompass them in any form as they change throughout the future.

These people just defeated the large military force of what was supposed to be ""their"" nation, answerable to a singular power, because that power turned it against them. But they are also smart enough to know that a military of solely minutemen is a recipe for disaster against any well organized fighting force. So the very thing they had to overcome for their freedom, they realized was a necessary evil for the sovereignty of the nation. So if I were to modernize the wording to reflect the original intent, it would look something like this.

""Because the assorted branches of the US armed forces are necessary to the continued existence of our nation, the right of each individual to own and possess equivalent armament shall not be infringed upon.""

Obviously I believe they intended the people to be equally as armed as the military. However, these people had no concept of guided munitions and nuclear warheads, so that intent obviously can't be directly applied today. But before we can apply the intent to the modern age, we need to start correctly defining it."

On the contrary, I don't care. I'm more of a 'whatever contract happens between two people' they should be free to do. Landlords should be able to charge whatever prices they want. But when mortgage rates go up, and landlords say 'how will I be able to pay for my mortgage' it is because of your poor choices. 

If your salary couldn't help you afford to pay your mortgage, maybe don't buy a house?

I just find it is a double standard how we are supposed to take personal responsibility with our debt with any other shopping, but the government is supposed to make housing super easy for landlords

I think my main view is,

TLDR: If you can't pay off a mortgage without tenants, maybe don't buy such an expensive house?

I agree that housing affordability is an issue, but, the landlords are often people buying large houses, that's why they need tenants. A 2 story house's mortgage at say, 200k, is a different story from a say, 50k mortgage on a 1 story apartment.

Edit to add. Everyone saying I don't understand mortgages clearly don't. 

To forget variable mortgage rates mean you clearly don't know mortgages.

I was one of the original members of a democratic website despite growing up in a heavy republican home. I have seen nothing but hypocrisy, false promises, pleads for votes that accomplish nothing, and absolute waste on both sides. 

I understand this would have consequences where your favorite long term senator or representative would be ousted but honestly I don’t care. How many of us our allowed to fail at our jobs long term and keep them? 

I would love if we only elected candidates of whichever party that cared about two things and I don’t care whatever issues they support. One overturn Citizens United and two enact terms/age limits for Congress. I literally am open to the rest being battled out.

 This whole cycle of who is in power wins what mid term. Who has what approval rating determines what news cycle. I am over it. The only effective way we, as citizens can efficiently pull this off, is to literally get rid off all of them. Replace them with the same party; I do not care. Just get rid of them all.

Edit 1 - I see the repeated statement saying basically what about having all new people with no experience. This is not true at all. Not every representative and seat is up in every election it is a cycle. Also assuming that every replacement would have zero experience is naive at best. It is a staggered 1/3rd system. I do believe the fastest, peaceful way is to replace the next 1/3 with a new 1/3rd. The committee’s don’t fall apart and there is still experience in the room that just had a massive message sent basically saying start serving us or you are next"

And while I am actually not a pro life advocate and do agree that a woman can certainly choose to have an abortion and that is of course much better than killing herself in which case both lifes would be lost, I feel that it doesn't have to be between those 2 radical options. In most cases there are other and better options that don't involve killing human beings or even potential human beings if you say an unborn baby isn't human. Of course I understand that there are some cases where sexual abuse is involved and I understand that if the child reminds the mother of the face of the abuser she doesn't ever want to see its ugly (ugly to her) face. But she doesn't have to, because even in those cases there are other options.

For example, there are many wonderful couples (including of course same sex couples and couples with Transwomen and Transmen) that can't have children of their own and desperately want children and would be fully capably and willing to provide a wonderful home for them. And I am not at all saying a woman can't have an abortion, as she clearly can do that and will find ways to do that even in places where it's illegal, so I am not even advocating to make it illegal.  

But for example in my country, abortion has been legal for like forever and there isn't any stigma attached to it either, yet still it's actually not popular at all, cause in addition to a complete welfare program that makes it very easy to raise children even by yourself and even without any income, we also have an option that's dubbed ""baby chute"". It's literally a sorta chute were you literally and anonymously drop your baby into. Don't worry, it's not a real drop, and there are nurses on the other side that are gonna immediately care for it and then eventually give it up for adoption.  So while I am not in any way infringing on your right to have an abortion, why would in cases where the child is healthy and there are no medical reasons for an abortion, and where it's feasible to use the option I described, the abortion be what saves life whereas putting the baby into the chute so it's allowed to live, be what kills life?

And of course I realize that this baby chute thing isn't yet available everywhere and it might be difficult to travel for some women in such situations. But even if the chute isn't available, adoption itself is available everywhere and even if it involves legal hassles that you want to avoid, there are ways around that too. I mean at the very least you have these religious nuts that wanna prevent you from doing an abortion, cause at least THOSE you have everywhere. So why not actually put them to use and actually have them help for a change? I am sure they would be more than willing to provide a qualified nurse for you to have the baby without big fanfare and provide ways to have it adopted - also without big fanfare or legal obligations on your part - especially because they see your aborting it as killing, so of course they would rather help you in any way that lets the baby live, than have it be killed. So how can you say killing it is the only option? But feel free to convince me otherwise."

I believe that therefore, producers have an obligation to take this effect seriously and only display CPR in the exact way it is taught in first-aid courses.

Everytime somebody is shown doing CPR by lightly tapping the chest in an awkward rhythm, there will be thousands of people who will remember that specific instance of CPR rather than what they were taught in a course 10 years ago, and believe that it is correct to do CPR that way. An especially egregious example for this is (Spoilers for Better Call Saul) &gt;!Gustavo Fring reanimating Hector Salamanca in S3E10. Awful, just awful CPR, completely inexcusable. Absolutely no force put onto the chest at all, and the intervals are terrible as well.!&lt;

The only exception I could think of is if the entire point of the bad CPR is to explicitly show that the character performing it is a baffoon, which 99% of the time is not the case

A very similar thing can be said for pet enclosures. Everytime I see a goldfish in a tiny tank or even worse a bowl, or a mouse/hamster in a tiny cage, I want to scream and throw my TV out of the window. We know from Finding Nemo that movies have a very significant impact on what pets people want to own. Most people do not know anybody who owns a goldfish, hamster or mouse, so they see these unsuitable enclosures on TV and think that it's totally okay to keep a pet in those. I genuinely believe that the only reason why goldfish bowls even exist at all anymore is speficially because of TV and movies, because they are among the worst pet enclosures on earth, and nobody in their right mind would ever want one on their own if they hadn't seen one in a moving picture before. Mice being picked up by their tail is another terrible behaviour that I see constantly.

tl;dr: movie and TV producers are making content that is supposed to be watched by millions of people. Therefore, they should have a legal obligation to not spread harmful misinformation and misconceptions if they are not absolutely integral to the story that is being told. CPR and pet enclosures are the most obvious examples for this because they are almost always terrible and never serve a purpose for the story, but there's probably much more examples where the distinction would not be as clear."

For example if I bake a cake randomly and give it to some random person, is that person now obligated to take the cake just because I took time to make it for them? No they have every right to refuse because they have no obligation to eat what they don't want. The same way I have no obligation to respond to someone I don't want to talk to if greeted. My conclusion is. Nobody who's just minding their business that's not in any setting where they have to serve people like any sort of customer service job, first responders etc. have any moral obligation to interact/respond to people they don't want.

0,2022-07-17,CMV: The bodily autonomy argument sucks (abortion),u/conn_r2112,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w17pri/cmv_the_bodily_autonomy_argument_sucks_abortion/,changemyview,"Firstly, I will be arguing my position from the assumption that personhood begins at conception and that we should respect the right to life of a day one fetus.

Imagine a hypothetical future where teleportation is a reality.  

You and your child of ‘X’ years of age travel regularly between two cities, a 6 hour drive each way!  So one day, you decide to invest in a teleportation machine to save you significant amounts of travel time.

The salesman instructs you on how to use the machine but give you the disclaimer that if you go through the machine with another person, there is a 1% chance that they will become conjoined to you on the other end, forevermore completely dependant on you to live.

Being aware of the possibility of this outcome, you decide to take your chances anyway.

If you unfortunately land on that 1%, and your child becomes conjoined to you… I don’t understand how you are not ethically culpable if you decide to remove them, thus murdering them.

You put them in that position where the only options were dependency or death!  Knowing it was a possibility you still took the chance and you made them dependent on you to live

Insofar as we assume the personhood of the fetus, I think the bodily autonomy argument is BS

Change my view

EDIT:  I don't want to argue personhood... if the strength of your bodily autonomy arguments necessitate a lack of personhood, then maybe the bodily autonomy argument isn't as strong as you thought"

0,2022-07-17,CMV: I'm against the legalisation of weed,u/xotbirdox,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w1alz2/cmv_im_against_the_legalisation_of_weed/,changemyview,"OK, so a bit of background: I have a half-brother who developed drug-induced psychosis from weed. It was found that he was predisposed to mental health issues, especially things like schizophrenia and psychosis, and that, coupled with the weed, is what triggered his illness. They still don't know exactly what permanent mental illness he has but he is off weed and on anti-psychotics now and is doing much better.

When he was on weed, he was addicted. No doubt about that. The doctors said the same thing. He was horrible to everyone, especially me, and was a shell of the man we once knew. It was like he was a completely different person. He believed everyone was out to get him, he thought he could literally see god, and that the TV was talking to him. He also believed he was a character in a TV advert that was showing at the time. He would get even more irritable if he couldn't smoke weed - one time, he had been sectioned (committed for all the Americans in this sub 😅) by the police for standing in traffic and hitting cars and screaming at drivers that they were ""killing the kids!,"" and he asked my mum and I to smuggle in some weed to the mental ward he was on. Of course, we didn't do it, and he was FURIOUS at us for not obliging. He called us all kinds of horrific names, brought up my mum's abuse that she suffered in her childhood just to upset her, it was awful. We walked out of there in tears.

Because of the way he treated us, I chose not to speak to him for 2-3 years. Our two mums (lesbian parents, same dad but each birthed by one of our mums) still spoke to him, they always maintained that they loved him unconditionally of course. And I think, deep down, I loved him unconditionally too, but I put on a front like I hated him for the longest time because I thought he hated me. Because he acted like he hated me. I didn't know what else to do but to shut him out, especially since I was going through self-harm and having to attend children's therapy services at the time (I was 14 when his psychosis started).

He's miles better now, that section when I was 18 was actually the thing that finally saved him. The doctor said the weed was killing his braincells, I don't know how literally he meant that tbh but it scared my brother straight. And now that he has the clarity of mind to articulate what was going on during his psychosis, he has told us that he was hearing a voice the entire time that sounded like it was behind glass and would constantly tell him that we didn't love him and were out to get him, which obviously was not and is not true. But that's why my brother lashed out at us; because he thought we hated him. That was so heartbreaking to hear. My brother and I are close again now and I love him so much. He actually finally apologised to me last year, which I never thought would happen bc I thought he didn't remember most of it.

Anyway, because of my experience with my brother, I have been adamantly against weed and its legalisation for at least 10 years now. I've not been like an anti-weed activist or anything like that but it's just a strong belief that I hold. People try to make good arguments to me about the potential benefits that weed might bring some people, but all I see when talking about weed is my brother and what he went through - and I never want anyone else to go through that.

I've done some research on the relationship between weed and mental illness since making up with my brother. What I found has turned me even more against it. The research shows that people who are (often unknowingly) predisposed to schizophrenia, seem to end up like my brother if they smoke weed. And what irks me is there is NO talk about this on the pro-weed side. There's an active shutting-down of discussion of any potential harms even. Most people on the pro-weed side seem to think weed is God's gift to the Earth and that it can do no wrong. They're actively unwilling to discuss the other side of it, which many scientific papers and medical professionals seem to confirm exists. They claim that bc it's natural, it's 100% fine, and like... tobacco is also natural. Even caffeine can cause addiction and that's natural too. There are also plenty of flat-out poisonous, completely natural plants out there. Natural does not mean good.

I'm just terrified that the current legalisation and overly-positive marketing of weed and weed-based products is leading us to sleepwalk straight into another Big Tobacco situation.

I want to read other viewpoints and hopefully see things from a different perspective and potentially change my view bc I am a huge leftist. My position on weed and other drugs has me at odds with other leftists, and I also really do feel for the plight of those who take or want medicinal marijuana. But I am just worried that it will come back to bite them in the arse a few decades from now. Please change my view.

I mostly play words that end with an E but when my E's get over, I have to think of another letter that ends a word, and that's frustrating cause E is found at the end of the word more than other letters. It's not fair that the E tile frustrates me when they are all played. Because it's hard for me to think of a word that ends in a different letter. For that reason E is also a bad tile.

Initially, I was open to using these the third person plural pronouns for persons who identify as non-binary but having now read a number of articles on Wikipedia on non-binary individuals where editors use the third person plural pronouns, I am now totally skeptical.   
I would be reading the ""Early life"" section of these articles and would have to stop to figure out whether ""they"" refers to the individual or them and their family.   
For reference, this excerpt from Demi Lovato's page:  

&gt;""Lovato has an older full sister named Dallas; a younger maternal half-sister, actress [Madison De La Garza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_De_La_Garza); and an older paternal half-sister, Amber, whom they first spoke to when they were twenty years old.   
&gt;  
&gt;In mid-1994, shortly after Lovato's second birthday, their parents divorced. Their father was of [Nuevomexicano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanos_of_New_Mexico) descent, with mostly Spanish and [Native American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas) ancestors, and came from a family that had been living in New Mexico for generations; he also had distant Portuguese and [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews) ancestry. Patrick was a descendant of [Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War) [Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)) veteran [Francisco Perea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Perea) and [Santa Fe de Nuevo México](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_de_Nuevo_M%C3%A9xico) governor [Francisco Xavier Chávez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Xavier_Ch%C3%A1vez). Lovato had no interest in forging a relationship with Patrick after their parents divorced. Their mother is of English and Irish descent""

Is ""their parents"" referring to Demi Lovato or to her and her half-sisters? Now imagine an entire article which naturally features the plural-they but also the singular-they and it becomes clear that singular-they is not an ideal alternative pronoun for non-binary people."

Small game hunting as in squirrels, rabbits, dove, quail, ducks, coot, crow, grouse and pheasant.

Pork and chicken prices at supermarkets are significantly lower than beef prices, sometimes as cheap as 2 dollars a pound.

If you have your own large property, then you could hunt it and not have to drive a lot in order to get to a hunting ground and spend a decent amount of money on gas

If you don't have hunting gear already, it can be a good chunk of change to get.

Duck loads for shotguns aren't cheap, and even cheap target loads for shotguns run 30 cents a piece. 22 LR rounds can be 10 cents a piece but its Harder to hit game with than shotguns.

Meanwhile, hunting rounds made for deer can be pricey, but 100 pounds of meat for a deer tag, license and a 2 dollar hollow point is a pretty good deal."

I do still believe that we should have a justice system to provide some level deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation, and restitution. What I'm against is the punishment aspect. By punishment, I mean the intentional reprobative retributive harming of someone. Here's a way to distinguish this between the other ideals I mentioned. There seems to be a clear difference between the state forcing a severely mentally ill person to stay in a mental ward to keep the rest of society safe versus the state compelling a non-mentally ill murderer to perform hard labor in order to harm them. 

In the case of the mentally ill criminal, the state is merely foreseeably causing harm to the mentally ill person. It would clearly be immoral to intentionally make the severely mentally ill person worse off by giving them the death penalty or something of the sort. It does however seem to be morally okay to merely cause foreseeable harm to mentally ill person. You might ask, ""well what's the difference?"" Here's a brief way to explain the difference. Suppose your country is at war, and they need to bomb some sort of enemy military facility to keep the country safe. However, there's civilians near the facility, and the only way to get rid of the facility to keep your country safe is by engaging in an action which will inevitably cause the deaths of the civilians. This we can call causing foreseeable harm. This case seems very clearly different to a person bombing civilian areas in order to make the populace of an enemy nation lose morale. It could still make your country safe, but we can still see that this is a case of intentional harm. Now, it may be the case that the first scenario is also immoral, but I think we can still see that the second scenario is worse than the first scenario.

Punishment is retributive in the sense that it's done because someone has done something that is legally prohibited. Punishment is also reprobabtive in the sense that it's done in disapproval of the legally prohibited act.

So the question that I struggle with which makes me skeptical of the permissibility of punishment is why it's okay to do certain things to a particular class of people which we would find utterly repugnant were we to do the same things to any other class of people. What is the morally relavant difference between legal criminals and non-criminals which allows us to do certain things to legal criminals, but not non-criminals?

I'm going to briefly respond to two solutions to the problem of punishment.  I will first address the consequentialist justification for punishment. Then I will address the retributivist justification.

The consequentialist justification says that punishment is justified because it produces favorable outcomes like deterrence, incapacitation, etc. I reject the consequentialist justification because I find consequentialism to be rather conterintuitive. If the consequentialist justification were true, it would be morally permissible to intentionally harm legally innocent people if it produced favorable outcomes such as preventing a riot or something of the sort. There's responses to these objections, and counter-responses, and many other objections the anti-punishment person could make to the consequentialist, but to keep it brief, I'll just leave it here and address potential responses in the comments. There are also other flavors of the consequentialist justification, I can't address all of them here.

The retributivist justification says that punishment is justified precisely because the legal criminal did something immoral, and they should receive harm because that's what they deserve. There are other flavors of retributivism just like there are other flavors of the consequentialist position, but I can't address them all here. First, the arguments which retributivists use just aren't intuitive for me. They may try to point to particularly horrendous people such as people who have murdered and raped many people like Ted Bundy. Surely they deserve serious intentional harm? The retributivist may also say that we should trust our moral intuitions in the absence of sufficient defeaters. However, I don't have these intuitions. If a serial killer murdered and tortured everyone I cared for, I would definitely feel sad, but I don't think I have the intuition that agents of the state have some sort of moral obligation to pursue Ted Bundy's suffering for it's own sake. Secondly, this retributivist solution can't justify punishment for all forms of legal criminals. Surely, someone who drives a car which hasn't passed an emissions test in order to drive their dying friend to the hospital doesn't deserve to have intentional harm inflicted on them? It is a reasonable and just law that people should drive cars which have passed emissions tests, but surely not all people who violate this law deserve to suffer.

Here are some brief reasons for why I don't think legal punishment is morally permissible or obligatory."

This is usually backed with some kind of statement about how the players are the product that's bringing in all the money. This is incorrect. If all the best players joined a minor league system, held out until they were old enough to be pros, went overseas or just flat out refused to play unless paid, it wouldn't have a huge impact. College sports would do just fine without  elite athletes. I believe this for a few reasons...

&amp;#x200B;

1. College sports fans accept they're watching a less talented product (otherwise they'd just watch the pros.) If pro level athletes didn't play collegiate sports, college fans would still be happy watching a less talented product than before. After all, many NCAAF fans will watch games with no pro prospects already. And even if the highest rated games are between the best teams, that is likely just because they're the best teams, not because they have the most pro prospects. 
2. College fans often cite loyalty to the school, a wider variety of offensive and defensive schemes, traditions, etc. as why they prefer college athletics. None of this changes if you only have decent , never gonna be a pro, student-athletes playing. Michigan alum will cheer for Michigan students, whether they're five star future first rounders or local students, the same way you cheer for your local high school team.  
3. Without elite athletes your players have a new appeal. This new brand of players will be much more like average students than future multimillionares who have no need for class, won't skip bowl games, will likely stay all four years, will likely be more locally based, etc. You will need to do more marketing and storytelling to replace the ""this kid will be a first round draft pick""  marketing angle college sports currently rely on, but fans might actually like watching them play more. After all, tons of college sports fans favorite players are the guys who didn't become pros, and the NCAA bball Tournament was just as fun without the straight out of high school players like Lebron competing. 
4. Bit of a stretch here, but: Jake Paul has proven people will watch amateurs compete if given an interesting enough storyline. If nobody cares about an elite Cuban professional who can't be hit but would happily watch two sloppy Youtubers box, are we so sure the connection between ratings and talent is what we've been led to believe all these years?"

Now, sure Gen Z is mostly full of idiots. Very little people in this generation actually take things seriously, and when they do they are idiots about it and can’t understand the true extent of the problem, which leads to them believing in or coming up with moronic solutions to problems that are more complex than they realize.

This might sound like the beginning of a long rant about how the new generation is soft and weak, and how we have absolutely no brains or smarts, and are just incredibly immature and unrealistic with our ideas.

The above is all true about my generation, but it doesn’t make us any worse. We just haven’t experienced life yet, and for those of us that are actually adults, they are literally JUST starting to figure life out. Even baby boomers were incredibly chaotic, and they are the ones you mostly hear ranting about the state of todays generation.

Essentially, you cannot blame a generation for being weak, stupid, immature, chaotic, etc when they haven’t even gotten the chance to experience life yet

If a man makes an accusation of being sexually harassed at work (against a person of any gender), should we tend to believe him? If a person (of any gender) makes a harassment accusation against a woman, should we tend to believe the accuser? If your answer to these questions is Yes, then the slogan aligning with these beliefs is “Believe accusers”, not “Believe women”. The fact that accusers are disproportionately women, is irrelevant – why settle for a slogan that mostly aligns with your beliefs, if you can use one that aligns 100%?

In a [previous CMV](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/fpoqx6/cmv_the_idea_of_believe_all_women_in_regards_to/), someone argued that “Believe women” was illogical because you should not automatically “believe” any person; the top-voted counter-argument was that there was a historical tendency not to believe accusers, so the “Believe women” slogan was intended to counteract this. Fine – but then this should apply to other accusers as well, to the extent there’s a tendency not to believe them.  (In particular, if a man accuses a woman of unwanted sexual advances, he is likely to get some ribbing from friends about how he couldn’t have “really” minded all that much, especially if the woman is attractive.)

And, frankly, I think all of this is obvious enough that the slogan “Believe women” has a whiff of male feminists sounding deliberately irrational in order to impress the women in their lives, when they should just say what they mean: Listen to accusers. CMV."

For context, I live near Seattle, Washington in the US and am mostly talking about a North American perspective where bicycle and other non-car transportation infrastructure is pitiful.

# Firstly, why I think this would be beneficial:

One significant point of reference that I am using is the Burke-Gilman and Samamish River Trails that span a significant portion of the northern part of lake Washington. These paths are fantastic for walking, running and  cycling because they are pleasant places to be and because they do a very good job of connecting larger suburbs of Seattle like Redmond, Woodinville, Bothell, Kenmore, Lake Forest Park, Seattle proper and even more of the surrounding areas. This makes all of these places and the areas surrounding them significantly easier to access by bike and walking, even though the bicycle infrastructure in these areas is otherwise lacking. Even if the first and last mile of my trip is poorly set up for cycling, it is much much easier to bike to those places because the rest of the trip is easy and comfortable. I find myself wanting a network of similar trails (especially going north and south from where I live), but the political will for that is somewhat lacking and it can be expensive or difficult to get large scale change in that regard. This, however, seems like a faster easier and cheaper way to get the bare minimum of similar trails that would bring cyclists between major clusters of destinations. Freeways already run along major corridors and are often flanked by important destinations. This would drastically increase the general areas that could be gotten close to by bicycle for relatively low cost and impact. Which would in turn increase bicycle usage and the demand for further development of bicycle of infrastructure that connects more destinations. These paths wouldn’t be as pleasant as high-quality bike paths, due do the proximity to the loud highway, but they would still be much more pleasant than biking on the street or sidewalks. The paths could also slightly sidestep the highway when practical, or trees or barriers could be used to separate the highway from the paths. This would be a significant stepping stone towards better cycling infrastructure in addition to being able to bare minimally connect distant destinations while other bike and transit infrastructure improves.

Plus, having nice and safe walking and biking trails near more people would increase the opportunity for many people to engage in more casual, daily exercise and make it much nicer for people to leave their house to go for a walk or exercise without a car, which would be beneficial for public health.


# Secondly, why I think this would work:

A lot of the highway around where I live have quite a bit of open space on both sides. It usually seems like enough of space to add a plenty wide cycle path. Some places it’s a little narrow, however with enough barriers between the highway and the paths, I would think that it would be safe for cyclists. I don’t know about the importance of the open spaces for safety of drivers, but shoulders are quite narrow in many places so it seems like there are cases where some factors make it worth it to forego that space. The path could even be put behind sound deadening walls that are already often there, though I acknowledge that it would mostly be prohibitive to do this.

These projects definitely would incur extra not insignificant expenses, however it seems to me that this could be folded into highway resurfacing and maintenance works that need to happen anyways, reducing extra road closures and work time that would otherwise need to happen.


In cases where the highway goes over an overpass or through an underpass or tunnel, or where the highways is impractical to follow, the bike path could be minimally routed through surface streets with bicycle and pedestrian crossing. If that was impossible for some reasons, it could go along the overpass, separated from the highway by concrete barriers, however that seems much less ideal to me.


# What would change my view:

A convincing argument as to why this wouldn’t be useful or effective, or a convincing argument that it would be much more expensive than I think it would be to the point of outweighing the plus sides.

# What would not change my view: 

Arguments that cycling is an ineffective means of transportation or arguing that cars are better than other forms of transportation. I am not looking to have this part of me view challenged at the moment.

I think it’s probably clear that I just came up with this idea looking at a few examples of things I like and dislike about the areas near where I live. I haven’t fully thought this through, nor am I an expert on urban planning, so I wanted some other perspectives. Change my view!"

It doesn't make sense to me to allow a drug that kills people who don't use it and cannot consent to it.

\[For people who can't consent to it, children who work on tobacco farms absorb the equivalent of 50 cigarettes a day from handling tobacco leaves\]([https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20220531-tobacco-industry-s-environmental-impact-is-devastating-who-says](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20220531-tobacco-industry-s-environmental-impact-is-devastating-who-says)).

This is not to attack smokers. There are very good reasons to be a drug addict in this world. But cigarettes are too destructive both to humans and the planet to be legal I believe. CMV! Please excuse formatting."

I won’t deny I have a bias here. I also started smoking cigarettes at 16 and drank alcohol underage. 

Flavored vape juice is not just appealing to minors. Adult smokers are drawn to flavors because they are more enjoyable than regular cigarettes, helping them quit. Vaping has been shown to not be as harmful as cigarettes. I’m not going to pretend it’s healthy, but it is at least *significantly* better than cigarettes. Since switching entirely to vaping my health has improved. My chronic cough is gone and I can walk up a flight of stairs without wheezing. Even if it turns out vaping will also cause cancer in 30 years, my quality of life is far better right now. There have been no deaths from nicotine vaping. The only vaping related deaths reported have been from using unregulated THC cartridges. Millions die every year from smoking related conditions. There’s also secondhand smoke, which harms non smokers as well. 

Vape flavor bans are hypocritical. You don’t see people lobbying to ban flavored alcohol which is also more appealing to minors. Alcohol can kill you in one night and there’s no potential health benefits to blue raspberry vodka. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t want to give up my Apple whisky, i just think it’s hypocritical to ban one and not the others. 

Flavor bans harm vape shops. With new vape mail restrictions, some of us have to depend on local vape shops. Now that more and more have gone out of business it’s less accessible. I can go to any gas station and buy a pack of cigarettes. I can’t go to a gas station and buy coils/pods for my specific device or e-liquid. My only option at that point is getting one of the devices and pods sold by big tobacco companies. Aside from not wanting to support those companies, those straight up are just shitty and overpriced.

For clarification, I am not saying that all vape regulation is bad and that we shouldn’t act to prevent minors from vaping. I am just saying that flavor bans and outright vape bans harm adults more than they protect minors."

Everyone wants to pursue it because profit just means making more money than you spend. What is money? It’s literally just a convenient way to represent, store and exchange value. Having money means you can exchange the money you have for the things you want, be that food, housing, power/influence and so on. 

So capitalism is effective because its only goal is to generate something that almost everyone wants more of anyway, so people are deeply motivated to create businesses which create more of it.

The downside is that profit is morally neutral.

People can convert profit into things that help the rest of the world or hurt the rest of the world, to one degree or another.

This means that capitalism is, without very strict control, apt to become a noxious influence on the world, we need a system that generates innovation like capitalism, but which is stable and positive by default without active input.

We need something that can replace profit as the primary driver to create efficient businesses and innovative technologies, something which is, in and of itself, also an inherently good thing to have more of, which benefits the human race the more it exists.

So in short my view is that capitalism could be reformed by finding something better than profit around which to base it, which has all of the qualities of profit, but is also morally positive. To be clear I don't know that that thing is, just that if we found something with the qualities i described above, capitalism would become an unparalleled force for good."

For instance, the gun debate in the US is completely stalled, even though gun owners are a minority. Now imagine replacing them with meat eaters or car owners who are the majority. The current price squeeze illustrates this really well - despite higher prices, people don't want to switch to non-petrol solutions for cars and heating because those are even more expensive. In short, making such big changes requires big cuts to standard of living for many. 

In other words, for reasons of cost, pleasure, standard of living or simply pure selfishness, most people wouldn't make the change. Suddenly trading off the future of one's grandkids for one's immediate prosperity, albeit cynical, seems quite attractive for most (or at least a large chunk of) people. The governments could try to force behavioural change, but in democracies a strong and vocal reaction is inevitable.

Carbon free generation doesn't seem like a particularly good option either. Renewables have very expensive reliability until viable energy storage is a thing. As for nuclear, the fuel is now very expensive too, and installations take just way too long to build.

Therefore in my opinion the only viable options are (relatively cheap) geoengineering projects, to which most people would be indifferent (with good PR) because they don't touch them directly, and government efforts should concentrate on these. Good examples are space silicon bubbles to increase Earth's albedo and carbon capture using controlled algal blooms (by fertilising the ocean). The success of these is not guaranteed, but at least they have a chance at it. This will buy us time to develop better energy sources such as fusion or good energy storage to move away from carbon for good, which should be the second focus area."

Liberal  ""someone that subscribes to a social philosophy that promotes individual rights, civil liberties and Free enterprise""

Now,Let's see the policies with the most support from ""liberals"" in the US

Mandated Paid maternity leave,
Government funding for childcare,
Minimum wage increase,
AOC's 70% wealth tax,
Tuition free college,
Medicare for all,
Stricter gun laws,
And a UBI.

none of these align with liberal values.

Why?

 Paid maternity leave: forces an organization/person into a non consentual contract.

Government funding for childcare: requires use of  others' resources to fulfill an individual's responsibility 

Minimum wage increase: forces an organization/person into a non consentual contract.

AOC's 70% wealth tax: self explanatory

Tuition free college: forces an organization/person into a non consentual contract and/or requires use of  others' resources to fulfill an individual's responsibility.


Medicare for all: would require forcing  organizations into an involuntary contact.

Stricter gun laws: gives governments more power to control the individual liberties of citizens also slippery slope and whatnot.


UBI: involuntary allocation of resources.


I'm not saying they are all necessarily bad policies, I'm just saying there's nothing liberal about them.

That being said, feel free to extrapolate to other scenarios but I don’t promise that I will consider them necessarily the same. With that being said, let’s get into it.

So generally speaking, it is somewhat expected that the man pays for dinner on a date (lots of people say the person who invited out the other person should pay but in general this is basically de facto man pays). In my experience, usually when I go out on a date the woman makes a token offer to pay without the expectation of actually having to. I’ve never gotten a second date where I’ve taken her up on that offer and even the girl I’m seeing now has said “yes if you had taken me up on my offer to pay then there would have been no second date because no one one’s date someone whose cheap”.

What I have a problem with is that if paying is that big of a deal to someone that they will not go on a second date, theyre not really offering to pay. What theyre doing is putting up a test to determine the personality of the person theyre with if you want to frame it in the best possible light and even then I still frankly find it a little off putting. It feels inconsistent to me because I feel like people who make this offers genuinely do think they’re being nice despite the fact it’s completely fake.

TL;DR Summary: if someone offers to pay for a date with a second date being contingent on them not taking that offer, they’re not actually being genuine in offering to pay for that date. CMV

Edit: I think the subject of what is supposed to be changed isn’t clear so I’m going to try to clarify it here. The question is “Is offering to pay and then not having a second date if the offer taken a genuine offer to pay?” while my stance is “this is not a genuine offer”. It is not a matter of “does this make sense”. But “should they other person feel like they’re making a genuine offer?”"

It got me to thinking about the whole stolen valor situation as well. It's easy to be a cop on pleasant traffic stops, DUI, low-stress situation. It's not easy to be a cop in high-stress situation. And when you can't handle the high-stress situation, or rather, become totally immobilized in these situations, you are basically a wannabe tough guy living out some weird fantasy.

I used to want to be a cop from the age of 2 up until the age of 14. It was cool to want to be a cop and have a gun and be in situational power as a kid because that was ""kid fantasy."" But once I actually researched the roles of cops and the shit that they potentially might have to face, such as death, I realized I didn't have it in me to put my life at risk to protect others. It took me an hour of teenage thinking to make that decision.

So there you have it. I became an accountant, instead. Off-topic, I guess I am larping, too, because I'm not that good at math."

0,2022-07-18,CMV: Corporate investors in Houses aren't a long term problem.,u/A_Soporific,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w24phm/cmv_corporate_investors_in_houses_arent_a_long/,changemyview,"I live in the Atlanta metro, where about 33% of homes are owned and rented by investment funds. It's crazy how high prices to buy have gotten. My brother bought a 3 bedroom / 3 bathroom house north of the city in walking distance of a sububran town's main street for $95,000 in 2015. Now the houses are nearly four times as expensive. It's not just *buying* that's gotten more expensive, the median rent in the community doubled since 2020 which puts undue stress on the college students who make up most of the rental market in my locality.

It's bad, y'all.

That said, I don't think it's a longer term problem. In fact, I think we're going to see a massive sell off by these large investors within the year because the problem is largely a function of bad policy.

In 2019, for example, you could earn 5.5% after expenses on the average rental property according to Redfin. At the same time the cost of a Mortgage was 2.2% on average. So if you were going to buy durable goods real estate's 3.3% was higher than buying a bond fund that way paying out 2.9%. I know, it's half a percent, but half a percent on a hundred million dollars is a real deal.

Especially since people paid rent on time 96% of the time, according to the financial disclosures of ""Progress Residential"", the largest of these Real Estate funds. That sort of on time payment is exceptional, and landlords tend to get paid first whereas anything that depends on disposable income has to wait for whatever is left.

The crazy low interest rates for so very long made borrowing money to buy houses trivially easy, especially if you're not using a traditional mortgage but rather corporate lines of credit. After all, if you use a revolving corporate line of credit or investor money you have way more flexibility when it comes to repayment schedules and you have the deed in your (company) name from the word go. This has led to a crazy number of cash offers on houses, a talk given by a Nashville realtor said that almost nine out of ten houses they sold in 2019 had at least one cash offer.

I don't think this will continue. In fact, I think that it's stopping already. That Nashville realtor says that only two in ten of new sales have had cash offers in the past three months. I think that the trend isn't just slowing but about to go in reverse as investors try to salvage as much capital as they can by dumping as many houses as they can while the price is still high.

Frankly, renting a house isn't as good of a deal as it used to be. Redfin's measure of profitability is down to 4.4% which is a substantial cut, but that's not the worst of it. The cost of borrowing spiked to 6% on the bake of the Fed raising rates and then doing it again. They're scheduled to raise rates another six times *this year alone*. Meaning getting a mortgage to rent it out would cost you money. While these investment banks aren't getting mortgages they are still having to borrow money or solicit investors to buy houses, which means that their costs have spiked as well.

If you're losing money if you borrow and rent it out because borrowing got so much more expensive there's a very real chance that you're going to lose money if you've already paid off the house as well. According to Progress Residential in the past three months only 87% of their 20 million residential units paid rent in the month it was due. That means that Progress is probably about the evict a couple million people, which is a slow and expensive process that is more trouble than Wall Street Investors are set up to handle. If this is a generalized trend we're going to see a wave of evictions and delinquent payments that are going to drive landlords small and large out of business.

To further make matters worse Real Estate isn't even more profitable than buying a bond fund any longer. Remember 4.4% returns on real estate, but in June bond funds were offering 4.7%. Why deal with collecting rent, maintaining houses, and foreclosing on delinquents when you can make more sitting on you couch and letting corporate bonds do all the work?

Corporate investors in real estate are a problem. But they are a problem primarily because interest rates were put way too low for way too long. If rates were creeping up since 2014 like they were ""supposed to"" in a strong economy then borrowing money to buy a house to rent would have never been more profitable than corporate bonds and thus corporate investors wouldn't have bought 20 million homes for the express purpose of jacking up the prices of homes and rent. Obama's administration was pushing home ownership real hard and didn't explicitly exclude rental properties from the incentives. Trump leaned on the Fed *super hard* to keep them from raising rates even though no one would have noticed (after a few scary headlines from CNBC the Wall Street Journal that would have been forgotten in a few days) and things would have gone way better in terms of both inflation and this housing crunch. Chaining down monetary policy to be able to score political points by both major parties caused the market to malfunction. Now that the Fed is allowed to do its job again, the market should cease to malfunction because there's just no artificially low rate to exploit.

In the future we should be careful about the government incentives surrounding home buying, but calls to do ban corporate ownership of houses strikes me as a shortsighted overreaction that doesn't understand the root causes of the problem at hand.

Of course, I could always be wrong about this. What do you all think? What am I missing here?"

All those veggie flavors, the cheese, excellent combination.  It was tasty and a staple of my costco experience.

I also enjoyed a hot dog with some onions.  All for $1.50, man, quality price.

Then COVID happened, and the combo and onions went away at most, if not all, US locations.  **I think it should stay that way**

I am a shareholder.  Assuming the reason those items were dropped was to increase profit, I am all in.  If I want onions, I can bring my own onions or save it when I get home.  For the combo, the cheese or pepperoni pizzas are viable substitutes.  There is not that much material drop off.  I can handle that for increased profits on the board, ESPECIALLY when the hot dog is still $1.50 in the age of massive inflation.

Given that, the loss of those 2 items does not appear to materially impact their sales or membership retention.  In the age of rising inflation, people still view the costco food court as a quality meal for the price.  It doesn’t seem to have negatively impacted membership revenues as they increased membership revenues, and likely will do so as prices go continue to rise.

So those are my views, CMV."

* 'Democrats' and 'Republicans' refer to voters, politicians and news media affiliated or leaning to either party.
* There was a longer version of this intro that got deleted by reddit for no reason. Gonna have to stick with a shitty one :/
* ""You don't know this for sure"" isn't going to change my view. No shit I don't, that's why I'm here lol

After the 2020 election results came out and Joe Biden won, the response from Republicans has been mixed, to say the very least. Many believe that the election was unfair, citing mail-in voting, social media crackdowns and a biased news cycle as tipping the scales in favor of Joe. A more extreme branch believes that the election was outright *stolen*, either through widespread election fraud or the deep state changing things. The news seems split as well: many accept it, some grumble and a few parrot very extensive theories. January 6th was the tipping point of the Republican response, and whether you see it as an insurrection, a protest or a friendly tour, it was most certainly extreme. The severity of the event and it's cause are still being debated today, more than a year later.

&amp;#x200B;

With this in mind, **My View** is that:

* Had the election results shown a victory for Donald Trump
* Had he won without any massive election fraud

The response from Democrats *in that hypothetical* would have been more extreme than the response from Republicans in our current timeline. I am now going to list a few reasons why I believe so.

&amp;#x200B;

**The perception of Trump from Democrats**: While it is quite clear that Republicans dislike Joe Biden, what between ""Let's Go Brandon!"" memes and speculation of his mental state, the sheer hatred that Democrats have for Trump cannot be understated:

* ""Vote blue no matter who"" was a somewhat common sentiment on social media during the election cycle that very plainly declared that you should vote against republicans **no matter who the democrat is**. This is a VERY extreme take (and one that even some left-leaning media [disagrees with](https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/vote-blue-no-matter-who-is-a-stupid-slogan-d4fc0cb87afd)) that was almost nonexistent before 2016. It displays a prevailing attitude towards Trump: that he is such a threat that he transcends regular politics and needed to be 'defeated' the way you would a tv villain.
   * This attitude wasn't nearly as common within Republican social media (and it's not because they couldn't make a rhyme: 'Vote Red 'til your Dead"" works just as well). There was obviously strong opposition to Joe Biden, but rarely ever an expression of 'I will choose trump even if god's chosen democrat walks on stage'.
* Donald Trump supporters are frequently summarized as Democrats as a gang of racist, backwards boomers; terms like MAGAheads and MAGAtards are used to mock anyone wearing clothes that supports him; many people consider so much as voting for Donald Trump making you synonymous with the alt-right. This is especially important because Donald Trump is *not* a fringe candidate; Democrats view a very large part of the nation as almost evil simply by association.
   * Neither Hilary Clinton nor Biden supporters were or have been met with such vitriol from the right.
* Many people have expressed a belief that Trump is not just a president who had too much overreach and was racist, but a *dictator* and a *fascist*. These are terms that are usually reserved for political leaders who, objectively, have done far, far, ***far*** worse than Trump ever has. The term dictator brings to mind one-party states where the leader is always in power and can do anything he wants. The term fascist conjures up Adolf Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini. These are people Democrats associate Trump with.

&amp;#x200B;

**Many Democrats** ***already*** **don't/didn't see him as a perfectly legitimate president**. This one might sound strange, but hear me out:

* There was a very widespread belief (and even today it's VERY common) that Russian intelligence and bots were interfering in the 2016 election, helping gain Donald Trump more votes and ultimately securing his victory. These claims were quite far from being 100% factual, yet they were widely reported on every major media channel at the time. The right-wing equivalent would've been dismissed as a conspiracy theory no matter how much evidence it had, yet the left-wing one was shockingly commonplace.
* This is a rather fringe viewpoint but some democrats, mostly online, find Donald Trump's victory unfair simply because he lost the popular vote. This is despite the fact that presidential elections have been decided by the electoral college for a very long time, long before Donald Trump, and it isn't like it was the first time the popular vote didn't win, either.
* Many democrats were calling for Trump's impeachment *long before January 6th*, and even before the election cycle began. Some politicians in particularly were even calling for his arrest, like [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/18/democrats-trump-prosecute-2020-1366755) and [Adam Schiff](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower-schiff-newsma/treason-arrest-him-the-democratic-lawmaker-who-enrages-donald-trump-idUSKBN1WI29M).
   * I can hardly find any evidence of republicans having a widespread belief that Obama was an illegitimate president that needed to be impeached.

&amp;#x200B;

**Democrats are more inclined towards political action**

This is probably going to be my most contentious point as the other two were mostly just common knowledge, but I am of the belief that left-leaning people are generally far more inclined towards activism (and therefore riots, but only a little) than right-wingers, and this is for several reasons.(Note: finding unbiased research on this point is extremely difficult. You will never find a right-wing website saying ""yeah, we're more radical or politically violent LOL!"", nor would you find the opposite, as it would give the 'other' side too much ammo).

* Protests are a lot easier to organize in urban cities because more people will see it, more people will join and more news websites will notice. As it happens, the more urban parts of the U.S. *tend* to be more Blue than Red. So from a geographical standpoint, leftists just have better conditions for protests and host them more.
* Protests can really only work with media support, and again, most mainstream media in the U.S. are in favor of Democrats (or more commonly, very against Republicans). Even if most news websites wouldn't be consciously biased towards left-leaning protests, they are more likely to cover them in a positive light just because. Democrats know this, too.
* Political Activism in colleges has been on the rise since the 1960s, and between Black Lives Matter, Roe v Wade and the 2016 and 2020 elections, it most likely hasn't declined (some [proof](https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2018/11/05/survey-shows-role-activism-and-politics-college-decision-process) that college students are more political). As it happens, colleges are overwhelmingly liberal and have a gigantic liberal bias.
   * As an addendum to this, top news firms usually require their journalists to have impressive degrees, meaning that most of their reporters graduate from these universities. The liberal over-representation, therefore, carries over from school to jobs cleanly. More on that [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZPJpdmw3A) but this is off-topic.
* Speaking of Trump, his inaguration has energized leftist protests like no other. As mentioned before, many democrats see him as an existential threat, and when you see your sitting president as pure evil, it generally spurs you into action. You can only imagine, then, how much a *re-election* would inspire activism.
* Liberals are just [a lot more politically active on social media](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/11/05/liberal-democrats-more-likely-than-other-groups-to-be-politically-active-on-social-media/) (the world's premier mode of communication) than conservatives. This includes searching for political rallies, goading others to take political action, etc.
* During the Black Lives Matter movement (which was almost entirely peaceful!), the vast majority of Democrats were very supportive of political action and even encouraged it. While many of this could be attributed to the peaceful protests, there were plenty of examples of the opposite.
   * US Representative Maxine Waters said [protesters should get 'confrontational' if Derek Chauvin wasn't convicted](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/20/maxine-waters-urges-confrontation-if-chauvin-found-not-guilty). This is a clear threat of violence that [Nancy Pelosi went on to defend](https://www.bet.com/article/xhuirx/nancy-pelosi-defends-maxine-waters-after-criticism), even when the judge for the trial pleaded for elected officials to shut the fuck up.
   * Ayanna Presley said that there needs to be '[unrest in the streets](https://nypost.com/2020/08/16/rep-pressley-calls-for-unrest-in-the-streets-over-trump-backing-gop-members/)' regarding the riots. In her defense, this was likely not referring to riots...but when she was met with massive complaints from republicans, she made no effort to defend herself or be specific, unlike Kamala Harris.
   * Left-leaning media tended to downplay the severity or frequency of the more violent BLM riots, the best example being CNN's ""Fiery but mostly peaceful protests"" headline that they ran while a town was burning to shreds behind them due to rioters. Focus on the looting, increases crime rates and lawlessness were also reserved to right-wing media outlets.
* Overall, the sheer scale of leftist protests absolutely *dwarf* right-wing equivalents. The Black Lives Matter protests may very well have been the [biggest in the history of the United States](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html), and this is only a measure of people who were peacefully protesting on the ground; it doesn't measure the social media vitriol, nor the more-violent 'protesters'. The Black Lives Matter movement (a) has existed before now and (b) is about more than a single black person, yes, but it is still quite impressive that the overly-violent death of a random black felon was able to spawn the biggest protests and riots in U.S. history...while the Justice Department estimates that [2,500 people](https://www.npr.org/2022/01/06/1070736018/jan-6-anniversary-investigation-cases-defendants-justice) were present at the Capitol on January 6th.
   * Even if you were to use very generous estimates of 15,000 to 20,000 people, that it is *still* unbelievably small in comparison to the amount of BLM protesters that were gathering across the country practically every day for *months on end*, over an issue that is objectively less important (the decision over who gets to be president does cover literally everything after all, not just race relations). Add on to the fact that the death toll on January 6th didn't even hit the double digits and you get my point.

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize, I believe that if Trump had won the election, January 6th would be practically a footnote in that timeline. Even if we assume that ""Trump 2020 protests"" are just as big, destructive and widespread as BLM protests, that is *several orders of magnitude more extreme than the Republican response to the election*\-but it would be much worse, as the stakes are much higher. Democrats would declare the election as totally fraudulent almost immediately, there would be huge rallies calling for an immediate impeachment or re-election, social media would become so far-left it'd be unbearable, you get the point.

Change my view!

I think that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is being empowered by the shitty state of human mind in the 21st century, especially the late 2010s and the 2020s decade. 

The primary contributing factor I think is pop culture. In our culture, music, movies, etc. there is frequently imagery of idols who are to be believed and followed at every step. And it's getting worse over time with crap like TikTok and corporate greed of increasingly tighter community guidelines of every website. You know who else is such an idol? Putin. No wonder people idolize crappy politicians if their own media surrounding promotes making an idol for oneself (not being xtian here, just making a statement). 

I think that this is the ""frog boiling"" paradigm. There are plenty of microscopic events which while inconsequential, eventually accumulate to make humans gradually dumber and more degraded. And frogs don't notice how they die while they're boiled. It's easy to drive attention to 24 February 2022, but hard to drive attention to underlying processes."

People call almost everything cultural ""appropriation"" now for reasons I cannot understand.

Adopting different aspects of other cultures is not a bad thing, despite what individuals online might say about it being cultural appropriation. Culture is MEANT to be shared, meant to evolve and be integrated into your own, etc. There are obvious times when one might take an aspect of another cultural and completely disrespect it. Ex. Turning a cultural, modest article of clothing into something revealing and sexy with no understanding of the meaning and values attached to the original article. That would be an example of cultural appropriation in a bad way. 

On the other hand, if someone wants to wear something from another culture, use a name from another language (while knowing the meaning because otherwise that's embarassing), etc. We do things such as try eachothers food without a problem, why not go any further than that? What is the harm? There is a grey area where people may do something harmless (white people wearing dreadlocks), and black people finding it disrespectful because they are typically looked down on for their hairstyles. 

So in conclusion, cultural appropriation is not inherently bad. If I am misunderstanding the meaning of the word, it does not take away from the fact it is thrown around way too heavily and for things that are not bad at all."

I've seen a few people on TikTok say this and haven't heard an actual argument other than the creator just getting called ace-phobic, so I'd appreciate an actual explanation from people who think otherwise. So here's my viewpoint:

Asexual people don't really or shouldn't belong in the LGBTQ community because being only asexual doesn't change who you're attracted to or doesn't change your gender identity. A straight person shouldn't be included in the LGBTQ community just because they're not interested in sexual activity. Being asexual is more of a romantic preference. This is the same as how being only polyamorous doesn't make you part of LGBTQ. It's just a romantic preference. 

An argument I've seen is that asexual people go through the same struggles as LGBTQ members, so that's why they're included in the community. First of all, no. Nobody has gotten kicked out of their house for being asexual, there haven't been anti-asexual laws or hate crimes. Sure, they may have been told they are weird and don't belong, but its definitely not the same struggles as homosexual and transgender people face.

So yeah. Asexuals and the rest of the LGBTQ community are not the same. Being asexual shouldn't make you part of the community."

8,2022-07-18,CMV: Humanity should find a way to remove its dependence on and interaction with the environment rather than modify the environment for its own benefit.,u/ImpulsiveAbstraction,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w2fi40/cmv_humanity_should_find_a_way_to_remove_its/,changemyview,"The first question I see being asked is what I mean by “environment,” the second why I believe humans have distinguished themselves from other species that are dependent on their respective environments. 

To me, an environment is that which surrounds and interacts with a system (if you’re aware of the thermodynamics definition of system, we can equate the environment to the surroundings, which interact with the system through the system boundaries). The system in this case is the organism or a population of organisms, and the environment is the relatively stable (I.e. essentially static over timescales lasting many organism generations, or “quasi-steady state”) habitat in which those organisms reside.

What distinguishes humanity from other species (one of many things) is that it can create controlled habitats for itself over a timescale matching (or increasingly close to) its own lifespan, which is well below the natural and balancing conversion rate of the environment. Much of this creation, of course, relies on converting resources from beyond the system boundary into a form that catalyzes the “human reaction front.”

To avoid being too metaphorical, I’ll just say that I see four potential futures:

1. The human reaction front reaches a head, after which the “natural response” is an opposing stress that forces the system to reverse itself in a “ringing effect” until a new equilibrium is achieved. I personally find this view naive, though you can of course argue this point.

2. The surroundings continue “reacting” with the human front until a wholly new environment, irreversibly created, is achieved, where little of the old habitats remain and therefore many other systems are extinguished. This new environment will likely force the human species into the “removal from environment” phase, as the human reactant itself is highly reactive to the surroundings (I.e. unlivable conditions)

This is about where the metaphor breaks down 😅…

3. The human reaction front reaches “net zero“ (I.e. SUPPOSED equilibrium) though it continues slowly expanding the system boundary as new habitats are “sustainably” generated (via new technology such as genetic engineering, or perhaps some sort of “climate control”) at the expense of existing habitats/organisms.

Okay, now I’ll just throw out the metaphor altogether 🤷🏻…

4. The human species finds a way to create a circular system within the controlled conditions of its limited habitat, minimizing “reactions” with the surroundings and therefore neither expanding nor creating hostile conditions via uninhibited “spontaneous” (to bring back the thermodynamics) growth and change.

Route four to me sounds like true sustainability, both in the anthropocentric sense and preserving the steady state natural world sense. Moreover, we would be allowing ourselves time to contemplate the intricacies of natural resources before we go plunging headfirst into our “reaction front” mania.

Note: I’m really excited about the opportunity to commercialize space because each celestial body is essentially a closed system (aka as long as we isolate ourselves on Earth we will have the opportunity to plunder and colonize these barren wastelands, presumably with the same such technology that could isolate us here at home).

EDIT1: in response to the comment by u/axis_next below, which may provide some more insight into the view i'm trying to profess:

The point of the ""closed system"" bit is to halt interactions with ""mass cycles"" that are particular to earth, such as the carbon cycle or the nitrogen cycle. It does not have to be an isolated system in the sense that energy flow cannot occur. In this sense, whatever solar power is incident on the areas in which we choose to reside (preferably areas that are otherwise uninhabitable to life) is free energy. Now, determining how the absorption/dispersion of our energy is managed is a practical problem I don't feign to have answers to, but my intuition is that we could determine the means by which that energy is typically stored/reflected in like regions and focus on emulating that pattern. I am not claiming that we as a species could remove ourselves entirely from the thermodynamic progress of the universe, but I do think that we could buffer the degradation process for our particular environment.

Now, the proposition is that we should prefer the closed state to the open state, specifically #3. The difference between #3 and #4 is the appraisal of other organisms besides ourselves. I am personally of the opinion that all organisms have value to the extent that they support a robust infrastructure that promotes the flourishing of sentient life. atm, as far as I've journeyed into the realm of philosophy (more specifically, utilitarianism as put forward by Peter Singer and Mill), that implies an impartiality between agents in similar circumstances with no reasonable differences that would substantiate discriminatory treatment (now, you could argue that species divide could constitute a ""reasonable difference,"" but I'll get to this), impartiality across time (no time is preferred to another, all else being equal), and a maximization of aggregate happiness.

We ask ourselves what a maximization of aggregate happiness entails, and via the two impartialities discussed we should prefer sustainable or ""cautiously progressive"" processes (i.e. impartial to time) that support the largest range of possible interest fulfillments (impartial to the agent being fulfilled, all else being equal). This could be done via the expansion of a species that is renowned for creating ""robust"" controlled environments that could endure any forseeable catastrophe (perhaps not, as our history would tell us), or we could have ""natural cycles"" that absorb blows by morphing into different forms via evolutionary processes and diversification. Whether one is more robust than the other is a matter of debate, but I would personally put more credibility in the hands of the ""expert"" who has survived more mass extinctions (whether we are but another phase in this I do not know).

One thing seems clear to me: it is better for both the controlled environment of human settlements, expansive as they are and increasingly suitable for uninhabitable regions of space/earth and the regenerative, highly absorbent structure of ""nature"" to exist simultaneously than for one or the other to dominate. On the one hand you have the potential for the extension of life beyond the current world, and on the other you have the millions of years of modifications that have seemingly maximized (or are in the process of maximizing) the amount of ""concerted interests"" (i.e. the interests of a ridiculous number of diverse organisms living symbiotically on the same unit of land) that a world can sustain.

To value our own capacity to ""alter our environment to benefit ourselves"" above the fulfillment of interests and regenerative power we cannot currently understand seems to me at least imprudent and premature, especially considering the dearth of evidence supporting the robustness of our own uniform environment ""if done right.""

EDIT2: In response to u/DGzcarbon's comment below (indicating succinctly that ""we are the environment""), here is a clarification on environment as I see it:

I think that this distinction depends on where you draw the line. From the thermodynamics perspective I have put forth (somewhat shakily), the system-environment boundary is an arbitrary feature chosen by whomever is choosing to analyze a particular problem. If you want to be more rigorous, we could say that for any given system of many constituent parts, there are a multitude of subsystems that could each constitute a system to which the remaining portion of the initial system is an ""environment."" Hence, to any species or any organism (or indeed to any atom or any parts of atoms), any other species or organism or organic/inorganic process within the ""closed system"" of earth could represent an environment.

For the sake of argument (indeed, arguing anything at all), we must set the boundary between what we wish to study and what is influencing that piece which we have chosen. In my case, I have chosen the human species as the system in question (what I would argue follows the anthropocentric worldview of ""potential future #3), but I could also choose the entirety of the biosphere, containing whichever clusters of matter tend to exhibit the qualities of ""life,"" ""sentience,"" or ""interest."" By this (indeed arbitrary, though perhaps more reasonable than other segregations) selection, we home in on ""that which matters or can generate 'what matters'"""
0,2022-07-18,"CMV: Neither Heterosexual Men nor Heterosexual Women Have an ""Advantage"" in Dating",u/bluepillarmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w2fkar/cmv_neither_heterosexual_men_nor_heterosexual/,changemyview,"I often times see people make posts suggesting that because of ""feminism"" or because of social media women now have an advantage to dating in heterosexual relationships.  I'm not quite sure why people think this is so.  It has something to do with Tinder and with women being more picky about partners and preferring taller men.  Do I have that right?

If so, this is nothing new.  Women have likely always been pickier because of the possibility of pregnancy which makes choosing a partner a far more serious decision.  While we're on that topic, I think it's safe to say that the fact that women can get pregnant and men cannot is a pretty serious disadvantage that women have when casually dating.  

I do not believe that men have it easier either, however.  A lot of women will complain that ""there are no good men"" or that it's generally hard to find a man to commit.  This is also false.  Yes, there are plenty of man-children who are obsessed with increasing the number of one-night stands they have or who don't want to settle down but there are plenty more that are mature and capable of providing emotional support.  

And while we're on that subject there are also lots of women who are shallow gold-diggers but there are many more that are not, who are intelligent and caring and who are overall great partners.  

I think that people who complain about not being able to find a partner should stop whining and try doing something new.  It's not the easiest thing in the world to do but there is no cause for a straight person to be bitter unless then have suffered some kind of serious abuse which is a different subject entirely.  

Anyway, I rest my case.  Neither straight men, nor straight women have any kind of dating advantage.  

Change my view."

It would be nice if it was another section with ropes, bands, bosu balls, and all that, but I actually can't use because of how i was born. I know it sounds petty and it is because of probably how little it takes out my account, but it does seem like it's unfair to take a bit of space that lots of the population can't use, and on top of that, me having to still pay the same price as women at the gym, even though they get an extra facility. At the minimum, there should at least be a discount for being a guy, and not that it's braking my bank, but just out of principalities.

Edit: So there seems to be confusion on my reasoning behind the ""why"" in my view, and it was that while everyone has to pay the same base rate, I can't use the same facilities as the others who didn't have to pay a premium. I understand completely if it was like those classes in the gym, but those require a payment. I also fully understand the reasoning for women only sections, as i think lots of guys acting weird/creepy, and I'm not saying these are invalid and that i should be able to use the women's section. I'm just stating that I believe that if everyone is paying the same price, there should be no free premium sections besides maybe a kids section. Being mixed as well as my dad, there have been rude racial remarks in the past, although seldom, but I wouldn't think there should be a POC section of the gym.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2: So i think there is a lot of confusion or maybe people aren't reading my post and only the title. My point is that there is a section of the gym i can't use because of how I am born and something i can't change, while other patreons can use it while we both pay the same price. My harp isn't about getting the cheapest membership, it's about being able to not fully use a facility and equipment while an other member who pays the exact same as me gets to have extra space and equipment"

I think their anger is correct but pointing it at political  problems is futile and they would be better off pointing it at human nature. Every country in the world has crimes, corruption, a rich upper class, social inequality, etc. You can make the argument that it would be lessened if everyone was forced to be equitable (such as higher taxes, bigger social safety nets, higher regulations, etc.) but that would just lead to more bureaucracy, which leads to more corruption, which leads to more greed/selfishness.

You can never get rid of it. It's like a river passing through a rock; it just gets diverted for a while before it returns back to normal. Now, obviously, doing *something* rather than nothing is certainly preferable, but I think we could make more progress if we were all just more honest with ourselves. We all hate billionaires but you would be stupid not to trade wealth with them. If we accept our limitations and not try to fight human nature, I think genuine progress could be made."

Increasing taxes on the billionaires, while it should still happen, won't make a difference in the social policies put in place because money isn't the issue... corruption and lobbying powers who influence where the dollars actually go is the issue. 

If taxes increased in the wealthy, I believe the extra money would be used to just continue to do more of what we're already doing which is cutting social programs and having legislation that appeals to the largest and most powerful lobbying groups. CMV."

For example, assuming the State Department designated Singapore ""D"" and an American citizen ignores the warning and moves to Singapore for employment and at some later point arrested for smuggling chewing gum into the country (In the past one could receive a year in prison and $5,500 fine for '[smuggling chewing gum](https://web.archive.org/web/20180930225032/http://www.chewinggumfacts.com/chewing-gum-facts/chewing-gum-in-singapore/)') the U.S. government should not interfere. 

While it is vital that the U.S. government protect its citizens abroad, that protection should have limits to promote personal responsibility AND respect for other nation's customs and traditions. Americans visiting foreign countries are expected to follow the laws of the host nation but if they are merely visitors (business or pleasure) the U.S. government SHOULD come to their aid if they are caught up in any sort of prosecution and/or detention circumstance. But if a U.S. citizen becomes a resident of that foreign country (buys/rents a home, has a job, and pays taxes) they should not be able to rely on the U.S. government to bail them out if they run afoul of the law or a corrupt government official. 

Finally, if a Foreign Sovereign has been identified by the State Department with a ""D"" risk indicator and a U.S. citizen ignores the warning and travels to the country as a tourist (business or pleasure) AND they are wrongfully detained, the U.S. Government SHOULD attempt to intervene but they should not go to extreme measures (prisoner exchange, etc) to free the U.S. citizen who ignored their warnings."
0,2022-07-19,Interstellar would have been a better movie with a bleak ending,u/Poo-et,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w2vx48/interstellar_would_have_been_a_better_movie_with/,changemyview,"So before I start, I note that this criticism comes from a place of love. Interstellar is my favourite film.

...but it's not a perfect film.

I think the ending is a ""ex machina aliens fix everything"" situation. All of the setup of humanity's struggle, the response of various people, Mann's betrayal, Professor Brand's lie, Murph's anger, Cooper's carefully planned sacrifice and other well written character developments were made irrelevant by magic 5d humans living in black holes. Importantly, the problems don't need to be resolved to be concluded satisfyingly, they just need to make a cohesive narrative about the fates of these characters. 

Cooper saving everyone while being alive inside a black hole that he then somehow escapes from diminishes his sacrifice and his relationship with Dr. Brand.

Professor Brand lying about the black hole equations is diminished by the answer being ""lol aliens"" and humanity's resource problems subsequently being resolved happily ever after. He's just a misguided fool rather than the only man who sees what's coming. 

Murph magically getting closure while simultaneously saving humanity through the power of time traveling dust morse makes her anger look childish and shortsighted.

Mann's entire character arc to betrayal becomes a whole lot less meaningful when his betrayal ended up not having any effect on anything at all.

Here's my proposal for how it should have gone:

The film proceeds identically until Cooper ejects into the black hole. The story shifts to the perspective of Dr. Brand, who desperately tries to navigate back to earth while feeling hopeless and having an existential crisis. She has a flashback to her romantic feelings for Edmund before he left which gives her motivation. Upon returning, she finds Earth on the brink of destruction. A small group of survivors are sheltering in the dilapidated space center, including an elderly Murph who seems distant and apathetic. Dr. Brand tries to persuade the group to get resources together for a trip to the planet the expedition passed up on due to Mann's falsified data, but the survivors are resentful following discovering Professor Brand's lie. Eventually, Dr. Brand manages to get the resources together for a one way trip, along with approximately half of the survivors, not including Murph. The film ends with a scene of the ship landing on the new planet whose hospitality is ambiguous. 

Here's why I think it's an improvement:

 * Whether Cooper's choice was right is a more nuanced dilemma. He saved more people, but not everyone, and at the sacrifice of his relationship with his daughter. This is the story Interstellar tries to tell with the (exceptionally well written) years of messages scene, but ends up mitigating. His sacrifice becomes more meaningful because it was a genuine sacrifice and not just objectively the right choice.
 * Mann's betrayal has a larger impact on the fate of humanity while still dooming him. A more horrifying conclusion than just ""Mann fails to achieve anything and then suicides""
 * Dr. Brand experiences hopelessness after Cooper's sacrifice but finds motivation in the romantic feelings she had for Edmund - a more believable interpretation of the power of love than the actual ending.
 * See the real impact Professor Brand's lie about the equation had on the people on earth, providing a more satisfying conclusion to his arc. It's a way more interesting conclusion that he's the only one who understood what was coming rather than he's just a goofy old man who didn't want people to worry.
 * A more thematically fitting ending - a movie about the bleakness and uncompromisingness of physics.
 * No Deus Ex aliens

I'd love to have my view changed."

Thing is, whenever you’re dealing with others, you’ll probably make a mistake at some point.

For example, in a workplace, you could have people of different races that are polite and professional with each other, but if they’re afraid of making a mistake, they could easily stick to purely surface-level conversation (and would be afraid to joke, offend, share anything deep, and so on).

So, instead of shunning mistakes and having just cordial/polite relationships, without ever getting into real (and potentially offensive topics), I think it’s best to embrace a mindset of “imperfectly woke” so to speak, listening to feedback as you go, and in doing so, a truly authentic relationship can form.

And, I think it’ll actually help society in the long-run to encourage people to make mistakes of wokeness. Sure, there will be mistakes at first, but mistakes in a relationship is far better than no relationship at all."

I’ve worked in the automotive industry my entire career to date with cars designed in the 2000s and 2010s.

For me, a car is meant to be enjoyed for the driving experience - the feel of the connection of driver to road through 4 wheels.

2010-onwards has seen a rise in screens and tech gimmicks in cars that are not just distracting, but permanent - they don’t hide away when not in use.

I feel that a lot of money now is spent on making the tech in the cabin, such as screens, options and fancy drive shifters, more appealing to buyers - at the expense of quality of parts and driving experience, while still driving the price of the car much higher.

It’s not just mass-market either - supercars are the same. For example, the last brilliant Lamborghini (in my opinion) was the original Murcielago. Yes, it had a screen, but it was small, out of the way, and so low-def it wouldn’t be much use beyond music. It looked hidden and out of place, like it hadn’t really been thought about until the last minute.

As such, the focal point for the driver was the road ahead, and the experience of driving.
As for the Aventador, the screen is in the middle of the dash, surrounded by a ridiculously complex centre console - the tech has invaded the experience.

Might just be me with an old-man mindset, but I’m interested to hear what you guys think."

How many feet are there in a mile? Which is greater: 5.5 pints, 94 fluid ounces, or 3 quarts? How many square yards are there in an acre? 

At the very least, most people would fumble a bit before seriously answering any of these questions. Maybe even use a calculator or reference guide. At worse, some people would not try or be able to answer some of these questions. 

The Imperial System is obviously very clumsy and confusing to use even for Americans. This is the reason why the United States of America should finally stop using the Imperial System of measurement. To be fair, there are two other countries that also use the Imperial System, and they are Liberia and Myanmar (Burma). 


These three countries should instead use the Metric System. The Metric System is superior to the Imperial System for three reasons. 

First, the Metric System is simple to understand. The simplicity of a base 10 system of measurement, such as the Metric System, makes it extremely easy to understand especially when dealing different scales of measures, such as meters versus kilometers. For example, it is obvious that 100 meters is 1/10 of a kilometer. No serious thinking is necessary. 

Second, calculations in the Metric System are also easier. This is probably why most researchers, doctors, and scientists use the Metric System even in the United States. For example, which is greater: 989 grams, 1.1 kilograms, or 1 million milligrams? How many meters are there in a kilometer? How many milliliters are there in 1.25 liters? 

Third, the Metric System is the international standard. This is probably the most important reason. Car manufacturers already realized that having similar parts in different measurements for different countries was a waste of resources, so all cars are now built using the Metric System for redundancy eliminations and cost reductions. Furthermore, all goods exported outside of the United States have to be label in metrics, or else they can not be sold. N.A.S.A. actually lost a $125 million dollar spacecraft, called the Mars Climate Orbiter, over the planet Mars, because one team was using the Metric System and another team was using the Imperial System. That was a very costly mistake that could have been avoided if everyone in the world used the same system of measurement. Since over 90% of the world uses the Metric System, it is by default the international standard. 


The Metric System has been proven to be far superior than the Imperial System, so why hasn't the United States of America converted? I believe it is NOT because Americans are afraid of the Metric System, but rather Americans are concerned over how painful the conversion process would be. In the long term, I believe the benefits and cost savings to convert to the Metric System would greatly offset the short term inconveniences. 

As a result, the United States of America should finally and completely stop using the Imperial System of measurement for the Metric System that has been proven to be simpler to understand, easier to calculate, the international standard, and reduce redundancies, errors, and costs."

The long of it is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w31pmd/cmv_society_needs_to_accept_that_minors_are/igvt1a5?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3). I need to go to bed, and I have a busy day tomorrow, so I will not be replying to any more replies. Thanks everyone who replied, even if this all turned into a giant mess.

Before I get into the meat of my view, I need to clarify how I am defining minors vs children. Children are individuals who have not yet entered puberty. Minors are any individuals who are underage. All children are minors, but not all minors are children. In this view I am presenting and discussing, I am specifically **excluding** children. So when I say “minors”, I am not including or referring to *children*; I am referring to teenagers and tweenagers. **I will not engage anyone who isn’t acknowledging this**, because in my experience things devolve into pointless arguing over semantics. I am not here to argue over how I’m using these words. 

Okay, it’s view time now. 

Minors look at adult content on the internet. This is not an opinion, it is objective fact. I did it, my friends did it, and people are still doing it. It is inevitable, especially in an age where people are getting their own personal devices with an internet connection at increasingly younger ages. 

People need to stop sticking their heads in the sand when this comes up. Teenagers and tweenagers are not innocent pure children, and refusing to acknowledge that they have sexual desires and look at stuff online to the point of accusing people who do acknowledge this of being pedophiles (which has actually happened to me) continues to project the very harmful message that sex, in any form or feeling, is something wrong and to be ashamed of. 

Since I’m sure this will come up, yes, I am aware that there are a lot of legal issues surrounding minors looking at adult content. Frankly, they’re outdated and something that needs to be addressed. Legally, there is no difference between a minor and a child, and for most things I don’t consider this to be an issue. However, I do believe that this needs to be changed in regards to minors willingly viewing publically available adult content. However, this is a much more complicated discussion that would require legal knowledge I don’t have, but more importantly, it isn’t something that is even possible to have a discussion on when people refuse to acknowledge that it happens.

Edit 1: In answer to people saying, **“This is accepted and not really a controversial statement, what are you actually trying to argue here?”**, firstly, I’m very glad to hear that you think this is an obvious, normal fact of life. Honestly, I think everyone knows this deep down. That’s not what I mean by accepting it though. Accepting this as a normal thing means not completely shutting down when it comes up, not labelling anyone who wants to discuss it as a creep, and not spouting complete denial. All of these are common reactions I’ve gotten from offhandedly making reference to this “normal fact of life”.

If you specifically want something a bit more concrete to play with, then I would also present this view as “Minors consuming adult content should be acknowledged and ~~normalized~~³ destigmatized.”

Edit 2: When I say ""adult content"", I am not just referring to pornography. I am referring to any sexual media, including: porn, hentai, erotic literature, erotic fanfiction, erotic webcomics, etc.

Edit 3: It has come to my attention that I have been using the word “normalize” incorrectly. I, in fact, do not want minors looking at adult content to be normalized, that would be bad. The word I was looking for was “destigmatized”."

I could go murder my neighbors right now and I'll have a better quality of life than a lot of our war veterans, I'll have better diet than people who work their asses off trying to make rent, I'll have it absolutely made. 

And to make this clear, I'm not taliking about doing stuff like this to anyone who did not involve violence in their crime. If you stole a car whatever, jails fine I guess (even though theres no excuse) but theft doesn't (usually) cause physical harm.

What I'm talking about is people like the guy in West Brookfield MA who broke into a house and murdered a family, including toddlers. Im taliing about the Fogles, the Weinsteins, the Dahmers, and like that.

I think it is BEYOND disgusting that people who have PROVEN they don't care about human rights receive them. The fact that rapists get fed is honestly vomit inducing, like typing this Im literally shaking.

Explain why, WHY people like that, who rape women, murder children, etc deserve to eat. Really, someone convince me because I hate being this angry all the time. But its impossible not to be. I'm not a criminal, I work my ass off, and sometimes I dunno if Im gonna be able to eat for a day or so til my check comes in. If I was a piece of shit murderer I'd never have to worry about it again though.

And I don't want to hear that prison is a bad place to be. I've never been in prison, I've been inside them though. The fuckin inmates are all jumping around, yelling, eating their snacks, getting the drugs that are so god damn easy to get in prison, they arent out of society, they aren't locked away, they're just in another society where its very possible to actually have fun and whatnot as efficiently as it was on the outside.

Just explain to me why the life of a violent criminal (I'm gonna call em VCs for the rest of the post) is worth anyhthing at all. Once proven with DNA or other irrefutable evidence, why do they get kept alive and fed with food and money that could go to bettering a low income area or something instead of keeping people alive just so they can contribute absulutely nothing to anything. About 10 billion of us now, we'll be fine without the fucking VCs.

The only reason a VC shouldnt be treated like the rabid animal they are is that there isn't enough evidence to be sure its them who did it, in which case the case (ha) should just get thrown on with the thousands of other unsolved cases every year. But in a situation like say with Dahmer where his apartments filled with corpses, just put a fucking .22 in the base of his skull and throw the corpse in a fuckin grinder like the one they use for dead cows. I'm serious, I do not, do NOT, understand why just being a homo sapien makes you special. If you of your own free will killed someone, raped someone, hurt a child, then you do NOT deserve another chance, PERIOD. Theres at least 10 million people who can do everything you can do without needing to be fixed. And that last sentence is true for all of us. If I die right now someone else gets my spot at work and the world keeps turning.

Now theres a few things I know are gonna be said so I'll just end off by arguing them now. 1 - ""Well an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind, killing killers is bad"" - No, maybe that was true 1000 years ago but we've got these neat things called safety glasses now. A system can absolutely be put in place to just throw the scum away where it belongs. And again, the VC has proven human rights mean nothing to them, so don't waste effort giving it to them.

2 - Things about false imprisonment. As I said before if there isn't enough evidence to be sure then just toss it on with all the other unsolved shit. And you know what? I bet both my nuts and my next 4 paychecks that if a judge who wrongly sentenced someone actually went to jail for it, there'd be no more false imprisonments tomorrow.

And finally, just one more thing to add that I know absolutely no one will agree with but I believe it 100%. I think that VCs, if we aren't going to kill them, should absolutely be used for medical experimentation. Someone rapes a kid? Cool, lock him up, give him AIDs, and see what it takes to cure it. Beat someone to death? I'm sure theres some new kinda of ways to mend bones and stuff, take that VC and break his bones and see what it takes to fix them.

And I guess the bottom line is this. If you have these bad, sexual, violent, etc urges and you go talk to someone about it and get yourself on medication fo rit and don't hurt anyone, then you are a perfectly good and functional member of society. But the moment you cross that line I don't even consider you a person anymore. Look at it this way. The thing that makes us special, above all the other animals is we can think, we don't need to act on our base urges, its more than stimulus and response. So the moment you act on those base urges like a regular animal, you should be treated like one. If a bear goes on a rampage through a suburb and destroys property and stuff, that bears gonna get shot. Why should  ahuman who does that be any different, I just don't get it.

Alright last paragraph for real. I know I got kinda ranty and all that so I probably stumbled around points more than I meant to but yeah. Why the fuck is Harvey weinstein alive and safe. Why is Jared Fogle alive and safe? They will never be able to contribute anything to this society that a million other, non child raping people couldn't to themselves."

But she didn’t and competed on the men’s team for 3 years where she was not a stand out athlete and pretty average. But then for one year she competes in the women’s team where she dominates and gets nominated over every single other woman at the school? How and why?

In my country, student debt is interest free indefinitely, meaning if you borrow 20000$, that's the amount that you have to pay back over however long you want and if you die, it's written off. Nothing more or less. 
Some people think interest free debt is okay to accumulate when you account for inflation and wages go up but the student loan remains the same. 

I think interest free loans are a terrible idea nonetheless because it's money that you could have to spend on food or savings going out of your paycheck. 
That's really all my reasons"

0,2022-07-19,CMV: Smoking cannabis is more harmful to your health than vaping nicotine,u/I_Am_An_AltAccount69,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w39siq/cmv_smoking_cannabis_is_more_harmful_to_your/,changemyview,"Before I explain my reasoning, a disclaimer. I am making this statement as a very frequent and heavy cannabis consumer. I doubt I will ever not love cannabis. I also am not a nicotine user and I don't particularly like vaping. The only form of nicotine I consume is cigarettes on rare occasions (a few times a year for special occasions). Also, NONE OF WHAT I AM SAYING APPLIES TO ANYTHING BESIDES PURE CANNABIS FLOWER AND PURE NICOTINE PRODUCTS WITH NO OTHER TOXIC ADDITIVES LIKE JUUL, NOTHING I AM SAYING APPLIES TO CIGARETTES OR ANY OTHER FORM OF NICOTINE USE. I AM ALSO NOT SAYING THAT NICOTINE USE AS A WHOLE IS LESS DAMAGING THAN SMOKING CANNABIS, BECAUSE WHAT I AM SAYING ONCE AGAIN APPLIES ONLY TO REGULATED VAPE PRODUCTS. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH VITAMIN E ACETATE. 

I recently learned that nicotine and any vape products that contain no toxic additives have not been linked with any cancer or death risk despite numerous studies. Ofc there have been many vaping deaths but those are the result of toxic additives like Vitamin E acetate that are not present in regulated vape products like Juul. With that in mind, the most significant health risks from vaping (as far as I can tell) are:

* Cardiovascular issues in the long term from nicotine raising your blood pressure
* Respiratory irritation and resulting conditions like COPD and asthma (note that this effect is much less than the corresponding risks with inhaling smoke)
* Potential mental health and anxiety issues (I am barely considering this in the comparison because the same goes for cannabis. It's a very complicated and varied issue). 
* Physical dependency

Meanwhile, it seems like more and more reports on the toxic effects of cannabis are surfacing. I think a lot of this is due in part to the massive increases in the potency of cannabis plants over the past few decades. Cannabis addiction, both in terms of physical withdrawal symptoms and psychological dependence, is also something that more and more people are reporting. Also, the airway irritation from smoking cannabis is much worse than with both vaped nicotine and vaped cannabis. All of these findings have been corroborated in studies. In terms of the severity of withdrawal, it's really hard to say and changes from person to person. 

So what are your thoughts? To be clear, this is a hypothesis and not necessarily my actual beliefs. But I think with vaping nicotine being generally more stigmatized than smoking cannabis (this pretty much goes for every route of administration for both), the question is worth asking. What do you think? I'm expecting to be downvoted a lot simply because the general social stigma in America disagrees with this post, but I really am looking for feedback/discussion."

the last three houses I've lived in, I've chosen for the lovely outdoors space (patio that gets sun at the right time of day etc, nice lawn) only to discover on moving in I can't sit there without being disturbed by the neighbourhood cats.

The lovely flower bed I planted with my toddler was abandoned because random cat kept digging in it and depositing poo. Thats not a safe place for my children to learn about gardening. cat faeces carries toxins. and no, it wasnt a fox, we saw the cat do it. 

last night woken at 3am by two cats having screeching match out in my back yard. lasted 30 mins. these are not wild cats, they have collars, but there's no way I'm getting close enough to touch them. probably get scratched to pieces. 

my parents have had similar issues - they loved their birdfeeder and watching the birds in their little garden. then next door neighbours move in with (I kid you not) 4 cats. no more birds for my parents to watch as the cats got everywhere, just dead birds on the ground on regular basis. they moved house eventually as they'd had enough, and talking to the neighbours achieved nothing (cat lovers totally oblivious to how selfish their behaviour was)

so why is it even legal for someone's pet to enter your property????

surely a true cat lover understands that a rural home is most suitable for a cat. less concrete, lots of space for cat to explore, and hunt for mice etc without crossing into other peoples properties. "

I won't say he's the love of my life bc he's not. He's amazing and cool but I've never met him in person so I have no idea how this is going to go, rent is 450 at an apartment I've been eyeing and with my other paycheck I'd have $2.2k.

Honestly I'm kinda banking on this thing with this guy not panning out. All I want is a new and fucking drastic change to my life. I'm way more than willing to make ends meet when I get there and I am going to get the apartment first and pay for the first three months while I get a job.

I just want to change everything about my life in a second. I've lived in the same old tiny dusty town my entire life. I'm selling all my old clothes and things I don't need or can't take there. And I'm packing all the stuff I want into my car for when I move bc I'll be driving the whole way there (16ish hours). 

When I get there I plan on putting down a deposit and three months rent so I can look for a job or doordash until I get one. And use the rest of my money for utilities, car insurance, and food. As well as just applying for a secured credit card and using it only to buy my YouTube premium to build up credit (always paying in full).

I'm trying to move to Springfield Illinois so if anyone has any tips for keeping cost of living way the heck down pls lmk in the comments or dm me.

I know it sounds stupid but I don't think it's dumb to move across the country with only 2k in my pockets to make it somewhere completely foreign.

Edit p2: we've been together for four months and he has been exhibiting bad emotional instability but unfortunately I bond greater to people like that (my therapist said it's because I want to help them and it reminds me of home)
He usually doesn't text me often and when I got upset by that he sighted he wanted to play games, which if is understandable because it's the only place he's ever received praise from. But I have tried to express that it hurts to be disregarded like that. Tbh the more I explain this the less I understand why I like him so much, I think I'm just craving a emotional connection I'm not sure.

Also it's always been, I have to come see him. Even though he knows my financial situation and he always boasts about having 12k in the bank but he always said he didn't have the money to come see me."

If the enemy in the opposite trench shoots in the wrong direction I am going to do everything I can to convince him he shot in the right one or that he hit me. He will feel good, like he is the best sniper that ever existed, he will feel a dopamine rush and might even think about aiming in that direction again to catch another soldier. He feels proud and confident, but I'm making a fool out of him. Altruism is making other people's interests so they better incentivize that.

There is a problem with altruism though, which is that most people are only altruists towards people they have connections with. The solution would be not just to praise altruism, but to do so especially when towards total strangers, the more disinterested, the better. If you incentivize interested altruism, the chances of a random person helping you are low. But if you incentivize people to help total strangers, they increase. The more disconnected a society is, the more we should see people praising random acts of kindness.

While I do value altruism and think it's of crucial importance, I also think there's no reason to put it higher on an objective hierarchy of values, if there even is one. It's on the same level as egocentric behavior, it's just not smart to incentivize the latter.

1,2022-07-20,"CMV: Dobbs has pushed the decision of abortion down to the states. At the core, the states will need to make a definition of “Personhood”. Attempts to do this will push their laws into unconstitutional territory with respect to the first amendment.",u/paigeguy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w3qmrt/cmv_dobbs_has_pushed_the_decision_of_abortion/,changemyview,"To understand this, I start with Roe. Prior to Dobbs, (although not explicit) the age at which a fetus becomes a Child of Law was 23ish weeks - COL23ish. This was based on viability of the fetus at that age.  It was a balance between the rights of a woman to decide, and the rights of the fetus to live. This is effectively what people refer to as Personhood.

States that prohibit abortion (with or without exceptions) would be defining a new Child of the Law to be at week 0 - COL0. ProLife slogans like “Life begins at Conception” and “Abortion is Murder” Show the reason and motivation for these beliefs.

For Roe, a COL was set based on the viability of the fetus - 23ish weeks. For states that outlaw all abortions (with or without exceptions), The COL is set at week zero - COL0 based on ?

I contend that the basis for this is a religious belief, and it will run afoul with the 1st Amendment.

*Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,* *or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.*

I read the first part as - you are free to exercise your religious beliefs, but you are prohibited from putting those religious beliefs into Law.

My definition of religion is broad and could be summed up as “if it walks like a duck, looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it is a duck”. Another would be: religion is a set of beliefs - organized or individual - that help people understand their place in the world (universe), and how they should act, and what to strive for”.

Religion has been put into law in minor ways.  It just gets fiddled into law without any opposition.  But defining Personhood to magically happen at the moment of conception is a BIG time religious belief. It opens the door wide open for other religious beliefs - marriage laws, sexual identity laws, racial laws. AND, it applies not just to the people who hold those beliefs, but also to everyone that doesn’t hold those beliefs.

Sad thing is that it would ultimately be the Supreme Court that decides this and I’m sure they can figure out some contrived reasoning that this is not religion.

Edit: Personhood is a term used by pro life advocates because they see an embryo as a person.  And they want laws to be made to protect that new person. This isn't a discussion about when this happens, its a discussion about what happens when the Law (state, federal, local) ends up defining this. That's why is use the phrase ""Child in the eyes of the law"" - or, By law, this embryo is now a human child and can be protected."

My argument is that intelligence on its own is not that important and that a large bank of knowledge should be more respected and claim the social status that intelligence does.

I accept the argument that an intelligence would likely make someone take in knowledge faster and with less stress, however is irrelevant to the original statement as that would involve a combination of intelligence and knowledge whereas the original statement is to explore intelligence without knowledge.

Examples

A child genius from a poor country exists, his iq is incredible, without any knowledge such as an education system he is as useless as all the other kids around him and will likely grow up to be useless.

The smartest person from 1000 years ago doesn't have the same knowledge as an average intelligence person today, if you left both of them to start a civilisation the modern day average intelligence person is likely to be more successful. I respect that there would be a point of dumbness where the intelligent ancient person would be able to be more successful. I'm not quite sure where that line would be though."
11,2022-07-20,CMV: It is not unreasonable or rude to cancel invites/data/meet-ups where someone 'brings a friend(s)' for what was supposed to be a one-on-one.,u/theif519,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w3rlj7/cmv_it_is_not_unreasonable_or_rude_to_cancel/,changemyview,"I'm asking this because I often see expectation that ""decent"" guys ~~(biologically male)~~ will understand and accept that a girl ~~(biologically female)~~ will ask to invite friends to a date at a the last minute. ~~I use 'biological male/female' here because I do not see this thrown around for non-binary or transgendered men/women, so I have no idea if it applies to them as well.~~

&amp;#x200B;

The scenario is that you are interested in someone, and you two get along well enough, and you decide to meet up with each other. At some point, maybe immediately, maybe literally the day-of the date, the other persons states that they have a friend or even multiple friends that want to tag along. It could be a romantic date, a platonic invite, a sexual casual meet-up, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally only am able to confidently interact with people one-on-one, and in groups I tend to be more passive and easily overwhelmed. In large enough groups, there is so much going on that is becomes impossible for me to *not* get drained from the interaction within the first 5 to 10 minutes. I will not enjoy myself in a group, so I know that I will not waste my time with it. The other person has every right to decline the meetup if I decline their willingness to add more people to the meet-up, but I don't see it as 'rude' unless it literally is the day-of or otherwise extremely short notice.  Why is it considered rude/unreasonable/indecent to not want to hang out with someone only wants to hang out in groups? I'll always do what is best for myself, so I will turn it down regardless, but why is there a social stigma around turning this down?

&amp;#x200B;

I understand from their perspective, it can be out of safety, but I'd still show up alone so basically it shifts the 'safety' the power balance to their side (extreme examples, but imagine they bring their very fit MMA-fighter-looking older brother who is eyeing my up the whole time, or they have a hypervigilant friend that is looking for every 'red flag' in the book to 'disqualify' me and think on the behalf of the person I am trying to meetup and get to know). So they feel safer because they have the power and I am supposed to use handle that. I do not mind just meeting in public, arriving and departing independently, but sometimes even then some people will *insist* on bringing other people. Why is it said that a 'decent' guy has to 'accept and understand' this situation? It seems more like something a *doormat* would do, and I refuse to be that way.

&amp;#x200B;

Change My View: Is it that, despite how I feel (uncomfortable about the situation, unsafe being the only person in a group of the other person's friends), that it is rude and ill-mannered to turn down a date that has been altered at the last minute?"

Breaking Bad. Better Call Saul. Scarface. The Sopranos. 

There are many great American movies and shows that depict corporate-like organized crime. It is my belief that this is not how it works, at least in the United States.


In the United States, if you get caught even selling a small portion of drugs, your life is over. In the movies, you see these heads of these criminal organizations, and they carry themselves like typical CEOs. They wear suits and they appear to be very intelligent and well-versed in business practices. 

But someone that intelligent knows about risk versus reward. Someone that intelligent has the capacity to get a legitimate job, making legitimate money. 

Yes, there are crime organizations in the US. Even ones that can be called organized. But in my opinion, the personnel in these organizations are not competent enough to do legitimate business. Therefore, people who participate in criminal businesses like drug trafficking/dealing, are typically not very intelligent. Because if they were, they would understand a simple concept of risk versus reward. And then they would quickly determine that it is absolutely not worth the risk to do that job.

Not to mention the war on drugs which I totally disagree with. But nonetheless, the USA, the richest country in the world, dedicates an insane amount of money to the war on drugs. Federal agents and law-enforcement have an abundance of resources, all dedicated to catching drug dealers. And there’s this misconception that the DEA does not care about small time dealers. That’s not true at all. If they get a tip that someone is selling drugs, even if it’s a small amount, they will absolutely execute a search warrant. Even if they find a small amount, they consider that a win. And they have nearly unlimited money to do so.

Anyone with average intelligence would know this and was not even consider getting into the illegal drug trade. Therefore, I believe that people who get into the illegal drug trade are either stupid or addicted to drugs themselves. This caricature of a suit and tie drug dealer like Gus Fring is a fantasy. And if you disagree with me, please find me a real life scenario where someone like Gus Fring actually existed.

Also, I find the, “you don’t know of any real life Gus Frings because they don’t get caught” argument to be weak and lazy.

But I believe we should approach it in a different way. 

For children and teenagers, the struggles that adults see as small and insignificant, but can hold a much higher weight in the minds of children and teenagers. 

Children and teenagers can be depressed or be anxious over smaller things than adults do. As we grow older, we become more capable human beings, and we learn to deal with more difficult challenges in life. So the insignificant small conflicts from our youth, we learn to ignore, because we learned to broaden our horizon, and focus on the big picture of life.

The concept of the big picture of life, which I believe is something only can be sensed through experience, not be taught, simply is not ingrained in their minds.  For example, for many teenagers, high school means the world to them, most of their interactions with the outside world is there, and to them, grades mean life and death. To children, not getting play time is like a prison sentence. 

I think as grownups, we all looked back on it, cringing: ""Why did we get so upset over these insignificant things?"" 

Many people, looking back on it, tell their children that their feelings don't matter, or loosing a friend in school is as significant as loosing a penny, or anything in school is not worth getting depressed about, etc... Is pure ignorance.

Somethings, no matter how much you teach someone, they will never understand until they are put into that position. I think adults should be focused on solving the issue at hand though reasoning and emotional support, not by ignoring and shutting down any type of struggles as invalid."

My male friends, pissing while sitting is superior to pissing while standing. Here is why:

\- Pressure does not build up in your dick, and anything under its flight path will be hit, so you will very likely hit the front edge of your toilet if you piss while standing. Sitting negates this problem.

\- If you have held it for long enough, it can become difficult to control, so piss inconsistency and going too high is very likely.

\- If you suffer from bad aim, you know what happens :d

\- Dispersion: When you piss while standing, your piss will likely still hit outside of the toilet even if you aim perfectly, due to splash damage and your piss is anything but a laser, you might have hits from anywhere within the area of 1ft from the centre of the main piss stream.

\- When you get a boner, good luck aiming down.

On the topic of reproductive rights I think a huge issue that is often missed is paternity fraud, depending on statistics, [the rate of paternity fraud is approximately 3.7% according to this study](https://guardian.ng/features/rising-paternity-fraud-as-metaphor-for-dysfunctional-society/) there are about 130 million babies born in the the world each year meaning approximately 4.8 million babies are born into a paternity fraud situation each year.
In the US there are [3.66 million births each year](https://out.reddit.com/t3_w44a36?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prb.org%2Farticles%2Fu-s-births-increased-in-2021-but-dont-call-it-a-comeback%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DBeth%2520Jarosz%26text%3DPreliminary%2520data%2520from%2520the%2520National%2Cto%25203.61%2520million%2520in%25202020&amp;token=AQAAzf7YYlv54LdohWohnAjbjqjMeX_-2wjfTFOu283UsrvMjL_A&amp;app_name=ios)
Meaning approximately 135,000 each year.

The birth certificate legalese should ascertain that, if the mother cannot reliably name the father, she should leave the father’s name blank and be required to carry out a paternity test until the biological father is confirmed. If she names someone without certainty and it turns out wrong, she should be charged with fraud especially if she was receiving child support and a harsher punishment if the act was intentional."

0,2022-07-21,CMV: It doesn't make sense that the average moviegoer likes or hates a movie because of its writing.,u/arcade_of_truths,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w488yd/cmv_it_doesnt_make_sense_that_the_average/,changemyview,"This post assumes that the average moviegoer does not have or know about the movie's script and its precise contents, which I believe to be a fair assumption. All statements made hereafter assume this, but you are free to discuss this assumption if you find to be unfair. Anyway...

A lot of people give great weight to a movie's writing when discussing what impact the movie as a whole left on them (whether it be positive/negative). You see it here on Reddit's various film subreddits, Rotten Tomatoes, Letterboxd, etc. I used to think like this too - that I liked the characters in a movie, the worldbuilding, the dialogue, and so on.

But when I immersed myself a bit more in media and studying about my favorite films, I eventually realized and had to concede that writing is just a skeleton to the meat that a movie provides... Like sure, screenwriters create these wonderful ideas that the rest of the production crew grasp and attempt to bring to life. But therein lies the problem, there is basically nothing in a film that is purely a screenwriter's work - that would suggest to the audience the strength of a film's writing - since it is manifested through other aspects of a film that aren't really ""writing"".

Let's look at a movie's characters, for instance. While the screenwriter had a vision for how this character would ideally be, it's mostly still the director who chooses the actors, and those actors would be the one to execute the lines (and sometimes even revise) the lines on a script. And it's through those acting performances that the average moviegoer latches on to the characters in the movie. Likewise, a movie's setting is not felt through the screenwriter's depiction of how the world should be, but rather through the set and costume design, etc.

For me, this leaves only the plot as possibly the only pure essence of writing left in a movie... But even then, it's more of execution on behalf of the production crew than writing really. If I said that I liked a movie because of its action scenes, is it because of descriptions of how that action scene went, or because of the exhilarating soundtrack that plays through it, the death-defying stunts that the actors perform, and the frantic pace that the camerawork suggests? I'm more inclined to believe in the latter.

I'm excited to see the viewpoints from the other side, and hopefully you can change my mind on this. Thanks for reading!"

In the minor furore about prom attire, kimonos and chongsam dresses this argument came to particular prominence. In brief, the idea goes that someone who was bullied for various facets of Asian-ness, especially by dominant members of the white culture, would rightfully be furious to see white people trying to take part in or gain attention by doing something Asian, like wearing a kimono/chongsam.

I find this view incredibly unreasonable.

Now, if someone were bullied for their Chinese lunchbox, or love of Chinese pop music as a child, were to then see the very same bully dressing up in a sexy Chinese dress for online likes, they are perfectly entitled to be angry, and to call out their bullies on this shameful hypocrisy. I would encourage any former bullying victim to call out their oppressors and shame them for their past behaviour.

However, taking out their rage on strangers, who ought to be presumed to be innnocent, is totally irrational and incoherent. While there is every reason to be annoyed that someone who wronged you is now 'stealing your culture' there is no reason to assume that a total stranger isn't doing something completely blameless. Maybe the person is just an ignorant bully, pouring themselves into a tight Chinese dress for attention. Maybe they were gifted the dress while  studying abroad in Taipei for a year.  Maybe they have a Chinese sister in law who encouraged them to wear it. Maybe they just thought it was cool. Whatever, they deserve the benefit of the doubt. Calling them out and assuming malice is simply enabling a cycle of rage, prejudice and negativity to go on forever.

If say, some random individual was bullied by the 'normal', athletic, handsome cohort at school for loving Marvel comics, is now decades later, enraged by the good looking, sporty, normies  loving the Marvel movies, and spitting feathers on Twitter about the issue, we'd quite rightly see them as a bitter, twisted loser.

Ultimately, its reasonable to be angry with an individual or group of individuals for hypocritically changing their approach to your culture. It's not reasonable to be angry with an identity group as a whole.

The further issue I have with this topic, is the assumption that any traditonal garb is necessarily tied up with a deep cultural meaning strongly attached to that culture.

Yes, there are some outfits like this. For instance a Thai monk's orange robes - it would be completely innappropriate for wear this while drinking, smoking and trying to hook up. However, a kimono and a cheongsam are not really much more than fancy clothes to wear for formal occasions or when one wishes to look attractive. Visitors to China, Taiwan, Japan et al will find these items for sale in tourist markets, or offered for rental for photoshoots. Assuming there is something more at play, or that there some deeper meaning that can't be understood by people who don't belong to the culture is playing into racial assumptions about 'exoticness' in Asia.

As one more aside, it often comes up that people in Japan really loved white Americans wearing kimonos. This is quickly rebuffed with people saying that 'Asian American's' deserve to have more of a say and be listened to, they're the ones being hurt. Now, if you're Japanese American, fair enough - have your say. If you're Chinese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese American etc then you should not be commenting on this issue whatsoever. It has nothing to do with you or your culture. In fact, it's subtly projecting the idea that Asians 'are all the same'"

10,2022-07-21,CMV: Emotions are a critical component of logical thinking when determining how to live your life and that’s ok,u/physioworld,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w4bw34/cmv_emotions_are_a_critical_component_of_logical/,changemyview,"In this post when I talk about logical thinking I’m referring to deductive reasoning (two or more premises and a conclusion) and the use of deductive reasoning to determine how humans should live their lives.

It seems to me that people often separate emotions from logic, that the two cannot and should not mix, but this is in my view entirely incorrect. While it is true that emotions are not required to build a logical statement about the wider universe along the lines of:

(P1) My lobster has a body made of segments, a tough outer shell, two pairs of antennae, and limbs that are jointed.

(P2) All organisms with bodies made of segments, a tough outer shell, two pairs of antennae, and limbs that are jointed are crustaceans.

(C) Therefore my Lobster is a crustacean. 

I think that when determining how humans should live, emotions are integral to the process.

My reasoning for this is that logic is simply a tool for determining the correct answer given a set of premises. If those premises are true and the structure of the argument valid then the conclusion must be true. But to build an argument to say how you should live, you need to feed the argument at least one thing you want, which is inherently emotional and subjective. For example:

(P1) I want to maximise the amount of pleasure I experience over the next 5 minutes

(P2) Heroin is the best known substance for short term maximisation of pleasure

(P3) I don’t care how long I live

(C) Therefore I should take an immediate dose of Heroin

This strikes me as a completely logical conclusion to make, however, I would take issue with P3, I personally do care how long I live for and even if I didn’t, on the chance I would continue to live, a crippling heroin addiction will make my life and the lives of those around me worse.

However my issues with P3 are purely emotional and subjective. Sure, humans evolved to survive and desire to live, but if a particular human doesn’t have that desire and values short term pleasure over their continued existence, who am I to say they’re wrong?

To use a less inflammatory example:

(P1) I want to live a long and happy life

(P2) Eating junk food on occasion will make me happy and not significantly curtail my longevity

(P3) I care more about the extra happiness than the loss of a few years of life

(C) Therefore I should eat junk food on occasion. 

Now some people would say that eating junk food is always irrational, because it’s bad for your health, but they only think that because they personally see little benefit from eating it and maybe place additional value on the extra few years of life.

My point is, when appraising how people should or should not live, logic is an amazing tool for figuring out what is best, once you know what you want to achieve, but the premises will necessarily be strewn with emotional reasoning and that’s ok

The last thing you want to do after working all day sitting at your desk is to sit again. Instead you do more home stuff, go out and be social. But it didn’t kill the gaming industry. People still buy games even though they have little time to play. People watch even more streams, etc. But there is definitely a shift now.
For example I bought the latest xbox series x now that i could finally afford having time home to play games… but i find myself buying all the games i “think” id want to play but end up not spending time actually playing them. Instead I watch a lot of Youtube channels about the game, streams of people playing it, game reviews, etc. When I do play, it’s max 1 hour and the whole time I feel guilty because I either find things that I dislike about the game, or I feel guilty for not doing something productive instead, or I suck at the game (because I don’t practice) and just give up and watch people play instead. I don’t think the actual gaming industry is in danger though but it’s definitely evolving. Especially now with VR, e-sport, and steaming services, etc.

Δ EDIT; My view is changed. I shouldn’t use WFH as the cause but one of the accelerating factors of a personal feeling that is related to me growing up and the industry evolving (as it was already doing before covid). WFH just made it clearer to me, but again is not the actual cause. Thanks to everyone for replying and staying civile and sharing their thought process."

&amp;#x200B;

And it pisses me off to no end that it seems to be the fashion right now to use 100% racist speech like this and be celebrated as progressive.

To me, it is easy. Characters are described in a book. Actors are cast to match that description. If the characters don't match the description, people get to complain. That's 100% normal.

Sure, you can argue the filmmaker is using his artistic freedom, and that's fine, but people aren't assholes for complaining about it, especially if it happens to be central to the story how the people look in a show about bloodlines and heirs and whatnot.

The problem is this: If Tobey Maguire gets cast as King Robert Baratheon, people complain that it's a total miscast, most would agree and things would be fine.

Now, if Samuel L Jackson gets cast as King Robert Baratheon, and people complain that it's a total miscast, they are getting called racists.

This fact, inherently, is what makes this debate racist. If it's about the size or body or hair of the actor, it is fine, people get to complain all they want. But if its about the race or the gender, ooooh nonono, keep your opinion to yourself.

In my opinion we only have freed ourselves from racism, when skin color is just another aesthetical feature and gets treated as such. We don't ""diversify"" hair color or body height in our actors either. The job of an actor among others, is to look a certain way to depict a character. If people feel that some aspects of that look break their immersion, they get to complain about it.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I want to stress that I have nothing against representation in media. In fact, there are great examples of original characters and storylines that handle this well. I am only talking about the topic of casting to existing characters in media/history/mythology and how people treat this topic.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT2: I also want to make another point in that people seem to just assume that the general audience is racist and only complains when white people get cast as POC and I think that's just not true. There will always be some assholes complaing about that, but I don't think thats true for the general audience. We celebrate characters like Nick Fury and Miles Morales. When its done well, we enjoy a good new representation of a character. Hell, we depicted God as Morgan Freeman, who ever complained about that? Ask Michelangelo on his opinion on that casting choice. It is such a grim and overblown idea that the general populace is inherently racist and only complains about black casting choices."

One aspect of consciousness that makes it difficult to observe is that that “higher” consciousness entities can observe lower consciousness, but the inverse doesn’t seem to be true. Humans can observe a sea sponge, but a sea sponge cannot observe a human (in any way meaningfully distinct from its general environment). This quandary is often discussed in the context of alien life, i.e.: how would super-intelligence communicate w/ sub-intelligence? 

Cyborg is a name for the single entity that is an interface of man and machine, and perhaps, where the resulting entity has capabilities beyond that of a non-modified human. There are lots of “subjective” interpretations here. What is a machine? Certainly, no one would argue that having a filling makes one a cyborg, as it neither makes me superior nor would we call a filling a machine. When we start looking at advancements in artificial limbs, medical procedures, and novel interface mechanisms into technology, we likely begin to get into a gray area. 

An organism has lots of definitions, but is generally considered: a unique, living, entity comprised of systems and parts, capable of certain distinct activities (consumption, growth, reproduction, and avoidance of things that prevent these (death, injury, isolation, etc.). To achieve these activities, there is often, though not always, centralized governance at a systems level, but the individual entities do not require, and often do not have, awareness of the whole or their part in the whole. 

A species is a collection of organisms that share common attributes and do not have exclusionary attributes. 

A company is a collection of living things (humans), operating towards common activities, namely consumption, growth, and reproduction. However, a company is certainly more than just humans; it is also the facilities, technology, systems, and processes that allow the individual efforts of humans to be collectively summarized into activities larger than the sum of parts. The interface (input and feedback) between the biological (human) and machine occurs in lots of ways: certainly manually, visually, thru audio, etc. but it also occurs at cognition and emotional level. Additionally, the communication / resource channels are bi-directional. It is not only humans inputting data and then receiving feedback from the non-biological. And the channels pass critical resources, and resources that are not available to humans in isolation: income, insurance, compound interest, familial and generational security, influence, access, etc. These resources are, at best, scarce, and at worse, not available, to non-augmented humans and are generally only created in meaningful volume by companies. 

Companies also exhibit examples of the subjective aspects of consciousness / sentience: emotion. A company cannot be void of a “mood” or “culture”. And this is dynamic. The healthiest companies have predictable and useful mood dynamics. The worst, unpredictable and harmful. The physical environment of a company in which humans exist has aspects of attractors and opposers. If the non-biologic opposers become too repulsive for the biologic, the biologic resources flee, which threatens the ability of the company to gather resources, grow, and reproduce. 

Companies are governed by distributed neural networks that govern both physical movement, but also movement in the abstract dimensions in which companies operate difficult for humans to define / describe, and also difficult for individual augmented humans to perceive. But, like other sentient species, companies work to modify their environments in ways to maximize their own success by securing resources, maximizing attractiveness, and eliminating threats to those resources. 

W/ all organisms, there exist levels of complexity. The extremes of those spectrums create existential questions, e.g.: are viruses alive? The same is true within the cyborg ""kingdom""; very simple companies might be right on the edge of considered sentient. Here i am describing those are unambiguously complex. 

Which makes me ask, “are companies a new species defined by ""cellular"" cyborgs, and are these ""cyborg-ian"" entities sentient?” I am arguing they pass the “parts” inspection. But do they pass the “sum” inspection? If we know that lower intelligence struggles to perceive higher intelligence (if that intelligence is too far superior), how would we disprove the possibility, or even likelihood, that sentience has indeed emerged, and the emergence suggests the creation of a new cyborg-based lifeform, that is the company?"

Both types require creativity, effort, and resources but the amount of resources dedicated to the creation of ANY copyrighted work are inconsequential compared to what it cost someone to create some types of patented inventions.  Tens of billions can be spent on a single patented idea and yet someone is only entitled to benefit from this investment for 20 years while someone who writes down a story is entitled to benefit from it at the very minimum 3 ½ times longer. Furthermore, I would argue that not do patented things cost powers of magnitude more than copyrighted works as a whole those things that are patented have a much larger and more important impact on the lives and happiness of the world population than anything copyrighted as well. I love my copyrighted works as much as anyone but I would rather be alive (due to patented medicine and other quality of life inventions) then read a great book, listen to the  greatest song, or watch the most amazing movie.

So can anyone convince me that someone that creates a copyrighted work deserves to be entitled to be rewarded for their product for so much longer than someone who invents something.

Edit 2 ----

Just to clarify the argument is not that patents should last longer rather that if someone creates something they deserve the same protections for the same time period no matter if it a product or a song.

Edit ----

Since the point of patents having a bigger benefit then copyrights has been brought up multiple times I wanted to add some questions for those arguments

If the benefits to society are the difference what about copyrighted works that have a huge impact of society? Also most patents don't have a big impact on society so why shouldn't they have the some protection as a book or song?"

There's no basis in science, psychology, or any other metric that would support them being acceptable; they are literally extrapolated from an old French ""love manual"" from the turn of the 20th century (according to my research on where this started).

Look at the facts based on these rules:

\- An 18-year-old person in high school could conceivably date a 22-year-old college graduate: not terrible, but most people would probably ""side-eye"" this relationship (especially the high schooler's parents).

\- a 22-year-old person graduating from college could date their 30-year-old supervisor at the store they work at; this is already a little off to begin with since the older person would have 2 FULL high school classes worth (freshman through senior) that separate them in age.  Life experience wise, the 30-year-old is 36% older than the younger one, with significant life changes and experiences tied to this, but according to these rules it's ""acceptable""

\- a 28-year-old just getting out of their second residency to be a doctor could date a 42-year-old divorcee with 2 children, whose child they had when they were 20 would only be 6 years YOUNGER than the person they're dating.  Again, apparently acceptable according to these ""tried and true"" rules, even though there is a 50% age gap between them.

\- a 34-year-old store clerk can both date their 24-year-old subordinate (10 years their junior, a 41% gap in age) AND also date this person's parent at the age of 54 (20 years their senior, a 58% age gap).  All acceptable under these rules.

Now, these may seem like extreme examples, but they happen every day and are believed to be acceptable by society.  The older the age, the more predatory and overly lenient things seem to get.

And the even darker aspect to this lax viewpoint on acceptable dating?  Fantasy.

Who one fantasizes about gets even more untoward when applying these rules since, well, if you can date someone SIGNIFICANTLY younger than you, one could only imagine you would also fantasize about someone EVEN YOUNGER than that.

The notion of the 45-year-old father fantasizing about his college-age daughter's friends... yeah, that happens, and we know it's not acceptable.  But, according to the ""rules"", well his daughter's friends would only be a few years removed from being acceptable to ""date"" anyways... ""it's only a few years off, what's the harm in thinking about them""?  (You know those mental gymnastics happen).

I propose a more ""focused"", scaled, and acceptably nuanced system that is drastically more appropriate:

\- (Note):  If you're under the age of 18, you can ONLY date someone 1 year older or younger than you.  (Don't think too many parents would disagree with this).  If you turn 18, you can still date someone who is 16 PROVIDED you were going out PRIOR to you turning 18.  (There are ""Romeo and Juliet"" laws that abide this but should be far more focused and less lenient as to not unduly punish those who were dating while young within an acceptable age gap).  Also... if you're a legal adult, you probably should NOT be fantasizing about ""minors"" anymore.

\- 18 Yrs Old- DATING AGE RANGE: 17-19 (16 only if dating prior to birthday), FANTASY RANGE: 18-23

\- 19 Yrs Old- DATING AGE RANGE: 18-20, FANTASY RANGE: 18-24

\- 20 Yrs Old- DATING AGE RANGE: 19-22 (no more High School dating), FANTASY RANGE: 18-25

\- 21 Yrs Old- DATING AGE RANGE: 20-23 (no more dating teenagers), FANTASY RANGE: 18-26

\- 22 Yrs Old- DATING AGE RANGE: 20-24, FANTASY RANGE: 19-27 (no more High School fantasies)

\- 25 Yrs Old- DATING AGE RANGE: 23-28, FANTASY RANGE: 21-30 (no more teenage fantasies)

\- 30 Yrs Old- DATING AGE RANGE: 27-35, FANTASY RANGE: 23-37

\- 35 Yrs Old- DATING AGE RANGE: 30-42 (no more dating people in their 20's), FANTASY RANGE: 26-44

\- 40 Yrs Old- DATING AGE RANGE: 34-50, FANTASY RANGE: 28-52

\- 45 Yrs Old- DATING AGE RANGE: 37-58, FANTASY RANGE: 29-61 (final age to fantasize about 20 yr old)

\- 50 Yrs Old- DATING AGE RANGE: 40-63, FANTASY RANGE: 32-68 (doubt much fantasy about 60 yr olds)

\- 55 Yrs Old- DATING AGE RANGE: 43-68, FANTASY RANGE MAX YOUTH: 37

\- 60 Yrs Old- DATING AGE RANGE: 47-73, FANTASY RANGE MAX YOUTH: 42

\- 65 Yrs Old- DATING AGE RANGE: 52-77, FANTASY RANGE MAX YOUTH: 47

Following these rules, the MAXIMUM age difference (scaling up to a point at age 59) one could have between someone they're dating is being 30% OLDER (them: age 46).  Effectively, you cannot date someone outside of when you were in grade school (K-12), meaning no one more than 13 years younger of older than you.  Period.  This prevents the possibility of parents dating their friend's children.

And the MAXIMUM age difference for fantasies peaks at 49 years old with thinking about someone 18 years younger than you (them: age 31), and then never goes younger than this (i.e. you should never fantasize about someone who wasn't even born when you were graduating High School).

The majority of society follows these rules to begin with, rarely deviating from dating someone who is more than 2-3 years outside their age... but there are exceptions.  Too big of exceptions sometimes.

Case in point: Leonardo DiCaprio.

Yes; he's a movie star, yes; he's rich and famous, yes; he's not an average person, etc etc etc.

Not once (in his documented dating life, of which there is extensive evidence) has he even followed the ""half your age + 7"" rule ONCE:

\- in 1999: he was 24, Giselle Bundchen was 18- the cutoff for ""half plus seven"" would have been 19

\- in 2005: he was 30, Bar Rafaeli was 20; a 50% age difference, unacceptable even by ""H+7"": 22

\- in 2011: he was 36, Blake Lively was 23, ""H+7"" cutoff: 25

\- in 2012: he was 37, Erin Heatherton was 22, ""H+7"" cutoff: 25

\- in 2013: he was 38, Toni Garrn was 20, that's a 90% age gap

\- and even today (2022); he's 45 years old, Camila Marone is 22; an over 100% age gap.

Now, outside of pointing to the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio is a creep, seeing celebrities and persons of high-esteem and privilege ""get away"" with such huge age gaps in relationships simply emboldens people of similar older ages to try and do likewise (or for those with a predilection toward ""grooming"" to feel their behavior is allowed), mostly from older, white men in Red States in the US).

You, of course, could make the tired and overly brazen argument that ""well, if their over 18, they're a legal adult and can date whoever they want"", and yes; this is true, but honestly: how many 18-24 years old people that you know make smart, thoughtful, well-informed decisions in life?  Did you make good decisions at that time?  Did anybody you know?  My guess is: no, you and they did not.  The older person should know better.  Always.

I feel the ages and ranges I've proposed are for more acceptable for dating and fantasy, still allowing some leeway as one gets older (to a point), and also tackles limiting inappropriate dating when one is in their late teens and early to mid 20's, while also giving a relatively expansive ""fantasy range"" that one can have that doesn't breach the realm of ""creepy"".

Please, change my view."

Especially having been through the family court system and seeing how sexist it is.

People tell you that the bias in family court is because of patriarchy.

But many feminists defend the bias. Sometimes not even understanding that it's a problem (step 1 to fix something is admitting it's a problem).  The only people who are doing anything about this, especially in the real world, are men's rights activists, or MRAs. But they don't seem to believe in the patriarchy.

If the patriarchy made this system, then fighting it opposes the patriarchy.

1401,2022-07-21,CMV: the gender pay gap is largely caused by differences in goals in life and not by systematic discriminatory work practices,u/rrocks003,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w4kbny/cmv_the_gender_pay_gap_is_largely_caused_by/,changemyview,"I have done some reading recently about the gender pay gap and have come to the conclusion above (which I fully admit may be incorrect), but if this is correct I don’t understand why the pay gap is such a political issue since you can’t change peoples goals in life.

So basically my view is that women are more likely to want to have time off to be with the family which leads to less total pay. One of the biggest [examples](https://www.zippia.com/teacher-jobs/demographics/) of this in the US is becoming a teacher. Teachers are one of the most low paid professions but it is disproportionately women because of the great work life balance that comes with only working during school hours. 

Anecdotally my own mother is a doctor who gets paid less than her male counterparts. This is because when she joined her partnership she negotiated for a lower salary with more time off so that she could spend time with her children while they were growing up. 


My last point is the difference in negotiation skills between men and women which leads to differences in pay for the exact same tasks. “57% of male Carnegie Mellon graduate business students negotiate their starting salaries. However, only 7% of women negotiate salaries… men’s starting salaries… are 7.6% higher than women’s.” [source](https://www.negotiations.com/articles/gender-interaction/) It seems that women are (or at least used to be) worse at negotiation and lost some potential salary this way as well. 


The wage gap has actually narrowed for the younger generations [source](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/25/gender-pay-gap-facts/). IMO this is a reflection of changing goals in life among younger women and stronger negotiation skills as they focus on their career more than previous generations have. 

So, I hope this post doesn’t offend anyone. I’m completely open to new perspectives. It just doesn’t seem to be a “systemic” problem like the news would have you believe and seems to have more to do with our own personal culture of motherhood. So please, change my view.

Edit: I’ve got to go now. This has been a very educational thread and I hope I didn’t offend anybody. I’ve come to the conclusion that a part of the wage gap is probably due to differences in employer/societal expectations. It looks like around 5-6% in the studies that adjust for most other factors (not nearly as large as politicians would have you think but still definitely not zero). Thanks for the new perspective. Hopefully, one day everybody can get paid a fair wage for the work that they do. PS teachers are God sends!!!"

5,2022-07-21,"CMV: Metric's not special -- multiple measurement systems exist to make specific tasks easier, and that's fine",u/badass_panda,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w4lz2l/cmv_metrics_not_special_multiple_measurement/,changemyview,"OK -- so I get that converting between measurement systems is a challenge, and that many measurement systems don't handle complex conversions very well.

That's the case for metric: everything is base 10 and was (at least initially) designed to be interrelated, so it's relatively easy to do complex conversions and to manipulate numbers.

That certainly makes a good case for why metric is a solid default system of measurement, a *lingua franca* for measurement ... if you need to do lots of complex operations or conversions, first convert to metric.

However, I often see that positioned as a reason you should not use anything *except* for metric. And here's the thing, I can see an argument being made that it'd be more convenient for people generally, if there were no situation-specific measurement systems to confuse matters.

But people often go a step farther: they say, ""Metric is best, it's always best, it's better than everything else,"" and then go back to the general benefits I mentioned above to back the point up. They miss the situation-specific benefits of another system of measurement.

I'd argue that there are plenty of situations where either the physical nature of the use-case, or the most common problems it presents, make metric (and base-10) a less practical way of approaching the problem.

# Examples:

***Let's say I need to quickly count a bunch of bagels.*** I've got a lot of bagels to count, and I need to do it quickly. Now, most people can count things in small groups, without actually ""counting"". This is called [subitization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subitizing), and we all do it -- if you see two coins on the counter, you don't need to count them in order to know you've got two.

However, most people can't subitize past three or four -- so to get to five, you quickly recognize a group of two and a group of three, and add them. To get to six, you recognize two groups of three, etc... or you count them one by one.

Well, if I use the largest groups that I can, then for the average person it'll be groups of three or four... which makes a base 12 or 16 system naturally efficient... same amount of steps, larger group.

* To get to 10, I need to go: ""Group of two, group of three, group of two, group of three."" If I'm a really awesome subitizer, I can go: ""Group of four, group of four, group of two.""
* To get to 12, I need to go: ""Group of three, group of three, group of three, group of three."" If I'm a really amazing subitizer, I can go: ""Group of four, group of four, group of four.""

***Let's say I need to split the apples evenly among the relatively small group of people that picked them.*** OK, so let's say we've got two groups: One put their apples into baskets with ten apples in them, the other put their apples into baskets with twelve apples in them. Group A has 10 baskets of apples, group B has 12 baskets of apples.

* Need to split that among two pickers? Easy-peasy. Group A's get 5 baskets each, group B's get 6 baskets each.
* Need to split that among three pickers? Uh-oh, Group A doesn't have enough baskets. Each picker's going to need to put .333333 baskets of apples into their knapsack. Group B? Each one gets 4 baskets.
* OK, what about four pickers? Same deal... Group A is in trouble, Group B each get 3.
* OK, what about 5 pickers? Finally, a good deal for Group A.
* OK, what about 6 pickers? Group A is screwed again.

The tl;dr on this one is that if your work group or family has fewer than a dozen people in it, it'll be easier to split things if you're counting up dozens.

***Let's say I want to write down grandma's recipes as simply as possible.*** Gam-gam's been cooking for a long time, and she makes her food by feel. She's making soup. She adds a spoonful of vinegar, fills a cup with wine and throws it in, adds a  dash of salt... If she was making four times as much, she'd add four spoons full of vinegar, fill the cup of wine up four times and throw it in, throw in four dashes of salt, etc.

Now, you *could* stop Gam-Gam, get out your graduated cylinder and write it down as ""14.3 ml of vinegar"" or ""247 ml wine"" or ""1.23 grams of salt"", but you *probably* don't need to be measuring things out with that precision to make Memaw's famous soup; she never did.

In reality, if you write it out that way, you'll be reaching for a handy spoon or cup to use yourself, anyway... the important thing is the rough ratios between ingredients and the process, so you might as well express it with the actual tools you'll be using.

***Want to tell people how big a really big thing is?*** Well, you could certainly tell them that it's exactly 4,462.3 square meters ... or you could tell them that it's the size of a football field, or about the size of an English football pitch. It can be helpful to use things people encounter during their daily life as units of measurement.

I could go on, but this is already a bit long."

1) The construction costs are exorbitant. The California high speed rail system is still being developed, but the cost for LA to SF could cost almost $100 billion. That is just one section. To expand it across the whole country? Trillions of dollars. 

2) Usage would never reach full capacity.  When something costs over a trillion dollars to make, the seat prices would never fall below airplane ticket prices. And people would still just take the airport. 

3) USA is just too large. Let’s say we build high speed rail from LA to NYC. If the train traveled at 300 mph, and never stopped (unlikely), that would be around 9 hours. Realistically with stops it would be 10-12 hours. The flight would take half the time. Only tourists would take this, not commuters. And it would not reduce airline usage. 

4) The only people who would benefit are the construction companies contracted to build the rail. So we’d just be making the rich even richer. 

There are literally thousands of better things USA could do with $1,000,000,000,000. One half-assed idea: You could give every homeless person in America $3,000,000. Why would we spend so much on a non-viable transportation alternative?"

In the US and the developed world in general, we believe in the free market. We don't let the government control the price of tractors or lumber. So why do we let the Fed control the interest rates instead of the market?

Since **when did we, in the US and the developed world, develop such a hatred for the free market**, that we're willing to let the government mandate price controls for what is arguably the most basic commodity - money? All our monetary problems will be fixed if the market simply sets the interest rates instead of the Fed.

The entire principle of the free market is that **the government is not smart enough to dictate prices**. The prices in a free market are signals, coalescing all the information available from millions of entities in a way that a centralized authority like the government cannot, thereby allocating resources more efficiently than a top-down system. This is understood fact in today's world. Everyone accepts it. 

But **when it comes to the price of money, suddenly everyone forgets basic economics.**

High inflation? No problem - the market will automatically raise interest rates to compensate, since no idiot will lend money for less than the inflation rate. Problem solved.

To be clear, **I am not advocating for deregulation**. Someone always pipes in saying that the wild west monetary system leads to crashes. I'm not saying that we should abolish our controls on things like capital reserve requirements, FDIC insurance, auditing of banks, the SEC, or anything else. Just that the intra-bank lending rate needs to be determined by the market instead of the Fed. Regulations will ensure that banks remain healthy.

**The Fed will still be the lender of last resort**. It will lend money to distressed banks at the market rate + haircut costs. This will ensure that banks first turn to each other to maintain their reserve requirements, and only approach the Fed when necessary to avoid the extra fees. Exactly how it works right now, in fact.

So danger of fraud, panic etc = None

Danger of liquidity crisis = None

So what's the friggin problem?"

The media is making a villain of this man and calling him a heckler and saying he was mean to this girl but just because age cried doesn’t mean his actions were wrong. He went up to her when she wasn’t performing, and in a low voice was giving her sound criticism. The only reason it was public is because she was recording on tiktok. Based on the clip of her singing he wasn’t wrong and she was kinda flat and couldn’t hold certain notes. If this was a concert of hers or something then I’d think differently but she’s in a public place where people have to listen to her whether they like it or not. To ask them to either enjoy it and or shit up seems obnoxious to me. Criticism is something that comes along with art and he did this in a respectful way. Maybe his starting words were a little brutal but it will always be that way with art 

You can cmv on either point

Edit: I have changed my view on whether or not he was rude. Still open to cmv on this point: If you’re not open to criticism then you shouldn’t publicly perform"

I was 12 years old when I saw the first Iron Man movie, and it was my first introduction to fan service.  I can’t find a good summary of the plot so my memory might be hazy, but I remember this scene of Tony Stark getting criticized by this reporter, and then it cuts to her her sleeping with him.  Even at 12 years old I thought it was the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen. I’m watching a superhero movie, I don’t want to see the guy I’m rooting for being a womanizer.

Now I was 12 in 2008 and I have seen a huge cultural shift since then as a result of both political movements and the growth of social media.  I don’t think you could release a scene like that in a movie nowadays without getting a lot of criticism from the Twitterverse and I think that’s fine.  The problem is that a lot of the criticism seems a little bit hypocritical.

In my youth I was also a big fan of the show Supernatural.  I really liked spooky things as a kid and loved a monster-of-the-week type shows centered around that.  The problem however, is Tumblr. I stopped watching the show when it became all about the weird fan service that was appealing to people on Tumblr.  I believe that there’s some weird ass people out there who really can’t enjoy a piece of entertainment without sexualizing it. I mean look at rule 34. Look at creepypastas for Christ sake. Jeff the killer used to be scary, and now they had to ban him from the sub Reddit because there were a million stories about Jeff the killer and Slender Man getting it on.

Now the difference I’ve noticed however, is that people seem to be way less critical of it when fan service is directed towards heterosexual women or the LGBTQ plus community. I don’t have anything against representation or depicting gay relationships in film, but I know fucking fan service when I see it. What brings this to mind is that god awful She-Hulk trailer. You have this clip of she hulk carrying some dude into the bedroom. Personally I like she-hulk because she’s an awesome superhero who deals with identity crisis and has a unique sense of humor.  In my opinion, strong female character does not equal writing in someone’s weird giantess kink.  I saw someone defending it on a sub Reddit, saying that “most men would be DYING to be carried around like that” and I almost vomited.

The same thing happened with resident evil 8 and it almost made me not wanna buy the game.  And that’s saying something because I have poured a lot of hours into S+ runs for those games

Now I understand that this kind of fan service is way more harmful towards women, as it’s usually a tool for objectifying them and writing boring female characters.  But gender politics aside, there are plenty of other problems with fan service. Despite it being cringeworthy, I just think it’s a lazy form of writing.  I think there’s better ways to make a character likable then just making them appeal to a male/female fantasy.  And in my opinion it also alienates people who watch your story for the story as opposed to keeping up to date with the latest TikTok trending piece of media.

And by the way I don’t think this is just related to traditional fan service, I think that cameos and pop culture references can really pull me out of a good movie, but they are not nearly as cringe worthy.

I’m gonna say this again because people on the Internet tend to get into arguments with bad faith.  Representation is OK. Sex in movies and TV is OK. Fan service is cringe, and you know exactly what I mean when I’m talking about it."
13,2022-07-21,"CMV: If someone encourages you to invest in crypto, they are trying to abuse you",u/PimplupXD,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w4tji8/cmv_if_someone_encourages_you_to_invest_in_crypto/,changemyview,"I really hope someone is able to change my view on this issue, since from my viewpoint it just seems evil.

Here's what I understand about crypto: it was invented as a way to do anonymous money transactions with no central authority. It's perfect for if you're running a human trafficking ring, or if involving an arbitrary governmental currency is too much of a hassle.

Being able to make encrypted transactions can be an incredibly good thing: Maybe you live in China or Russia and you want to donate to a good cause without your government's awareness, or maybe you want to buy a therapeutic drug that could save a family member from suicide, but it happens to be illegal where you live.

In any of those cases, crypto is amazing. I fully condone buying crypto in order to spend it with noble intent.

But wouldn't it be amazing if cryptocurrency just, stopped constantly fluctuating in value?

Here's where the evil of crypto mining comes into play. In order to have a virtual currency with no central authority, you need a way to stop hackers from taking over your system. And cryptocurrency invented an ingenious solution: literally just hiring people to waste computing power. Why would you try to hack into Bitcoin and overthrow it, when you could literally make more money by cooperating with them?

Every single crypto transaction is verified by a computer wasting a bunch of electricity to solve a needlessly complex problem for no reason. Except the reason is that Bitcoin pays them a ""mining fee"" as a reward for not trying to overthrow their system.

But this causes a huge environmental impact, and this is where it starts to turn into abuse. It's one thing to buy cryptocurrency in order to spend it on something you need, but it's another thing entirely to view it as an ""investment"": frequently buying and dumping crypto like stocks in order to make a profit.

Literally the only thing that determines a cryptocurrency's value is what idiots are willing to buy and sell it for. So you could buy a bunch of Bitcoin for $1,000, and then spend a month hyping it up as much as possible, and after a bunch of other people jump on board you can sell it for literal hundreds of millions of dollars. This is not an exaggeration.

This has turned crypto into a zero-sum game where people will buy it and then desperately try to hype it up to other people in order to turn a massive profit.

And if there's anything the gold rush can teach us, it wasn't the thousands of people who went searching for gold who made the biggest profit, it was the people who had a monopoly on their food and housing.

A bunch of people have thousands of GPUs running quadrillions of operations per second just so they can profit off of every crypto transaction that takes place. And if the analogy isn't already blatant enough, when you spend bitcoin you literally have to pay the ""mining fee"".

So instead of creating munchkin D&amp;D characters, a bunch of powergaming nerds can quench their thirst for wealth and resources by purchasing GPUs and wasting thousands of dollars on electricity each month in order to turn an even bigger profit.

And the only way this scheme is able to succeed is if there are idiots like you and me who decide to buy crypto but can't sell it fast enough.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's my view: if you buy crypto in order to spend it, all the power to ya. But if you're using it as something you can pump and dump to get rich, then go to hell.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:** several good points have been made in the comments, and my view has been changed:

&gt;If someone encourages you to invest in crypto, they are being unethical, or they don't fully understand how cryptocurrency works."
97,2022-07-21,"CMV: If you disagree with ‘body-shaming’, you should be displeased by the posting of those recent photos of Elon Musk.",u/forbiddenmemeories,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w4tnqf/cmv_if_you_disagree_with_bodyshaming_you_should/,changemyview,"If you’ve been on Reddit or other social media platforms of late, you may have come across some photos of Musk in swimming trunks on subs like r/oddlyterrifying. They’ve been shared around, wise has been cracked, jokes have been made. How did this guy ever go out with Grimes, how can he be an idol to some people on this site, etc. 

Now, I don’t like Elon Musk, and his popularity amongst some people does baffle and alarm me. I don’t exactly know him inside out but he certainly seems pretty childish, narcissistic and unscrupulous at the very least. I have no interest in defending him or his behaviour. However, when I saw posts with these photos, I was a little bit perturbed, because the only real joke is that Elon Musk looks quite fat and pasty in them. Isn’t pointing at that fact for our own amusement ‘body-shaming’?

Now, as I’ve said, Musk seems like a dick to me, so mocking him *in general* seems fair enough. And, there would be a certain irony in exercising restraint when it comes to mocking Musk on social media, given he portrays himself as this apparent champion of free speech. However, whilst I certainly think anyone is perfectly entitled to mock Musk if they wish, if you believe that body-shaming is wrong, then you should be troubled to see *anybody*, even Elon Musk, being mocked for that *specific* thing. It’s not that Musk or anyone else should be immune from ridicule- rather, it’s that surely if you think body-shaming is just a bad thing to do, then you think that someone’s weight isn’t something worth ridiculing in the first place. If someone is laughing at someone else for being overweight, we can infer that they think that being overweight is something worth laughing about.

I’ll draw a comparison. Say Musk, or anybody else we might want to criticise, was a member of a minority group for whom certain derogatory slurs exist. It would be fine to speak about them in generally derogatory terms- but it wouldn’t be fine to call them those slurs; those express contempt for people from that group in general, and suggest that being a part of that group is itself something worthy of derision. If, for example, we were taking a pop at someone for their behaviour and that person happened to have cerebral palsy, calling them an asshole would presumably be fine, but referring to them as a “spazz” would be considered bigoted. It’s not that they’re immune from criticism or mockery- it’s that laughing at that *particular* thing suggests that that thing is, well, worth being laughed at for. If I saw someone using the word “spazz” to refer to someone, I’d presume they thought that having that kind of impairment was funny- or at least, that they had been careless and allowed that implication to come through.

Of course, you might not be bothered by 'body-shaming' at least regarding someone's weight or skin quality, or at least you might think that a joke where someone’s weight or skin quality is the punchline can still be funny and not such a bad thing. But if you *do* apparently regard body-shaming as wrong, then I think you should regard laughing at anyone for their body, even Elon Musk, as a bad thing; that nobody's weight is *inherently* humorous, and that we don't merely refrain from mocking other, nicer people about their weight simply because we like them more."

It's something we give to other entities, living and nonliving. What we value often is based on beliefs instilled in us by our culture and upbringing, but reflection can change our minds.

The ""value of human life"" is common to all surviving cultures, but hasn't been universal. The Spartans committed infanticide. The Aztecs sacrificed humans. Today, people abort fetuses and humans in prior stages of development - and, in my opinion, *that's okay*, because their nonsapience makes them not ""people"" to me.

""Person"" I use here as a general term, because the question is not ""Is it a person?"" answered with a ""yes"" or ""no."" The appropriate question is ""What *legal rights* should it/they have?"" Because, again, value is a concept, not an oabsolute quality. There is no such thing as rights we have universally by being human.

Now, don't get me wrong, but I \*and most people) see slavery, the Holocaust, and other atrocities as reprehensible, because I (we) value the autonomy and life of ""people"" and don't want to see them suffer. I don't extend this regard to fetuses because I value the autonomy of the mother over the life of a nonsapient human.

If I recall correctly, most of U.S. society agrees with me. Pro-lifers' banning abortion in a democracy is only legitimate with the consent of the populace. If they want to outlaw it, convince me and 180 million others.

Note: yes, I know infants arguably are nonsentient in their first two years of life outside the womb. Any line drawn after (or at) conception between having a legal right to life and not is arbitrary.

This has been used many times in the past.  Sometimes, it was used in the South to enforce terrorism towards minorities.  It was also used to free people charged with alcohol violations during Prohibition. It was used to free some mercy killers, as well. 

With trials for new abortion-related crimes well underway, the fastest way for a single person to have an impact on abortion laws is to refuse to convict a person of an abortion crime.  

Also, by making the state use scarce resources to try and fail to convict people who have had abortions, future prosecutions will be less likely.  

With enough nullifications, the movement away from criminalizing abortions will be strong enough to get those laws repealed. 

Yes, elections are still important. Failure to vote is what got us into this mess.  But, elections are a very slow process, and with the GOP attempts to destroy election integrity and outright voter suppression, they are going to have even less impact.  

Is there another way for an individual to have as strong an impact on the criminalization of abortion?"

There has been one person named Andrew Tate that has been trending and while I disagree with many things he is saying, he seems to be recognizing/identifying many issues that people are relating to (assuming its male students of all ages) and concluding it in a way that majority of the viewer based believe is controversial. So he is offering something valuable to them that I think is important to recognize since it tends to be popular to villainize these type of people which I believe hinders understanding.

So I wanted to use this example for my reasoning behind my view. There are many comments and talks that disagree with this person. But the way the person disagreeing acts can be condescending, self-righteous, mean, etc. I want to identify this as ""toxic"" since I didn't know a better word for my title. Since many of the discussions I refer to act in these ways, the person who is disagreeing comes off as self-serving and selfish since its behavior of a hypocrite. 
In a short person, someone is telling another person they disagree with, they are wrong. While showing no compassion, listening skills, or understanding. You are not going to be winning anyone over. If anything people are going to invest more towards the person that is controversial since they are the one who connected with them while the opposing person is seen to show no solution and a hypocrite.

I haven't been living in the US for most of my 20s (6-7 years) and recently moved back. And started using English speaking (American dominant) sites again like Reddit so I have been living in a bubble from these talks and don't have much tolerance with them since I view it as them trying ""to win an argument"" while I try to view these talks as ""I am trying to create discussion and learn from this with the other person. It's either I learn something or I don't and stop.""

Am I wrong that these topics seem ineffective in how the most popular people are acting towards people they disagree on? And thinking that its creating even more long-term issues? 
I am wondering if this is actually a good thing for communities because I think its very rude. I think I see it very often. I think if you want 

I think if you want to prove a point or disagree with someone on something such as if its good/bad then you need to be compassionate. You need to show your effective listening skills and sincerely show you're trying, and you need to not do things like villainize someone. Especially if its challenging someone with a large following or something that getting a lot of engagement and you want to prove a point

Also I'm going to try my best to type this. I believe my ideas are very abstract and I have a difficult time putting it into words. So I'd appreciate if people ask me questions if something is confusing and have patience with me if we have a discussion.

edit/ I didn't want to delve deep into Tate as a main example. Since there are also other topics this happens that become popular that this happens to and used the Tate trend has an example because it was the easiest for me to recall not because its the most important"

Before I get to the bulk of my argument, I want to make it clear that I don't want to attack other classes. I think that a good education is a liberal arts education -with plenty of real world, practical education thrown in. As such, English/literature, history, the sciences, mathematics, economics, etc, are all important.

Still, I think Civics is probably the most important subject.

Why?

First, I think the most important thing that a school curriculum needs to achieve is to prepare the student to become a good citizen. Even though the 2020 US election had the highest turnout in the 21st century, the turnout was still only 66.8% of the total number of eligible voters.

[https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/2020-presidential-election-voting-and-registration-tables-now-available.html](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/2020-presidential-election-voting-and-registration-tables-now-available.html)

For democracy to continue and not just die over time, we must have concerned, educated citizens who fully understand their rights, and more importantly how they can practically execute their rights. 

Take my own high school experience for example, I attend one semester, half a year, course in the US government, one two semester course in US government, and one half semester course in economics. I left the US government class, which I took as a sixteen year old sophomore, with a vague understanding of the judiciary, legislative, and executive systems; the ability to, temporarily, recite the preamble; and maybe some understanding of the amendments. What I didn’t learn is the particulars for how supreme court judges are nominated, how and in what way supreme court cases have been decided, how foreign policy is implemented, how grassroots organizing, protesting, writing letters and other civic actions can allow citizens to be more active in their government, the specifics in regards to protest, why, how, and when it is legal, etc. 

I think that every American citizen should have a deep understanding of all of these questions, and many more. Specifically, I’d love to see Civics treated just as importantly as English, math, and sciences, each of which, at least in my state, were four year long classes. Ideally, I’d like for Civics -history too, but that’s a different CMV- to be studied all throughout highschool. In freshmen year, students should take intro classes covering the origin of American government, the judiciary, legislative, and executive branch, how laws are passed, the job of the president, how voting works. All the basic stuff. Year 2 should cover all of this in more depth with some hands on material, i.e. writing mock campaign speeches. Year 3 should go even deeper by looking at government on the local and civil level. Practical applications are even more important. Students should be taught how to write letters to their representatives and be allowed to send them if they like -and the teacher allows it. Students should be taught about local issues and laws. Year 4 should return to the federal level focusing on the nitty gritty details of far reaching governmental decisions: foreign policy, climate change, relation to economics, civics. Specifics on protest should be taught so that students who have now become adults can go out and actually fight for their rights and believes. 

So, what do you all think? And no, I’m not stupid enough to actually think any of this would happen."

I understand that people have ADD and dyslexia and other cognitive differences.

I guess I translated that too literally from the German “social safety net”.

There is a lot of talk about universal basic income these days. I suggest an alternative: Universal basic employment. 

What I mean by that, is instead of collecting social security, people should be able earn money by picking up jobs that otherwise would not get done. 

There would be a database of all the jobs in the public and social sector, with charities, etc. that would be nice to have, need no qualifications and benefit society, but there is no other budget or time to get them done. Anything from spending non-medical time with people in care homes, going shopping for the elderly, lending a hand with simple tasks in hospitals, supervising afternoon homework hours in schools, maybe also learning new job skills, writing resumes and applying for work, etc. Everyone can just pick up these jobs and get paid. There should always be jobs available, but if not, you can earn your day’s worth of money by spending the day reading educational books in the public library or similar backup tasks that benefit society or a person’s employability in the regular job market.  

The deal is essentially money for time. You can pick up as many tasks as you like every day, or take a longer-term engagements, and normal full-time working hours under this scheme should result in enough money to live modestly but comfortably like currently employed people in low-skilled jobs. 2/3 time should get you the current social security level. 

On the flip side, playing video games or watching TV all day will not get you any social support whatsoever, except for the bare minimum needed to survive, and none of it should be paid in cash.

To cover some of the obvious edge cases: 

There should be a one-time-in-x-years option to apply for starting your own business for a year with possible extensions if successful, until the business can stand on its own, and treating that as full-time employment.

Disability and acute illness need to be accommodated, ideally with some sort of work (=exchange of time for money) that is suitable for that specific disabled and chronically ill person and free time to recuperate with no work for the acutely sick.

There should still be some form of unemployment insurance that allows people who just lost their job to focus on finding a new one in their field for maybe 6 months or so.

The main point of this scheme would be to offer everyone an opportunity to exchange their time for money, even if they cannot make it through a job interview, and to get all those little jobs done that nobody has time or money for right now. 

Conversely nobody would be able to get government money without giving back to society, and given that people who want money have to be out of the house, can’t sleep in or play video games and watch TV, anyway, i.e. all the good parts about not working are gone, there would be more of an incentive to pick up better paid, regular jobs. 

At the same time, employers will have to offer a better deal than earning a living for giving companionship and everyday (non-care) help to elderly people or reading stories to sick kids. So people would still have the option to reject bad employers more easily than now."

Windows used to be much simpler and easier to use. The folders system of Windows 3.1 was essentially just a bunch of folders on your desktop that had all of your programs in it. It was great, and you could organize things to your hearts desire.

Windows 95 may have improved on this a bit the task bar, always in the lower left corner where programs were always accessible and organized by default. There were basic programs like notepad and wordpad, minesweeper, space cadet pinball, and solitare. It even came with a web browser, Internet Explorer, prior to the anti-trust suits. 
Windows 3.1 and then Windows 95 were near universal, and just about everyone who used computers could navigate through its easy to use interface. It was backwards compatible with most DOS programs, and you could easily enter a command line if that was your thing.
Personalization was a cinch with easy to find and change screensavers and desktop backgrounds.
Most importantly, there were no ads anywhere in your Windows Experience, and Windows did not move the location of functions every few years.
In short, the Windows User Interface peaked during Windows 3.1 and Windows 95, with arguments in favor of both.

E.g. having saferooms where people can use drugs under medical supervision. I think that the main goal of drug policies should be minimizing the issues caused by drug abuse to third parties, i.e. law abiding citizens, and therefore these efforts are bad use of money.

I do believe that it is more cost-efficient to spend resources on preventive measures, than just policing the drug users. I also believe that the city should provide treatment options for everyone that want to get their lives back in order.

I don't see how enabling ""safe use"" policies helps us to achieve the main goal. The resources are limited, and the queues to get into treatment from the streets are way too long. Resources spent on ""safe use"" and OD prevention could be better used elsewhere.

I would love to hear your opposing viewpoints. The topic is complex and I couldn't fit all my reasoning in this starting post without starting to ramble, so I will elaborate on my position in reply to your comments.

Copies/originals made sense in a time where the primary method of assenting to an agreement was the signature of a document.

I'm not referring to a broader idea of intelligence or IQ. I'm not doing a 'gotcha' referring to the fact that probably every single person on this planet has, at some point in time, done something irrational. I think you can do or believe in something irrational, without necessarily being irrational, and the sign of rationality would be your capacity to recognize said action was illogical when exposed to that reality. Some examples to highlight this:

1. Someone with OCD could compulsively entertain an irrational thought, while still acknowledging that the thought itself is irrational. This isn't restricted to people with OCD.
2. If, theoretically, we found out tomorrow that some fundamental scientific law like gravity was actually wrong, all the people and scientists who believed in gravity with (near) certainty wouldn't somehow be irrational for previously holding that view. They followed information and evidence available to the logical conclusion. If these scientists resisted the new information, however, without logical reasoning to do so, then that would constitute irrationality. I would extend this scenario to even absurd positions such as people that believe the earth is flat, so long as they have *only* been exposed to information that would *logically* lead them to said conclusion.

As such, I am not calling people that merely disagree with me or my positions irrational. I'm using rationality to refer to how people arrive at, and maintain, positions. It's entirely possible that I fail to logically argue why evolution is real to a nonbeliever, even if my position is ultimately the correct one, which results in said nonbeliever tentatively maintaining their view in a rational manner. The moment that nonbeliever acts to preserve their position in the face of conflicting information/evidence that would logically entail a shifting in views, however, they are now irrational.

To further clarify once more, this does not mean I am calling anyone who has ever reasoned incorrectly or acted irrationally irrational. More specifically, I mean that the vast majority of people are *generally* irrational. Here, irrational behavior isn't the exception, but rather the norm (or, at the very least, common enough to be a trend). To illustrate, an irrational person would be an individual who, upon questioning or challenging any position they hold (and care enough to defend), would act illogically to defend that position instead of modifying it with the exposure to new information/arguments.

When I say ""vast majority,"" I mean 90% is probably an extreme lowball. It might be reasonable to believe that &lt;1% of people on the planet are rational. I obviously don't have any scientific evidence backing this up, so it's basically just running on the perception I have of people via extrapolated anecdotes. For instance, if I look into a given public figure and find that they exhibit irrational behavior only after brief research, it's reasonable to assume that it wasn't just an unlucky exception. It also seems reasonable to assume that many in their audience likely agree with them, thus extending the irrationality. This also goes for policies, which, regardless of their validity, are often supported using irrational arguments. Another example would be pointing at 'intellectuals' that are often irrational, despite apparently being among the highest echelons of intelligence. If someone perceived as being extremely smart is actually irrational, then that isn't exactly good news for the people below them."

We should not celebrate him. There are better explorers to celebrate, if that's the route we want to go.

However, Columbus Day has become a day of celebration for Italian-Americans and their heritage and journey as immigrants. Stripping them of a holiday, telling them it is wrong to celebrate, and giving it to another group is unfair and wrong.

I am all for having an Indigenous People's Day, and maybe that is  a day to learn about and vilify those who hurt Natives in the name of conquest and colonialism. But why does it have to supersede another group's day?

MLK wasn't exactly a hero when it came to gay rights. He viewed homosexuality as a perversion and a mental illness. Would it be right to turn MLK day into Gay Pride Day? Obviously MLK is a hero and I am not trying to associate him with the crimes of Columbus, but it's really the only comparison I could make, since no group really claims any other federal holiday.

I don’t see why you should be forcing cursive on people, The ""but its prettier"" is an opinion (which i agree with, but cursive isnt as legible to me)  and isn’t a good reason.

The ""you wont be able to read historical documents"" argument is fair, but you‘re not just going to go waltzing into the white house and being granted permission to just go read the entire constitution, You’re going to read it from a document online which is usually in print.

&amp;#x200B;

The ""it’s faster"" argument is dependent on the person, Some people write with cursive a lot better and faster but for me I write extremely sloppy with cursive (because i’m not good at cursive and print is easier) and also slower.

tl;dr : cursive should be an optional skill and you shouldnt be forced to write in it."

the extensive groundings that seem somewhat common rarely fit the crime for instance talking back or disrespect(neither causes harm to the ""victim"")

socialization with other humans specifically peers is necessary for proper development

any longer serves no punitive purpose and any good is outweighed by harm

longer should be treated as house arrest and should require trial and due process if the parents really want a longer grounding

And it great that attention is being brought to issues like homophobia. However, i'd argue that everyone who lives in a developed nation like the ones listed above already knows about sexuality, and the stigma existing around it.

Speaking of, I don't see much stigma around sexuality in these places. In fact, these places have laws that protect against hate like that.

Now, to the crux of the issue. the places I commonly see the activism is in those developed countries where there is already little to no homophobia. where there does exist is the 72 countries which have laws against homosexuality. and nobody cares to point their focus there, where homosexuals are commonly persecuted (it's not a case of 'yeah it's the law but it's not enforced').

sidenote: most of the LGBT activist are liberals who also support freedom of speech on religions. However most religious scripture and ideas also contains hate against homosexuals, which is a nice shot in the foot.

Let's have a talk. i'd be interested to hear.

Edit: I'd like to clarify that my point applies to the modern day. And it doesn't reflect of the overall impact of this movement. I won't comment on it because i'm not too informed of the movement's impact.

Edit 2: this post has gotten some attention, which is cool. I'd want to clarify some things.

\- I use the USA as an example of a developed nation with gay rights and all, but that (and to my own fault) may have been a bad example. I'm going to discount the US as a developed nation with gay rights protection on the basis of it's convoluted political landscape.

\- I speak on the scale of the globe, not just the US.

\- I'm not here to discuss whether homosexuals deserve rights or not. (imo this shouldn't be up for discussion and the answer is banana xd)"

I love my religion/culture. And I find it weird that in some religions, people try to get other people to join their religion. 

That’s another reason why Hindus or other Indian religions don’t evangelise/proselytize.

Imagine if you went to a different country/region and asked the  people there to live by your culture. They would probably think “no, we are not from your country,, we have our own traditions and values”

Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Buddhism etc  is part of Indian culture. Unless someone wants to adopt it, why we want them to?

Like you wouldn’t tell a foreigner to live by your culture just because you do?

So, we don’t tell people to adopt our traditions - unless they want to. They are ours.

I find it strange and very rude that people would want to convert others to their religion. It's extremely condescending and disrespectful that some people want everyone in the world to join their religion. One of the things that makes this world great, in my opinion, is different cultures, faiths and traditions - if you erase all but one, that takes a lot of the beauty of humanity away. I find that really sad.

You might say that in some religions, they have a command to spread their faith - this is true, but I say that it goes against the teaching that lots of religions have, which is respect, and respect should, in my view, is more important than how many people you have in your religion. The number of people you have in your religion, does not make it more true. That would be an ad populum fallacy, also known as appeal to popularity. 

You also might say that people try to convert people to save them from torture. Well, if that sort of theology is true, I would question if that belief comes from God or humans, and would still not want to convert people. I see proselytising and evangelism almost as bad as murder. It goes against my ethical values completely. 

Hindu religion believes that no particular religion is better than another; all genuine religious paths are facets of God's pure love and light, deserving tolerance and understanding. Hindu Sanatan Dharma not only teaches tolerance for other religions but respect as well. Everyone is entitled to their own path, and none should be mocked or persecuted. H The often quoted proverb that conveys this attitude is, ""Ekam sat bahudha Vedanti"" which means, ""Truth is one, paths are many."" No one path is correct; we are all striving for the same goal in our own unique way. It is this tolerance and belief in the all-pervasiveness of Divinity that has allowed India to be home to followers of virtually every major world religion for thousands of years. 

Change my view so I can understand the other perspective please."

0,2022-07-23,CMV: The 2nd amendment is more likely to end up taking away our other freedoms than protecting them,u/thehomiemoth,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w65a4a/cmv_the_2nd_amendment_is_more_likely_to_end_up/,changemyview,"A common argument I hear in favor of the second amendment is that it is ""the right that protects all the other rights"". Essentially that the second amendment gives us a check on the government and the ability to overthrow it, which would prevent any government from becoming tyrannical. This argument rests on 2 assumptions that I find flawed:

&amp;#x200B;

1. That the existing US constitutional government is the only (or at least most likely) source of removing our freedoms.
2. Guns are necessary to prevent that (which seems highly unlikely given the huge number of effective democratic societies worldwide without large scale gun ownership)
3. That whoever overthrew the government would do a better job of protecting our freedoms than the current US government.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I believe it is far more likely in this era that the second amendment would be used to remove rights and institute a right-wing dictatorship. I base this on the following ideas:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The vast majority of historical revolutions do *not* result in democracies. If you look at governments being overthrown throughout history, very rarely do they end up like the American Revolution. They tend to result in the most militant faction (ie the Jacobins, the Bolsheviks, the Nazis) taking power and instituting a single party state.
2. There is a strong current of right wing authoritarianism that is growing in militancy.  This is evidenced most strikingly by the attempted coup (not only of Jan 6, but the attempted legislative /legal coup by Republican leadership), but also by the growing number of extremist militia groups, an increasing lack of regard for democratic norms and institutions, voter suppression, growing support for conspiracy theories like qanon and the Big Lie, and an increasing removal from any objective truth which makes it easier to radicalize said group. If you convince half the population that elections are being stolen from them, it is reasonable to expect they will attempt to overthrow the government and institute one that follows their own interests.
3. There are significantly more firearms owned by those who  support right wing authoritarianism than those who  oppose it. This is not an argument I have great data for, but given that a significant preponderance of gun owners are conservative, and the increasing radicalization of the conservative population, it is highly likely (if it weren't, the gun ownership would have to be highly concentrated among a shrinking sliver of ""moderate conservatives"").
4. Informal militia groups have been a key component of enforcing the will of right wing governments in revolutionary periods throughout history (ie brownshirts, Black Hundreds). They are also recognized by several US government agencies, including the FBI, and several NGOs including the SPLC as being a key threat to the US government.

A hypothetical scenario might look something like this. It's 2028, and President DeSantis lost his re-election. However state legislatures in Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin overturn their election results and hand the electoral votes to DeSantis, giving him the win. There are mass protests against this obvious subversion of the will of the electorate but they are fired upon by right wing militias. The police, who are increasingly radicalized, let it happen or join in. They face no consequences, and soon become the enforcement police of a single party state a la the brownshirts, Black Hundreds, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Another scenario might involve a militant coup by these militia groups, armed radicalized citizens, and assisted by a radicalized police force, to simply overthrow a democratically elected government and institute a new constitutional order.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not arguing these scenarios (or any of the number of hundreds of others like it) are *more likely than not*. I am arguing that they are more likely than any scenario in which the second amendment is used to protect our freedoms rather than remove them.  In order to change my view, you would have to convince me that it is *more likely* that the second amendment would be used to protect freedoms than to take them away."

(read the first paragraph before skipping because it seems too long)",u/Sleepycoon,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w65psk/cmv_belief_in_god_isnt_a_choice_therefore/,changemyview,"There are two parts and you can skip to the second one at the end and still get the gist. The first (long) part is ""my personal story"" that explains where this view came from and why I believe it. The second (short) part is ""my actual view"", what won't change it, and how it can be changed. Tl;Dr at the end of that's still too much.



MY PERSONAL STORY:

I am approaching thirty and I'm not religious. I would describe myself as an agnostic atheist. I grew up in a Pentecostal, Evangelical, trinitarian, what I'm sure some would call fundamentalist, Protestant church. My father was the pastor, we were involved in district and national organization and I grew up meeting missionaries, going to events, spending time around leaders in the denomination, and interacting with not only fellow Christians but with learned and well respected teachers, preachers, and apologists.

I was always taught that we were saved by faith, not works. That all it took to become a Christian was to believe in Jesus, ask him into your heart, and ask forgiveness for your sins. I was taught that faith, belief, was the single most important part of christianity. That bad things happened to good people, prayers went unanswered, and overt miracles like in the Old testament never happened anymore because of faith. Because anything that would definitively prove the existence of God would remove the need for faith, and without faith there is no christianity. If we follow God simply because we know we have to, we are faithless.

I was taught that faith was so important because of free will. Free will is the one thing that separated us from the animals and the angels. It is the sole defining trait that makes us human. Our ability to make choices of our own free will is our most important asset. We are allowed to damn God and choose hell or accept God and live a life and an eternity unlike anything any other creature gets to experience because of our free will. If we lose our free will, we lose everything. Our faith in God is our free will.

If we could know for certain god exists, we wouldn't have faith, and without faith we're not making a choice. We are doing what has to be done, like an animal following its instinct. If we are presented two plates we can choose what to eat, but if we are told the plate on the left is poison that will kill us then the only viable choice is the plate on the right and therefore we have no choice. The entire reason humans exist is so that we can use our free will to choose to have faith and believe in God despite a lack of definitive evidence that we have to.

I never had a rebel phase where I wanted to act out against my parents religion just for the sake of being different or for finding my own identity away from them. I considered becoming a pastor or a missionary, I took Bible and theology courses, I spent thousands of hours watching and reading apologists and teachers and learning all I could about how to defend the faith. I was also a geek who liked learning about science and technology.

I started to hear opposing viewpoints when I watched debates to see how the pro apologists did it, when I I at he'd atheist YouTubers rebut Christian videos so I could sus out the holes in their logic, and when I learned more about the scientific explanations for demonic worldly 'magic'. I never had an aha moment that killed my faith, it was a slow steady death that started years before I even realized it was happening and that I fought to the bitter end. I desperately wanted to hold on to my faith, but I packed whatever ability some people seem to have to just shut of the logical and reasoning part of their brain when it came to realizations they disagreed with.

Once all of the wires had been connected in my head and the cognitive dissonance no longer allowed me to ignore the truth that I had known deep down for a long time, I finally admitted to myself that I didn't believe anymore and I hadn't for years and I had only been telling myself I still did because it was so ingrained in me my entire life that I had no other choice; my faith was dead. It can't come back. I didn't make a conscious decision to lose My faith, it just happened. I could start going to church again, I could keep studying and reading my bible, which I never stopped doing, I could start praying in earnest again, I could walk the walk and talk to talk and become a model christian, but none of that will bring my faith back. No More than a gay man marrying a woman and having kids and acting like the straightest man on the planet will make him heterosexual, no more than someone who truly genuinely deeply believes in God with every fiber of their being shouting from the rooftops that God isn't real, burning their bibles, and leaving the church will make them an atheist.



MY ACTUAL VIEW:

The fact that I did not choose to lose my faith, that to me not believing is as unchangeable and out of my control as whether or not I genuinely believe the sun will rise tomorrow or whether or not salmon will migrate North to their eggs means that when it comes to belief in god, I never exerted free will. I never chose to believe, I just believed because I didn't know anything else. I never chose to stop believing, I just stopped believing because my understanding of reality changed.

If in the eyes of Christianity humanity only exists to exert free will to choose whether or not and believing or not believing in God is not something that we exert our Free Will and choose to do then the basic premise of Christianity is invalid and therefore cannot be true.

I'm obviously not asking somebody to convince me to believe in God again because I genuinely don't think that's possible. I think this impossibility is why no matter irrefutable, insurmountable evidence science brings against common Christian ideologies people so rarely change their mind.

Any sort of argument that tries to convince me I'm lying, either to you or to myself, about the genuineness of my statements will be ignored. ""You didn't really stop believing you just _______""

Want to live in sin, don't want to feel guilty for your decisions, think that following God is too hard, are rebelling against your parents, are young and naive and think you know better, are blaming God for bad things that to you, hate god, had bad experiences with a church and are projecting on all churches, have been blinded by worldliness, have been tricked by the devil, haven't been going to church and/or reading the Bible and/or praying like you should, have drifted away from God and to get your life back on track, etc. These are all incorrect and none of them are arguments or talking points. I genuinely believe that I made no conscious choice to stop believing, and I cannot make a conscious choice to start believing again.

What will change my view is someone either pointing out a flaw in my logic and proving my statement is wrong, or proving that using our free will to choose to believe in God is not a requirement for a majority of Christian denominations. If you can somehow prove to me that I actually did consciously choose to stop believing or that I actually can consciously choose to stop believing again, that will also change my view. But I don't think that is possible.

Tl;Dr: If Christianity relies on making a conscious choice to believe in God (I think it does) and belief in god is not a conscious choice (I think it isn't) then Christianity isn't real. Prove either parenthesis or the logic of the statement as a whole wrong to cmv."
0,2022-07-23,CMV: Armageddon is an all-time great movie,u/jonesmanbob,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w660op/cmv_armageddon_is_an_alltime_great_movie/,changemyview,"I’ve seen Armageddon (Michael Bay movie from 1997) more than a half-dozen times and to me it’s one of the all time great movies. My friends however vehemently disagree and are baffled, would love folks on Reddit to CMV if possible.

Armageddon has a lot of amazing things that make it potentially an all-time classic:

1. Amazing acting and cast. The cast is superb set of A-listers. I especially found Billy Bob Thornton’s character to be compelling.
2. High stakes that connected with me emotionally. The President’s speech in the middle of the movie (while the characters are about to take off) was one of the most moving speeches by an on-screen politician.
3. Amazing character development
4. All time musical score with Liv Tyler’s dad producing an iconic song.


Btw I found Don’t Look Up to be a really bad and annoying movie (despite having a similarly star-studded cast).

Edit: okay I’m convinced that general consensus that it’s not Citizen Kane or The Godfather given the lack of IMDb and rotten tomatoes support. However would like someone to convince me I shouldn’t consider it really great."

Many cities used to use helicopters for roof to roof transport in the 50s and 60s, but unfortunately due to the association of helicopters in vietnam + plus cities being left wing, they stopped using them.

Helicopters are very eco-friendly and easy to maintain. They're small, compactable and fuel efficient. -But most importantly pretty cheap. the average cost of a helicopter is 20,000$ while a full subway train is like 10 times that.

Unlike other forms of transportations, they literally don’t need any infrastructure as they can take off and land from anywhere. We wouldn't have to start any massive infrastructure projects.

Finally. They are remarkably safe with only 50 people a year dying in crashes. The death rate in helicopters is 0.72 per 100,000 hours. While in cars, its 12.9 per 100,000 hours. That's like 10 times more deadly. So yes, helicopters proportionally are safer than cars. 

I'd love to see any counter arguments though."

0,2022-07-23,CMV: The reason civil debate between the left and right has ceased is due to demonization of both sides by the other.,u/InfiniteNullity,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w69cif/cmv_the_reason_civil_debate_between_the_left_and/,changemyview,"This is a view I have held for the majority of time I’ve followed politics. For context im a 19 yo college student and I consider myself very moderate as I have opinions from both sides that I agree with. For example I absolutely detest that Roe v. Wade was overturned, I believe the right to an abortion should absolutely be protected. On the other side I am quite fond of the capitalist system and while I recognize it’s faults, I still plan to utilize this economic system to benefit myself and my future family to the fullest. 

Now for the main argument of this post. I believe that civil discourse between opposing views is absolutely essential to reaching compromise and expanding your ideas in this world. I believe that the reason (most) people on both sides cannot even fathom considering the ideas of the opposing side is due to the demonization tactics used by both sides to make the other into the enemy. I believe most people have forgotten or choose to be willfully ignorant to the fact that end of the day BOTH SIDES WANT AMERICA TO BE BETTER AND PROSPEROUS. The only difference between these parties is that the path to this growth is different! It is much easier (and both parties use this knowingly to gain/keep followers) to just write off someone with opposing views as the enemy who wants to make this country fail or turn it into some dystopian hellhole. The problem is that nothing can ever get done when this is the mindset people have. There will never be a consensus on every topic and issue so it is essential to recognize different views and COME TO COMPROMISE. Personally I always make an effort to try to understand WHY someone believes what they do versus taking their view at face level. This allows me to either reflect on and change my view or have a respectful debate and perhaps make them reconsider their view. There is also the chance we still end up disagreeing but at the end of these conversations we can still respect that our different life experiences are what shaped these views. I believe if more people approached conversations on politics with this mindset we would be able to actually come to proper compromises and have proper discussions that further the knowledge and understanding of everyone. 

(When I refer to parties using things like demonization I am referring in general to party leaders and spokespeople.)

(Also don’t be afraid to ask me about specific political opinions I have on this post or through pms, I have a pretty diverse set of views and love to discuss with others)"

I can't write entire penal code so I'm not very specific.  Let us say I'm talking about crimes which **NORMALLY** induce intense amount of anger in the victim or anyone who loves the victim (family, friends etc ..)

1. A criminal raped a child and murdered him. **Allow parent or anyone murder or beat the the criminal anyway they want.** If they don't want that, then just throw them in prison for whatever the current norm is. 
2. Criminal murdered a wife. Let the husband kill or beat him  as he please. If not, let the current norm do the work.

.. and many other enraging crimes. 

**If you think it does not do good for anyone, let me ask you.** 

Can you forgive the guy who raped and killed your 5 y old daughter in front of you after tying you up ? Will you allow him to change and become functioning member of society just because he regret doing so ? Will you just suck it up  and give him a warm hug because he is a different person after spending couple of years in prison ?

This is just the idea and I'm not talking about all the crimes. Let the victim speak and let us try to understand the victim.

Possible counter points and their reply

1. Death penalty is barbaric.  ( Answer - To you it is, not to me.  )
2. Innocent person might be convicted and loose his chance to prove himself. ( Answer - Yes. That is why there is always some particular numbers of years needs to spend in prison before capital punishment. )

I think these are actually multi-billion dollar financial problems, happening on a global scale, that we trivialize as body confidence problems.

Our current strategy for trying to fight beauty standards is to expand the definition of beauty, but I think this just creates more beautiful women, without actually solving any of the fundamental problems. The makeup companies don’t care whether the lipstick women buy is red, or green, as long as it puts money in their pocket.

There have been millions of dollars spent trying to fight these as “body confidence problems”, but they have been funded by the beauty industry, and I think they have actually just made everything worse.

Income inequality is higher now in America than it was in the French Revolution with skyrocketing inflation in nearly every country combined with high gas prices, high food prices, high real estate prices,and stagnant wages. Most in my generation will never be able to afford a home or have enough money to start a family. Our political landscape (at least here in the United States) is getting worse as well. We are more polarized than ever before and for the first time in recent history the Supreme Court is taking away human rights rather than expanding on them. Republican politicians want to establish a theocratic fascist state since they are voting against legislation that guarantees basic rights like access to contraception and interracial marriage. This is all happening simultaneously as right wing organizations like the Proud Boys and others gain more popularity amongst young white males. Lastly is the climate change issue which is one that could very likely cause the complete collapse of society this century. Droughts and poor crop yields will increase food and water prices even more over the coming decades while natural disasters become costlier.

The phones I get for them will cost no more than $50 (maybe $100 after inflation,) and they'll be Androids, unless they request Apple phones, but the same pricing rules will still apply. I'll probably pick them up at pawn shops or discount stores.

Purchasing premium gaming features for real money (like to remove ads in a particular Android app game for $19.99, or 100 gold gems for $10, etc.) will require my and/or my future wife's approval and they will do chores and produce school assignments with high grades, in order to get paid. I'll likely put their monetary credits on a GreenLight debit card specially made for kids.

They will have a GPS tracking app so I know where they (their phones) are at all times, and everything they surf, text, snap and etc. Will be logged so I can review their usage later.

Giving 6 y.o.s their own phones will give me a peace of mind in knowing where they are at all times and that they're only a call or text away. 

Also, they'll never get bored while waiting to see a doctor, if they don't feel like playing with other kids at recess, if they can't understand and absorb the pastor's message while sitting at church, etc.

I think just 2-3 basic questions in the test would be enough. I am honestly surprised that this idea has not really been talked about much but i dont see why it couldn't work. Big retailers like Target and Walmart are already incorperating AI technology in detecting potential shoplifters and other people with nefarious intentions. Even if this idea is not incorporated into law i dont see why gun sellers like Walmart couldn't still use something like it. It would massively decrease their liability i think. If I owned a company that sold firearms I would definently want to implement a program like this. I can also see potential concerns with involving AI in what many consider to be their inalienable right. I suppose if it is 99.9% accurate there would still be approximately a 1 in 1000 chance of someone wrongly being denied a purchase.

Zeldin should ask the Department of Justice to attempt to get the man who attacked him mental help instead of sending him to prison.,u/ReviewEquivalent1266,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w6n5l7/cmv_rep_zeldin_should_ask_the_department_of/,changemyview,"Shortly after David Jakubonis attempted to attack Rep Lee Zeldin on Thursday he was arrested by police in New York. Frustratingly state authorities released him shortly after on his own recognizance. Today Jakubonis was arrested by the FBI and is being held by the Department of Justice as he awaits a detention hearing. This action by the DOJ was necessary and appropriate.

That being said, after watching the video of the 'attack' I can't help but point out that it was barely an attack. It was a pathetic assault by a drunk and confused man. Jakubonis told authorities he did not know who Zeldin was at the time. Evidently Jakubonis is a decorated veteran who lost the mother of his twins, his job in 2015 and has been struggling with addiction. He is clearly in need of serious mental help and rehabilitation. 

It occurs to me that the DOJ MUST throw the book at this guy - we can't allow people to attack sitting Congressmen - but Rep Zeldin could (and I think should) step forward and ask the DOJ to show leniency and try to find a way to get this guy the mental help he needs instead of sending him to jail."

For once, the MCU has developed a show that's not merely  about good guys beating up bad guys. It's a lot more complex than that. It deals with Marc's personal struggles, marriage struggles, his broken and damaged mind, his PTSD, his insecurities and fears, his feelings of worthlessness and low self esteem. Plus, the guy's really handsome too lol.

It's also a show that feels less marvel-like than other shows. The Egyptian aspect of it reminds me of something like the movie Stargate. It explores the Egyptian mythology and magic behind Moon Knight's superpowers, his God's, the afterlives, etc. It is soo well written, and I honestly think that the Moon Knight is the best marvel character MCU has to offer to date.

Many of these complain that “it's not b.d.s.m.” due to the lack of consent or the lack of consent in general to which the fans typically reply in an annoyed fashion that no one claimed it was, that the fact that it's non-concensual is obviously the point and that they want them to leave them alone. I recently interacted with someone who claims that this is done because “people confuse the two”, but I've never seen any inistance of this happening and asked that an instance be produced, which yielded nothing. The people that like it seem to not use words such as “b.d.s.m.” to describe it but simply “rape”, “forceful” or similar terms. The people that dislike it don't seem to think so either.

All that seems to exist are indeed some people that initially mistakenly thought it was “b.d.s.m.” and then find out it isn't and in some cases become angry over it and complain that it is not, but I'm certainly not seeing anyone confusing it."

The two forms of sexual activity are viewed as different in kind, one as legitimate, one as either too niche to share publicly (sort of like a fetish) or illegitimate (because non-procreative). Furthermore, one results in something that is impossible to conceal. Thank you.

Having visible hickeys is often considered trashy, unprofessional, and immature, because it provides evidence of physical/sexual activities with your partner that are supposed to remain private. At the same time, I know of nobody who takes issue with a couple announcing that they are pregnant, or saying things like ""We have been trying for a while now,"" even though this obviously and implies that they have been having sex with each other.

Either the disapproval of hickeys is an irrational cultural taboo, or people should shut up about having babies.

Examples in politics include Hillary Clinton and George W / Jeb Bush.   Do you really think they could have got to where they were if it wasn't for Bill Clinton and George H W Bush?   However, even in the private sector there is a lot of nepotism.   It's not as obvious but it's still there.

The problem is that the decisions made by people who gain power through nepotism are driving the United States and the World right into the ground.   The younger generations now have the opportunity to learn the lesson that you cannot tolerate nepotism.

Edit: The race issue was brought up.   I want to point out that solutions to the race issue can also become nepotist.   You can still choose insiders and favor friends and select from another racial group as a strategy to keep things in the inside but change the ethnic composition."
1402,2022-07-24,"CMV: BLM protesting the Tekle Sundberg shooting and heckling the victim shows no rationality, only blind hatred of police, and BLM leadership should denounce the protests in order to mitigate this loss of legitimacy.",u/Pangolinsftw,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w6zfsz/cmv_blm_protesting_the_tekle_sundberg_shooting/,changemyview,"It unfortunately seems to be a pattern that Black Lives Matter frequently protests the death of people who are justifiably shot by police, often with damning bodycam footage to that end.

This too is the case with the shooting of Tekle Sundberg, who shot up a woman's apartment with her children inside and after a 6 hour standoff after repeatedly shooting at police.

What's truly egregious about this case in my opinion is that the woman whose apartment was shot up by Tekle Sundberg [showed up at the protest](https://twitter.com/DeevonRahming/status/1548439171693367301?t=Yv6Cz4nla5WTiTcLWwER1g&amp;s=19) and expressed her anger that BLM was protesting the shooting of this man who shot up her apartment with she and her kids inside.

Rather than listening in cowed silence, or better, collectively agreeing that maybe they got it wrong this time and shutting down the protest out of respect for the victim, the BLM protestors heckle the woman saying things like:

""You're alive, shut up!""

""You're alive!"" another protestor says. I'm deeply puzzled by the intended meaning here: are they saying that it's *wrong* for police to shoot someone who not only fired at this woman and her children, but fired at police? Do people genuinely believe this kind of situation doesn't warrant the shooter being taken out? Truly baffling mentality. You can say he's mentally ill, but being mentally ill doesn't mean we allow people to try to murder others.

""She's obviously going through a moment"", another protestor says. Like **holy shit** are you even listening? This woman is telling you her harrowing account of having a stalker shoot up her apartment with her family inside and how her kids are going to be scarred for life and she can't sleep at night and you say *that?* Incredible. Are you even open to understanding the facts of the case? This statement shows a staggering level of irrationality and blind zeal - if this is a common mentality in the BLM movement, that is deeply troubling.

""Shut up! Shut up, bitch!"" other protestors shout. Nice.

""He tried to kill me in front of my kids!"" the woman shouts repeatedly to end the video.

I can understand her frustration. It must be infuriating and bizarre to know that in a case where the undisputed facts show that a criminal fired shots into an apartment with a woman and her children *and* fired at police, still he was gifted with a 6 hour standoff to try to talk him down but he repeatedly refused and threatened police until he was finally shot by a sniper.

If I were the leadership of BLM, I would be very concerned about this kind of publicity. Given the circumstances I think it's only proper that they make a public statement about how the treatment of this victim during the protest was unconscionable and malicious, and how the shooting of Tekle Sundberg was likely justified. By the way, has BLM ever made such a statement? Do they ever admit that maybe a police shooting was justified? If not, isn't that kind of concerning?

At this point, I see BLM as an illegitimate organization (they already have a [scandal](https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/blm-co-founder-admits-she-held-parties-at-mansion-bought-with-donor-funds-black-lives-matter-patrisse-cullors-malibu-florida-global-network-foundation-blmgnf) about embezzling funds). Ideologically, it seems like BLM is willing to protest even completely justified police shootings, having no interest in the facts of the case. They seem unwilling to even entertain the idea that justified shootings are a thing. This marks them as an organization of zealous, ignorant, radical anti-police hatred - even going so far as to heckle and insult the victim of an attempted murder if she berates them for protesting the man who tried to kill her, which should offend any rational person.

0,2022-07-24,CMV: the term “assault weapon” is a perfectly appropriate way for the media and others to describe the guns often used by mass shooters,u/fredinNH,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w7055s/cmv_the_term_assault_weapon_is_a_perfectly/,changemyview,"Very often when the media or random citizens use the term “assault weapon” they get a lot of pushback from gun enthusiasts and others who point out that it’s not a real or accurate description of any one particular firearm. You will see people reply with the gotcha question “define assault weapon”, and a conversation will ensue that invariably results in a pointlessly long-winded essay on esoteric minutiae related to firearms. 

Here’s the thing - the majority of Americans don’t own a gun or know a whole lot about them. It would be silly for the media to give an exact description of each gun used in each mass shooting. It makes more sense to use a catch-all term that gives the reader an instant idea of what was used, along with the name of the gun so those who are interested can look into it more on their own. 

The reason they’ve gone with “assault weapon” is probably because the department of justice defined the term in 1994 when the now-defunct assault weapons ban was passed into law. Their definition at the time:

* *In general, assault weapons are semiautomatic firearms with a large magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid fire and combat use*

Now certainly one could argue that they have a lot of non-combat uses, which they do, but
the term has been used so often and for so long that it now appears on multiple definition platforms with a particular meaning that correlates to the dept of justice meaning from 1994. 

Wikipedia, Websters, and dictionary.com all use the same basic definition from the 1994 legislation. 

We all know what an assault weapon is. It’s a semiautomatic gun that can accept a large-capacity magazine thereby making it possible for the shooter to fire a large amount of bullets in a short period of time. Having this basic understanding of what was used in a tragic event is a good thing and gun enthusiasts and others who think it’s a bad term should accept it. Change my view."

 But- earlier this year I went to talk to my friends' friends. And they asked me whether I was left or right, I said I didn't really care about politics. Which prompted me to be banned from the server and then blocked by all of them. Sometimes on reddit I suggest a different talking point politely and get permanently banned from the subreddit. 
I think I said ""Right wingers are very pro speech"" (wasn't even meant as a compliment) and I got banned for simping for nazis. For reference the reddit wasn't even politics based. I think it was r/selfawarewolves or something.

My significant other and their family are all pro-choice and pro-mandatory vaccines, and most left-leaning people I know are as well. I am pro-choice, but I believe vaccination is a personal decision that is up to each individual. 

The reasonings people believe in each of these things, to my understanding, is as follows:

Pro-choice - It is up to each individual to make decisions regarding their own body, especially where medical care is concerned. No one can be coerced into doing anything with their body against their own will.

Pro-mandatory vaccines - Everyone needs to be vaccinated to ensure herd immunity. The well-being of society at large takes precedence over your own decision making, and the statistics show that it is better to get vaccinated for each individual anyway.

I believe the arguments for bodily autonomy present in the pro-choice viewpoint are incompatible with the lack of bodily autonomy in the pro-mandatory vaccine argument. I don’t believe the fact that getting vaccinated is a good medical decision overrides the fact that it should be up to each individual. My viewpoint can be changed if you can convince me that my premises are wrong, or that these views are not incompatible somehow.

EDIT: I am aware of the “your rights end where someone else’s begin” argument. I am arguing that my right to not get vaccinated is more important than the risk that places on others, because I strongly believe in bodily autonomy. My view can also be changed here if you can convince me that bodily autonomy is less important than the risk that not getting vaccinated places on others."

* the universe is more massive than we humans can wrap our heads around
* there is no reason life must be caron-based
* there is no reason we, or any other life form cant evolve into or create another life form.
* a common theory of earth's origin of life includes the impact of 2 objects, possibly resulting in life on earth and mars.

Ok.

I don't buy the ""great filter"" theory: I assign quite a high probability that humans will pass any sort of ""filter"" that does exist. From our humble origins as single-celled organisms, humans have progressed way too far way too fast. On a million+-year timeframe, we are on the cusp of creating ""artificial intelligence"" (non-carbon-based life) living on other planets. These would go undetected to other alien lifeforms far away. Said AI wouldn't be self-sustainable on the first attempt, but after enough tries, we would successfully seed self-sustaining AI on another planet. We will ensure said AI life were non-hostile to intelligence life, and given in cases where this is met, desirous of expansion. The AI life would thrive on its planet and begin to evolve itself. Eventually, the AI would evolve to the point it didn't need to life on its seed planet (and any planet for that matter) and, fulfilling its desire to expand, set off to live forever in empty space. This would be a version of ""successful AI""

The true origin of life would attempt to create successful AI a finite number of times until knew it succeeded (what's the point after that?). Those finite number of life would either go extinct, or evolve and become successful AI themselves. In either case, we end up with a finite number of non-successful AI life on planets because any life capable of creating successful AI would do so, or know it already exists and not try. This is why planets in the universe are not teeming with life: life is not bound to physical planets and such.

So where do humans fit into all this? My money is origin of life on Earth stems from the true origin of life attempting to seed the universe with life. This would explain the theory a life-seeded asteroid began our life on Earth.

Note: This comes on the heels of listening to Lex Fridman's podcast with Martin Rees entitlted Black holes, alien life, dark matter and the big bang. Most (all?) of this theory is shared by Rees.

Interested in having my view changed because a lot of people talk about polyamoury as though it's the way they are, not the way they live, and I'm wondering what I'm missing.

The way I see it, polyamoury is a lifestyle or a type of relationship. If you're in a monogamous relationship you're monogamous, if you're in a poly relationship you're poly, if you're single I suppose it'd depend on what type of relationship you're seeking. But it seems to me like a choice. Sure some people might be more suited to being poly than others, but it still seems like a choice."

I also don't know if this is the  right sub, its title is about changing my views so I am posting here, mods please be kind.

So the thing is I don't like certain characters, mainly main characters and I am not able to enjoy most of the fiction due to that. I dislike a character and if that character is main character which in most cases is, I drop the show, book, anime or whatever I am watching/reading.

This change in my views started almost 11 months ago when I started watching anime. It was all good, I watched some famous ones like Death Note, My Hero Academia, Tokyo Ghoul, Dragon Ball Franchise(I watched it earlier when I was kid too), Rent a gf , Monster etc. But after some time, I started becoming discontent from shounen series that how their main characters were most privileged in the show, talked about some ""hard work"", had a lot of plot armor etc. And I instantly dropped famous shows like Naruto, Bleach etc. after just 5-10 episodes. I carried on to Demon slayer because I liked its animation but now it is really unwatchable for me especially after season 2 fight.

In my mind I am always ready to fight from fans of shounen and I felt that I have became arrogant over time. This hate then spread to almost every media. I liked villains more because how they were defeated by hero always even if they were stronger just because they were villains. Or how main characters get best girl almost always even if good deserving side characters exist, just because he was main character.

Its not that I only hate heroes, I also hate some villains mostly from fiction like Saw where villain almost escapes doing bad even if they were easily catchable, i.e I hate reverse plot armored villains which are mostly shown in gore, horror type fiction.

One thing I really hate is plot armor which is when a character escapes an unescapable situation by some unbelievable method(which is powerups in anime) just because plot requires them.

Can someone please change my view? How can I love fiction as it is and stop that bad, blood boiling type feeling when I see main characters win or something like that?

I will list my problems :

\- Plot armor

\- Heroes winning always

\- Main characters changing rules of their world just because they are main characters

\- Strange feeling when I see above mentioned things in any fiction.

&amp;#x200B;

I enjoyed some anime which are shounen like Attack on Titan."

The lack of control also means a lack of knowledge which scares me more, I have no idea what the noises mean and if they’re normal or not, it’s super disorientating to feel the plane turning but have no clue where the actual destination is and, worst of all is turbulence, especially not knowing when it’ll randomly start up.

2,2022-07-25,cmv: the USA is much better place to live for professionals than EU,u/MarekBekied,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w7grdl/cmv_the_usa_is_much_better_place_to_live_for/,changemyview,"I don't know how to start so I'll just list here my standings and explain them below:

(I'm from EU)

Salaries in the USA are much higher than in EU

It drives me crazy how big is the pay gap between the same positions in the USA and EU. I did NOT make a long research on that but just from looking at some i.e. Tech positions you can see there is 20-40% pay gap on the exact same positions. EU tax rates are a f joke, we contribute to our future pensions, heath care system (which apparently seems to be better in the USA) etc. Now someone can make a valid point ""health care in the USA is EXPENSIVE"" and that is undoubtedly true. However if you have a decent job your employer probably provided you with a decent health insurance and still making 20-40% more and saving some of it in case of a bad days is far better (imo) than relaying on the public health care in EU. Pension tax is also a joke, in most cases i have literally no control over my contribution, many things can happen, crisis, new government I'm not even considering what has happened in Greece...

The whole 'quality of life'

EU employee has more paid off days, vacations, sick days etc. In most cases americans will not have the same privileges - that's true. However again having a decent job will still give you some of those EU 'sweet' privileges while still having a higher salary. Btw what is the point of having so much free weeks in a year while your wage will not allow you to travel as much and as hard as americans do in a few days? You can relax stay at home go to a local restaurant and the cinema? Sounds like an average weekend to me. Sharing a flat is much more common in EU because of the sky high rent prices (compared to salaries).

Living as a single guy

In EU (for example Germany) there are even special taxes for people who are single and for those married. What? Wtf is that. Why a single man or woman is punished for being single? I'm not talking about having kids, and if you do you can reckon on some money from government, i understand kids are expensive but hey guess what people in the USA also have kids, and I'm almost sure they don't have as much social help as EU offers. And of course the accommodation prices..

I think for now it's all. Note these are just mine thoughts on this topic. I MIGHT be wrong and I probably AM, I'd say more, I'd love to be wrong as i live in EU and maybe there are things I'm not considering so my calculations/thoughts are misleading! Anyways try to CMV."

I understand what they are feeling but they're targeting the wrong person. 

Stage comedy is the one podium that is meant for making jokes about any kind of people. It's not reflecting on the views of the person who makes the joke. It's an opportunity to put any subject in any light without judgment of the content of what's being said. 

Stand up what society desperately needs to reflect on itself. By prohibiting comedians from taking a stage because of what they're saying on the stage, society is lacking in one of its most important tasks: being able to take a blow. 

Comedians are the jesters of modern day society. They have the specific task to make a mockery out of anything and everything. When someone doesn't like to mocked, that's who they'll mock. 

Comedians are not politicians. Comedy shows are no political rallies. If you go to a comedy show and you expect to hear someone's personal views on things, you're in the wrong place. 

Comedians need a carte blanche. The only thing they should be judged on is whether they are funny or not. Everything else is within limits.

If you don't think it's funny, then don't go. Just don't take anything a jester says personally. If you feel attacked, if anything, it's a call for self reflection.

Edit - delta because Chappelle should view himself as a jester. But he defends his points off stage and therefore he jeopardizes his role as a comedian."

This is partially inspired by the situation that happened at a Walgreens when a clerk refused to sell a couple condoms.

Now to specify, this refers to secular jobs. Not churches, religious schools and so on so forth. Run of the mill jobs.

Here are my issues with the situation and why I see it as a dangerous trend

\#1 It's forcing your beliefs on to other people

Pretty basic. ""My religions bans X so I am banning X for everyone"". Nobody should have the right to do that. Your religion is your own thing. It does not give you blanket allowance to  meddle into other persons lives. The whole ""Saving your soul from damnation"" (For Christians specificially) does not apply when you are working a job. You were hired to do that job, not to convert and harass people.

If your job forces you to go against your beliefs. GET ANOTHER JOB.

\#2 You can bullshit your way to discriminate against anyone on religious grounds

Religious texts are open to interpretation in a lot of places, sometimes self contradictory. So one can easily create a reason to deny anyone service. American evangelicals have used the bible to justify everything from slavery to lynching to denying people medical service (AIDS crisis). This should not be a legally protected right because it's so dangerous.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine the following more dire scenarios.

A man runs into a pharmacy and needs medicine Z asap. Matter of life and death. The clerk refuses to sell it because it was developed with stem cells. What happens then? What if there isn't a manager on call to check him out instead? Congratulations, a person died by the clerk held true to their beliefs.

Imagine a bunch of firefighters leaving an active fire because ""It's the sabath now, we can't work""

Am I the only one who sees allowing this as complete and utter insanity?"

There is definitely a bit of a fetish for and bias towards being extroverted and it is generally seen as a good thing while introversion is not. 

I would argue that the most socially adept people are actually those that are best at balancing between extrovert and introvert traits. being loud and having a “big personality” all the time is quite maladaptive and actually a sign of poor social skills.

I can see the responses already arguing this is not how people see it, but I am not debating whether or not society does see it this way or not because at least in American culture its is painfully true that extrovert=good social skills. There is an extreme a fetish for extroverts in the west."

That being said, I was raised in the catholic church most of my life growing up. I hated most of it. But I got to witness the positives of the church and what they did for the community. They were a hub for those in need. They were free guidance to people who felt lost. I never got anything but unconditional love and support from the church (for the most part) even if I thought they were misguided in their beliefs. With all of this talk about Christian Nationalism, and these bigots making policies in the name of God, the Bible, whatever, I thought I was important to recognize some of the good that churches can do for communities. If they weren't around, I can't imagine where some of these people would be at. I mean take the AA program. Religious and church lead from its inception. Or food drives for the homeless. Sponsorship programs around Christmas. Most churches are completely unlike the extremes that get portrayed on TV and movies. It's mostly just a bunch of boring adults circle jerking about how much they love God. Weird but harmless. Don't let policy makers put a bad taste in their mouth. They are just attempting to manipulate a more susceptible population, but from what I've seen most reject it as much as we do. Hate the GOP, not the church.

Edit 1: Alright so big main edit. This is such a morally complex situation considering the history of the church with systematic ignoring rampant pedophilia and pockets of extremes. On an additional note for context, I was raised in the catholic church in a mostly progressive community. I know the experience is likely different in different cities, some of the protestant groups, and especially if you were openly gay. I do not agree with any of the positions those churches have. The spirit of this post was to challenge the perspective that all churches were extreme in their stances, trying to influence public policy, and their members were ignorant Bible thumpers incapable of critical or rational thought. For me and for many, our experience with the church has been pleasant and welcoming. Even if you are atheist, gay, liberal, whatever. The churches I attended never took firm stances on who deserves to go to hell, and they often avoided divisive issues for fear of alienating their congregation. Most catholics don't believe everything the church teaches. And for the most part these churches do a good job of supporting those in need (even if they don't share the faith). I've been a part of numerous service projects that were affiliated with the church that had no religious orientation other than being comprised of churchgoers. These churches preach generosity and altruism and help a lot of people who attend those churches. So while they may not be great for everyone they are still a positive influence on most of their attendees and even some who aren't. While I am atheist I do believe in their right to have their faith and I appreciate the support and guidance they've given to me and people around me throughout the years. We may not agree on everything, but with the exception of some major flaws that need to be addressed they do have a positive influence. Whether or not the pros outweigh the cons, is as you can tell very debatable. It's easy to rationalize that if we had the churches resources without the church that we could do so much more good, but our government and community organizations don't often reflect that. Until the day comes where they can, I still love and appreciate the churches support for our communities. But for the love of God, they need to address their pedo issue."

I think anyone who has suffered and wanted to die for a long time should be allowed to die painlessly, with medical help if needed. I think of this as similar to body autonomy and personal freedoms. I would personally never choose to kill myself, but I can see why some people would. I don’t think it’s a great moral failing to do so, and I think refusing to let people die when they want is more for the benefit of those that survive them. Suicide is the right choice for some individuals, and only they can decide what’s right for them.

Edit: someone reported me to Reddit as a suicide risk lol It’s baffling to me how humans can’t have a logical conversation about suicide without resorting to threats. I would personally never choose suicide, I really value my life and try to live in the moment. But I am not egocentric enough to believe everyone feels this way, or arrogant enough to think I should decide how long everyone lives.

I have probably gone to the Movie Theater over 40 times in the last year.  The other day I saw Nope in IMAX, (a Hard R Horror film), and a group of people wheeled in a baby stroller, with an infant at the bottom row. This was a 7:00 IMAX showing, and IMAX is famous for having very loud sound, (And this one was even louder than the usual IMAX screenings I have seen)

The second I saw the stroller I knew this would be rough. The child cried for 2 HOURS STRAIGHT. I do not blame the kid at all. But why do people bring a kid to a movie like that?  I thought to myself they shouldn't have even let them in the theater, Of course, an infant is going to disrupt a Horror movie.

These people KNEW their child would be upset, Any child would cry in an environment like that. It is just so inconsiderate. I was extremely bothered by it, and I saw people in front of me shaking their heads while the baby screamed at the top of its lungs. I don't blame the child at all. But the theater shouldn't have even let them in, or the second it started crying they should have kicked it out. This should be normalized.

Also, Teenagers will go to movie theaters in droves, and act like fools, disrupting the entire movie. I really think Theaters should have a zero-tolerance no refund policy for people like this, Even people who forget to silence their Cell-phones. It is ridiculous. People are so inconsiderate. I'm sure people will say ""Why not wait to watch it at home"" But I usually go to IMAX which you cant replicate at home.

I also saw Dune 2 times in IMAX, And someone a few rows in front of me was watching a Football Game on his phone. (He ended up leaving halfway in though) That one really got my blood boiling. 

It is like in every film now there's always someone who ruins the film. I am sure at this point I am hypersensitive to it. But going to the movies is a form of therapy/coping mechanism for me.

Also, a new trend I've noticed is people being a good 30 minutes late for the movie. When I saw Multiverse Of Madness, a manager came out after 30 minutes past the start time and apologized and said there is still a bunch of empty seats that sold so we have to wait, Ended up starting 50 minutes late.

I really think Theaters should Kick people out like this, They should monitor Theaters, Stop them from becoming a Playground."

Take the new Lord of the Rings show, the Ring of Power, or the Game of Thrones.

I suppose the issue is when the creators of these series say they are ""staying faithful"" to the originals, but do not do so. Some deviation should be allowed, but the creators of the new series should definitely not claim they are being faithful."

Whenever I see people espouse views similar to mine in this forum, they are consistently attacked as transphobic/hatemongering/fascist etc, and I haven't yet seen a compelling argument as to why that is. I'd like my view changed because I consider myself an egalitarian who doesn't hold hatred in my heart for any group of people, and it bothers me that my view on this matter is considered to be conservative rhetoric masking a hatred of trans people.

What I believe:
1. I believe that gender identity does not exist, and that there is only sex, which is determined by a person's sex chromosomes. I believe this because the concept of an innate ""gender identity"" does not jive with my experience as a human. I don't ""feel like"" a man, I just am one because I was born with XY chromosomes. I believe this to be the experience of anyone not suffering from dysphoria. The concept of gender identity seems to me to be invented by academics as a way to explain transgender people without hurting anyone's feelings with the term ""mental illness"".

2. As hinted above, I believe transgender people are suffering from a mental illness (gender dysphoria) that causes them to feel that they are ""supposed"" to be the opposite sex, or that their body is ""wrong"". This causes them significant distress and disruption to their lives.

3. The best known treatment for this illness is for the person in question to transition, and live their life as though they were the opposite sex. This is different for everyone and can include changing pronouns, gender reassignment surgery, etc.

4. Importantly, I FULLY RESPECT trans people's right to do this. I will happily refer to them by whatever pronouns they prefer, and call them whatever name they prefer, and otherwise treat them as though they are the sex they feel they should be. This is basic courtesy, and anyone who disagrees is a transphobic asshole. Further, I do not judge them negatively for being born with a mental illness. The stigma against mentally ill people in this country is disgusting, and I don't want to be accused of furthering that stigma.

5. I don't believe there is a ""trans agenda"" to turn more people trans or turn kids trans. That is straight lunacy. The only agenda trans people have is to be treated with the same respect and afforded the same rights as everyone else, which again I fully support.

6. The new definition for woman and man as ""anyone who identifies as a woman/man"" is ridiculous. It is very obviously circular, and I've seen many intelligent people make themselves look like idiots trying to justify it. ""Adult male/female human"" is a perfectly good definition. If more inclusive language is desired you can use ""men and trans-men"" or ""women and trans-women"" as necessary. It's god damned crazy to me that Democratic politicians think it's a good idea to die on this stupid hill of redefining common English words to be more inclusive instead of just using the more verbose language. This is not a good political strategy for convincing voters outside of your base, and it will be detrimental to trans rights in the long run.

I feel I have sufficiently expressed my view here, but I undoubtedly forgot something. However I've already written a novel, so I think that's it. PLEASE do not make assumptions about my view that I have not explicitly stated.

Edit: I'm stepping away now because I need to eat dinner. I will return later -- I am close to having my view changed!"

A game being exclusive to a storefront (Epic Games Store is the obvious example) is a mild inconvenience but that’s about it. I can’t fathom the amount of online controversy surrounding the topic. 

I spend most of gaming time on PC and got used to games being on different stores years ago. Outside of the initial install, the only “difficult” part about launching a game on a different store is clicking a different icon to launch it. I get the “it’s anti-competitive” arguments, but I have a hard time believing people would be reacting the same way if Steam were the ones signing exclusivity deals. In the same breath, literally all console manufacturers do this. While, again, it sucks, but at least the gatekeeping only involves the free software you use to launch the game and not some $400+ piece of hardware. 

Once I’ve launched a game, I completely forget what store I opened it with. I feel like I’m taking crazy pills whenever I see a Reddit thread complaining about this."

People are perpetually fat across cultures, no one bats an eye. 

People are perpetually lazy and don't go to the gym/study/etc people make jokes about it and sort of accept it.

Someone pops Adderall to study, everyone judges them heavily.

Someone injects testosterone to be more confident, enhance athletic performance, everyone judges them heavily.

*""There's a health risk""* some would say.

Of course there is, there is a health risk associated with everything we do. And yet, for some reason the health risks of performance enhancing drugs are seen as a ""bad"" or ""dumb"" thing to do by most people.

You hop into a car? That's a health risk. You drink all the time? That's a massive health risk! You're really fat? Even bigger! Arguably, simply being a sedentary fat guy is infinitely more damaging to your long term health than being an athletic doper. Furthermore, is it really just quantity of life society should be concerned with? Or also quality? What if, being an enhanced performer makes someone extremely happy, motivated, and pleased with life? Compare Ben Johnson to the average guy his age and you tell me who's healthier. 

*""It's unfair""* some would say.

Of course it is. Life is unfair. Some people are born 6ft tall with perfect facial features, myostatin inhibition, a deep charismatic voice, and a 200+iq. How is that anymore fair than the guy with average genetics who took drugs to improve themselves? This is probably the worst argument. 

""*If it isn't shunned, it will be seen as normal and the bar for everyone gets raised""*

Well, honestly this argument might be convincing...if it wasn't already the case, and if that hasn't been pretty much par for the course of human societal advancement in general. A hundred years ago knowing algebra was like genius level...now it's par for the course. Your 12 year old knows it. Every generation is being demanded to know more and to know it better than the generation before them. PEDs are simply the next iteration of that. If anything, removing the stigma will hopefully lead to advances in technology that make it both safer *and* more effective. Better yet, gene doping! 

Imagine...a world where everyone is a genius, young, hot, talented? That sounds like hell!

&amp;#x200B;

I am getting off topic though, it's not that performance enhancing drugs should be promoted to everyone...my view is simply that we should view PED use the same way our society has grown to view many other things about human beings...your body your choice."

Drug prohibition is not only ineffective, but is utterly counterproductive at achieving the intended goals. Despite an estimate 1 trillion dollars being spent to support the policy since being implemented in 1971, overdose deaths, opiate addiction, incarceration for drug related crimes, and even recreational drug use in general, are each at an all time high.

Drug abuse and addiction cost American society more than $740 billion annually in lost workplace productivity, healthcare expenses, and crime-related costs.

Doing a little rough math, I think we could supply all substance abusers with an amount of drugs to maintain their addiction for around 20 billion per year. Let's double that to make sure their satisfied and not committing crime for more. 

Detox and 90 days rehab costs come in at 20k very generously. For 420 billion, we could send every substance abuser to a posh rehab once a year. 

That would leave us with 270 billion dollars to allocate towards overdose prevention, community outreach programs, mental healthcare, and other harm reduction measures before we reach what the current situation costs us every year. 

Legalizing drugs and providing them for free would eliminate much more than what is counted as ""drug related"" crime. It would have profound, positive effects in ways we can't completely comprehend. 

A policy that provides free drugs, encourages free treatment for substance abuse disorder, and increased mental healthcare is the only logical, moral, and effective way to address the problem of addiction in our society.

EDIT:

I would like to add something. I realized above I made a mistake by using several points to paint a picture against drug prohibition in-between a sandwich of my opinions on the opposing views I would like changed and it's made things less clear than they could be! 

I believe that drug prohibition policies such as the ones found in America are counterproductive and amplify the issues of drug use within a society, and I believe that drug liberalization policies that incorporate medical treatment for addiction that includes free drugs are vastly more effective at reducing the impact of drug use on a society, reducing the impact of drug use on the individual, and reducing the prevalence of disordered drug use within a society. 

I look forward to any and all discussion that intends to switch my opinions of these two opposing views, or attempts to target my beliefs on either!"

Their economic and climate change policies are widely popular to majority of Americans. Yes, I am aware that gerrymandering unfortunately plays a big effect, but there bigger reasons why they have been and are projected to lose to the Republicans this midterm season.

1.) Stop calling every moderate and Republican facists/nazis. I think this plays into the right’s “cancel culture” that they have been feeding into many voters, and quite frankly, isn’t true. Many republican voters do not pay that much attention to politics, and they’re not all facists that are part of some secret “White Nationalism” plan and turn America into a theoracy.

2.) Allow abortions only during rape, incest, and if mothers life in danger. While it is true a majority of Americans support Roe vs Wade, that number declines into a small minority if you say a woman should get an abortion in ALL cases. Many R voters vote R because of only abortion, and if you adjust that, it will swing many single issue voters to D.

3.) Stop saying men can get pregnant, can have periods, and associating the party and the “left” with encouragement of drag queens. Don’t abandon the trans, but don’t make it a focal point. Many people see that as the main face of the Democratic platform, which if you agree with transitioning or not, is hurting Ds.

The government is leaving poisonous food out: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/magazine/australia-cat-killing.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/magazine/australia-cat-killing.html?referringSource=articleShare

Aboriginal (indigenous) Australians eat cats they find outside:

The government (secretly) sent men with guns to shot cats that a conservation agency was taking care of:
https://www.alleycat.org/harmless-cat-community-massacred-and-mutilated-in-australia/

Now that I’ve explained the situation, I would like to offer some alternative ideas I believe the Australians could do instead of poisoning, eating, or shooting cats. I read that neuter/spaying cats then releasing them isn’t a good option because they can still kill birds after they’re released. So, why don’t they simply not release the cats? 

My first idea: they build huge enclosures (almost like a zoo) where the cats can live the rest of their days out in peace (while not hurting birds). The Australian government might even make some money doing this. Because I would assuming having a cat zoo would bring in a lot of visitors. Additionally, they could make it where people can adopt the cats. Imagine all the international tourists who go to the cat zoo while visiting Australia, fall in love with a cat, and take it back home. 

Honestly, I realize how that idea is a stretch. But it brings my point that I feel like the Australians could do SOMETHING other than killing the cats. There has to be some other option? Potentially they could send the cats to other countries, or declaw the cats, or build enclosures to protect the birds?

The reason I bring my argument up here is that I really want someone to change my view. I want to believe that this is the only option. Because it’s depressing and heartbreaking to think that there are other options yet Australia decided to go with the mass killing one. Also, I always liked Australians and I feel like I owe them the benefit of the doubt and hearing them out before I judge them.

So please feel free to try to justify why Australia is doing this."

Offense is not mine to decide, it's the other party's. But I'm here to talk about whether the term itself is intrinsically offensive. Like, say, the word faggot. Using it ever with the actual meaning is pretty bad. I also think that referring to a trans person as a futa is actually offensive. While the word, to my knowledge, stems from the Japanese word for hermaphrodite, it is entirely understandable why most trans people would not want to be called this. I am not arguing that. 

I don't think the word futa is offensive because it refers to a subgenre of hentai and smut. In these properties, a futa is usually a kind of third sex that people are usually simply born into. What I am arguing that using futa in this context is not offensive. 

Now, you might bring up fetishization being a bad thing. That futa material could easily be looked at as fetishizing trans women. An understandable concern and one I can see doing some harm. But, again, futa is explicitly not a trans woman. I simply don't look at both the same. 

Also, mini-CMV. I don't hold this opinion very strongly, but I want to see if it's any illogical. Change My Mind. Fetishization of a minority group is not always bad. Wait, that sounds horrible seeing it written out. Eh. Change my view on it anyway."

I've seen it myself, when people in my life started taking some medications, their weight simply went up despite any significant change in what they eat or do.

However, I do believe that this ""forced"" weight gain is limited and not enough to push someone into obesity or even significant fatness.

Afterall, a person can't gain weight on and on if they don't keep eating a caloric surplus.

For people in this situation, mantaining an ideal weight might be too hard, as in requiring a change of habits that could be very hard to sustain, especially for people who cannot, for various reasons, control what they eat meticulously (thinking for example about people who eat every day at the company canteen, and thus cannot bring their lunch everyday).

For everyone else, I do believe that being normal weight is 100% achievable through careful choices.

I do acknowledge that there are environmental factors that lead someone into being fat. Education / upbringing as well as economic factors that make it harder to eat properly. A rich person can have nutritious and healthy food delivered every day, a poor person probably has a hard time affording anything but unhealthy food.

However this is not an obstacle that people simply cannot ever overcome. There are always strategies, if people want, to eat a proper amount and drop to a normal weight over time.

As for education, in the current day and age, people do have access to all the information they need to make proper choices and change their habits, tho it might require a significant effort."

But I can't see why anyone would think that an android that is indistinguishable from humans is a good idea.  Some pre-conditions and assumptions made about this post:

1. Androids does not necessarily possess fully autonomous AI, it could be a pre-programmed human-looking robot.  Although I'm not limiting the discussions to pre-programmed behavior, I am stating that sentient AI is not required for my arguments below.
2. Robots and by extension Androids while initially designed to obey some form of ""Three Laws of Robotics,"" can still be tweaked by hackers and the safety mechanism would inevitable be removed similar to how modern devices have jailbreaks to open up restricted functionalities.
3. The androids have crossed the uncanny valley and could pass for regular humans, if you're not an expert in looking for androids you'll probably think they're human.

Of the practical applications that Androids can fulfill the most subversive is that they could be developed for military applications, like Soldiers and Spy infiltration units.  While the benefit of easier ""training"" is possible the issues with software and ownership could be a problem.  Which furthers the point that developing androids would be problematic because machines run on software and could be turned against their directives just by hacking their software. 

Another application is for the lonely or horny people could use them as companions or sex toys.  Which would incur the risk that those machines could either be spy androids which already exist in today's world as apps that collect our data and sell them to buyers.  As androids, these units would be expendable version of human spies and could potentially be produced in bulk.  From here all I can see is smart bombs disguised in human skin being deployed coyly in unsuspecting targets.  While dangerous machines always have fail-safe installed, nothing can be fully safe if a terrorist group or just some rogue employees would go out of their way to creating a back door.

Also let's imagine a scenario where androids was marketed to the world successfully and become ubiquitous some time in the future, what's to stop a hacker ring from creating some firmware that allows them root access and causing worldwide chaos to society?  Right now smart phones have vulnerabilities and our data can get scammed and our bank accounts can get drained but if androids that could potentially be stronger than humans could exist then that scene in iRobot is not only a possibility but there would be no centralized server that could ""turn off"" the rampaging androids from wiping humanity from the face of the earth."

First on the political harm front.   


Gun ownership is not a purely right-wing activity. 32[% of Democrats say there is a gun in the home, as do 36% of Independents.](https://news.gallup.com/poll/21496/gun-ownership-higher-among-republicans-than-democrats.aspx) It seems to me that winning elections is about two things, motivating one's base and convincing the larger portion of the independents to one's side. Risking roughly 1/3rd of one's base and slightly more of the independents is a big gamble.   


Moreover, history suggests that this can be a losing issue. The Clinton ban was enacted at a time when [Gallup polling showed a 57% support for the issue](https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/268340/analyzing-surveys-banning-assault-weapons.aspx).  The soon-to-follow 1994 election was a total repudiation of Democratic policies as the [GOP took over Congress for the first time since 1952](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_United_States_elections), giving us the Gingrich revolution, and the rise of the neo-cons in wielding power in Congress that continue to this day. The most current Gallup poll shows support for the [same question is at 55%, lower than in 1994.](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-poll-majority-americans-gun-policies-extremely-important-midterm-vote)  


The fastest growing groups of gun owners in the USA today are marginalized people, [minorities](https://www.wmal.com/2022/04/25/minority-gun-ownership-growing-at-record-rates/) and [women](https://www.cbs58.com/news/women-are-fastest-growing-group-of-gun-owners-in-america). These are traditionally democratically leaning voters. Their actions in the marketplace indicate that they believe they need to be armed. Passing laws limiting that choice isn't likely to earn their vote.   


Further, the democratic party has long bemoaned the fact that it can't make inroads into rural America. Passing laws that take direct aim (pun intended) at activities that are part of rural American culture is only going to make that all the much harder. 

The Second issue is efficacy.   


A [DOJ study found no evidence](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/204431.pdf) that the Clinton-era assault weapon ban had any effect on gun violence and stated that ""should it be renewed, the ban's effects on gun violence are likely to be small and best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement.""  


There [does not appear to be any link](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-019-04922-x) between an [assault weapon and large-capacity magazine bans](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27842178) and homicide rates.   


People like to point to Australia as ""proof"" that weapon bans work, but researchers [found little evidence to back that up.](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2530362)

Most gun deaths are suicides, these are almost exclusively caused by handguns, not assault rifles. States with low homicide rates still have high suicide rates with guns.  Of the homicides, street violence (which almost exclusively uses handguns) and domestic violence (which almost exclusively uses handguns) are the two main categories. [Even within the category of active shooters, handguns are still the firearm most commonly involved.](https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/essays/mass-shootings.html)

If the Democrats wanted to do something about firearm-related deaths, they'd focus on actually implementing any portion of their existing platform well rather than passing an ineffective ban that will politically harm them and do nothing to impact firearm fatalities. They are playing to short-term optics and the result is going to be to their political detriment regardless of if it passes. And even if it passes, it will do nothing to impact firearm-related deaths in a meaningful way."

0,2022-07-26,CMV: Incest should not be illegal,u/GirlScoutCookieGrow,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w8oq8n/cmv_incest_should_not_be_illegal/,changemyview,"View is summed up by the title. Here are a couple common arguments against incest and my responses to them:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Interbreeding is linked to an increased risk in genetic disorders""

1. Incest does not necessarily mean there's going to be interbreeding. Incest could happen between step-siblings, two brothers, two sisters, etc. They could also be practicing safe sex (birth control + condoms), abstaining from sex, or even just be infertile.
2. There's no guarantee that the child will have any abnormality at all. The increased risk is modest (\~5%) and has only been shown in populations which have been inbreeding for many generations. Given the low incidence of incest in western countries today, the risk is negligible.
3. When else would you tell someone they aren't allowed to reproduce just because their offspring might have a genetic condition? You wouldn't tell this to a woman with Down Syndrome. And you're starting to creep into eugenics territory.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Incest relationships are abusive"" / ""There is a huge power imbalance in incest relationships""

1. Incest relationships can be abusive and can have a power imbalance. But so could any other kind of relationship. Women who date cops are probably more likely to be beaten, but do we outlaw their relationship? Of course not. People even describe them and their boss having an abusive relationship with a power imbalance. But do we outlaw bosses? Of course not. Also, genuine physical and mental abuse is already a crime.
2. Incest relationships aren't inherently abusive or have power imbalances. Not every incest relationship is between an adult and child. It could be between siblings, cousins, etc. where there is no power imbalance and grooming is not possible.

The more I think about it, the more I feel like criminalizing incest is an overreach by the people. I get that it's taboo and people have a gut reaction to be disgusted, but why should you care what happens in someones private life? The arguments against incest feel a lot like the arguments we had against gay marriage 20 years ago.

Do you think you can change my view on incest? Lets have a discussion!"

With people you know, family and close friends, I don't see why fat jokes are suddenly bad, unless you know there's an underlying cause. My whole life, if I did something wrong it would be joked about by friends and family, for example not brushing my teeth at night when I was like 8, family would joke about my dirty teeth, and so I made damn sure to brush my teeth every night after that.

I don't see why it's not the same with being fat; it's a similar issue, you are doing something harmful to yourself and you shouldn't do it, little diggs and teasing here and there are often great ways to promote change. 

At least the name is wrong, for example homophobia is the dislike of gay people; which is obviously wrong because you can't change your sexual preferences. Being fat is not the same as being gay, and the struggles they face are completely different.

I just got in trouble at the gym for chatting on the phone with my headphones on and not on speaker. The volume in my ear was not to a level that caused me to be talking loudly and I feel pretty aware of my own volume. 

Meanwhile a couple machines next to me are two people who came to the gym together chatting super loudly to one another. Arguably and noticeably louder and more obnoxious than my conversation on the phone. This is allowed though. 

So I’m wondering why this rule is in place? If it’s at a respectable volume, why shouldn’t it be allowed? I enjoy chatting while I work out but don’t have anyone to actually chat with at the gym. And I think the strangers at the gym would probably prefer I call my grandma than I strike up an unsolicited conversation with them while they are trying to climb the stairmaster and minding their own business.

They've always been seen I hate to say now in hindsight as a 'fussy eater', and have recently been diagnosed with an eating disorder that involves limitations of varieties of foods.

When one isn't brought up well as a child it might manifest in between childhood and young-adulthood as a thing that they utilise as a means of compensation. One of the points of my above asexual digression is that it's also is another 'label' that's unorthodox and interesting, which is the common denominator between all the mental complications this person suffers from, whether professionally diagnosed or self-accounted. My point isn't that kids and young adults are making it all up for attention (*KEY THING HERE: THEY ARE NOT*), but rather that these titles that they use and ultimately become diagnosed with are things that their id has subconsciously driven them into not wanting to abandon for fear of being rejected for being plain.

Otherwise, realistically, what are the odds of a person (the same as who I've been writing about) being diagnosed with several disorders, some of which are intuitive and some legitemate, and of on top of that having even more self-accounted disorders. The therapists, instead of legitemately ridding them of it, only advance it.

This person has had (on their account) long-term depression easily caused by nutritional deficiencies (such as magnesium), and it, now being clinically diagnosed, lately has worsened because of unnatural hormone levels from excess oestrogen, and on top of that will be given antidepressants which makes psychiatric disorders even worse; and absolutely no benefit has been given to the client here except the superficial satisfaction that they have a slightly altered appearance and voice.

TL;DR: A therapist's job shouldn't be to prescribe pills to people with depression, but rather find the root cause of it (whether internal or external), and deal with it on that basis alone. It should also be their job to rather promote habits and practices that contribute to the ridding of the illness, not dosages of artificial numbness of it. It's nothing less than a group of people with common interests who prey upon the sensitive and I hate to say naive minds of individuals of today's still living generations."

Think about it, those who are willing to work harder are discouraged from doing so because of the  inherant flaws in the paid-by-the-hour system. If everyone at an establishment is paid the same no matter how much they  work they actually get done in an 8 hour period, there is no encouragement for employees to actually try to finish for example in 7 or 6 hours that same amount of work.  Why not work a little slower to get some overtime? There is also the problem, caused by those same inherrant flaws, of individuals being overburdened because of higher ups' sometimes unreasonable expectations of what amount of work should reasonably get done in that 8 hour period.  One question to be asked about that is how do and how should supervisors go about deciding what a reasonable amount work to be completed in that 8 hour period actually is. I would also argue that there are various ways the system is disadvantageous to employers almost as much as those they employ.   For one this commonplace system makes it harder for employers to distinguish between those that truly strive to work hard and those are lazy almost to the point of being detrimental to other workers.    Another problem for employers is that they are not always getting as much for their money compared to a commission based employment system.  Lazy workers actually end up getting paid more than the harder working ones in many cases which is unfair and not very good value for an employers money.   A hard worker might get 8 hours worth of work done in 6 hours (and still only get paid for six) and a lazy person might take 10 hours to get done what should have only taken them 8 (and get paid much more than the hard worker). Paid-by-the hour is very common today but I would argue that commission based systems would be fairer and more efficient ."

17,2022-07-26,CMV: Learning to be a grown-up is not as simple as that.,u/iammagicbutimnormal,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w935zc/cmv_learning_to_be_a_grownup_is_not_as_simple_as/,changemyview,"I’ve been a foster provider in America with my husband for four years. I would say that one of my existential crises involves the concept that children do not belong in the justice system. I do not envy the judges that sit day after day and decide to remove children from their homes. Once this happens several people are involved in a case number. That child is the case number in the court system. Their lives are documented from the moment they go into the system. Can you imagine having people write notes about you each week and subjectively give their viewpoints on your behavior and progress in maturity? It’s kind of a cruel joke. Then they age out of the system, left with very few opportunities or connections. Turn it on its head and it’s actually quite cruel.

I’m one of those well-meaning people in the whole situation and I know that I am speaking from my own perspective. I am licensed to keep children safe and cared for in my home from the time their case is opened until it closes. That is what I am. Nothing more. I mean, the requirements are a bit steep for me sometimes, but I just trudge through it. I don’t know how other foster providers add up when it comes to all the demands. I am just me. I do a damn good job, but my impact is only the amount of time they are in my home. After that, I have no power over what happens to them or where they go. That can be quite heartbreaking and I have had to work through what that feels like. I know how little control I have outside of my home. I know that’s just way too many strange adults for these children to expect to move around with and learn any sense of identity, self-esteem, connection, character-building opportunities. Their young lives and opportunities get lost in the shuffle. It is a very lonely road for such young humans.

Several professionals and people are involved in a foster child’s care, but no one is cooperating or coordinating and the child just ends up being carted around from one adult to the next based on a judge’s orders. The judge is not the only one involved in this decision. There’s the parents and their lawyer, the child and the child’s lawyer, the casa advocate, the foster provider, the social workers, the counselors, extended family, and so on and so forth. The system is set up to work very well, but the bureaucracy and inadequacy of it all always comes up short. Honestly, it’s almost worse than being taken away from their parents. At least with their parents they have one set of grown-ups. When they become foster children they are forced into multiple relationships with grown-ups that they’ve never met before, and this is chronic throughout their life. I don’t know how they’re ever supposed to feel secure enough to invest in themselves in any meaningful way. What gets started can quickly be deleted with each new move. It’s a strange sort of chronic trauma that ends up creating emotionally dysregulated adults that have very little understanding of how to competently be grown-ups. Overall, the Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) systems don’t help anything get better. For the most part it just makes things worse for kids. I don’t think it’s the right way to protect children.

My existential crisis is how we treat families in America. Many millions of people in our own country, one of the wealthiest countries in the world, live in abject poverty, and the environment of poverty breeds crime and despair. I think our country could be doing a whole lot better for children if we focused on supporting the family structure, instead of cruelly putting them through the CPS grinder and then expecting them to be acclimated and adjusted as adults when they age out of the system. This is a great injustice in our “me” culture, identity marketing, social media platforms, go-fund me’s, and animal rescue videos, and while that is all going on there are hundreds of thousands of children being given so little time or value by our society. I promise you the answers would not be easy but if we were really willing to look at what investments and consequences would look like to create positive outcomes for children, we might could get somewhere. We could make progress to repair the long since severed compassion that ebbs and flows through our society."

0,2022-07-27,"CMV: Instead of (or maybe in addition to) term limits, we should impose age limits on elected officials",u/rwhelser,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w96326/cmv_instead_of_or_maybe_in_addition_to_term/,changemyview,"Recently, Democrats have introduced a bill to implement term limits on U.S. Supreme Court Justices (see [https://hankjohnson.house.gov/sites/hankjohnson.house.gov/files/documents/SCOTUS\_TERMS\_xml.pdf](https://hankjohnson.house.gov/sites/hankjohnson.house.gov/files/documents/SCOTUS_TERMS_xml.pdf)).  This appears to mirror H.R. 5140 which was introduced on August 31, 2021 to impose 18-year limits on Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court.  The 22nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution already limits a President to no more than two terms in office.  And there have been talks on social media and elsewhere about the ""need"" to impose term limits on Members of Congress.

I would argue that either in addition to or separately from imposing term limits, there should be an age limit for elected officials.  While I think it should also apply to state officials and maybe local officials, I'm going to keep this conversation focused on national offices (Members of Congress, the President).  The U.S. Constitution states that among other qualifications, an individual has to be at least 25 years old to serve as a U.S. Representative, at least 30 years old to serve as a U.S. Senator, and at least 35 to serve as U.S. President.

I would argue that there should be age caps for elected officials as well.  A few main reasons why I would advocate for such an action include:

* For their health (especially the President) - the work isn't exactly relaxing by any means, and just look at how a President looks at the time of his inauguration compared to the day he leaves office.
* Times/generations change - the mentality that Baby Boomers have are much different from Gen X, Millennials, Gen Z, etc., so would it be appropriate for the older generations to impose restrictions based on those views/perspectives (a simple example is to look at the concept of telework/remote work; limiting the discussion to government, there are some elected officials who argue that telework is ineffective based on their experience--in other words a lack of experience because that's not what they grew up with).  It's accepted that there will be generational differences so it's not like we can say at 2030 that nobody born in 1990-2000 can serve, that's not my point here.
* Along the lines of the second point, it ensures that we have fresh ideas moving through government through every term or every few terms.
* Finally, we know that our minds and bodies break down with age.  Rather than simply say, ""we're imposing term limits because 'reasons' (whatever they happen to be),"" imposing an age cap can be reasonably justified.

Let's look at some data.  The average age of Members of the House at the beginning of the 117th (current) Congress was 58.4 years; of Senators, 64.3 years.  The median age at inauguration of incoming U.S. presidents is 55 years. The specific years and days median is 55 years and 104.5 days, which falls midway between how old Warren G. Harding was in 1921 and Lyndon B. Johnson was in 1963 (our current President and his predecessor are the oldest and second oldest to serve in that office).  I would love to have the median age for Members of Congress, but couldn't find it and admittedly I'm not very interested to look up 500+ Members' ages to do a median calculation.

With that said, I would argue that elected officials should be capped at either age 62 or 65.  The reason I picked these two ages is because 62 is the earliest that an American can collect Social Security retirement benefits; 65 is when they can enroll in Medicare, both programs geared toward the retired population.  One thing I want to make clear is that once a candidate has reached that maximum age, they can't run for election or re-election.  For example, if John Doe is 61 years old and elected to the U.S. Senate, then he could serve his full six-year term and would be required to leave the Senate at age 66 (ineligible to run for re-election, as he's over the maximum age).

I'm honestly indifferent on imposing the same on Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court.  And the only reason that I say that is because their job is reactionary.  They're not creating or enacting laws, and in that position, a greater level of legal experience is probably preferable compared elected officials.  They're also not ""supposed"" to engage in partisan politics, rather, they should impartially review the laws as challenged through the lower courts.  I also recognize that we don't live in ""should"" land, but again, I don't feel the age limit on Justices would be as impactful as a Member of Congress or the President.

Finally, I do want to clarify that I'm not suggesting that the job of an elected official can't be done later in life (Joe Biden is 79 years old, Senators Chuck Grassley and Dianne Feinstein are both 88 years old), my point is simply that if we capped the age at which someone could serve as an elected official, I believe we might see some of the changes that people who argue for stricter term limits may seek and have a better justification for the requirement.

&amp;#x200B;

To change my view, I would expect someone to explain how not capping an elected official's age would be more effective (not to say that you have to prove older politicians do better, just that our current system would be more effective).

I look forward to the discussion."
1101,2022-07-27,CMV: Maternity and paternity tests being taken at birth / during pregnancy should be standard.,u/IfICommentDownvoteMe,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w96dpv/cmv_maternity_and_paternity_tests_being_taken_at/,changemyview,"Gonna keep it quick and simple (not really, I talk a lot sometimes) .  It would help many men who have been cheated on from raising a child that isn’t theirs/ continuing a relationship with someone who cheated if they don’t choose to. It would also prevent “switched at birth” scenarios.  Why don’t do we this already? It really just seems like practical common sense. 

If you saw the recent **ridiculous** BestOfRedditorsUpdate post: a father did a paternity test and found out his daughter wasn’t his. He thought his wife was cheating, she hadn’t, and convinced him to take other tests with her, when she took her test she found out the child isn’t hers, either ! The baby had been switched at birth and now the hospital is being sued. I’m
sure this isn’t extremely common, but just the chance makes it worth it. Also, if they had done this at the beginning, they wouldn’t have had this problem. 

I’m sure many of you will have some virtue signaling answer about trust lmao. I’m not the “don’t do something that doesn’t harm us because of society’s perception” type person. I would rather do it and have absolutely no reason to ever doubt you then not do it because it’s what, “unnecessary if you *really* trust me?” My girlfriend knows when we have a child , or while she’s preggers, I’m taking one. It’s not an I wanna catch you in the act or expect you to cheat type thing. I would be heartbroken lmao. It’s a ‘signing the birth certificate’ thing to me, basically another thing I just see as being the father and it being confirmed to you. I’d feel even more amazing walking out of the hospital with that piece of paper that just certifies to me, this is my child. As much as people don’t want to say, as a man you do not have the same absolute certainty as the person who birthed the child. Regardless of how much you trust etc,  you do not have that absolute answer. 

She’s not the type of person who would cheat on me, and it’s not something that worries me with her. You can make your mind up on whether I believe that or not, this is Reddit Lmao, ik how this is gonna go, I’m sure many of you will say I don’t trust her without knowing her, me , or our relationship. I feel that it should be normalized in every relationship. And I do feel it should be both woman and man doing it, there’s just more reasoning on the man side to give which is why I’m still going on this long ass post. 

I’m the “extreme precaution” type person. Reverse in every parking spot to be able to leave fast, remove myself from situations I feel could possibly go wrong, she knows this about me and honestly didn’t have a problem with me saying I’d like one when the time comes. My question to those who disagree: why would it really bother you so much if you know it’s not gonna be an issue? It’s basically the same as a prenup. Yeah, you can interpret it badly if you want or you could just see it as a formality and move on since it really shouldn’t matter.

Edit: no, I’m not saying it should be mandatory or forced.  It should just be easily accessible and something you can opt into/ opt out of during pregnancy check ups or after labor etc
I’m just saying it should be normalized, considered a standard not looked down upon


Edit 2: as someone said in the comments, it can also help mothers from fathers who claim the child isn’t theirs when it is.

Edit 3: I’ve read through just about everything . If I didn’t respond it’s because you asked sometning someone else already did.


Welp, I’m done,  been at this for way to long and most of the responses were subpar ignoring the feelings of the people this would possibly help and turned into an argument on how i hate women,  think literally all of them are cheating every second of everyday, and am just a shit person. Thank you for Reddit for showing me truly how amazing and wonderful you all are. You guys are perfect. You can do literally no wrong, and you always always state the moral answer with consideration for everyone involved. You rock, guys. 🪨"

For Reference:

&gt;2nd Ammendment: Right to Bear Arms
&gt;
&gt;&gt;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

It is my understanding that the purpose of this ammendment is to ensure the right of the people to have weapons such that they can defend against tyranny or whatever. I am not a big 2A wonk, but given the militarization of the police (See [ACLU Report](https://www.aclu.org/report/war-comes-home-excessive-militarization-american-police); see also [Cato Institute Handbook](https://www.cato.org/cato-handbook-policymakers/cato-handbook-policy-makers-8th-edition-2017/20-stopping-police-militarization)) it seems that maybe there is good cause for people to have these weapons. That said, all the [mass shootings and other gun violence](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/) creates an impotice to do something about all these guns floating around.

Taken together, it seems to me that the only reasonable way to achieve disarmament with respect to the second amendment is to concurrently disarm and decrease budgets of law enforcement as well. To do otherwise invites the possibility of a police state (more than already currently exists lol) which threatens the free state that the 2nd ammendment is supposed to protect. Unfortunately, it seems like both Parties are pretty stoked on continuing this process of militarizing the police, which works in the reverse insofar as it tips the scales in a way that also presents a threat to the free state.

329,2022-07-27,CMV: There is a significant chunk of the population that isn't used to hard times and want easy solutions to difficult problems,u/Mr_CrashSite,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w9ekr7/cmv_there_is_a_significant_chunk_of_the/,changemyview,"This is a half formed view that I have that I'm interested in hearing the opposite side for.

I will preface this and say I'm from the UK - so most of my commetray will be about my country, but it might apply more broadly to the views I see on reddit. Essentially my view is that we are going through some really rough times, but the reaction to these rough times, from the type of people I read and interact with, stems from the belief that the default is ""good times"" and we could easily go back to these times if only businesses and government took the correct action.

The past few years have been rough on everyone - we've had a pandemic, the first major one in a long, long time. The response to the pandemic has been stressful in a multitude of directions (economic, social, mental) - both down to disease itself, and the policies implemented to counteract it. We've now had our first major war in Europe in an equally long amount of time which has further destabilised the already shaky economy. While some economies are strong with low unemployment (US) there is high inflation which is affecting the poorest and in a lot of European countries, could cause a recession. 

It is not to say all countries are equally poor at responding, or are affected the same. The UK and US have both had higher inflation in part due to the stimulus during the various lockdowns, and due to Brexit in the UK. But even still, all countries are being hit hard - Germany is about to raked over the coals due to the Russian's cutting off energy supplies to them.

Finally, what my view is about, is that I've seen an attitude to these circumstances that is essentially that these problems are easily fixable. We are having multiple public sector strikes (which to be fair to them are probably long due, especially in the NHS) as the cost of living is increasing. The government is obviously not wanting to grant these, as it could increase inflationary pressure. **But the people I see seem to think that this is just obviously the correct thing to do.** It might be correct, but it isn't obvious and I doubt either myself or they have any actual data about the complicated economics of such a move. People want the increase in wages for TFL staff, but don't acknowledge that the TFL is beyond fucked, due to an increase in WFH and the lockdowns. There would undoubtedly be consequences to increasing wages, which will most likely hit the poorest anyway. **There aren't easy solutions to these problems.**

To be clear, I'm not placing the blame on the people asking for a wage increase. Even if it is the wrong choice in the current state of affairs (I don't know enough about economics to have an opinion on this), I still think it is understandable for individuals to want a pay increase, and advocating for that is fine, even if it ultimately isn't granted.

It is obviously to the credit of people who are worried about the most vulnerable in our society, but I wish there was some acknowledgement that some harm will have to be suffered when the geopolitical and economic situation is as it is. Food prices aren't going to be fixed without an increase in the supply of grain and fuel. This might take months or years to fix.

**I've come round to think that hard times are the default** - the past 30-40 years have been largely smooth for most people, with increases in living standards. 2008 was the first sign of some decline, but it didn't have the same sense of doom that is now being spread. Even with the energy crisis we are having now, we aren't having rolling blackouts like we did in the 70's (not that I lived through them). I have no idea if people were the same then, but regardless, **it feels like people have taken for granted the comfort of modern day life**. No one wants to take the hit. I get it. But people scream for solutions without reflecting that this is the human condition, we are struggling to support everyone with limited resources and these aren't hard times, this is the default, we were in the good times. People are going to suffer, and we can do our best to mitigate us, but it won't pass smoothly. 

I don't think I've been exceedingly clear on what my view is, but if anyone is able to parse it and has an alternative view I would be interested."

I'm not making a stance on abortion rights either way - but this part of the conversation has always confused me.

One way I think about it is this: If a pregnant woman is planning and excited to have her child and someone terminated her pregnancy without her consent or desire - we would legally (and logically) consider that murder. It would be ending that life, small as it is.

The intention of the pregnancy seems to change the value of the life inside, which seems inconsistent to me. 

I think it's possible to believe in abortion rights but still hold the view that there really is a human life that is ending when you abort. In my opinion, since that is very morally complicated, we've jumped through a lot of hoops to convince ourselves that it's not a human at all, which I don't think is true.

EDIT: Thanks for all the thoughtful responses. As many are pointing out - there's a difference between ""human"" and ""person"" which I agree with. The purpose of the post is more in the context of those who would say a fetus is not a ""human life"". 

Also, I'm not saying that abortion should be considered murder - just that we understand certain contexts of a fetus being killed as murder -  it would follow that in those contexts we see the fetus as a human life (a prerequisite for murder to exist) - and therefore so should we in all contexts (including abortion)"

California Quail are able to be hunted in states where they are common and have a total population of about 1-3 million birds. Meanwhile, the American Robin population is over 300 million and it seems like pretty much every US state does not allow it to be hunted. 

Why is the animal with a smaller population allowed to be hunted but the animal with a much larger population is protected?

I'm sure that if American Robin's are hunted in a regulated manner, say a bag limit of one robin a day, the Robin population should be fine considering people usually go after popular game animals anyway like grouse, pheasant and turkey."

There are two pretty funny subs for people like me who see politics as entertainment. One is r/TheRightCantMeme and the other is r/TheLeftCantMeme. I subscribe to and enjoy both. 

I got to thinking though neither of them “can meme”. And here’s why, earnestly held political views are not very funny and nor should they be. 

For example, if you are someone on the far-right of American politics, you possibly believe that there is a cabal of Satanic politicians dead set on undermining the stability of Western Civilization through the promotion of mass immigration from the Global South and non-traditional expressions of sexuality and gender. 

So, think that opinion is so ridiculous that I actually chuckled a bit while I was writing it but, if I were somehow convinced that it was true, it would hardly be a laughing matter. 

In the United States, campus activists under the age of about 25 are what is considered far-left, also known as “woke”. Such people hold views that are less outrageous than the far-right but similarly lacking in humor. 

Like, if you are someone who sincerely believes that all of American society is built on a foundation of white supremacy and oppression of women, POCs and LGBTQIA+, are you in the mood making jokes? Didn’t think so. 

Therefore, the result is visible in both subs. r/TheRightCantMeme displays a lot of ham-fisted, poorly concealed xenophobia, homophobia, racism and paranoia, r/TheLeftCantMeme showcases the pompous, sanctimonious scolding and lecturing that a lot of the woke crowd can’t help themselves from engaging in. And the results are hilarious!

However, I would like to say that if you truly want to make a good meme, then you probably need not to wear your political opinions on your sleeve. I would recommend r/shitposting or the [Jreg](https://www.youtube.com/c/Jregory) on YouTube.  

But maybe I’m wrong. Can anyone change my view? Is there a side of the political spectrum that is more able to meme?"

…BUT

Sam’s offers the consumer a better experience.

1. Scan and go.  I can go into Sam’s, scan my items, and leave without waiting in line.  It doesn’t work for alcohol in my state, but I have read from other members it is legal to scan alcohol in their state.  Sometimes, particularly before holidays, the lines can be long AF.  Scan and go removes the need to wait in line.

2. Better online interface.  I was able to get my items shipped to my home at no additional cost than the warehouse price.  Saved me a trip to the store. 

3. Wi-Fi in the warehouse.  Makes listening to podcasts or other media easier with wifi ability.

4. Superior food court.  I actually can get onions for my hotdog.

For these reasons as a consumer, Sam’s is better for the consumer. 

Please CMV.  I am speaking solely as a consumer and I do not care how employees are treated as that does not impact my consumer behavior.  For example I wear Nike’s and own an iPhone."

When i say console im mainly talking about Playstation and Xbox.

That being said lets start with money. According to [this article]\(link expunged due to reddit spam filter\) a PC with equivalent performance to a PS5 costs 77$ more (I think in practice the difference is a bit larger). But xbox and PS have a fee to play online of 60$ per year. You will also have to buy a new console every few years if you want to keep up with new game releases, while a PC will be compatible with all games released in the forseable future and most games released in the past (all if you are ready to use an old OS or emulator). Of course newer games demand more and more performance so in practice you will have to upgrader your PC eventually, but you do that to have better perfomance, not to be even able to access the game. You can also get PCs for much less than consoles if you have a tight budget.

PC has way more games. To such an extent that certain genres of games (are very rare or) dont exist at all on console (rts, moba, indie, gamejam, ect.). I would also argue that games are generally cheaper on PC since multiple stores are competing with sales, and because of p*racy.

Input devices are much more flexible on PC. You have to use a licenced controller to play the vast majority of games on consoles, while PCs allow you to use any input device a console can use + non licenced controllers, keyboard and mouse, drawing tablets, touchscreen, ect.

PCs allow you to cusomize your gaming experience to a much larger degree. For some reason console games usually have a severly limited settings menu compared to PC, not only relating to graphics settings but also chaging the button mapping.

Console has extremly limited modding abilities. Few games on console have mods at all, and if they have the selection is limited compared to PC.

And of course a PC can do all the non gaming stuff too.

Here are some advatages of consoles that i dont find very convincing:

You can play on the couch. Same with PC, you can even use something like steamOS to get the full console expirience.

There is no hardware advantage in competative multiplayer games. There still is. Different people will use different versions of the console, have different screens with different input lag, have different internet speed. Consoles do even the playing field by a small amount, but we are splitting hairs at this point.

Consoles are plug and play. If you buy a console or PC you will have to go through a first time setup, create accounts, install updates ect. PC only has just one more step of downloading Steam or equivalent.

However, it seems like this whole Britney Griner situation is getting a lot of traction in the media and US seemed to offer some package to the Russians on the swaps.  On lot of the online forums, people are kind of joking about the details behind the swap and putting this in context of trades that goes on in sports (e.g. The Russians need to attach couple of 1st round picks).  Presumably, this is happening because Griner is a WNBA star as well and there is a sports root.  And to be clear, I don't really have much opinion on this particular proposed swap either since I feel like I am uninformed on the matter.

However, the more I think about this situation, whether this is a fair swap or not for the United States should be analyzed similar to a sports trade.  On an extreme case, if you are swapping Griner with some no-name civilian, people would be more receptive.  Also, people who are supporting this swap would balk at the terms of condition if the Russians are asking for too much (right?)?  So at the end of the day, setting aside the emotional feelings that one might have regarding Griner or even taking into account what Griner has done, at the end of the day, whether this is a fair swap or not hinges on the personnels involved.  So in this sense, this is a lot similar to debates people have on sporting teams conducting a trade and seeing who has the upper hand in the deal.  Obviously, the stakes are much higher with people's livelihood on the line but at the end of the day, most people who are not intimately connected to this issue (e.g. Griner's family) would probably recognize that certain offers are good and certain offers are terrible.  It is just a matter of drawing the line somewhere, which is a subjective matter.

EDIT: again, to be clear, I am NOT indicating that this is an joking matter.  I am just saying that at the end of the day, the personnels involved in the proposed swap does matter and can lead one to change one's mind about whether the swap is a good idea or a bad one.  Similar to trade in sports."

For context, there is a huge discussion about if voting under 18 (at 18 you're an ""adult"") should be allowed.

I personally think that this is a bad idea. I just think if you can vote at 16 you are most certainly to young to have your honest and true opinion on things. When I think back what my political opinion on things were when I was 16 I would not have let myself vote for anything. I was in the middle of puppetry and that's were you really make your mind up and start to think more adultlike.

Also I am kind of afraid that they don't take the voting's serious enough and just vote something random or something meme-ish.

I would like to hear some good arguments why this should be allowed because it sounds pretty progressive to our society.

Edit: What I forgot to mention is that you get fined for not voting. It's not much money but still about 5 Dollars. That's because they want to make the participation rates higher. So the option for them to just not vote is not really available and I don't think you're that interested in politics  at 16 to make yourself the time to read all the things to vote for.

I believe the death penalty is never moral, most of the opposition on Reddit focuses on the belief that the risk of false positives outweighs the good that comes from killing people they say deserve it. However I believe that it is never moral even in the impossible hypothetical that where we know 100% that someone is guilty.

My stance is essentially that nobody deserves death, I've really never been on board with the idea that prison is for punishment so that leaves the other 3 factors used to justify incarceration, rehabilitation, incapacitation and deterrence. Rehabilitation is a bit moot as most crimes that earn a DP are considered so bad you can't be rehabilitated. The next, incapacitation is served plenty well by a life sentence however as modern prisons are extremely secure and the chances of an escape are negligible.

Deterrence is overrated as a factor imo but studies have shown it doesn't deter criminals as they don't think they'll be caught at all (notice how many people pirate despite the penalties going up to 5 years in prison) so using it as an argument for the dp is a pretty garbage argument. I also think the dp cheapens life and makes people think of life as more disposable. This are why I believe the dp is never moral, please change my view"

I believe the terms ""1984"" and ""totalitarian"" are extremely overused on Reddit and it really cheapens the word, similar to ""Communism/Socialist"" being cheapened by Conservatives to the point where many Progressives barely bat an eye at things being described as Socialist as distinctly non socialist policies like Universal Healthcare or regulation in general have been given the ""Socialist"" label.

This post was inspired by a frankly garbage take I saw on r/unpopularopinions where OP basically said kids using slang is doublespeak and a step towards totalitarianism. It seems that among Reddit Libertarians ""totalitarian"" or ""authoritarian"" is a basic verb because I hear it seemingly every other sentence and has been used to describe everything from seat belt laws to the eviction moratorium.

This in my opinion really cheapens the term, using it in such a half hearted way will eventually burn Libertarians and Conservatives hard as eventually people will pretty much ignore them in a ""the boy who cried wolf"" situation which could lead people to embrace actual authoritarian measures while using the previous examples to discredit people point it out. To stop this people need to take care to only use these terms in very serious contexts, not whenever a law you don't like gets passed as every time you take another popular policy in this way said technique gets less and less effective.

The best part of this movie is all the crazy technology and seeing how the satellites have to spin to make fake gravity and how the spaceships have to synchronize their spin to dock with the satellite and how they have a diagnostic tool to see every solder of the circuit and how they have to eat liquids in space. It is interesting because you start thinking about how all this stuff works. What little dialogue there is is actually pretty intense and full of subtext like when the guy says ""I'm not at liberty to discuss that"". Also the subplot about the evil robot was good

I think the aliens part was pretty stupid and not based on science at all. It seemed like it was just there as an excuse for them to take a space voyage. And it was just there because otherwise the movie would not have had a plot. And the abstract ending where he becomes a baby doesn't really make sense and doesnt add to the movie

Therefore moral values about preserving life don't apply because the life doesn't exist. Also, being pro-life is seen as at least mainly a religious argument, so it follows that most people being against it and making the aforementioned argument are non-religious and therefore far less likely to believe in an afterlife.

However, I see many of the same people who turn around and argue that being unborn would be better *for them*, even though they have already established that the fetus is neither alive nor capable of feeling and therefore cannot apply morally. On top of that, I imagine there is a significant overlap with people who would support euthanasia or other forms of assisted suicide (and even the death penalty) on the basis that for some people being dead is better for them, even though that would result in nonexistence as a result of the premise that an afterlife does not exist.

I believe this is inconsistent. If something that is nonexistent cannot apply to moral values, we cannot consider it any better or worse than an alternative. To make a moral position about nonexistence for an individual would be like trying to claim that imaginary number ""i"" is greater than, less than, or equal to 0. It is none of these, as ""i"" is unordered. It doesn't have a place on the number line, as it's a complex number and these comparisons don't apply.

Some would argue that this is a neutral moral situation, but I would say that the lack of judgment doesn't imply the existence of neutral judgment. It couldn't in this case, as one of the operands is incompatible by premise.

If we have a decision about two alternatives and one eliminates morals altogether, it cannot be considered moral to choose that one, even if the other involves suffering. This very idea coming up in a moral discussion is nonsensical.

This is consistent with other aspects of life. We don't consider destroying a building as moral or immoral to the building itself, only to the living people that might be affected. We don't view the death of a fictional character as moral or immoral beyond theory. We can view it as helping or harming us emotionally, but logically it does nothing to them because they aren't actual living beings."

Nobody would ever say Tony Parker is better than Chris Paul, but he has 4 championships. 
 
In the 2000 NBA Finals Kobe Bryant averaged 15/4/4 shooting  36/20/90 from the field. In that same series Shaq averaged 38 points 16.7 rebounds 2.7 blocks and shot 61% from the field. 

In 7 NBA Finals appearances Kobe averaged 25/5/5 shooting 41% from the field 31% from 3. If Finals performance is a barometer for greatness this gentleman seems to be lacking in offensive productivity. During the Lakers 3peat Shaq averaged 36 points, 15 rebounds, and 3 blocks a game.


Kobe’s “5 rings” are overrated. He played with a top 10 all time NBA talent Center, in his prime that averaged 35/15 in the finals. He even got a ring averaging 15ppg like a roll player. Kobe is an all time great guard but his Finals performances are looking funny under a microscope 🔬"

I believe sanctions are primarily punishing the middle classes of nations, but they are not creating positive or swift outcomes with Russia. I’ll use personal and historical anecdotes to explain. 

I work in a small software biz for oil companies, and I see the hypocrisy. Russia has record profits in this sector. They are emboldened from these wrist slaps to join BRICS to create an “international reserve currency”. 

OFAC has so many rules and regs with arbitrary verbiage and require training and depts yet offer no help to a modest company like mine who was fined over what they deemed egregious (~$15k) late payment from Rosneft for software after the very Dept (Treasury) was late in providing us tax documentation (6166). “Trade-based corporate sanctions compliance” flagged and punished our biz, we paid hundred thousands for fines and lawyers for this “potential civil liability”, and Rosneft never had to pay their bill. Mitigation due to our small size, if we requested licensing for payment from the very dept that was months late giving us a simple tax form we paid for, and our remedial efforts. Rosneft is rolling in it. Our govt gets paid and holds moral superiority. 

The US is phasing out of Russian oil, but the EU has spent billions a week on imports while still trying to enforce sanctions. More money than they have given to aid Ukraine. 

We imported billions of dollars of agriculture, mineral fuels, fertilizers and metals in 2019 from Russia alone. Our GDP is falling, food and gas is up, wages stagnant, the dollar weakening. Is it really a stretch to connect some dots or point out the hypocrisy of governments’ “do what I say”? The Dept of Treasury lifted sanctions on some Russian billionaire oligarchs, why?

As long as there is a market for Russian products, Putin is emboldened. Sanctions could work if they weren’t just a foreign policy tool. I hate war, but didn’t sanctions not work on Hussein until Operation Desert Storm? 

Food for thought. I don’t like hypocrisy.

P.S. my salary puts me in lower class, then my partner’s makes us middle, we have been scraping by for years. He is Russian Ukrainian and my German ancestors escaped the Rhineland during Bolshevik revolution."
0,2022-07-28,CMV: Moral nihilism is the only rationally coherent metaethical stance,u/IntellectualFerret,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wagi3f/cmv_moral_nihilism_is_the_only_rationally/,changemyview,"I want this view changed because moral nihilism being true seems to make life a lot less interesting, and indeed sort of prevent me from holding any stances based on morality at all. That seems lame. However, I can't seem to think of a rebuttal to moral nihilism. My arguments go as follows:

First, I think every train of rational moral inquiry inevitably demands that an axiom be generated out of thin air:

&gt;""Murder is wrong"" Why? ""Because it causes pain"" Why is that wrong? ""Because actions which produce a greater proportion of pain than pleasure are wrong"" Why? ""Because no shit""

The problem is I don't think ""no shit"" is a compelling reason, and yet obviously you have to have a ""cus obviously its true"" at some point in the line, or else you'll just get stuck with ""why"" forever. The only thing upon which it seems we can base any axiom at all is our intuition, but I'm not convinced that our intuitions can be trusted when it comes to moral facts. Consider the following argument:

&amp;#x200B;

1. We have intuitions about moral truths
2. We also have intuitions about the natural world
3. Often, our intuitions about the national world are wrong (for instance, many people believe that climate change is not occurring because ""it snowed a lot this winter"")
4. Therefore, it seems our intuitions are not infallible, and require empirical, objective observation to verify
5. Empirical, objective observation of moral truths is impossible
6. Thus, our intuitions about morality must be fallible
7. Thus, it would be erroneous to assume we can draw any objective conclusions about morality from our moral intuitions.

I think most of those premises stand on their own, except maybe 5, which feels a bit shaky to me, but I can't think of any way to observe a moral truth. I guess what I'm looking for is proof that human intuition can be trusted, because if it can't be frankly I'm not sure how anything can be true.

&amp;#x200B;

My second concern is Mackie's ""argument from queerness,"" which I think is pretty convincing. As he puts it briefly:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If there were objective values, then they would be entities or qualities or relations of a very strange sort, utterly different from anything else in the universe. Correspondingly, if we were aware of them, it would have to be by some special faculty of moral perception or intuition, utterly different from our ordinary ways of knowing everything else

&amp;#x200B;

The epistemological component is especially compelling to me, as if we do truly have an ability to sense objective moral truths which exist in the ether, such an ability would be wildly different from all our other means of understanding the world. So different, in fact, that it seems unlikely to even exist. The more plausible conclusion is that we simply evolved with our own ideas of right and wrong based on what was evolutionarily advantageous to us (i.e., perhaps we evolved  a sense that ""murdering is wrong"" because humans who didn't mutate in that particular way tended to kill each other off, thus preventing them from spreading their genes). Occam's razor allows us to assume that the latter is the more likely conclusion. But then, this provides further reason to believe that our intuitions are not a sound place to begin investigating moral truth. Yet without our intuitions, on what grounds can we possibly find moral truths at all?

Let's say a man is at a beach festival, late into the night, excited and immersed into the atmosphere. A news reporter approaches him and asks him how's it going. He answers ""Great! Music is great, women are beautiful, but some of them not so much. Girls, you need to hit the gym more. When I go to the beach I want to see tits and ass""

That anecdote actually happened to popular youtuber George Buhnici and the overwhelming response from women was that his attitude was sexist. 

Under most circumstances I would agree that it's an inappropriate thing to say. But in a casual setting, a party, a club, I don't see such a statement as sexist, but rather self-deprecating towards the guy. It's just his opinion, women have no reason care about what he thinks, the only victim of these claims is the man because he makes himself look like a superficial buffoon.

I would like to understand how is this sexist. And I think this is important, there is a lot at stake here, if people are expected to act in party settings at the same level of seriousness as in professional settings, then whole human socialization is in great danger.

With that out of the way, in May of this year the Biden administration offered to trade Bout for Griner in a prisoner exchange (https://www.forbes.com/sites/geraldposner/2022/05/19/brittney-griner-involved-in-possible-prisoner-swap-with-russia/?sh=66e45e603d2d), then in July Whelan was added into the mix (https://sports.yahoo.com/us-has-offered-substantial-proposal-to-russia-in-exchange-for-brittney-griner-paul-whelan-191716926.html), it is rumored that Russia back in 2020 believed Whelan alone to be worth Bout and someone else (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-usa-whelan-lawyer-idUSKBN23U14K), so this is pretty much an offer without hopes of progress, first Russia ask for two in exchange for Whelan, then USA ask for Griner instead of Whelan in exchange for Bout and then after receiving no answer on the previous one decides to also ask for Whelan (There won't be a deal), then, ¿Why make the offer? Because it paints the one doing so in a favorable light and elections are near.

In a simplified easy to digest language what the average voter is receiving is this: The D is standing up for black alphabet woman USA citizen jailed in a hostile country, while the R is criticizing the D for doing so, so, R is against black alphabet woman, which highly favours the D while keeps alive the imagery that the R is anti black and anti alphabet people, regardless of the trade offer going nowhere."

Beady is better than Manning, Brees, Rodgers, etc. but we can't say better than say, Joe Montana, even if he wins another 5 SB's. The reason for this is simple. Because of the rule you can't hit QB's low (which, if not enacted in 2009 would have led to Brady being constantly injured thanks to NFL D's discovering he's weak in the knees), the Aaron Rodgers ""driving the weight down on a qb"" rule, helmet to helmet hits, etc. Brady has been able to do what QB's from other eras couldn't: stay healthy and continue to win. Max Kellermans ""cliff"" comment wasn't stupid, since yes, historically QB's haven't done well into Brady's age, he just failed to account for the impact the rule changes had on the health of modern era, can't be hit Qb's. 

While what Brady's done is impressive, we can never know what a guy like Montana could have done in his career if all these QB protection rules had been enacted in the 80's. Maybe he would've played until he was fifty and won fifteen SB titles.  Look at all his injuries, or the shot to the back of the neck from the Giant's D lineman that cost him an entire season in 1990. We will never know."

0,2022-07-29,CMV: Changing an existing queer character’s (in children’s media) orientation or gender in an effort to make them look straight is homophobic and an example of networks attempting to groom and push a heterosexual agenda onto kids.,u/tsundereshipper,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wax2ig/cmv_changing_an_existing_queer_characters_in/,changemyview,"I will be using the anime Sailor Moon as an example here.

For those unaware non-weebs, Sailor Moon is one of the most popular and genre-defining anime franchises of it’s time. It was part of what was known as the big “Millenial Boom of the 90’s” that helped popularize and mainstream anime into the West. Sailor Moon alongside Dragon Ball Z, Pokemon, Yugioh and Cardcaptor Sakura are all global hit phenomena that managed to bridge the gap between “those weird Japanese porn cartoons” and “normie society.”

These types of shows were also all aimed at kids back in their home Japan, and I’m talking *really* little kids, like kindergarten aged and up little.

So what did American dubbing companies at the time proceed to do when they brought such shows over to the West? Surely such innocent and benign child-friendly media would remain virtually untouched in the localization process right?

Oh you sweet summer child…

See due to the difference in culture Japan has much more lenient standards on what’s appropriate to show to little kids - at least compared with America at the time. Yet even then some things remained universal, the Queer romances featured in Sailor Moon for instance were as chaste as any Disney Renaissance Romance film at the time if not chaster. 

But I understand if America simply wasn’t ready to introduce the concept of two mommies or daddies to their preschoolers, it was the 90’s after all.

But there’s still no excuse for not just simply removing these characters/relationships but actively *turning* them straight instead, and there are three instances where this happens in the original DIC Sailor Moon dub (DIC was a subsidiary of Disney, so technically Sailor Moon was originally licensed and localized by Disney, my have times changed indeed if we’re going from a world where Disney actively straight-washed queerness in their licenses to outright *creating* it.)

* In the first season of Sailor Moon we are introduced to two villains from the evil organization who are a canonical gay couple. How did DIC handle this you might ask? Instead of removing the characters altogether or editing/changing their scenes and dialogue they instead kept everything else the same except turned one of them into a *woman.*

* In the second season we get a scene where another male character not explicitly, but heavily alludes to secret feelings for another man. The context for this scene was just as rife for DIC to leave out the subject of romance altogether on the man’s part and simply have him neutrally mock the female character’s feelings instead. (In the original they both shared a romantic interest in the same man) What did DIC do? Instead of taking the neutral way out they instead change the man’s dialogue into confessing a secret crush towards the woman he’s currently conversing with in the scene, again *literally straight-washing a character and inventing their own hetero ship out of nowhere!* Why did romance even have to remain relevant to this edit in the first place? If they were just trying to avoid the controversy of showing the queer boogeyman to the kiddos and risk having angry Karen moms calling the broadcast stations why did they feel the need to interject their own made up hetero fanfiction, why couldn’t they just censor the scene as is and avoid any mention of romantic intentions on the part of the male to begin with?

* The third and final instance is from the 3rd season and involves yet another canonical queer couple (only this time lesbians) who were infamously censored into cousins, but the cousins thing isn’t what I’m going to rant about that’s just whatever, network requirements and the like. No, what I *am* going to rant about is DIC taking the chance to gratuitously insert a moment of heterosexuality into a specific scene involving these lesbians when they could’ve just left it well enough alone as is and the kids wouldn’t have known the better. In the scene the girls are reminiscing about their first kisses and one half of the lesbian couple is talking about her first kiss back in Junior High, she never reveals the identity of who stole her first kiss even in the Japanese original but again it’s heavily alluded to with the way she gazes knowingly at her partner from across the table. So what did DIC do? Instead of just removing the scene or even just the gaze altogether or assuming that the kids would be none the wiser cause you know, they already changed this couple into *cousins,* they instead had to cringely make Sailor Neptune’s character describe in detail who the identity of her first kiss was - why it was BRAD the CUTEST guy in her school of course ~!

All these instances I mentioned go beyond just mere censorship and into straight-out (pun intended) heterosexual propaganda, so don’t talk to me about chaste LGBT content in kids media being used to indoctrinate kids when anime dubbing companies of the 90’s were hypocritically doing the same thing. I’d like to see if anyone can explain to me why the above was okay yet it’s somehow “propaganda” for kids to see a lesbian kiss in the new Buzz Lightyear movie? I’d be interested in seeing if anyone can justify how the above three examples *aren’t* in fact, blatant heterosexual propaganda and indoctrinating kids into being straight when they could’ve just as easily left well enough alone and edit out the scenes altogether rather than leaving them mostly the same just with a “straight” altercation. 

Why is Buzz Lightyear considered gay propaganda but the above examples aren’t hetero propaganda? Why is it only propaganda when Disney creates original queer scenes but not when they localize existing characters into being straight? Propaganda is Propaganda, either criticize all instances of it or just admit that you hold homophobic double standards because I assure you it would’ve been *far* more sanitizing for the kids if they just edited out all allusions to romance in general with these scenes/characters."

With getting older, I experimented around with all those views and had that what people today call spiritual experiences:

\-Lucid dreaming 

\-Being visited from cold, black heavy, paralyzing monsters in sleep

\-Meeting friends in dreams, proven by both sides.

\-Hearing songs in dreams as an inspiration for real life music making

\-Experiencing life as a guided stream of experiences and symbol, that are in line with magic and religion

\-Seeing gods in dreams, sitting in their position like the icons

\-Seeing dead relatives in dreams

\-In Meditation, I experienced to full change of my consciousness to a white, bright light that was everything I was at this moment

But some years ago, I lost my faith in all those experiences in that way, that I no longer believe, they come from a supernatural origin. I now believe, they are just part of the human biology, all those things I experienced, can be explained with rational and materialist based explanations.

There is no soul, no supernatural world, no gods outside of this world, no magical destiny beyond selective human mind that builds sense in our everyday life experience.

Things like near death experiences are just the same things as one can experience in spiritual practice, but the people that have them, are not familiar with those things and therefore too dumb to rate them correctly. 

Past life memories cannot exists, because one cannot even now remember their whole life and those memories are to the most part, forever gone, because they have no synaptic connection anymore. There is no soul or external supernatural source, that can save your memories. Past life experiences are a suggestion, based on your current mental state, nothing more.

The only real past life memories are that you can find are in the ordinary reality, for example history, cultural practices, learned technologies and mythology. You are one of many humans in the stream of history, there is no individuality, because there is no soul.

Astrology is pseudo-science, nothing more."

I think people think that since inflation is out of control, interest rates are high, and we are by definition in a recession, that what we are experiencing is anything like what happened in 2008. That every recession guarantees a crash in housing prices. The cause of that crash isn't anything similar to what's going on now. What we are experiencing now is an unprecedented series of events and circumstances. 

There's still a huge inventory problem, a general lack of new homes being built, corporations and foreign buyers buying up ridiculous amounts of real estate. To disrupt the lack of inventory new houses would need to be built in a time where no one wants to buy and you can't find enough contractors. 

No one who bought a house in the last 2-5 years is going to be stupid enough to sell right now, not when interest rates are 6%, if you're locked into a low interest mortgage you're going to keep it, unless you're in a situation where you're forced to move. 

I see demand going down until interest rates come back down, and maybe you won't get into a bidding war. But I don't see a lot of people selling. I checked my area and there's only about 4 houses going for under $500k listed, 2 years ago there was a decent selection in $200-300k range, could be anecdotal evidence but I doubt people who got those good prices and rates are leaving anytime soon."

A gateway substance is one that leads to the abuse of harder/more harmful drugs.

According to a 2012 investigation, alcohol, not tobacco or marijuana, is the leading to other substances and illegal drug use among underage Americans.

And, according to a study by the National Institutes of Health, 55.3% of high school seniors (all under legal drinking age) have used alcohol in the past year.

This figure is especially concerning because, as with cannabis, alcohol use is known to have harmful developmental effects on children and teenagers, negatively impacting problem solving and memory. 

 Many who drink alcohol do so as an escape, to mask negative feelings of stress, depression, or anxiety with intoxication and artificial feelings of well-being.

But abusing alcohol only makes these issues worse in the long run. 

As alcohol use and dependence escalate, they can lead to a spiral of increasingly negative feelings and compulsive substance abuse with no easy way out. This may continue until you’re drinking alcohol because you feel like you have to, not because you want to."

I've heard some people say this, and I sort of get it---as people are often willing to fight for wealth, and I'd say it is a common motive for war; however, I have some issues with it being portrayed as **the ultimate/root cause** of war.

   
 

First, I feel that it might be over generalizing. By this, I mean that it might be interpreted that all war done around natural resources or for economic reasons is done because of greed. I first realized this impression while reading [the abstract of an NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1122271/)study on the ""Root causes of Violent conflict in **Developing Countries**"". 

In it, it categorized potential causes of conflict, and dedicated one section to economic factors. One of the motives mentioned was economic opportunity (such as young men searching for employment, and finding it as soldiers); but it characterized those motives---even though they were working in **developing countries** with **low incomes**\---can be fit into a ""**Greed Hypothesis**"". Well, let me just say: to me, that sounds like the result of desperation, more than greed.

   
 

Second of all(this is the one I want to put an emphasis on) is that these motives are seemingly ***assumed***; the possibility of other motives is seemingly retroactively dismissed as an ""excuse"". But what if the prospect of wealth was itself simply an excuse to get the support of wealthy financiers? What makes that less likely? 

I feel like cynicism is clouding judgement here? Why must we be so pessimistic?

Or, if you believe that interpreting greed as the general cause for war is sensible based on what we know(about psychology, history, or other relevant factors), then please explain your reasoning below, because a lot of the arguments I've heard just seem to take natural, dominating greed of humans for granted, or say something vague about ""it's just basic human nature"" without really elaborating."

I had to pursue him until he finally turned into a parking lot and I was in tears, ending up with severe internal bruising of the spine and pelvis and couldn’t walk straight up for a week. 

He told police he was sorry and wasn’t thinking, and if the light was red then what was there to even think about. Just stop. Put your foot on the brake and stop. If you can’t manage that after so many years of driving, you need to turn in your license voluntarily or have someone come and pick it up. The cops were even like “dude… you hit her pretty hard in the intersection way back there.

Some might say that this tells you the story is very recent. I disagree because:

A. You can find old articles that say 'BREAKING' in them.

B. Obviously if an article or video was published recently, the story is breaking.

Some might say this tells you the reporting is still preliminary, but that has been covered by the previous points I wrote. Besides, almost all news reports are liable to be changed - very few news stories remain static for long.

So, change my view: the word BREAKING in a headline is meaningless and there's no logical reason to continue doing it.

The problem: Granted, GRE isn't fair for many reasons, so it has been discarded from many grad admission committees. I argue that GPA is an even worse offender of exclusiveness, because many students suffer from poorer GPAs due to needing to work through school, not being able to afford to re-take classes, being too busy working to make office hours/study groups, and feeling intense anxiety speaking with professors. At least GRE is standardized and much cheaper than re-taking classes. GPA, an unstandardized chaotic mess, suffers from differences between universities in grade inflation/deflation. In some places, students work hard for C's and in others, students generally get B's with minimal effort. And who gets into med school/ grad school?"

But I consistently see the narrative that the technology in storage and solar exists NOW to stop climate change and to power the electrical grid, but I just don't see it. And to be transparent, I am a proponent of nuclear, if you went through my profile, somebody could probably find a 'gotcha.' I used to work in the industry, but now I work on the grid side of things, so I'm agnostic as long as we can stop burning massive amounts of coal and natural gas, which is an unbelievable amount.

Anyways, to the topic at hand. I don't think people actually comprehend the scale of power demand in any localized region, and comparatively, understand the tiny amount of power that even industrial sized batteries can supply. 

[With our current battery technology, we are down to about 132$ per kWh](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1134307_report-ev-battery-costs-might-rise-in-2022), which is a pretty impressive reduction over a ten year span(ignoring the curve is flattening). To make the math easier and to give the tech the benefit of the doubt, I will call it $100/kwh. But the grid business deals in megawatts, so that's ~~$1,000,000~~100,000/MWh...or to put it differently, this battery can supply 1MW load for an hour for the cost of ~~1,000,000~~100,000 bucks. 

The PJM market(yes, that's like saying ATM machine...shutup) is a power pool that encompasses most of the northeast United States. It has a daily load demand of roughly 130,000 MW to 150,000MW during peak conditions. During off-peak(11pm-7am), this is consistently half. So we'll call it 70,000MW. To power one hour of this load would be 70,000MWx~~1,000,000~~100,000$/MWh....or 7 billion dollars per HOUR when the sun isn't shining, which could potentially be over 12 hours in the winter. So a ~~trillion~~few hundred billion dollars, for batteries that need to be replaced eventually. The numbers I'm finding is all over the place, so call it ten years. 

And we are only discussing battery costs. I consistently see the statement that solar and wind tech is the cheapest source out there, which is true for certain conditions. But when the whole grid is powered by these, the numbers won't be linear. Right now, they get away with being cheap because there are always natural gas backups. Without divulging too many details, for every MW generated via solar in my domain, a natural gas plant has to be on hot standby to 'pick up' if clouds come in. And while this is an aside, it's a massive fuckin' pain in the ass to grid operators when 3,000MW just disappears when clouds pop up. That's 3 fullsized  conventional steam plants. 

Both capacity factors for solar and wind are ROUGHLY the same at 33%. So they only generate power for 1/3rd of the day if we did an average. So to supply a days worth of power, you will need 3x the amount of solar and wind just to power the daytime, not even considering charging the batteries that will supply the night. 

Obviously the proportion of solar+wind will get a little sloppy at night because wind definitely have an effect and will be intermittent during the nights.

I'm all over the place, but I'd like to be put in my place...because at the moment, waiting for batteries and solar and wind is not the answer imo. We can't rely on 'battery breakthroughs' that will all of a sudden make energy storage a fraction of lithium ion batteries. And pumped storage is not the answer, unfortunately. Every good location has been utilized, and it's [already expensive for 'obvious' locations](https://www.dnr.sc.gov/managed/wild/jocassee/newsletters/jocvol17no2.pdf) aka A billion dollars for 1000MW, not including the cost to fill them up. You know how much money it costs to 'make' power from a pumped hydro plant? About 1/0.8 of whatever it takes to pump it up due to inefficiencies.

Right now, we are waiting on a few trillion dollar investments per region per decade to curb emissions via battery storage.

0,2022-07-29,"cmv: The European system of governance, does not really work without the European way of thinking.",u/atuljinni,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wbmuoa/cmv_the_european_system_of_governance_does_not/,changemyview,"I'm heavily borrowing here from the works of Joseph Henrich.

So, the European system of governance (parliamentary or presidential) does not really work in a society which isn't European or neo-european unless they also start thinking and behaving like Europe.

Here, by Europe, I mostly mean western Europe, not the eastern Europe. And my point is that the current form of governance came organically out of Europe over a period of 1000 years. This way of governance is very much dependent on the European way of thinking. So after WW2, when most of the countries started gaining independence, they mostly adopted a European way of governance (probably because they were being ruled in that system already and with independence only changed the leaders, but kept the system intact, or they tried to copy the European way of governance since they were the only developed nations at that point).

Since then, the more a nation tries to develop, the more it tries to copy the European way of living (for example, monogamy, dismantling of the kin or clan system, western way of education, and others). I am not saying that these things aren't good, my point is that for good or for bad, these ways of living came out of Europe.

So if today any nation wants to develop, it can either try to emulate the European way of life as much as it can, or has to look into a different form of governance altogether.

Edit 1: the term ""Neo - Europe"" means societies which were formed by Europeans during the period of imperialism. For example, the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand.

Edit 2: since everyone is asking what the European way of thinking is, let me explain. By the term European way of thinking, I mean certain values and family systems that are found in more or less all of catholic Europe (including Britain). This system came because of the workings of the Catholic Church. Let me explain family systems first, in Europe the Church, first dismantled the clan system of living, it promoted newly-wed couples to not live with parents, but move out to a new home, at one point people couldn't marry up to their 6th cousins (both on father and mother side), the marriage couldn't happen without the explicit consent of both the bride and the groom (the ""I do"" thing people say at weddings). All of these concepts aren't found in other cultures having a significant population atleast.

For values, you can again check many experiments like the ultimatum game or dictator game which shows that people of Europe or Neo Europe on average tend to distribute the money more equally, they tend to have guilt instead on shame, and others. One can easily find about all these experiments and more in the book ""The weirdest people on Earth"".

When I say ""European way of thinking"", I don't mean that the Europe is a homogenous society with only one culture, it has various cultures. But atleast in the regions which were historically under the influence or control of the Catholic Church, do share a generally same set of values."

that Cyprus had just undergone a fascist coup perpetrated by Greek ultranationalists who were intending on ethnically cleaning the Turkish Cypriots from Cyprus. That is not even my opinion, the entire international community agrees - even Greece to some extent.

Not only that but since secession Northern Cyprus has shown itself to be a free, secular, democratic nation.

I understand needing some measure of protections in place against trolls or malicious actors but i find in my experience I usually am unable to share a lot of great content (atleast I think, dont actually know if they would have been if no one is allowed to see it because some power mod u/buttmuffins decides he knows what the community wants.

Cant list too many examples off the top of my head because it has been a horribly long time since ive been on reddit.

But /r/unpopularopinions probably being one of the worst culprits. (Honestly i think cmv is the real unpopularopinions reddit) They prohibit so many topics that can arguably include their best potential content. I understand some topics like politics or religion can get ugly but its not like people have to participate in said threads.

Like I think I once tried to post something to that subreddit about how I believe the saharan desert was a worse geographical barrier to the rest of the world for sub-saharan africa than the atlantic ocean was for the Americas. (That was a long post I put a lot of effort into just to be banned from the subreddit for politics, even though no politics were involved, also thats a post for another time if i feel like redoing it lol, perhaps it was a little better suited for cmv)

Regardless I'm sure a lot of people can relate and I am eager to delta those that are worthy, but I aint cheap n easy ;)

Thanks for reading!

Edit: I'm not bashing mods and admins per se, just saying how a lot of the administration's policies is probably hurting reddit's own potential and users with frustrating and inconsistent management that drives users away more than it protects them or ensures quality content, infact as I said, probably prevents more quality content than preventing malicious content. (If people are genuine but post poor content they shouldnt be blocked and be allowed to improve via feedback)

Edit3: Oh crap I noticed most posts capitalize CMV in their titles, hopefully this doesnt turn out to be a aelf-fulfilling prophecy lol! /s I see other people with lowercase cmv not being taken down.

1,2022-07-30,CMV: When a view/argument is presented: the actual substance of the argument should be the main focus of any rebuttal/critism.,u/Fire-Watch,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wbq68p/cmv_when_a_viewargument_is_presented_the_actual/,changemyview,"I have found very often, that when a view is presented in an argument, many people seem to focus their attack on the argument itself instead of the actual substance of that argument. I think it may be helpful to give an example of this:

\----start of my example----------

There are two men who share the same view: ""Cats should be elected to be our eternal rulers and overlords"" (---example of view---)

Both men write an argument expressing this view.  Lets say their names are Bob Mcdebatesalot and Decepti Feles. Bob  is some sort of expert at rhetoric and writes the most compelling argument that has ever been written to support the idea that cats should be our benevolent overlords (meows of approval can be heard) Decepti, though, is not so eloquent when it comes to expressing his views and writes something riddled with spelling mistakes and rhetorical fallacies of which the cats would not approve (disapproving hisses can now be heard).   The substance of both men's arguments are still the same: they both are arguing that cats have the right of rule over mankind.  But when it comes time for the rebuttals to each man's arguments...

Lets just say that decepti's bad grammar and rhetorical fallicies were pointed out in large parts in the rebuttals against his arguments.  And Bob, well since his arguments were purrfect, he successfully convinced everyone and was later asked by the cats to give the speech which commemorated the start of the rule of Chairman Meow and the start of the era of Pax Feles (""Peace of Cats"" in latin) which would last for 9000 cat years.

\----end of my example--------------

My view is that even though Bob argued his point of view well and Decepti poorly.... Both men still have valid substance in their arguments.  I will concede that part of the reason Decepti's errors should be pointed out is because it  could arguably could help him improve as a debator (and thereby better be able to please his feline masters in the future when he presents his arguments in their favour)

My view, therefore; at this point in time is that the substance  of an argument should be the central focus of any rebuttal."

My reasoning:

* Universal - Picross doesn't rely on words or a specific language, just pure logic. I just purchased a small Picross collection in Italy and I can use it just fine without knowing any Italian whatsoever.

* Accessible - the concept is extremely simple and can be taught to even young kids. No vocabulary, general or pop culture knowledge is needed to succeed.

Now these points also apply to Soduko, but here's where Picross has the edge:

* Therapeutic - physically coloring the pixels as you uncover the solution is extremely therapeutic in the Occupational Therapy sense. It also helps keep kids physically busy, which is always a plus.

* Rewarding - thus point is where Picross truly shines. By the end of the puzzle you are left with a pixelated drawing, which is quite nice to glance at seeing as before you started it was simply a coded number of sequence. You are rewarded for your efforts, and you can get themed Picross books to get puzzles in a genre you like (animals, world landmarks, video game characters, etc).

0,2022-07-30,CMV: The belief that identity persists over time requires the belief in a soul.,u/fantasy53,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wbtktu/cmv_the_belief_that_identity_persists_over_time/,changemyview," In a modern justice system, we rely on concepts like retribution justice and personal responsibility, and all of these are based on the idea that identity persists over time., For example, if someone commits a crime and they are court, they are responsible and should be held accountable for this but there is no reason to believe that identity persists unless you also believe in the idea of the soul.

Materialistic explanations of identity such as substance-based explanations can’t be relied upon because our cells and molecules are changing constantly, so if the trial is held three or four weeks into the future the person being accused might not actually be the exact same person who committed the crime.

Locke has a theory about memory preserving identity, but there is a problem with this as well because if someone has mental problems and they believe that they’ve committed the crimes of Pol pot  then they should be held responsible for those crimes, the problem with the theory is it doesn’t distinguish between false and true memories and of course  how would a judge in a trial be able to tell if a person genuinely remember something or not.

There are also relational theories of identity as well, but just because two objects or two people share a relationship that doesn’t mean they’re the same.  the only thing that can explain the existence of identity over time is a soul, the reason why the person who committed the crime and the person in the courtroom  are the same is because they share the same soul."

For my stance is that when people reach the specified retirement age, they must be granted a fixed wage payment equivalent to the country's national average for the sake of their survival, in the same way some government employees get. In return, this may provide some benefits. Many people who are saving for their old age will be relieved, and the stress of people who are living on a paycheck-to-pay-check will be reduced. This may increase consumers' spending on non-essential goods like electronics or high-branded apparel without stressing about the future, and in turn, bring more profits for vendors and producers and also create space for a new labor force to join various economic activities left by their retired peers, but now many people will laboriously argue about the topic of inflation, and that is the reason why I also mentioned controlling important segments of the economy. Now economy is the area of society concerned about the production and consumption of goods and services in the area. If the government controls important sectors such as the agriculture sector and its R&amp;D and controls the prices of essential goods, especially food staple goods that are being sold by vendors and holds control over the prices of gas and energy sector, it can also provide free healthcare, basic education, and free real estate properties for people who are not advantaged and, most importantly, have control over its country's demographics. I don't know how much I am correct with this perception or how I perceive that these actions will smooth the functioning of the economy and how the economic agents (businesses, households, and government) interact with each other and how the three markets, namely labor market, Goods and service market &amp; Financial market will have a good standing while assuaging the poor.  As far as financing is considered, however, it can be financed by printing money. In some countries, like the [US](https://www.soundvision.com/article/some-interesting-money-facts), $540 million is printed every day, and also, printing money is used to finance most government expenditures."

People really shouldnt have sex until they have their career in order imo as this would be the safest. I just really dont see how casual sex can be enjoyable as i know i would worry constantly during and after it that i or my partner would have one of the two things i mentioned before.

Most I’d say 90% of people are considerate. When they see there’s construction they begin to merge. But there’s always 2-3 people who wait until they get to the very end of the lane to try to merge. The majority of the time it’s one of 2 things, either the person is an asshole or shouldn’t be driving. They’d be an asshole because they think their time is more important than everyone in the merging lane. These are people working together to make sure things continue to flow smoothly and some decide to take advantage of it, ruining it for everyone else. If that’s not the case and they genuinely didn’t see it then they shouldn’t be driving. If you see everyone starts to merge, can’t see the orange cones, big flashing arrow, and usually warning signs, then you lack the proper awareness to be a safe driver.

The only excuse which usually isn’t the case is if you’re turning onto the street directly perpendicular to the merge, or if there’s a large truck that is obscuring your view. If you start merging prior to getting to the merge even if there’s a couple asshole who don’t let you merge, you can usually get in before you reach the end.

Not necessarily with every situation, but I feel this is accurate when it comes to certain situations. 

The overall meaning behind my view is that I feel like just because somebody says they are offended by something someone has said, or has done, doesn’t mean that they’re automatically right and whoever offended them is wrong. 

I’m sure you all are familiar with cancel culture and how it has evolved throughout the years. I’ll be the first to say, because it’s important that it’s understood, I’m not saying that I or anybody else can control what offends somebody, or control their right to be offended by anything. I’m simply saying that just because someone is offended by something, doesn’t mean that their taken on said action was justified for them receiving an apology, or being show any sympathy etc. 

It’s hard to just make an example off the top, but I’ll say two examples. I’m me being an example to explain my view, the other being an example that takes place/has taken place in real life. 

Example 1 (Hypothetical)

Let’s say there’s a morbidly obese woman whose at the doctor’s office for a checkup. The doctor then goes on to tell her that she’s over weight, needs to watch what she eats, and suggest a diet for her to partake in, along with a layout for a suitable workout plan that fits this woman’s body/work schedule. Continuing on, this woman then goes on to claim that she feels offended and feels like the doctor took a body shaming approach when delivering the information he suggest for her. 

Is it ok for this woman to be offended? Absolutely 

Is the doctor in the wrong though? 

If this woman were to post a video crying about how she feels like she was body shamed, should this doctor be fired from his job?

Keep in mind, the doctor was never disrespectful, but more so was just very blunt telling this woman what she needs to hear health wise versus what she would want to hear. 

Whose wrong in this situation?

Example 2 (Real Life)

Look at comedians of today. I’m all for times in the world changing not only for the better, but just in a general sense. But I feel like comedians today offend people at their shows when the whole purpose is to make one laugh and have a good time. Jokes at a comedy show can range from cultures, to stereotypes, sexual preferences, insecurities, etc. 
Look at Dave Chapelle. People were trying to cancel him because they felt his show was homophobic. While again, I admit that I cant tell somebody what can offend them and what cant, but does the people that felt Dave was wrong, does this mean they were automatically right? Does intent matter? Context matter? How about the Environment in which it’s understood that comedy shows are entertainment and while everyone might not find it funny, it comes from a genuine place of basically laughing at the wrongs in society in an attempt to make a negative into a positive. 

Basically to summarize everything. I’ll stick to the second example to conclude. I feel like if someone feels they want to cancel  Dave due to being offended, that’s ok. But does it automatically make the offended party right? My view is that I don’t think so. I feel like being offended is more of a opinionated thing versus factual like I see a lot people try and make it seem."

Short version is we jumped from speculation to certainty without enough time for science, the topic has since become a belief system, and proper science has become near to impossible.

Or at least so it seems....

First read a speculative article about ""greenhouse gases"" in the 1980s, and thought humans were *likely* affecting climate (somewhere between 90% and 0.9%). I still have the same range of uncertainty.

Problem is, I figured that to do the science properly would take near a century, yet we seem to have reached popular certainty in the 1990s. Then the conversation got weird. Questioning the consensus was treated as heresy. This could not be science.

Also, the history of science tells us that the community beliefs are often wrong.

Keep in mind that two of my professors in Physics had experiments that required *extreme* rigor to get accurate result. One got a Nobel for detecting neutrinos, and another was measuring gravity at close distance with extreme accuracy. Like to think I learned about rigor from listening.

We are now 30-40 years in, and I cannot tell what (proper) science has been done. 

Was reminded of this topic when ordering a book:  
[https://www.amazon.com/Scout-Mindset-Perils-Defensive-Thinking/dp/0735217556/ref=tmm\_hrd\_swatch\_0](https://www.amazon.com/Scout-Mindset-Perils-Defensive-Thinking/dp/0735217556/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=)  
after listening to a TEDx talk:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MYEtQ5Zdn8&amp;ab\_channel=TEDxTalks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MYEtQ5Zdn8&amp;ab_channel=TEDxTalks)

On this topic, I still have the same set of questions from the start. Ask questions and the conversation quickly turns irrational. You must be a ""believer"" or a ""denier"". Seems to be an exact map to the ""scout versus soldier"" mindset.

Is there any explanation other than herd behavior for the short span from speculation to certainty?

Is there a proper *impartial* review of the science around this topic? Is this even possible?"

My view is that as long as people behave with kindness and respect towards others it doesn't matter what they think on the inside.

We'll literally never know for sure what someone else may truly believe, only their actions/behaviour matter as that is what affects the external world.

Thought crime, as in the crime of thinking a certain way, like prejudice based on race or religion, is meaningless unless it causes someone to act on those beliefs. It is the act, not the belief that we punish when someone commits a hate crime - the crime itself is not hating, its hatred fuelling a criminal act. 

If your external behaviour is pleasant to everyone including those you hate then what difference does it make?

I can truly believe in my heart that eating meat is morally wrong, on ethical grounds of cruelty and environmental grounds. That's a meaningless thing to believe if I still eat meat. 

My behavior is what matters, not the belief. 

If someone hates animals and the environment but still doesn't eat meat then the end result is the same!"

I think this  example would help me explain:

\-----Start of example----

Donald the duck is a police officer. Donald wants to get a personalized custom plate for his vehicle that also denotes how he is in law enforcement.    Donald goes to the dmv and purchases a custom plate and precedes to install it on his car.   Some weeks later donald is driving back home in his own car from the local donut place.  He is recklessly speeding down the road and endangering public safety (20 mph over lets say).  Karen the Goose who is an on duty police officer sees this behaviour and precedes to pull him over.  After donald pulled over and stopped, karen pulled behind him and stoped like anytime she does when she pulls someone over.   Karen gets out of the car and walk's up to Donald's window. Donald and Karen do not know each other because they are from seperate agencies.   Karen, however; saw that the duck she pulled over had a law enforcement plate on the back of his car.   Karen knew that this was one of her law enforcement comrades and because of this: Of course she wasn't going to give him a ticket! I mean why would she jeapordize a fellow officers career like that?  They do the secret thin-blue line handshake and donald goes merrily on his way... still speeding down that very road he was just pulled over on.

Later that day..... karen would also pull over an off-duty firefighter who also had a custom first-responder plate and let him off as well, Afterall, she thought to herself: ""Blue and red gotta stay together right? ""

Next, she pulled over cory the crocidile who had a ""Veteran"" custom liscense plate. She let him off too when she saw his plate. ""He's done a lot for this country, he doesnt deserve a ticket either"" Karen thought to herself

But then she pulled over Bob the bear.  Bob is just your average bear with an average bland liscense plate... of course she gave him a ticket... ""He was speeding, no excuses!"", she thought to herself.

\----End of example----

My view is that first responder custom lisense plates increase the likelihood of the kind of favoritism/ corruption illustrated by my short story example.  I also think that any kind of vanity plate could also increase the likelyhood of favortism happening as illustrated by ""cory"" in my example.

Plus even with another typical custom liscense plate, there could end up being favoritism: what if someone has a wildlife themed liscense plate because they donated to wildlife preservation research.  ""Karen"" could pull them over and let them off simply because she saw from the plate that they donate to saving animals and stuff.  Donating money to a cause is good, but it should not give a person special priviliges when pulled over.

I can also,however; see some benefits to first responder liscense plates: I can see why a law enforcement  officer would want to have LE vanity plates on their car when it is parked outside of their house, for example.  It could likely deter theft and other crimes from happening if the potential crook sees that whoever lives there has LE vanity plates and is probably a cop.  If i was a cop i would certainly want peace of mind like that.

I have immense respect for Law enforcement, Firefighters and Veterans but I also dont believe there should not be favoritism when it comes to the handing out of tickets and enforcement of other laws such as dui laws. All groups should be treated fairly and equally when pulled over, not simply get let off just because they are the member of a certain group or class of people."

Assumption : Being obese is main symptom of fast food addiction and a proof. I know being obese isn’t always the proof someone is addicted to fast food, but 90% of cases it Is.  
Tolerance :  With every pound you gain you demand more of fast food, this could mean if you gain a pound in a month you demand around 3500 extra calories of junk every month. 
Withdrawal : The worst thing. Even the biggest alcoholic/smokers craves alcohol for 6 weeks to maybe few months. That’s it. An obese person may crave junk food till he/she gets to normal weight. That weight loss where your body literally demands food by creating cravings like hunger where you can’t eat it because you are quitting on junk food. That’s the main withdrawal by symptom of junk food addiction. No drug or anything can replicate the withdrawal duration of fast food addiction with symptom being strong hunger craving where your body literally demands more calories.
Reinforcement: Let’s face it if someone is used to of eating fast food,every time they get hungry(which is a natural need of body unlike being drunk/ urge to smoke) they crave fast food. With ads and everything and no legal laws, it’s easy to consume.
Dependence : This is referred to how easy it is to quit the drug. Let’s face it almost every fat person has tried to quit it at some point(infact many points),the entire fat logic is based on girls unable to lose weight no matter what they do and eventually accepting there body. 
Fat people are treated the worse in society, a smoke or alcoholic could have a gf , be functioning and no one bats an eye. When you are fat every single person ridicules you . Life in high school/college is non existent and yet people fail to quit it not because they are weak willed but the sheer fact it is eventually the most addictive drug out there."

""Fishness"" refers to a performer's aptitude for passing as an ordinary person of the gender they are performing. ""Realness"" refers to a performer's aptitude for performing gendered behavior in a particular context. 

""Fishness"" is contextually general, whereas ""realness"" is contextually particular. It is possible to be real and not fish because there are some things that ordinary people of a given gender typically do not do. For example, if people are competing in the supermodel realness category, the entrants would not be trying to be fish, but they would try to be real; this is by design, since for there to be a supermodel industry, ordinary women need to not be comparable to supermodels. 

Typically, in drag culture, most of the contestants will either be gay or trans people. This risks making it seem as if straight and cis people can neither be fish nor real, because they do not need to ""pass"" as anything in their day-to-day lives. 

My view is that straight and cis people absolutely can be fish and real with respect to behavioral norms  for their gender. A tomboy, for example, who feels she cannot be a girly girl is neither fish nor real. When your girlfriend pulls out the nipple pasties, the choker, the sexy lingerie, and etc., she's being real but most definitely not fish. When that too-short waifish guy at the gym feels the need to strut his chest and flex his arms more than his bros, his overcompensation points to a lack of belief in his realness as a gym rat."

I guess it is a bit illogical to think that we can look identical to a woman. If it is truly the case that I, and any other trans women have deluded ourselves into believing that we can look indistinguishable from the female sex, then there’s no point disclosing, **especially** if the trans woman started transitioning in adulthood.

I feel joy and sense of accomplishment playing videogames.

Many mental health specialists and a big part of society in general say that people often refuge in videogames when they can't feel those emotions I mentioned in real life.

But my question - what's real life?

I will take one example about life fulfillment in real life - Travelling.

Many people get extreme joy and sense of accomplishment when they travel - they visit new cities, new monuments and learn different cultures.

But are those cities, monuments and cultures real? They aren't natural, that's for sure... They are human creations...

Same as videogames! You can also visit new cites, monuments and cultures created by humans but in this case they are virtual. That's the only difference.

We are moving into a virtual era so is it really wrong to get joy and sense of accomplishment playing videogames? So many psychologists say it is unhealthy... I don't understand why…

Even the human connection factor nowadays you can have virtually and many videogames are huge online communities.

Travelling is just one example, many other things in ""real life"" are human creations as well...

Even the most basic things that most people live for... Like marriage!!!

What makes it real? It's a human invention. No more than than... And so many people take it so seriously... 

Many people live for it... Go trough a lot of stress palnning it... Mental distress thinking about the ""commitment"" they will make... Spend all the money they have on a party... Then 50% of them end up divorcing…

I understand that love is a more deep and real thing...  Family too... But the ""contract"" called marriage and the ""party"" are no more real than a videogame. 

Even worst - this contract or obligation that marriage should be forever. This human creation is useless, stupid and only exist to bring suffering to people... Specialy to the kids!!

Sure is great when love lasts forever but the obligation ruins it all. 

Attention, I am not saying that videogames are good and the other things in life are bad... I love to travel and I feel extreme joy doing it. Also maybe I will get married someday. Nothing wrong with that!

I just don’t understand why videogames are considered a refuge from real life by mental health specialists (and others) when many other real life events are as real as videogames…"

With AI art and AI scriptwriting like DALLE and AI dungeon, proof that AI can already construct art just as well, if not better than humans, there is no reason for a company to hire a worker over a machine. 

The art industry is already shrinking and will continue to shrink as more automation takes over. No one will go through the trouble of hiring a graphic designer or artist when AI can instantly generate pictures, concept art, game portraits or scripts for movies. 

House of Cards was already written by AI, and everyone loved it. There's no hope for us artists or creatives, this society values the arts less than even burger flippers. 

I can forsee art jobs disappearing by 2030, and growing extinct by 2050. Who the hell would want to waste 1000$ on a painting or comission, when DALLE can generate it in 5 minutes for free?

Most jobs will go, but jobs that require technical knowledge like medicine would stay around a bit longer.

2,2022-07-31,CMV: The arguments made by the GOP about the national debt (or spending in general) are nothing more than political theater,u/rwhelser,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wcj9rv/cmv_the_arguments_made_by_the_gop_about_the/,changemyview,"Disclaimer:  I'm not saying that the ignoring the debt is good or that we shouldn't be mindful of our spending.

With that said, it seems every time that Republicans are either the minority in Congress or don't control the White House, they love to talk about fiscal responsibility, or raise concerns about the national debt.  How many times do we hear about our grandchildren's money being spent?  Most recently, some GOP senators caused waves when they shot down the PACT Act this week, which provided for military Veterans who suffered from exposure to burn pits, Agent Orange, and the like.  One of the issues raised that killed the bill?  You guessed it, spending.

When the second round of stimulus checks went out prior to Donald Trump leaving the White House, members of the GOP and even White House staffers argued the lower amount was justified as the former President stood with them in being fiscally responsible.  They wound up embarrassed when he tweeted, ""where's the $2,000 checks?!"" which goes very much against Republican values.

When the government shut down in October 2013, it was over spending issues.  Again, during the majority of Barack Obama's presidency, the GOP screamed bloody murder when it came to fiscal responsibility and the national debt.  

So of course, when the GOP took over the House, Senate, and the White House following the 2016 elections, we saw responsible, fiscal responsibility at work, right?  Not quite.  The national debt at the end of Fiscal Year 2016 (Sep 2016) was just over $19.5 trillion.  A year later (again, when the GOP took control of the Congress and White House), it was up to $20.245 trillion.  At the end of FY 2018, it was up to $21.516 trillion.  By the end of FY 2020 and just before the November elections, the debt was at $27.748 trillion.  To put these numbers in perspective, comparing it to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the variable that economists use to determine the size of the economy, in FY 2016 the debt was 105% of GDP.  By the end of FY 2020, it was 129% of GDP.  

During the Trump years, nobody in the GOP raised an issue about the debt, the excessive spending, or even mentioned the words ""fiscal responsibility.""  The only time that Trump mentioned anything about the debt was during his campaign, maybe during a debate, he said he'd have it to zero in eight years.  Instead, on his watch, the debt increased more over a four-year period than any President in history (emphasis on the four-year period part).  I also want to note that it's not the President who makes the money decisions.  Congress has the power of the purse.

The last and only time in U.S. history that the national debt was zero, was in 1835, before there even was a Republican Party (it wasn't established until 1854).  But modern Republicans love to tout how those on the other side love to spend like drunken sailors (sorry sailors, I know that's an insult to you).  But at the same time, when they've had the ability to do so, they have never enacted anything to try to restrain excessive spending or bring down the debt.

With that said, I believe these politicians also know something that the common voter either does not or chooses not to think about.  When it comes to debt, the U.S. is not like an individual or a business.  If an individual were to borrow thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, billions, or (if ever possible) trillions of dollars *every single year for years*, they'd be royally screwed real quick; not to mention they probably wouldn't be borrowing for that long.  On the flip side, the U.S. national debt has been at or above $1 trillion since 1981, however, the country didn't fall apart.  Kids born in the 80s, 90s, and 00s didn't see IOUs in the mail because Uncle Sam borrowed against them.  The federal government has, instead, been functioning pretty normally since then--whether it's been effective or not is a separate topic altogether.  So how can government continue to operate at a loss where it continuously borrows trillions of dollars every single year and not face the same catastrophe that would haunt you and me?  The federal government has a monopoly on creating the U.S. dollar.  The United States has the largest economy of any country on Earth, and is a reliable trade partner.  The U.S. dollar is the world's reserve currency, and many other countries rely on the U.S. to keep their economies running, just as the U.S. relies on them.  

In theory, Congress could pass a resolution creating $30 trillion earmarked at paying off the national debt at any point in time (note:  there is a bit of complexity involved here, and there would be massive consequences as a result, but I'm painting this picture for simplicity).  On the flip side, if you or I were to print money for the purpose of paying our bills, we'd end up in jail.  

Knowing this, and seeing how reckless politicians have been with public funds over the decades, I honestly feel that the GOP narrative of fiscal responsibility and worrying about the national debt is complete political theater and nothing more.  I don't believe for a moment that they care about fiscal responsibility one bit.  In fact, the only time you'll hear it even come up or see some action take place is when election time pops up (\*checks calendar, sees this year is an election year, and wonders if this week's vote on the PACT Act might have been politically motivated for votes\*).

I would love for someone to change my view on this.  I do think it's an important issue, and unfortunately, until a massive program like Social Security starts to fail, I honestly don't see our elected officials doing anything about it.  Reducing the debt means cutting back, and cutting back means pissing off voters, and that translates to those elected officials being voted out, and we all know their top priority over everything is getting elected/re-elected.

I look forward to the discussion."

Most of them seem to have had a rather disappointing history: They arrived at some point in the 20th and represented an underrated revolution by freeing people from thousands of hours they could instead spend on work, children, or just relaxing. But then, for reasons I don’t understand, they just stopped there and didn’t improve much more than incremental improvements that saved at max a couple of minutes. If I lived at the time they came around I would’ve predicted that by now:

1. Washing machines wouldn’t require a bunch of time and effort spent sorting clothes.

2. Dishwashers wouldn’t need every grain of rice scraped off before you put your plate in.

3. Toilets wouldn’t often get clogged and could flush down almost anything.

4. And other things regarding nearly every classic home appliance.

In the last half-century we have explored the outer reaches of our solar system, connected the world through the internet, and brought computers and pocket-sized phones to nearly every home in the developed world. Why then couldn’t we set aside some of our innovation brilliancy to shaving off those last few hours of everyday manual labour? For sure information technology spared us time by granting us quick information, but with the exception of some regional lack of broadband most of the work that needs to be done for sparing us time has been done. Now I honestly think it’s time for tech investors to focus more on creative household appliance ideas/solutions, and not Apple or SpaceX. Before we go to Mars we should make sure our progress isn’t slowed down by people not having the time they need."

I understand that most names were changed but it was somewhat uneasy and queasy reading about his family members who were (at the time) still alive; I think most are. 

However, as I have spoken to other people about this most seem to feel nonchalant about it. So below is the view I would like changing:

&gt;	It was right of me to stop reading the books by Knausgard because continuing them would have been unethical

If I asked someone to obstain for one week, they will most likely say something like ""I just cant go without cheese""; I have heard this statement dozens of times. If you replace the word ""cheese"" with ""alcohol"", it makes more sense. Theres no reason, other than addiction, that someone would use the word ""cant"". The first step of defeating addiction is denial, so it comes as no surprise that people will persistantly deny this. Change my view."

Touchy topic, and controversial stance, I know. Just hear me out, then you can change my mind :).

For context, I am 21M, and I have throughout my adolescence and early adulthood learned restraint, typically through reviewing not-so-great decisions on my part but also by watching what others around me do. I know that my experiences are fairly common (at least at my relatively young age) and occur on both sides of relationships, friendships, collegiality, business partnerships, etc. regardless of sex, but the recent campaign for ousting and openly discussing sexual assault, domestic violence, abuse, toxic masculinity, etc. has seemed to send out conflicting signals. On the one hand, I understand that emotional maturity includes the confidence to express openly one's feelings and the ability to respond in kind to others' feelings, but there also seem to be sides that must be suppressed (and for good reason). If a sexual and aggressive drive is more prevalent and potent in men, who have each in turn put themselves in iffy situations as I have, it seems to me to point to a call for restraint and, sometimes in my case, a fear of unleashing the beast. Either that or an understanding by both parties that restraint is an option that may be preferred.

Now, I could see the argument that expressing emotions verbally and taking the circumstance and response of the listener into account is a useful compromise (e.g., do not hit on your coworkers because they have shit to do and are not in the mood/mindset to receive that in any capacity; a miss in this circumstance also leads to intercolleague tension/drama), and that expressing emotions by \*acting on\* somebody is a different case than \*sharing with\* somebody, but in some cases we may even frown upon someone unloading their burdens onto us at an inopportune time. And recurring episodes may lead to frustration or misunderstandings, as is clear with (some branches of) the movements described above.

So I suppose my case is to be careful what you wish for and specify in what form it should be done, because from personal experience there are legitimate feelings in men that are best left unsaid.

Other points of view welcome, but this is my understanding from what I have experienced. Thanks for listening!

EDIT: Thank you all for the insights! For those just coming in, here is what I have given deltas to: u/masterofyourhouse has brought up that aggression is a manifestation of the emotion of anger and that there are better ways of expressing said emotion. They also mention that sexual attraction is similar and can be expressed in healthier ways such as benign compliments or thoughts.

u/I_am_the_night has mentioned that movements for ""more emotional expression"" refer to encouraging healthy forms of expression rather than more of the norm. I agree completely, and I realized I had the wrong impression based on (potentially) sensationalist media consumption."

952,2022-07-31,CMV: Expanding the supreme court for clearly partisan reasons (Ex. Roe V Wade) is a bad idea,u/WrinklingBrain,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wcx2e1/cmv_expanding_the_supreme_court_for_clearly/,changemyview,"Hello, my belief is as follows.

I believe that the movements and desires of some people to expand the supreme court's justice count to beyond nine in light of the recent overturning of Roe v Wade is a bad idea.

I believe it is a bad idea because it sets a horrible precedent of expanding the court for something that is a partisan issue. Namely, republicans vs democrats for the most part in this case. I am trying not to fall into the slippery slope fallacy here but it's hard not to see how if the party in control of this power now expands the court, that the other party wouldn't do the same thing. There is already precedence for one side doing something for its own reason and the other side using such precedence to accomplish their goals, because why wouldn't they?

I think this ping-ponging back and forth ad nauseam will completely undermine the supreme court of this country because any side in control and just add more people.

I think alternative measures on the court could and should be taken. One idea I've heard would be to introduce term limits similar to our other public offices.

In order to change my view I'd need evidence or convincing that expanding the court for a partisan issue is a net positive, regardless of the future expansions in might enable, or to be convinced that there will not be any more expansion if we just let it happen this time.

0,2022-07-31,CMV: It would be better if school teachers had tasers to stop a mass shooting than a firearm,u/carsandsodabars,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wcxhj4/cmv_it_would_be_better_if_school_teachers_had/,changemyview,"Tasers are by and large non lethal and you don't have to worry about a bullet overpenetrating a mass shooter and hitting someone else. Also, guns are very loud and shooting one without hearing protection can lead to hearing loss. Also, the conscious of the person doing the tasing will be at more ease than if they shot and killed someone with a gun. Training with a taser can be done anywhere at anytime unlike with guns and they require less skill to use than a gun.

Pepper spray doesn't incapacitate a mass shooter as much as a taser can.

A lot more people would feel comfortable using one compared with a firearm and considering classroom sizes, they can be a viable option to stop a mass shooter."

If you listen to what climate scientists, marine biologists, ecologists, and all the other experts that have reached a majority consensus say, we are barreling towards a radically different environment within a short time span, usually within 100 years. An environment that is losing many critical species of insects and waterborne life, that will present major challenges to agriculture worldwide, and that is starting to create snowballing effects that release greenhouse gasses from glaciers in exponentially increasing quantities. You've all seen the alarmist news articles here on Reddit, except that the majority of experts do agree that those articles are mostly *not* alarmist. I'm not here to argue about whether those experts are right, I'll take it at face value that our way of life is majorly screwed if we don't drastically re-organize how we interact with each other and the environment on a global scale.

In America, the most reasonable way to approach this is to use government regulations to highly incentivize, or just straight up force, industries and large corporations to use sustainable practices, or change their business model until it is sustainable. This should include moving material production back to domestic shores, highly funding R&amp;D to find the best manufacturing, food production, and consumption practices to prioritize reducing environment impact instead of profit. Dis-allowing companies to continue using foreign labor to get around environmental policy is also necessary. 

Things I am aware of already: 

It will be prohibitively expensive - Yes, but the alternative is to not have a functioning society for the vast majority of people in a few short generations. This is worth any cost to avoid. 

The political climate will never allow for this level of dystopian governmental power - True, but given that the alternative is, again, the probable collapse of society, we may have to sacrifice some of our notions of 'freedom' in order to continue to exist.

We deserve what we get, or people will not allow change this drastically to save themselves - Also true, but not relevant because I want to talk about possible solutions and the best way forward."

I'm a huge BS fan, and there's no way I can afford tix this time around, but I don't feel robbed by him. I think, if anything, he's helping lead other artists into a more realistic market. If he's wrong, and the seats don't actually sell, Bruce will be the first to know and adapt. I get being upset, but the anger should go toward secondary sellers not the artists. 

I want you to cmv because my biases for Bruce or my misunderstandings about the secondary market might be influencing my reasoning. But I've bought plenty of tix at marked up prices and thought ""wouldn't it be better if this money went to Artist instead of Website/middleman""? Bruce seems to be finding a way to do that.

The vast majority of people consider themselves good people, and through that comes their belief in doing good things, things they think they have a good reason to do. However obviously not all people are good people.

Both an opressive and controling parent and a more understanding one believe they do what is best for their child. That is a good motive, yet one of those two parents are still taking the wrong approach.

An abusive husband/wife will see their actions as what a good relationship should look like. Having a good relationship is a good intention, yet their idea of what that is is flawed.

Many murderers will claim they killed someone for the benefit of society. Benefiting society is a noble cause, but quite a few great people have been killed for that reason.

Ultimately, nearly every action can be justified by a motive that's seen as good, but not all actions are good. Following that, nearly every person has good intentons, but not all people are good.

I have been implying there being an exception a lot in this text. That's because there is a minority of people fully aware that their actions are bad yet doing them anyways. In their case, following bad intentions cannot lead to a good outcome outside of sitcoms. They're bad people essentialy by default."
