Today, we want to discuss an urgent matter that affects both the moderators and users. As you may be aware, the [recent announcement](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/31/popular-reddit-app-apollo-may-go-out-of-business-over-reddits-new-unaffordable-api-pricing/) made by Reddit regarding their APIs have raised significant concerns within the Reddit community.

Starting on July 1st, Reddit has unilaterally decided to impose exorbitant charges on third-party app developers (Relay, Reddit is Fun, Apollo, Baconreader, Narwhal etc.) for utilizing their API. This decision [has far-reaching consequences](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=pics&utm_content=t3_141e2lw) that not only hinder app developers but also affect the experience of moderators and users alike. The lack of maturity in Reddit's official app has made it difficult for us to fulfill our responsibilities as moderators efficiently, and it has also left many users dissatisfied with their browsing experience.

In response to this situation, the moderators of r/Economics have joined forces with other subreddit communities and their respective mod teams in a coordinated effort. We believe that unity is essential in driving change and advocating for the rights of app developers and the overall user experience. To amplify our message and demonstrate the strength of our concerns, r/Economics will be participating in a temporary blackout starting on June 12th, lasting for 48 hours.

During this blackout period, the subreddit will be set to private, rendering it inaccessible to all users. This collective action is intended to raise awareness and urge Reddit to reconsider their recent API changes. Our primary goal is to initiate a productive dialogue with Reddit, leading to a reversal of the detrimental modifications they have implemented.

We understand that this blackout may cause temporary inconvenience to our community, and for that, we apologize. However, we firmly believe that this short-term disruption will bring long-term benefits for every user. By standing together with other subreddit communities, we hope to send a clear message to Reddit and foster a meaningful conversation about the future of their API policies.

In the meantime, we encourage you to let Reddit know that you disagree with their planned changes. There are a few ways you can express your concerns:

* [Email](mailto:contact@reddit.com) Reddit or create a [support ticket](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to communicate your opposition to their proposed modifications.
* Share your thoughts on other social media platforms, spreading awareness about the issue .
* Show your support by participating in the Reddit boycott for 48 hours, starting on June 12th.

We appreciate your understanding, support, and active participation in this important endeavor. It is through the strength and dedication of our community that we can strive for a better Reddit experience for everyone involved.

Thank you,

The Mod Team of r/Economics"
