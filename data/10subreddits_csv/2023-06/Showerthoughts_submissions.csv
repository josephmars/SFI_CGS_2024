&#x200B;

&#x200B;

<egghead reflections>

Fascinating logical statement, I think!

One the one hand the statement talks of an incredibly unlikely series of events - billions of years of living organisms on this planet somehow each surviving long enough to reproduce and for *their* direct progeny to also achieve that most noble of goals.  To have this chain of events over such a vast period of time leading directly to each of us as individuals - it's almost unfathomable in its majesty.

On the *other* hand, the statement is unsurprising, obvious even.  How so?  Well, the condition that the statement describes is an example of the 'observer selection bias'.  Essentially it means this - no matter how unlikely or contrived the set up is; if it represents a precondition for something like one's existence, then it's not surprising, because it if weren't the case we wouldn't be here to be talking about it.

I didn't originate any of these ideas.   I'm not sure exactly who I read that used this statement about our ancestors, but it belongs to a tradition of similar kind of statements that are sometimes known as the 'Anthropic Principle'.

Think about how rare really fat folks used to be. They had them in freak shows, for pete's sake. 

I guess it was a lot easier in some cultures/locations, tropical ones like Samoa. Just reel in some fishing nets and scoop up some fruit.

It's still something of a status symbol to be fat in some countries. I didn't think hard about why till now. If you were Big, and virtually everyone was working for every bite of food, you were either rich enough to just buy all your meals or important enough to be given it instead."

Its the distance that light travels in 365 days).
Some alien planet has s year which has 400 days hence their ”lightyear” is 400 days.

Samsung evolved a lot visually since they released their custom AR avatar app, but since 2021 there hasn't been any noticeable visual upgrades, not to mention their face rig is pathetic when compared to iPhones on the release of live emojis.

That being said, I think it is important to have options, but in the end of the day we end up using regular emojis, GIFs or meme stills for non verbal communication."

None of us are protecting anything from a solar storm. I don't know if cloud storage servers are protected from such an event. 

When this will happen :
All the electronic consoles will fry (especially those rare irreplaceable items).
All games are going to fry, cartridge or discs, or even magnetic tapes.
All music, movies, games that were not stored securely on servers will be wiped from history. 
Am your memories stored on hdd will be wiped out. Personal documents, health and history, gone.

Since all cameras and smartphones will be fried, we wouldn't be able to record the aftermath of the event. 

Sure, humanity will go back to industrial era, but most of cultural content produced since the 80s (where magnetic bands were widely used), being public or personal, will just vanish from history.

What will remain are printed books, printed photos, and vinyl music discs.

[Recent comments](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/reddit-protest-blackout-ceo-steve-huffman-moderators-rcna89544) have brought to our attention the lack of unfettered democracy in this subreddit. As a result, we’d like to experiment with some new democratic features through the month of June.

We’ll be calling for votes on various aspects of the subreddit over the coming weeks, starting with the page’s [ideal operating hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/14b5i8h/poll_vote_for_rshowerthoughts_hours_of_operation/) and a few [cosmetic adjustments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/14b4z7q/poll_vote_on_fresh_new_colors_for_the/).

All votes or suggestions must adhere to Reddit’s terms of service.

Outside of these small democratic exercises, the subreddit will now return to its original purpose. Keep an eye on our rules: Although they may change throughout this exercise, they must still be followed.

To kick things off, please feel free to select from a handful of ***new and exciting user flair options!***

([How to set up user flair](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205242695-How-do-I-get-user-flair-). If you're using old reddit, temporarily uncheck ""use subreddit style"" in order to access the ""*Show my flair on this subreddit.""* box.)"

These results beg the question, though: Can the logo truly be called ""Garfield Orange"" if it's missing Garfield's iconic stripes? We must settle this democratically.

Please vote below on whether the Showerthoughts logo should appear [*with*](https://imgur.com/MXNTpXa) or [*without*](https://imgur.com/eoSCFqL) stripes. Voting will close today at [7:00 pm Pacific Time](https://everytimezone.com/convert/pacific_u_s_/7pm).

For eleven years, /r/Showerthoughts has been one of Reddit’s most-popular communities. That time hasn’t been without its difficulties, but for the most part, we’ve all gotten along (with each other and with administrators). Members of our team fondly remember Moderator Roadshows, visits to Reddit’s headquarters, Reddit Secret Santa, April Fools’ Day events, regional meetups, and many more uplifting moments. We’ve watched this platform grow by leaps and bounds, and although we haven’t been completely happy about every change that we’ve witnessed, we’ve always done our best to work with Reddit at finding ways to adapt, compromise, and move forward. 

This process has occasionally been preceded by some exceptionally public debate, however.

On June 12th, 2023, /r/Showerthoughts joined thousands of other subreddits in protesting the planned changes to Reddit’s API; changes which – despite being immediately evident to only a minority of Redditors – threatened to worsen the site for everyone. By June 16th, 2023, that demonstration had evolved to represent a wider (and growing) array of concerns, many of which arose in response to [Reddit’s statements to journalists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-blackout-moderators-steve-huffman/). Today (June 26th, 2023), we are hopeful that users and administrators alike can make a return to the productive dialogue that has served us in the past. 

We acknowledge that Reddit has placed itself in a situation that makes adjusting its current API roadmap impossible. 

However, we have the following requests:

- Commit to exploring ways by which third-party applications can make an affordable return.
- Commit to providing moderation tools and [accessibility options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/) (on Old Reddit, New Reddit, and mobile platforms) which match or exceed the functionality and utility of third-party applications.
- Commit to prioritizing a significant reduction in spam, misinformation, bigotry, and illegal content on Reddit.
- Guarantee that any future developments which may impact moderators, contributors, or stakeholders will be announced no less than one fiscal quarter before they are scheduled to go into effect.
- Work together with longstanding moderators to establish a reasonable roadmap and deadline for accomplishing all of the above.
- Affirm that efforts meant to keep Reddit accountable to its commitments and deadlines will hereafter not be met with insults, threats, removals, or hostility.
- Publicly affirm all of the above by way of updating Reddit’s User Agreement and Reddit’s Moderator Code of Conduct to include reasonable expectations and requirements for administrators’ behavior. 
- Implement and fill a senior-level role (with decision-making and policy-shaping power) of ""Moderator Advocate"" at Reddit, with a required qualification for the position being robust experience as a volunteer Reddit moderator.

Reddit is unique amongst social-media sites in that its lifeblood – its multitude of moderators and contributors – consists entirely of volunteers. We populate and curate the platform’s many communities, thereby providing a welcoming and engaging environment for all of its visitors. We receive little in the way of thanks for these efforts, but we frequently endure abuse, threats, attacks, and exposure to truly reprehensible media. Historically, we have trusted that Reddit’s administrators have the best interests of the platform and its users (be they moderators, contributors, participants, or lurkers) at heart; that while Reddit may be a for-profit company, it nonetheless recognizes and appreciates the value that Redditors provide. 

That trust has been all but entirely eroded… but we hope that together, we can begin to rebuild it.

In simplest terms, Reddit, we implore you: **Remember the human**. 

We look forward to your response by Thursday, June 29th, 2023.
