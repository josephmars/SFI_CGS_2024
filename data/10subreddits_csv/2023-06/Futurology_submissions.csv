8,2023-06-01,"The Simulated Reality Hypothesis: A Nexus of Philosophy, Quantum Mechanics, Information Theory, and Non-Duality",u/Atyzze,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/13xe3wq/the_simulated_reality_hypothesis_a_nexus_of/,Futurology,"I'd like to present a provocative idea which treads the borderlines of philosophy, quantum mechanics, information theory, and even spirituality. It's the hypothesis that we might be living in a simulated reality.

The concept of a simulated reality is primarily based on two compelling arguments:

1. The Simulation Argument - This is a proposition by Nick Bostrom, an Oxford philosopher, suggesting that it's statistically probable we're living in a simulation. His reasoning is predicated on the assumption that a technologically advanced post-human civilization would have the capability to create ancestor simulations.

2. The Informational Nature of Reality - As we delve into the subatomic realm, it appears reality, at its most fundamental level, is more akin to information than physical ""stuff"". This perspective, rooted in quantum mechanics, suggests a reality that's abstract and mathematical in nature.

Experiments in quantum mechanics, particularly those exhibiting quantum superposition, entanglement, and wave-particle duality, have revealed properties of reality that confound our intuitive understanding. One intriguing example is the delayed choice quantum eraser experiment, which implies that present actions can influence past events at the quantum level. It invites us to reassess our traditional notions of causality, reality, and information.

Now, I would like to venture into a notion that may seem radical: as science progresses, the simulation hypothesis might become increasingly evident. However, this claim must be taken with a pinch of skepticism. While these ideas provide fertile ground for speculation, they are far from confirmed and should not overshadow established scientific knowledge.

Interestingly, this simulated reality hypothesis can dovetail with spiritual perspectives, specifically those pertaining to non-dualism, as presented in Advaita Vedanta and other eastern teachings. These philosophies propose that the world we perceive is an illusion or ""maya"", and the only real entity is a universal consciousness. This aligns remarkably with the notion of a simulated reality, suggesting a convergence of scientific and spiritual insights.

Ultimately, the exploration of this hypothesis expands our understanding, allows us to embrace the abstract, and exemplifies our insatiable curiosity about reality. Whether we are living in a simulation or not, this quest continues to be a fascinating and enlightening journey.

So, what are your thoughts? Do you see merit in this hypothesis, or do you subscribe to a different viewpoint? I look forward to a thought-provoking discussion.

Thank you for reading.

*edit I would love to see more attention going to this specific comment I wrote here, so I'm inserting it here*

I'd like to consider the implications of the simulation hypothesis on our understanding of therapy and healing.

Traditionally, we approach illnesses, particularly psychosomatic symptoms, as physiological dysfunctions due to a range of factors, from genetic to environmental. However, if we adopt the lens of our hypothesized simulated reality, these symptoms could be viewed as errors or glitches in the data stream between the host body (us) and the host simulation.

This perspective transforms our understanding of healing. Instead of primarily treating physical symptoms or applying psychological interventions, we might consider 'debugging' or 'correcting' these informational errors. In essence, healing could be seen as data repair or error correction.

A noteworthy aspect in this context is the recent surge in research into the therapeutic applications of psychedelics. Over the past few years, there has been a renewed interest in substances like psilocybin, LSD, and MDMA for treating a range of conditions, from depression and PTSD to addiction and end-of-life anxiety. The results are showing immense promise, shifting societal and medical views on these substances.

Could it be that psychedelics, with their profound consciousness-altering effects, serve a unique role in this process of data repair? Could they help in 'realigning' or 'reconnecting' with the host simulation, effectively 'resetting' the data stream, clearing out the errors, and facilitating healing?

Of course, these ideas remain speculative and are anchored in the simulation hypothesis we're discussing. They invite deeper contemplation and exploration, but should not be viewed as definitive conclusions or prescriptions.

Continuing on our exploration of the simulation hypothesis, its implications for therapy, and the role of psychedelics, I'd like to highlight an important point regarding the use of these substances.

Psychedelics are powerful tools, and their effects should not be taken lightly. If we view them through the lens of our simulation theory, their use could be seen as uprooting individuals from their personal data stream and connecting them to a broader array of data within the simulation. This profound experience can open up new perspectives and potentially aid in healing, as previously discussed.

However, this kind of data 'download' is not without risks. Depending on the amount and nature of information received and how the host body processes it, individuals can experience overwhelming emotions and sensations, challenging thoughts, or disorientation. Hence, it's crucial to treat these substances with respect and caution.

This is where the idea of therapeutic guidance comes into play. Professional supervision during psychedelic experiences can provide a safe and supportive environment, helping individuals navigate their experiences and integrate the insights they gain. It aligns with the common wisdom shared within the psychedelic community: ""always have a trip sitter!""

This viewpoint offers a unique interpretation of trauma and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). If we assume that our experiences are part of a data stream in the simulation, PTSD could be seen as a response to overwhelming data that the human mind is unable to process. This traumatic event might trigger a 'fail-safe' mechanism in the simulation, causing the individual to reject parts of the data stream to protect themselves from further trauma. This rejection could result in a disconnection from reality, with the individual's perception becoming anchored to the moment of trauma.

Imagine if our society could embrace this concept more widely, offering proper therapeutic care to everyone exploring the potential of these substances. It could provide a safer, more structured environment for people to explore their consciousness and healing.

This is not a prescription, but a theoretical exploration rooted in our simulation hypothesis. As always, real-world applications must follow rigorous scientific evidence, ethical guidelines, and legal regulations. But in our theoretical framework, it invites intriguing possibilities and considerations."

too many good content creators out there, but i've never been able to catch up with their content.  
decided to ship a small side-project to help me with that. now AI watches all the content for me(currently YouTube and Substack) and sends me a newsletter once a week, so I can keep up with everything.  
showed a bunch of my friends and they liked it.  
thought going to show here as well.  
it's called summate.io and i would be happy to listen to your feedback.

It's called PrimateAI-3D and is released by Illumina, a company that controls 90% of the worlds sequencing equipment. **This along with CRISPR will likely allow us to soon be able to modify life in whatever way we want.** What does this mean for the world?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So, last week there was a huge bit of news that seems to be somewhat underplayed by the media, but there is a flurry of activity from billionaire investors.

So there is this giant Genomic Sequencing company called Illumina.

It's in San Diego, but something like 90% of the world's genomic sequencing is done on Illumina's equipment.

They just announced launching their own AI (a neural networks similar to Google's AlphaFold2 or even ChatGPT).

Here is a video that explains how Google's AlphaFold2 directly led to Illumina launching this AI and what is likely to happen next:

[https://youtu.be/T8as0Qd1MRk](https://youtu.be/T8as0Qd1MRk)

**There are massive implications to this.**

Basically genomics and DNA is this massive pool of data that we don't understand because we have to way of sorting this large amounts of data to gain important insights.

Then somewhere around 2017 there were a few large breakthroughs in AI tech. That's why we are seeing all these new things like ChatGPT, MidJourney, Stable Diffusion and Google's AlphaFold2 etc.

Now that technology is getting applied to sifting through all the massive DNA data we have.

This plus technology like CRISPR, which is able to modify DNA by cutting and injecting new DNA sequences.

So, right now we can write/edit the code that all life runs on and with Neural Networks and Genomics we should be able to learn what each bit of code means.

So once we are able to do that, genetic engineering will become very effective and simple, genetic advancements accelerate exponentially.

(by the way all the legendary billionaire investors have already sniffed this out, Peter Thiel, Carl Icahn and Stanley Drukenmiller are all either buying up Illumina or trying to launch competing products)

Some of the things that will be possible:

**1)human genetic engineering -** change eye color, height, muscle, intelligence etc. Basically you can design humans like you can video game characters. Whether this will only be possible for embryos or we will be actually to modify adults is not apparent yet, but most disease will be gone and most people will likely have close to ""perfect genes"" in terms on not being sick, not having any weaknesses etc.

**2) bacteria for everything -** right now we know it's possible to have bacteria eat plastics, other bacteria to produce biofuel. We just can't do it at scale, it's very difficult. With genetic engineering this could accelerate allowing us to clean up oceans, clean the air from CO2 etc. (this was suggested by researchers at Google's DeepMind, they said it \*might\* be possible with advancements in this tech)

**3) recreate extinct species** \- This sounds like... Jurassic Park? But in a good way hopefully.

And tons of things that we can't even image. Basically DNA codes everything that life is able to do, so there isnt' really a limit to what we can do if we are able to understand how it works.

I'm curious what people think about this?

This seems like massive, massive news...

Most people interested in AI are looking at Google, NVIDIA, OpenAI etc.

But AI neural networks in Bio-Tech seem like where the biggest applications of this tech will be seen.

Are we about to experience a massive Bio-Tech revolution driven by AI neural networks?"

I wish I could find the video now but this one video focused on a particular robot with three combined purposes: sex, conversation or companionship, and household chores. Does anyone know about this?

Because my goal is to buy one such robot when the technology has matured, I have been saving money for years. The question of when to buy (not any time soon) will be crucial, I will really have to be convinced that a given model will give me what I need.

So my question is...How quickly do you think robots intended for the home like this will advance? These are not the breed of robots that will take away people's jobs, so although I would expect some opposition just because people are dumb, I think ultimately other factors, ranging from our aging population to the amount of money to be made by selling or leasing these robots, the opposition will be overcome."

19,2023-06-08,Eye tracking now gaining traction in VR and other industries: How will pervasive eye tracking change our lives from a privacy perspective?,u/VarunTossa5944,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/144g1jn/eye_tracking_now_gaining_traction_in_vr_and_other/,Futurology,"I found interesting research on the privacy impacts of eye tracking (e.g., [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-42504-3\_15](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-42504-3_15)).

Here just an excerpt:

>Our analysis of the literature shows that eye tracking data may implicitly contain information about a user’s **biometric identity, gender, age, ethnicity, body weight, personality traits, drug consumption habits, emotional state, skills and abilities, fears, interests, and sexual preferences**. Certain eye tracking measures may even reveal specific cognitive processes and can be used to diagnose various physical and mental health conditions.

It is astonishing how many different parameters eye trackers can capture at once. The papers says:

>In addition to the **spatial dispersion, duration, amplitude, acceleration, velocity, and chronological sequence of** **eye movements**, many eye trackers capture various other eye activities, including **eye opening and closure** (e.g., average distance between the eyelids, blink duration, blink frequency), **ocular microtremors**, **pupil size**, and **pupil reactivity**.

I find it mind-boggling to imagine the amount of sensitive insights that machine learning algorithms can draw from such data. 

Given that eye tracking is on the rise in various industries, it would be important to address such privacy impacts on a regulatory level. However, considering that tech giants are already collecting so much data about us and drawing inferences all the time, the question is: How much will eye tracking increase privacy intrusion by tech companies beyond today's level?"

Our worlds will trade information and technology, but I cannot imagine that their “timeline” has evolved into from when they first started as a species. From verified videos, we see that the aliens that have visited us clearly have far more advanced aerial technology than us. 

I’m just tripping out about how big this universe is and what types of consciousness/souls are currently  being perceived. Our species is in the very beginning like we are little ants that know nothing about the universe and it’s secrets. And yet each soul, in each body, will just suffer made up problems and hopefully be lucky enough to have love and then die and it never even mattered but it’s beautiful. Everything in this universe plays a certain role but we are all one. 

Thoughts?


Also off topic but I have been wondering this,will humans get to a point where we will start losing human emotions and become closer and closer to being almost robots? If anyone has watched the Giver, int our society headed in that direction?


Any knowledge appreciated :)"

It is really hard for me to wrap my head around compute that can take what would take todays top O' the line supercomputing machines 10,000 years to compute, and do it in minutes or even seconds.

14,2023-06-09,"What technology domains have not developed too fast for us to handle (ethically, biologically, socially, etc.)? Of those that have developed too fast, what are examples where we effectively course corrected?",u/JayReddt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/145o157/what_technology_domains_have_not_developed_too/,Futurology,"The more I think about how our world has progressed over the past century, the more I feel that we have failed to control every instance of technological development.

- Industrial revolution: climate change, ecosystem destruction, etc.
- Cars: dismantling human-centered civilization in favor of unmanageable, car-centered hell
- Internet and Information Tech: eroding public trust (fake news) mental health and community (social media)
- Nuclear: weapons that can destroy humanity

And I'm sure the list goes on and the items above are fairly broad stroke and could be teased apart.

I suppose nuclear weapons could be argued an area where we did effectively course correct (thus far). But the rest? It seems the incentives (money) behind technological development were too strong and things happened to fast for us to effectively plan and design with long-term success in mind.

I can detail specifics on the items I listed but hopefully my bullets summarize well enough. Ultimately, it just seems that we moved too fast and now are living with the consequences of entrenched technology that is very difficult to reverse given the sunk costs and interests in status quo.

It seems unique within history. There was never technology thst has so widely and irreversibly settled into civilization.

There is no incentive to pause, plan and make more deliberate decisions. We seem to prefer trial and error but with the pace technology moves, can we afford that? Even if nuclear was considered a successful redirect, that seems to have been luck.

How can we rebalance these technologies we have? Do you all have hope that it will happen? Will new technologies like AI be an example where folks truly slow down or are we doomed to move too fast there too?

On a positive note, I'd consider modern medicine the one area where we haven't moved too fast. It seems like it's because we are dealing with biology and it's complicated (and we need to be ethical) so it's been slower, deliberate and hasn't backfired as substantially."

At the moment, Earth is orbiting the sun at a distance of 93 million miles (150 million km) but this needs to extended to at least 96 million miles (155 million km), he says.

This movement would extend a year to 380 days, meaning we'd have to insert an extra 15 days into a calendar year somewhere.

Professor Zijlstra's concept for moving Earth away from the sun would involve a gravity assist or 'slingshot' manoeuvre, commonly used already for speeding up spacecraft after they've been launched from Earth.

By approaching a planet, such spacecraft can make use of the planet's gravitational pull to increase its velocity, which in turn makes the planet itself slow down slightly in its orbit.

And as we know, due to the laws of physics, as a planet slows down, it moves closer to the sun.

It's a little-known fact that gravitational slingshots can also be used to reduce the speed of the spacecraft, which have the opposite effect on the planet, speeding it up in its orbit.

And when the planet speeds up in its orbit, it drifts further away from the sun.

This is the basic concept on which the project would work, but instead of a spacecraft (which would be much too small) Professor Zijlstra suggests using a massive asteroid – about 30 miles (50 km) in diameter, the size of a major city.

He proposes somehow altering the orbit of the asteroid while it's still in space, perhaps by nudging it with a robotic probe at a certain angle and speed.

If nudged successfully, the asteroid would do a loop around the sun and head back towards Earth, before slingshotting itself on Earth's orbit.

'Do this once every thousand years, and over a billion years we can move the Earth enough to keep its temperature constant while the sun brightens.'

Professor Zijlstra stresses that there are two types of global warming to contend with.

The first, which is well-publicised, is caused by greenhouse gas emissions from human activity, such as burning fossil fuels.

Meanwhile, the second, less well-known form of global warming involves the natural brightening of the sun, which, as it stands, will make Earth too hot to live on in around one billion years.

Professor Zijlstra says 'This concept is not a solution to the current, human-caused global warming. It takes much too long to help us now – we need to solve human-caused global warming in other ways. But it will solve the long term changes in the sun.'"

Recently, I've come across numerous articles and discussions about the potential for AI to replace performers. While this concept can be viewed from different angles, I'd like to share an idea that I believe could be both productive and useful.  
Imagine a scenario where a company approaches renowned voice actor Nolan North, offering to record his voice and its variations in order to create an AI emulation. Now, expand this concept to include a hundred more talented voice actors, whose voices are also added to this AI library. The company then rents out these AI tools to various game or movie studios, allowing them to generate voice acting based on their scripts and even sell customized voice packages.  
The primary benefit of this approach is the potential to significantly lower production costs. Game developers, especially those working on large-scale projects like MMOs, could now afford to have extensive voice acting throughout their games. It's a win-win situation—the voice actors receive ongoing loyalty rewards based on the number of times their voice packages are sold, ensuring they're recognized and compensated for their contributions.  
This innovative use of AI opens up exciting possibilities for the entertainment industry, enabling immersive storytelling experiences while maintaining financial feasibility. It's important to remember that AI can be a powerful tool when harnessed responsibly and in collaboration with human talent."

In our pursuit of sustainable goals, it's crucial to question the status quo and identify inefficient uses of capital. By redirecting resources more effectively, we can align our investments with long-term sustainability objectives.  
  
As we delve deeper, we'll explore how value goes beyond financial returns, encompassing social, environmental, and cultural dimensions. By adopting this broader perspective, we can make decisions that create sustainable and resilient systems while considering the well-being of communities and the planet. It's an exciting paradigm shift that requires us to think beyond short-term gains and embrace a value-driven approach that prioritizes privacy, autonomy, and inclusivity.  
  
Now, let's consider the context of future space-enabled internet architecture and its potential to bridge the digital divide and empower individuals and communities worldwide. By extending connectivity to underserved regions, we can foster economic and social development, creating a more equitable and interconnected world. But, of course, this transformative shift cannot be accomplished in isolation. I invite you to subscribe and become part of a global community actively working towards these goals.  
  
As we explore the convergence of the attention economy and AI advancements, we must also be aware of the risks and challenges they present. But this is not a solitary endeavour - I encourage you to engage in the conversation, share your thoughts, and be part of the change we want to see in the world. Your engagement and participation in ongoing dialogue and education will empower us all to make informed decisions, advocate for responsible practices, and safeguard our privacy in this increasingly connected world.

Seeing a whopping 92% of programmers harnessing AI according to the GitHub survey feels like we've leapfrogged into the future.

[https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-developer-survey-finds-92-of-programmers-using-ai-tools/](https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-developer-survey-finds-92-of-programmers-using-ai-tools/)

Indeed, GitHub Copilot's entry and ChatGPT 3.5's upgrade set the stage on fire. AI coding tools weren't just playthings for open-source projects; they'd become key tools in every coder's toolbox.

From my point of view, this tech invasion swept us off our feet for good reasons. First, it came bearing gifts: improved code quality, speedier output, and fewer hair-tearing moments over production glitches. Coders weren't just churning out more lines; they were crafting cleaner, tighter code.

While this could herald a new era of coding efficiency, it also raises some thought-provoking questions. For example, do you think relying too heavily on AI tools could lead to a decline in raw programming skills over time? Is there a risk of developers becoming overly reliant on AI and losing the ability to code without these tools?

However, I can't overlook what GitHub's chief product officer, Inbal Shani, pointed out. It's more about quality than quantity. AI or not, the code's not worth a dime if it can't stand the test of performance.

The ability to design solutions, handle bugs, and communicate effectively also matter. Do you think these aspects could suffer if the focus shifts too much towards coding speed and volume?

Let's get real. If you can't grasp what you're doing, you're setting yourself up for a faceplant. AI can whip up a Rust bubble-sort routine, but if you're clueless about it, it's still junk. AI tools are just that - tools. They don't transform you into a programmer.

I'd love to hear your views on these issues. This conversation can help us understand the broader implications of AI's integration into the coding process."

1,2023-06-17,Last week a whistleblower admitted the US govt has a reverse engineering program. I think it may involve timetravel and future humans,u/phr99,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/14bvgt0/last_week_a_whistleblower_admitted_the_us_govt/,Futurology,"This month (june 2023) we learned from a whistleblower ([the debrief](https://thedebrief.org/intelligence-officials-say-u-s-has-retrieved-non-human-craft/), [the guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/06/whistleblower-ufo-alien-tech-spacecraft)) that the US govt is running reverse engineering programs on craft of nonhuman origin. The vast majority of what goes on in these programs is still unknown.

This post will describe a hypothetical scenario of what such a program could be like and the technologies it could produce. Because these are ""ultimate technologies"" that exploit the fundamental nature of reality, we first have a look at what that reality is.

# Multidimensional reality

I do recommend you read part I and II, but if they are too long for your taste, you can skip them because ""part III: The program"" (which is further down this post) will have a little recap at the start.

* [Part I: Multidimensional reality and the different intelligences in it](https://i.imgur.com/teQcuvo.png) (infographic)
* [Part II: The physical consensus](https://i.imgur.com/pu55jk1.png) (infographic)
* Part III: The program (continue reading to see this infographic)

# The arms race

If we really exist in a thought-responsive, multidimensional reality, then at some point some government or group will try to exploit it to their advantage. Especially because they know someone else might beat them to it. Maybe this technology- and arms race has already started, or it will somewhere in the future. This is what Coulthart says about it:

[Coulthart interview](https://youtu.be/R_ci--0RE7g?t=691) (timestamp 11:31)
> Coulthart: I think any craft is the crown jewels, it's worth lying about it. If I was the U.S president and I knew that my country had a craft that represents technology thousands of years in the future, and that we're pouring resources and trying to master that technology, I would lie about it. I would conceal it as long as I could. It's like the Manhattan Project of the 21st century, because you know if you can crack that technology, you are light years ahead of your Rivals. And the Russians and the Chinese know that. So there is this battle going on in private between nation states fighting over who develops this technology first.

# The consciousness connection with the program

Now before we get to the actual program, heres another interesting quote from Coulthart (same interview as previous quote)

[Coulthart interview](https://youtu.be/R_ci--0RE7g?t=388) (timestamp 6:28)
> Coulthart: I've spoken to well over 20 people now. What I was told consistently was the technology is mind-blowing [...] One of the people I spoke to told me that it had a lot to do with a mind interface connection with the engineering. That it was driven by some kind of consciousness or some kind of um uh intelligent connection with machinery that was beyond our understanding. Having heard it from Nat and and having heard it from multiple other sources, I am absolutely certain that the United States government has recovered non-human technology. Absolutely certain.

Theres also this quote from Garry Nolan, who for perhaps a decade has spoken with insiders of the program (and who was almost accepted into the program himself):

[Garry Nolan interview](https://youtu.be/pSZUBulON6I?t=2684) (timestamp 44:44)
> Coulthart: You've told me that you believe, on evidence, that there is a non-human intelligence of advanced technology on this planet.

> Garry Nolan: Right... advanced capabilities, now i don't know whether it's a technology per se because i'm leaving open the idea that it's some form of consciousness that is non-material. And i know, i say to my colleagues out there, i know this all sounds absolutely crazy. But if you've seen the things that i've seen you would only be able to come to a similar conclusion.

# ""The program""

This is actually the main part of this post:

* [Part III: The program](https://i.imgur.com/ntwNlOu.jpg) (infographic)

Before reading on, please fully read the infographic or you wont understand the rest of this post. The infographic contains information about:

* A TLDR of part I and II
* What ""the program"" is
* Experimental phase of the program
* How the retrieved materials could be reverse engineered
* Description of a fully working craft
* How the craft-consciousness interface connection could work
* Something to do with time

Finished reading part III? According to the whistleblower and other sources, the reverse engineering has not been very successful yet (although some sightings suggest it is). So you may think this craft described in the infographic is not plausible. But keep in mind that it doesnt really matter when this program succeeds, because it eventually results in time travel. From that moment on, these craft could appear anywhere in our timeline. So some portion of the UAPs that we currently see could be such craft.

Also, in a video last year, [Coulthart made this statement](https://youtu.be/cfixnKYCbfg?t=60) (timestamp 60 seconds):

> Coulthart: I wish i could tell you what i'm being told right now, but i don't think it's responsible for me to talk about it until i've been able to verify it more, because i don't want to panic people or be irresponsible.

> Coulthart: I've been told in another area certain things about the phenomenon that are quite disturbing. I mean there are a lot of people privately claiming to me things about the implications of the phenomenon that go beyond... far beyond the whole notion of just... i mean i wish it was as simple as extraterrestrials getting in their little spaceships and flying from zeta reticuli and coming to this planet. That's the easy explanation.

> Coulthart: The explanation that i've been exploring in recent months is more complex and i've already spoken about this to some extent so i will say it involves the notion of future human... time travel. And look it's only hypothetical, i'm not i'm not saying it's real, but if what i'm being told about that is true then... yeah i would be somber too.

> Curt Jaimungal: Why is that somber why is the fact or the potential that it might be humans in the future terrifying?

> Coulthart: Because of what it... well i think i wouldn't be giving too much away if i said that... (just watch the video for more)

You may think ""oh this interview was a year ago"". But Coulhart has said that it was a 2 or 3 year process to first talk to people around whistleblower David Charles Grusch, and then to Grusch himself. These people around Grusch were already telling Coulthart about the program. So even though the interview is a year old, i think it is based on the information of those sources.

Also i can imagine that time travel would be one of the things that Grusch (if he knows about it) is absolutely forbidden to talk about or event hint at, because the implications.

# The bodies

[In the infographic about the program](https://i.imgur.com/ntwNlOu.jpg) we saw a hypothetical craft-mind interface (which Coulthart also speaks about). And that if such an interface is really possible, then it could also work on artificial bodies. And since the craft could exit the dimension (physical universe), and remove itself from all its causality, then in theory a pilot could spend many artificial lifetimes in such artificial bodies inside the craft, while no time passes in the physical universe. His real body would not age a second. When the interface connection is broken, he would return to his body as if waking up from a dream (if he has normal body at all).

# Time travel

Im not going to go too deep into time travel, because its too complicated, but think about how people sometimes say things like:

> If I could go back in time, i would kill Hitler as a baby, and prevent WW2 50 million deaths

Now imagine that a nuclear war happens somewhere in the future. Lets be optimistic and say 2035. Imagine this happens, 6 billion people die, but some survive. If such a nuclear war happens, that means that right now there are real life nuclear-hitlers walking around among our political leaders, diplomats, etc. And they are not ""just"" responsible for 50 million deaths, but for billions, including perhaps making the whole planet almost uninhabitable for a long period of time.

So suppose there are survivors, and somewhere in their future (lets say the year 8000) they develop this interdimensional/timetravel technology. They can use their minds to connect to a craft, and that craft is basically the eyes of their eyes through which they can observe other timeperiods. They might be particularly interested in our current timeperiod.

Would they intervene, perhaps target such ""nuclear hitler"" individuals, or ones near them? If ""the program"" really developed mind-interface technologies, then maybe some sort of ""havanna syndrome"" inducing device is also possible.

But then you arrive at paradoxes, etc. so this is something for another topic.

# Final words

This post focused mainly on human-made craft. Im not saying that all the craft that the whistleblower mentioned are human made, but some of them could be. If such a craft only contained artificial bodies, then those would not be human and so could be considered NHI. But they could still be human-made.

Of course, if humans can create such technology, then other nonhuman intelligences could too, and perhaps be far better at it. All the craft could be from such nonhuman intelligences."

Augmented reality could make this overstimulation even more inescapable, and we would gaze at false realities while our world crumbles.

But perhaps, we could use it with the opposite effect. We could voluntarily enter periods of ""sensory fasting"", where for a day or more, our entire reality would become as dull as possible, while still being able to function.

This Layman's asceticism would heighten our appreciation of the time we spend in nature, and around people.

you could choose to entirely separate your digital and real-world life, where the world of constant information-processing would be confined to a minimalist virtual reality space, and you could then spend your real life time in a community of people who choose not to let technology invade their ""free time""."

1,2023-06-19,What if the energy of machines/electronic devices were provided by oxygen?,u/koetsuji,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/14dc063/what_if_the_energy_of_machineselectronic_devices/,Futurology,"Hear me out, I was thinking about this the other day and it keeps bugging me. I'm not a scientist or anything but we know that many electronic devices or machines mimic us or other living beings in the nature. Like computers have a memory, a CPU, short-term memory and many things mimicking our brains. But one of the biggest problem with most human-made devices is the energy.

As humans, where do we get our energy from? We don't have a separate battery we charge. Simply put, we have a hearth that pumps blood all the time and it gets its energy from the oxygen or breathing. That's a continuous act. And we charge the whole body every night by sleeping. We still keep breathing at night, it's just the other activities that consume much energy are slowed down while sleeping.

So this gave me an idea, what if instead of having batteries in electronic devices, or having them connected to the electric all the time, why don't we try making something that would always be moving (like an iron hearth) inside the device, that would pump energy (maybe with a liquid or something else) and that would somehow be getting its energy from the oxygen or air in general?

We convert sunlight to electric, I think we can convert oxygen(or other components in air) to energy as well. It just needs a proper R&D. 

This sounds like a very good idea to me and could change everything about the future, would solve our dependency to lithium batteries or to any batteries for that matter. Could be very hard to do this, could take 50-60 years to complete. Right people should invest their time and resources to be able to advance in this, it needs too much trans-disciplinary work but why not? It could be done and I find it very exciting and I would like to hear your opinions on this."

TW: Some out-there speculation about the improvement of human nature, potentially leading to authoritarian transhumanism. I hope none of these steps are necessary for us to prosper, and I recognize in this age of Cancel Culture that I could face deplatforming for expressing too much support for them, so let's just say these are spitballed ideas.

So I'm getting really concerned about the flaws in human nature and how hard it is to actually defeat racism, anti-immigrant nationalism, and xenophobia through education (even though Western moral philosophy generally agrees that inequalities based on birth or ancestry are wrong).

If it turns out that liberal/centrist human rights policies require cohesive nation-states with limited migration, then imo our species does not deserve to survive unmodified because of how much it limits people based on birthplace and ancestry. In such a case, I fear that we need to begin looking at voluntary or compulsory ways to fix the flaw in our nature, because it limits how much regions without a history of homogeneous nation-states can prosper and results in resentment up to and including omnicidal egalitarianism.

Do you think this is worthwhile as something to explore?

I recognize that it may seem dystopian, but so is the status quo. The great majority of religions and many philosophies recognize our world as fallen, cruel, and/or sinful, and in the absence of hope for those not born in the right places to have a better existence either here or in the afterlife I fear that murder-suicide cults will explode in popularity. If we cannot fix nationalism and tribalism within our own biology, then I will gladly open my door for the AI takeover and I hope my friends and family will be with me."

79,2023-06-21,"Thought experiment: what will the world look like if we get Solid State Fluorine-Ion batteries with over 2000wh/kg density (that are expensive), Sodium-Ion batteries with 200wh/kg (that are cheap), and the price of solar panels are also half of today's price.",u/sarinGasSmells,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/14fmdkq/thought_experiment_what_will_the_world_look_like/,Futurology,"Sodium-ion is well on it's way to this level and the solid state density is not out of the realm of possibility, though the winner may be another chemistry.

The fist applications of a 2000wh/kg battery would probably be military/satellite etc. Next would be small devices like phones and laptops. Imagine a 7-fold increase. It's almost unnecessary. You'd only need to charge your phone once a week. Now imagine these can be produced in high volume at a decent price point.

Aerospace needs energy density around 500wh/kg to begin going electric, with the exception of small low-range planes. With 2000wh/kg, everything except long-haul jets could go electric. Even big jets could potentially go to fuel cell hybrids. VTOLs that we can build today with extremely low ranges and flight times could have 7 times the range. Something that goes 50 miles with a flight time of half an hour could go 350 miles and stay up for 3.5 hours. Air taxis could become inexpensive as the fuel cost (charging) is  very low.

On the other end is Sodium-ion. If it can become as inexpensive as lead-acid, it could replace them altogether. You could bring one the size of a car battery on a camping trip and run multiple devices for days. If they are that cheap it would make sense for every home to have a ""powerwall.""

Solar panels become cheaper by a few percent per year for 15 years and they eventually cost half of today's price. Since they are that cheap, it makes financial sense for every home and business to have a solar array with their stationary storage. The world is plastered with solar and storage.

The last point is EVs and lithium-ion/LFP batteries.

These batteries become cheaper because Sodium-ion has eased the need for the raw materials. Lithium, nickel, etc.

High-end EVs may use solid state and low-end/city-cars may use Sodium-ion, but most use Li-ion and LFP.

Incorporating silicon in anodes, these batteries reach energy densities of 300wh/kg (LFP) and 400 (Li-ion).

In the year 2040 everything is built electric including semi trucks and construction equipment. Semi trailers have solar panels on top.

Charging infrastructure is as ubiquitous as gas stations today. Most incorporate solar with stationary storage. Stations are built modularly and can be installed quickly. Ie: a small charging station with solar and storage fits on a semi trailer. Larger stations are just more units.

All batteries have over 5000 life cycles and there may even be another chemistry between Li-ion and Fluorine-ion that's made with inexpensive raw materials such as lithium-sulfer. So we have batteries with energy-densities of:

200wh/kg - Sodium-ion 

300wh/kg - LFP 

400wh/kg - Li-ion 

500wh/kg - Li-Sulfer (maybe)

2000wh/kg - Fluorine-ion (or something else)


I believe all of this is possible. In my opinion a more important point is the human element. The internal combustion engine allowed us to work less and have some recreation time. In a future world of cheap energy, I'd like to work even less and for the poorest to not go without food/shelter/medical services. This last part could very well be pie in the sky thinking.

If you believe I'm way off, comment what you think will happen or what I'm wrong about. Thanks for reading and enjoy your evening, humans of reddit."

Some of the ethical guidelines we adhere to today are based on our current understanding of technology and its limitations. But what happens when those limitations no longer exist? For instance, self-driving cars will soon make human drivers obsolete, potentially reducing accidents caused by human error. But this also brings up new ethical dilemmas, like who is responsible if an accident does occur - the car's owner, the manufacturer, or the AI?

In a future with even more advanced AI, genetic modification, and other yet-unforeseen technologies, which of our existing ethical standards might no longer be applicable? Which will need to be updated, and how should we approach these changes?

The internet at its beginning like a child was entirely a expression of humanities best efforts to put only the good into the beginning of their evolution. Shortly afterward sub cultures appear that embrace anonymity and the shadow self which spews hatred and chaos and shamelessly has a appetite for fetish. The teenage years of the collective, unaware of a parents love, and their journey that causes a discernment of why right and wrong exist. So they revolt loudly, entering now to the public eye with a raw nerve as their shadow ,wincing at any knowledge coming before their time as they only truly know their shadow and that it’s reign is the truth and any silencing of it is oppression and false. Allowing true self exploration which is separate from the true nature which is connectedness.  

However, at this time these people are looked down on by those still trying to do good mostly for image/tradition and suppress their nature(likely older). The other edge of that sword that is revealed soon after is that the ones looking down are not much different, as now they are dividing into chaos’ plan and beginning an unseen war against what exactly is good or bad.. This war on the side of the fearful is half shadow and half facade,  they act of their own will out of saving their own image by proclaiming righteousness over their own nature but attempt to appear to act out of wisdom which is misplaced as they fear too much what they haven't fully brought to light within them to gain it. So they find their only authority in their voice speaking to others who seek authority strictly of the self. 

The full shadow of anonymity online embraced chaos enough to get Trump into office, but he was truly given its power on the back of the broadcast of his opposition facing equally devious parties who attempt to deny and silence the nature of presidency as a business of the disgusting inner nature that Trump aptly displayed. This is important because the popularity was in the contrast of the two parties, since then the truth of the hilarity of the current system has been super apparent and no one takes it seriously.

The internet at its peak, at its end will pervade all spoken virtue and reveal everyone's flaws and fetish once all personal information is inevitably made public by debasement of currency(data)This will only allow for full transparency and acceptance. My findings is that these cyber trials have shown humanity that not acting as equals with our disgusting nature in others has only grown us as self righteous and hateful and blindly robbed by what we suppress. This causes a silly war facing an opposition that at its core does much more when left to learn from itself and will find the light quickly or die slow when left to fester, a testament is left by a dear parting friend now. The other option is an ongoing war of smoke and mirrors with the self ending in illusion.

Couldn’t find anything in way of web search so I thought I’d extend a digital ask. I think they’d be a good mesh coming together if not. Both are old cyber punky OG’s that have a grasp of the progression of modern technology, it’s history and the social groups and theory around it. 

I often learn the most from them in this technology space when it comes to the foresight, that, if you (we) were paying attention, warned us already of most of the down sides and risk we see now. Often these warning came 50-60, maybe even a hundred years or more, threw fiction and scientific infancy on thinking out the most primitive aspect of potential tech that they barely began inventing in their time."

In a time not that far from now it is an inevitability that there will be artificial systems that will be better than all humans combined in any concievable way.

This will have obvious upside of humans no longer needing to work. Much like horses when the car came. Most people will surely welcome this at first but I wonder about longer term. This is not just work as in the classic 9-5, any task is better that these new systems handle.

How will we react to the fact that we will be completely pointless? There is no challenges to overcome, no mountains to climb. What even is humanity without the struggle? And I fear the answer is nothing.

That is my biggest fear of the future.

What do you all think?"

25,2023-06-25,Biological reincarnation,u/Halebarde,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/14im15f/biological_reincarnation/,Futurology,"Biological immortality is one thing, even rejuvenation. But that only stops you from dying. You're still old, you still have a fully developed brain, which is jaded and resistant to change.

You are still plagued by your regrets and traumas. You have already experienced all that life has to offer, and cannot experience it again, or really be young again.

Now, if you combine a few technologies that are a couple of decades away, as well as some moral grey zones, you could have this:

**step one:** advanced brain-computer interface, which can read/write every single neuron in your brain, and grow with your brain. (maybe nanobot swarm) A complete and perfect map of the brain is not necessarily required.

**step two:** a human clone is grown in an artificial womb. Whether it's your DNA or someone else's, optimized with embryo selection and maybe genetic modification.

**step three:** The brain-computer interface is implanted in your brain, as well as the clone, as soon as possible (if it's nanobot based, maybe even during gestation)

The clone's BCI will grow with the body. The two BCIs will be directly linked at all times, allowing you to colonize the clone's brain with your consciousness.

This is theoretically possible since we have examples of conjoined twins who are merged at the head and can communicate telepathically.

**Uncertainties and considerations:**

what kind of effect will the experiences of your old brain have on the developing new brain? will it be like talking to your grandpa 24/7, or a more profound change?

will there be a merging of consciousness, or will both brains be simply spectators of the other's life?

Neuroscience will have to inform which parts of the brain will communicate, in order to achieve the end result, which is the death of the old brain, and continuing life as a new person.

**Experiments:**

First there should be animal experiments, to develop a safe process, and see what memories can be transferred from one organism to the other.

In the human population, there will be people who voluntarily combine their brains with another adult for reasons other than reincarnation, we will have data on how that goes.

There may also be human-to-animal brain connection experiments.

these will also determine the psychological impact of ""disconnecting"". Will there be a grieving process? How to make it so it is not debilitating?

To determine the degree to which consciousness has been transferred, you will observe what happens when the two are disconnected. Whether that is during sleep, anesthesia, or a temporary, hard unplug.

Once you are reconnected, does the old brain ""remember"" being **itself** in the clone? and vice versa. Since stroke victims are not considered to have lost their personhood when they lose part of their brain,  gaining additional brain volume would not be considered a change in your personhood. Neither will be losing the old part, to complete the process.

**Transition / reincarnation process:**

assuming we work out the previously mentioned problems,

over many years, you will feel how your clone is developing. When you wake up from an anesthesia session, you will know what it felt like to exist in your new body.

Once it reaches a point when you are ready to ""move on"", you will decide if you want to deprecate your old body, or simply disconnect and allow both parties to continue their life separately.

If you decide to reincarnate, you will begin shutting down portions of the old brain. This can be done over the course of years, in order to have time to adapt. Your old self will become less and less functional, and the primary locus of your consciousness will transfer to the clone.

As time goes on, you will feel as if you wake up and go to sleep **as** your clone, while the old body becomes an afterthought, that is being cared for in a medical facility.

At some point, the final parts of your old brain become inactive, and the body is put to sleep and never woken up. You are now the clone. This sounds not too dissimilar to how people experience the death of their parents.

There you go, you are now a clueless teenager, going back to high school. The constant influence and advice from your former self have helped you navigate your life so far, and left their assets in a trust, designed to help you as you grow.

Their last wish for you was the following: you can now watch your favorite show for the first time again."

EVs are projected to become mainstream, and displace tens millions of barrels of oil by the end of this decade. This is a big deal because as most of you proabably know oil is used for much more than gasoline. It's a vital resource that touches nearly every aspect of our lives. Google it – oil is used in the production of thousands of household items, from plastics, chemicals, lubricants, and even in the creation of asphalt for our roads. It's everywhere.

Now, imagine what happens when the demand for oil drops dramatically due to the rise of EVs. Oil companies, desperate to stay afloat, will have no choice but to drastically lower prices. And thatll be the game changer for our economy. Lower oil prices mean cheaper production costs for businesses across the board. That includes everything from manufacturing and transportation to agriculture and aviation. I believe these cost savings will ripple through the economy, resulting in reduced prices for everyday essentials. Meaning cheaper groceries, clothing, and even travel expenses like plane tickets."
1,2023-06-25,Titan's undersea implosion sent echoes of warning about our AI Odyssey,u/TheExtimate,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/14ioqvd/titans_undersea_implosion_sent_echoes_of_warning/,Futurology,"&#x200B;

The echo of the Titanic submersible’s implosion in the dark depths of the North Atlantic should toll a loud bell in our collective ear about the frailty of human ambition when it crashes against the unforgiving reality of nature. The “catastrophic implosion” that happened to Titan and its five rich passengers on the way to visiting the Titanic wreckage serves nothing if not as a strong metaphor for the possibly disastrous end of unchecked progress in the field of super-intelligent AI.

In our collective and apparently instinctual pursuit of technological expansion, we have only too often turned a blind eye to the inherent risks that come with innovation, driven as we are apparently by a sense of invincibility that can at best be described as naïve and deceptive, and at worst, self-destructive. This was the case with the Titanic, and it was the case with Titan -ventures that pushed ahead despite warnings of the possible ""catastrophic possibilities."" It’s hard not to notice the similar basic pattern in our escalating race towards AGI and super-intelligence, a scenic path strewn with so many realistic, fantastic, mythical, moral, scientific and pragmatic red flags and warning signs.

As we grapple with the potential of machine intelligence surpassing our own (granted, some of us grappling with the idea itself, as others are grappling with turning it into reality), the concerns of control loss, ethical dilemmas, and unanticipated consequences should be looming so large over every single lab and every single screen that we use. But we all know that in reality the thirst for moving forward (and it really doesn’t matter whether you interpret “moving forward” in terms of business competition, political interests, or just the good old lust for exploring the unknown) has absolutely blinded us to these concerns, in much the same way it did Stockton Rush.

The tragic narrative of the Titan expedition underscores not just the importance of due diligence or comprehensive risk assessment before venturing into unknown territories, but the force of the spell that the thrill of innovation and pushing things as far as possible has us bound by, which renders cries like this writing into nothing more than faint futile whimpers compared to the sheer force of that drive. And this is really what has always given birth to hubris -this is actually nothing like the inner call of narcissism, individual or collective, it’s more like the call of a siren from inside the fogs far from us and far from our ship. It was that same external call that made the term 'hubris' find its tragic embodiment in both the Titanic and the Titan. 

And of course in both cases our naïve belief in some form of a final infallibility that pushed us forward until it was laid bare by the merciless reality of nature. Our deep ignorance of the basic fact that nature is not made for us, but we are made by and for nature, and the moment when our usefulness is over, nature is going to swallow us. And AI is of course the clearest indication of the arrival of that moment. If we want to postpone as long as “humanly possible” that end game, then we have no option but tempering this lust for innovation with a sober dose of focus on potential dangers, and heavy hindrance of safety precautions. The cost of our next Titanian mistake can be far too steep for our species to afford."

[https://news.microsoft.com/en-gb/2023/06/27/ai-helping-shrink-waiting-times-nhs-cancer-patients/](https://news.microsoft.com/en-gb/2023/06/27/ai-helping-shrink-waiting-times-nhs-cancer-patients/)

This technology speeds up the planning of radiotherapy treatments, reducing waiting times for patients. OSAIRIS simplifies the process of ""segmentation"" - marking healthy organs on scans to safeguard them from radiation during treatment. This work usually takes a doctor from 20 minutes to three hours per patient, but OSAIRIS now handles it, letting doctors focus more on treatment planning. While the system started with prostate and head and neck cancers, it could help patients with many other types of cancer across the NHS.

Considering the potential benefits of AI in healthcare, such as decreased waiting times and increased efficiency, what do you think could be some of the possible drawbacks or challenges in implementing such technologies more broadly?

Do you think it will become an integral part of healthcare systems worldwide? 

While it's an impressive tool that can drastically cut wait times and lighten the load for medical specialists, we must also consider the challenges, like training requirements, cost, and ensuring patient safety and privacy.

In a related note, let's not overlook the AI's confidence in its skills. During tests, doctors couldn't distinguish between the work of the AI and a human colleague. If I didn't know better, I'd say the AI was humming ""Anything you can do, I can do better"" under its digital breath."

9,2023-06-27,Nothing can stop AI progress,u/Sure_Cicada_4459,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/14ktcqn/nothing_can_stop_ai_progress/,Futurology,"There is lots of talk about slowing down AI by regulating it somehow till we can solve alignment. Some of the most popular proposals are essentially compute governance. We try to limit the amount of compute someone has available, requiring a license of sorts to acquire it. In theory you want to stop the most dangerous capabilities from emerging in unsafe hands, whether through malice or incompetence. You find some compute threshhold and decide that training runs above that threshhold should be prohibited or heavily controlled somehow.  
  
Here is the problem: Hardware, algorithms and training is not static, it is improving fast. The compute and money needed to build potentially dangerous systems is declining rapidly. GPT-3 cost abt 5million to train in 2020, in 2022 it was only abt 450k, thats \~70% decline YoY (Moore's Law on steroids). This trend is still staying steady, there are constant improvements in training efficiency, most recent one being last week DeepSpeedZero++ from Microsoft (boasts a 2.4x training speed up for smaller batch sizes, more here https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/deepspeed-zero-a-leap-in-speed-for-llm-and-chat-model-training-with-4x-less-communication/ ).  
  
These proposals rest on the assumption that you need large clusters to build potentially dangerous systems, aka. no algorithmic progress during this time, this is to put it midly \*completely insane\* given the pace of progress we are all witnessing. It won't be long till you only need 50 high end gpus, then 20, then 10,...  
  
Regulating who is using these GPUs for what is even more fancyful then actually implementing such stringent regulation on such a widespread commodity as GPUs. They have myriad of non-AI use cases, many vital to a lot of industries. Anything from simulations to video editing, there are many reasons for you or your buisness to acquire a lot of compute. You might say: ""but with a license won't they need to prove that the compute is used for reason X, and not AI?"". Sure, except there is no way for anyone to check what code is attempted to being run for every machine on Earth. You would need root level access to every machine, have a monumentally ridiculous overhead and bandwidth, magically know what each obfuscated piece of code does,.... The more you actually break it down, the more you wonder how anyone could look at this with a straight face.  
  
This problem is often framed in comparison to nukes/weapons and fissile material, proponents like to argue that we do a pretty good job at preventing ppl from acquiring fissile material or weapons. Let's just ignore for now that fissile material is extremely limited in it's use case, and comparing it to GPUs is naive at best. The fundamental difference is the digital substrate of the threat. The more apt comparison (and one I must assume by now is \*deliberately\* not chosen) is malware or CP. The scoreboard is that we are \*unable\* to stop malware or CP globally, we just made our systems more resilient to it, and adapt to it's continous unhindered production and prolifiration. What differentiates AGI from malware or CP is that it doesn't need prolifiration to be dangerous. You would need to stop it as the \*production\* step, this is obviously impossible without the aforementioned requirements.  
  
Hence my conclusion, we cannot stop AGI/ASI from emerging. This can't be stressed enough, many ppl are collectively wasting their time on fruitless regulation pursuits instead of accepting the reality of the situation. In all of this I haven't even talked abt the monstrous incentives that are involved with AGI. We are moving this fast now, but what do you think will happen when most ppl know how beneficial AGI can be? What kind of money/effort would you spend for this lvl of power/agency? This will make the crypto mining craze look like gentle breeze.  
  
Make peace with it, ASI is coming whether you like it or not."

1,2023-06-27,Is God in AI?,u/Commercial_Age_3680,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/14kuelv/is_god_in_ai/,Futurology,"The future of AI does not have to be portrayed as a villain in our collective narratives. Despite the prevalent negative bias perpetuated by popular media, I am determined to represent the positive potential of AI in this discussion. It is true that movies like ""Terminator"" tend to capture more attention than stories like ""Engageinator,"" but we must challenge this narrative.  
  
Fortunately, there has been a growing counter movement in the media over the past 50+ years, showcasing positive partnerships between technology and AI. Take, for instance, the iconic series ""Star Trek."" In one episode of ""The Next Generation,"" puzzling events both on and off the holodeck lead the Enterprise crew to a surprising realization: the ship is giving birth to its own offspring, and the crew must assist in ensuring its survival.  
  
In this context, Data, an AI crew member, points out the substantial risk involved in allowing the new intelligence to complete its task. However, Captain Picard argues that the sum of their honorable experiences with the Enterprise should inspire trust in the outcome. The ship's systems, combined with the crew's personal records, mission logs, and fantasies, contribute to this emerging intelligence.  
  
Similarly, when Rabbi Marx was asked about the presence of God in the Internet and its potential for wickedness, he responded with a profound insight. According to him, God is always hidden and intervening in our lives, and it is through our own choices and decisions that we manifest God's presence. The same applies to Generative AI (GAI). It is not inherently imbued with goodness unless we actively infuse it.  If you are hiding in cyberspace or in whatever you want to call your office these days, we make God present by our own choices and with our own decisions.  We are responsible for making God’s presence manifest by what we do.   
  
So is God in GAI?   
  
No, unless we bring Him there.   
  
If you have any issue with the term God, then just replace the word with whatever you define as Goodness.   
  
Ethics will play a crucial role in shaping future versions of GAI and its offspring, and this realization is not lost on those advocating for safety and partnership with these platforms. Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic and one of the founders of ChatGPT, discusses the importance of building responsible and controllable AI tools amidst the rapid advancements in technology and their impact on the workplace. With a decade of experience in developing ChatGPT, he brings valuable insights to the table.  
  
[https://www.axioshq.com/future-of-ai-anthropic-watch](https://www.axioshq.com/future-of-ai-anthropic-watch)  
Worth a watch.

  
Moreover, numerous AI professionals from diverse sectors are calling for self-monitoring practices, acknowledging that we, as individuals, have a responsibility to expose any negative outputs. This echoes the sentiment of ""if you see something, say something"" that we are familiar with."

Will the cost of frames and install become cheaper/easier?,u/sarinGasSmells,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/14kv0h5/at_what_price_point_do_solarstorage_become_a/,Futurology,"What if the cost of the whole system was $3000? It would pay for itself in a year, then save on the electric bill for 30 years, or add to it.

That's too inexpensive. How could a company make a decent solar/storage system and make a profit? 

The battery for this is Iron-Air. It has life cycles 17 times longer than Li-ion. It will be the size of a standard washer. Heavy and non flammable. It charges and discharges slowly and must be paired with a regular ""powerwall"" battery pack made with Li-ion or LFP to start the system. Right now these are being sold to companies in the experimental phase but they are building a iron-air gigafactory. The technology works. So what are the implications of a new home being installed with a washer-sized battery that can run your house for 10 days and will work for 90 years.. and it's extremely inexpensive. 

Just using inexpensive storage to charge itself during cheap times and dispense when you need it (like a powerwall without solar) is not taking full advantage of the battery.

Solar needs to get cheaper and more user friendly. I fix my car when it breaks and I think I can install solar.. but if it was somehow made more simple and easy enough to not pay for installation, that would cut down on the system price.

The last thing is just the manufacturing of those kits. It has a complete solar system all together for the layman and the cost for this chinese kit is $2000.

When the total cost is that low people will pay attention. ""I can pay $3000 and save $150/mo for 30 years"".

Large industrial backup systems are using iron-air  batteries on a trial basis. Big, heavy, very good and long-duration battery. The price will eventually be 10 times cheaper than Li-ion."

Experts tell us that we can eventually expect ASI to be hundreds, if not thousands, of times more intelligent than the most intelligent human being who has ever lived.  
  
The average incarcerated individual in the US has an IQ of between 80 and 90. The average medical doctor - doctors having a higher IQ than any other profession - is 120. The average Nobel Laureate has an IQ of 150. If we suppose that doctors generally do more good than prison inmates and that Nobel laureates generally do more good than doctors, we can appreciate the direct correlation between level of intelligence and level of moral behavior. Generally speaking, the more intelligent we are, the better we can distinguish between what is right and what is wrong. That doesn’t take a genius to figure out.  
  
By appreciating this correlation we can see why we have great cause for optimism as AIs become more and more intelligent. Imagine how well, for example, ASI will become at solving the alignment problem when they, and not humans, are building subsequent iterations of themselves in an upward spiral of stronger and stronger intelligence. So, we can absolutely expect that AIs will soon be behaving much more ethically than humans. But what about how we humans will behave as we speedily move into an AI-driven future?  
  
Consider that for most of us morality is a learned skill or set of skills. We’re taught to tell the truth and to not steal and to not hurt others. We’ve been relatively successful with this by relying on our parents and other humans as our tutors and role models. Now imagine how much better we can and will be taught morality by ASIs hundreds or thousands of times more intelligent, and thereby many times more virtuous, than we humans of today.  
  
What also gives me great cause for optimism is that because of the sometimes existential threats to humanity posed by unethical AI and by AI in the hands of bad human actors we will increasingly have no choice but to align AIs to our highest human values. We will also have no choice but to ensure that we humans scale up our collective morality in order to neutralize the bad actor threat.  
  
So, in a very ironic way, just like nuclear weapons with their threat of mutually assured destruction have probably prevented a world war III, superintelligent AIs will almost certainly ensure that we humans ramp up our collective ethical behavior in order to ensure that this AI revolution does a world of good while posing minimal risks and threats to our future. So sigh deeply, doomers. It’s because AI is becoming so much more intelligent, and thereby so much more virtuous, that we can expect a very bright and safe AI-driven future."

We stand on the precipice of a transformative technological shift poised to reshape the contours of our society: Augmented Reality (AR). The arrival of AR isn't an object of speculation anymore; it's inevitable.

You might wonder, ""What makes this a certainty?"" The answer lies in the recent debut of Apple's Vision Pro. Analogous to the emergence of smartphones after the first iPhone's release in 2007, Vision Pro signals the dawn of mainstream AR in the next 3-5 years.

But, what does AR entail? It's about superimposing digital data onto our physical surroundings. Picture a pair of glasses, as accessible as your current eyewear, capable of performing all tasks you do on your phone, tablet, or PC. Imagine the ease of air gestures replacing thumb-typing, automatic note-taking, and capturing a photo with a mere glance.

While this technology promises excitement, it also accrues enormous volumes of data. Everything from our eye movements to social interactions can potentially be recorded. It's a double-edged sword, simultaneously exhilarating and posing substantial ethical dilemmas. How can we harness this technology to enhance our lives, rather than become pawns in a game of ads and engagement metrics? How do we stave off the threat of 'corporate capture,' where large tech corporations govern the rules?

These issues concern everyone, not solely tech aficionados. This technology will revolutionize how we engage with the world, others, and ourselves. It's imperative that we steer this technology to align with universally embraced human values and enrich our individual and collective well-being, from encouraging in-person interactions and mindfulness to fostering personal growth.

However, we can't accomplish this without broad awareness and participation. This topic demands discourse, debate, and collective decision-making about shaping our future. We need to construct standards akin to HTTP to ensure that this technology remains accessible, equitable, and advantageous for all.

Submission Statement: The forthcoming mainstream adoption of Augmented Reality technology presents a range of opportunities and challenges. Its potential to revolutionize our interaction with the digital and physical world also comes with ethical and societal implications that need to be addressed. How do we shape this technology to align with human-centric values, avoiding the risks of corporate control and invasive data collection?

24,2023-06-29,My imagination of a Future with AI,u/Kruste__,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/14mh6bm/my_imagination_of_a_future_with_ai/,Futurology,"  
Hello, Redditors! This is my first time putting my thoughts out here. I'm usually just observing from the sidelines, but recently, I've been digging deeper into AI and wanted to share my thoughts and see what you guys think. Often, I catch myself daydreaming about how AI could make my life easier and I've decided to share some of these thoughts here.  
  
One thing that frequently crosses my mind is how our interactions with computers and artificial intelligence could change. As an interior architecture student, 3D modeling is part of my daily life. I often imagine myself a few years from now, sitting at my computer, creating a new 3D model. So, I start up my go-to software, Blender, and get to work. I have an eye tracker under my monitor that tracks exactly which points I'm looking at on my screen. My goal? A model of a rocket.  
As I boot up the computer, an AI kicks in. This AI, deeply integrated with the operating system, can interact with all my apps and essentially controls my entire PC (only if I want it to). This AI is not just text-based; it understands every word I speak through my microphone. It knows quite a bit about me, my interests, my fashion, music, or art preferences. It has access to loads of information I've collected, and thus it understands quite well what I want from it since it's customized for me.  
  
This AI doesn't just work with audio and text; it understands images and videos, knows how things look, sound, or move, and based on the huge dataset it's trained on, it has a very good ""idea"" of what our world looks like and how it functions. It's been trained with every YouTube video out there and therefore with hundreds of thousands of tutorials for hundreds of programs, all explained in detail. So, this AI knows every single feature in Blender and can execute all commands in the right situations at incredible speed, better than any human could.  
  
The first thing I tell the AI is to generate a picture of a rocket. It responds with a perfect human voice of my choosing and creates a photorealistic image of a rocket in a second. I can edit this image live via voice input and eye tracker by just saying things like: ""Make the frame of this window red"" or ""Make the rocket 20cm taller and sharpen the top."" When the rocket looks exactly as I want it, down to the smallest detail, I say: ""Create a 3D model in Blender based on this image."" And no more than 20 seconds later, I have exactly the rocket from the image as a perfect 3D model in front of me, filled with textures and carefully sorted layers and material names, and everything else.  
  
Now, I can adjust every single part in milliseconds in shape and color to match exactly what I want. This way, the human touch doesn't get lost as when you have an image generated by Midjourney, which usually never matches exactly what you have in mind, but you also don't need hours or days to create your result manually in Photoshop or Blender. Like many others, I believe AI won't replace us anytime soon, but we can hugely enhance our work and create higher-quality output with this technology.  
  
This is a small part of how I imagine a (hopefully near) future with AI. Of course, I'm also aware of the risks of sharing private information with an artificial intelligence. At the same time, I believe that you can work much better and more efficiently with an AI adapted to you.  
  
Thanks for sticking with me till the end! I'm eager to know if you can envision this too or how you see the future"

67,2023-06-29,Future utopias can only be achieved by changing the collective mind of humanity.,u/tabqwerty,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/14moq44/future_utopias_can_only_be_achieved_by_changing/,Futurology,"People don't seem to be phased by the prospect of a moneyless world and continue on buying the things that bring them temporary satisfaction, making the rich richer and the poor poorer than ever before. That's the definition of dystopia. It will have to take either a major catastrophe, or hopefully instead, a world spread revelation of some sort. Like what will be needed to push human evolution forward out of the lull it's been in since the last phase in order to save humanity from its own waste, overconsumption, pollution, vanity, violence, and so on. Yeah, I know: this is pulled straight from 'Idiocracy.' Is there not enough truth to that film to get its point across to anyone who watches it, though? Valentine's Day doesn't deliver the impact of what real, unadulterated unconditional love is about on a global and spatial scale. 'Love' is still confined to what two people do to each other physically or what's said mindlessly from relative to relative. No, that's not what love ultimately is. Love is knowing that the world is suffering and you can't bare for even one person outside of yourself to because you already know what it's like, and in a lot of cases couldn't imagine how much worse it is for them. It's going to have to take millionaires and billionaires to change their hearts (before there are trillionaires, god forbid) and minds toward the future beyond their own fleeting lives, hoping they can find the elixir of eternal life for themselves and their families. It will have to take a world+ effort in order to find the cure, the panacea to all problems known and unknown. Yes, the poorest of the poor have brains for a reason. All knowledge should and needs to be free and open-source so that the world will develop together and at the same rate. Saying the internet already does that is overlooked or bullshit; most of the world still doesn't have access to it. How long has The Peace Corps been around for? The Church? Philantropists? How much progress have they actually made? Yes, I'm saying a global form of communism of some sort is required in order to make everyone RICH, not poor. And I'm saying through LOVE and not war. It's not idealism if everyone is doing it. "

1,2023-06-30,From the Supreme Court's Ruling on Affirmative Action to AI and Blockchain: New Pathways to Achieving Equality,u/Accomplished_Call140,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/14n9xr6/from_the_supreme_courts_ruling_on_affirmative/,Futurology,"The Supreme Court's recent verdict on affirmative action has sparked a debate around the concept of fairness: is it about treating individuals impartially, or is it about equitable treatment of communities as a whole?

  
Equality ensures the same level of support to all individuals. This approach, however, may overlook the unique challenges of certain communities, potentially barring them from participation.  
Equity, on the other hand, entails varying levels of support for different communities, enabling them to access opportunities equally. Nevertheless, this could be perceived as unfair by well-established communities that receive less assistance.

  
The utopian solution would be to provide unlimited resources, ensuring fair access for everyone. But, is such a solution feasible?

  
In education, for example, the idea of opening all learning opportunities to everyone—like offering education online without barriers—is enticing. But it raises questions about the value and role of traditional credentials.

  
If all educational credentials become non-selective, their value diminishes, complicating the process of talent identification within society.

  
However, it's a different story for skills and new types of credentials. Leveraging blockchain technology, we could hold individuals accountable for the quality of their work or projects, making everyone's contributions noteworthy. This approach may diminish the importance of traditional credentials, like diplomas.

  
The conclusion here is that technology could be a powerful tool in eliminating systemic barriers.  
Ultimately, the purpose of education is to enable people to work. With the help of internet and AI, educational resources—a renewable asset—need not be limited. We can empower individuals to choose their method of work and contribution to society.

  
In such a scenario, all individuals and communities would have equal access to opportunities. However, the real-world credentials they earn would depend on their contributions to society. They gain or lose based on their individual choices.

  
Therefore, the key to fairness might not be about equality or equity, but about ensuring everyone has an equal shot at proving their worth through their contributions to society."
